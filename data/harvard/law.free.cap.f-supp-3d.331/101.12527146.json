Kevin Castel, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Plaintiffs are participants in a defined-contribution retirement savings plan that was available to employees of SunEdison, Inc. (\"SunEdison\" or the \"Company\"). Before SunEdison filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2016, it briefly described itself as the world's largest renewable energy development company. Plaintiffs allege that over the course of 2015 and 2016, the Company launched an aggressive expansion strategy, which left SunEdison with dwindling liquidity and onerous borrowing terms. Plaintiffs allege that management's decisions caused a collapse in SunEdison's share price and drove the Company into bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   SunEdison made available to its employees a retirement savings plan (the \"Plan\") governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    etseq.\n   </em>\n   Within the Plan, one investment option was an employee stock ownership plan (\"ESOP\") that invested in the publicly traded shares of SunEdison itself (the \"SunEdison Stock Fund\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that defendants continued to offer SunEdison shares as an investment option despite knowing that the Company was in extreme financial peril. Plaintiffs allege that defendants knew or should have known that SunEdison was teetering on collapse, and that they should have frozen the SunEdison Stock Fund's purchase of additional shares and/or sold its existing holdings. They allege that defendants breached their duties under ERISA to act as prudent fiduciaries, monitor the Plan's investments and loyally represent the best interests of the Plan and its beneficiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint (the \"Complaint\") pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Fed.

(Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 13-16.) They allege that defendants breached their obligations to act as prudent fiduciaries under ERISA by continuing to make shares of SunEdison stock an investment option under the Plan between the dates of July 20, 2015 and April 21, 2016 (the \"Relevant Period\"), when a reasonable fiduciary would not have done so in light of the Company's rapidly deteriorating finances and poor long-term prospects. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   All defendants sat on either the Company's board of directors or its Investment Committee. As plan administrator, the Investment Committee was responsible for the Plan's day-to-day management, and was comprised of SunEdison officers and employees appointed by the Company's board of directors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 26, 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the board of directors had a duty to appoint prudent individuals to serve on the Investment Committee and to monitor its performance, and that the directors failed to take appropriate actions when they knew or should have known that the Company's future was imperiled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7.) The Complaint alleges that all defendants were fiduciaries of the SunEdison Stock Fund under ERISA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (21)(A)(i). (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 242-43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Plan is a defined-contribution retirement savings plan that covers eligible employees of SunEdison and its subsidiaries. (Compl't \u00b6 39.) Participants had a choice to contribute between 1% and 50% of their pre-tax salary to the Plan. (Compl't \u00b6 44.) During the Relevant Period, the Plan offered a number of investment options to employees, including the SunEdison Stock Fund, whose holdings typically consisted of 97% SunEdison stock and 3% cash. (Compl't \u00b6 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Complaint describes \"the rise and fall of SunEdison,\" which once touted itself as \"the world's largest renewable energy development company,\" before it launched an ambitious expansion strategy that left it with unsustainable debt and diminishing liquidity. (Compl't \u00b6 57.) Plaintiffs allege that SunEdison lacked adequate internal controls to track its cash flows and made numerous public misrepresentations about the Company's financial wellbeing. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 58-63.) They describe how SunEdison's acquisition spree and its decision to spin off two subsidiaries as public companies contributed to a growing liquidity crisis that management failed to disclose, culminating in the Company's dependence on certain high-interest, undisclosed loans. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 64-179.) Plaintiffs allege that SunEdison CEO Ahmad Chatila and CFO Brian Wuebbels had the incentive to pursue risky, high-growth strategies because the Company's executive-compensation package adopted a formula based on projected future earnings, and not actual earnings. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 104-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   According to plaintiffs, because of SunEdison's mounting problems, its shares of common stock should not have been available as an investment choice under the Plan. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 180-207.) Plaintiffs allege that SunEdison's risks were \"widely reported,\" and that based on these public reports, defendants knew or should have known that those risks threatened the investments of the SunEdison Stock Fund. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 180-81.) When the Company's public statements gradually revealed the extent of its liquidity shortfalls and unfavorable loan terms, the price of SunEdison common stock dropped accordingly. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 183-207.) Plaintiffs allege that, as these disclosures came to light, defendants failed to conduct themselves as prudent ERISA fiduciaries and to undertake an investigation of whether SunEdison remained a prudent investment. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 183-207.) In April 2016, the New York Stock Exchange de-listed SunEdison and suspended trading of its common stock, and the Company filed for bankruptcy protection. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 206-07.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that, as Company insiders, the defendants had access to nonpublic information about the risks confronting SunEdison. (Compl't \u00b6 218.) They allege that if defendants had divested the Plan of SunEdison shares based on non-public\n   information, they could have saved the Plan millions of dollars. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 219-20.) The Complaint alleges that defendants could not reasonably have concluded that accumulating more SunEdison shares would be beneficial to participants, and that the exercise of prudence should have prompted defendants to freeze further share purchases and sell existing holdings. (Compl't \u00b6 222, 224, 231-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Complaint alleges that defendants breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201109\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), by failing to discharge their duties solely in the interest of the Plan's participants. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 245-46.) Count One alleges that the Investment Committee defendants failed to prudently manage the Plan's assets and thus breached fiduciary duties under ERISA. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 255-66.) Count Two alleges that all defendants breached a duty of loyalty to the Plan's participants and beneficiaries. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 267-79.) Count Three alleges that all defendants failed to adequately monitor the performance of the Plan's holdings, and that the board of directors separately failed to monitor the performance of the Investment Committee that administered the Plan.

The Complaint purports to identify special circumstances in the public information known about the Company, pointing to negative press coverage and the assertion that \"global markets turned decisively against SunEdison and its growth strategy\" by mid-2015. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 212-17.) It lists eight items of public information that it calls \"special circumstances\" going toward \"the financial stability of the Company....\" (Compl't \u00b6 212.) They include negative press coverage of SunEdison's public offerings for its two subsidiary YieldCo companies, corresponding drops in SunEdison share price, a 70% drop in the share price of a SunEdison competitor, the reclassification of Company debt, drastic changes to the composition of management at a SunEdison subsidiary and a March 2016\n   <em>\n    Wall Street Journal\n   </em>\n   article reporting on an SEC investigation of the Company.

These drops in share price correlated to negative news, which is consistent with the market's integration of risk into share value. Separately, a steep drop in the share price of an unaffiliated competitor does not plausibly allege that a fiduciary was imprudent in continuing to make shares of SunEdison available under the Plan. Instead of supporting the plausibility of plaintiffs' claims, the relationship between negative public announcements and declining share price make it less plausible that SunEdison shares were riskier than the market's assessment.

According to the Complaint, defendants \"could not reasonably have concluded\" that stopping additional purchases of SunEdison shares \"would do more harm than good\" by potentially causing a drop in share price, since they had \"already observed a significant drop\" in the Company's share price. (Compl't \u00b6\u00b6 222, 235-38.)

The Complaint also contrasts the performance of SunEdison shares with other investment options available to Plan participants, and alleges that for every $100 invested in the SunEdison Stock Fund at the start of the Relevant Period, a participant would have lost all but $1.47, whereas the alternative investments available under the Plan would have left a participant with an average figure of $97.83.
