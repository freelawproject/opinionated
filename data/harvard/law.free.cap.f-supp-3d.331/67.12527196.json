Specifically, he claims that, having been released on bond by an immigration judge (\"IJ\"), the respondents violated the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, the Fourth Amendment's proscription against unreasonable seizures, the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), and the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") by revoking his bond and conducting subsequent custody proceedings on the grounds that he was driving without a license. Am. Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 29, 51, 56-59, 61-62, 78. Further, the petitioner claims that in the process of determining whether he should be released on bond and his subsequent appeal, the IJ and Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") committed legal error by relying on erroneous interpretations of the INA and unambiguous mischaracterizations of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the petition is\n   <strong>\n    granted.\n   </strong>\n   The respondents are ordered to provide the petitioner with a new hearing before the BIA within thirty (30) days of this Opinion or release the petitioner from custody on his original bond, which had already been set by the first IJ to consider his release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The petitioner is a Guatemalan asylum applicant who entered the United States in September 2007, when he was ten years old.

Further, although the flight risk issue had already been litigated before IJ Thompson, because the petitioner's recent claims to avoid removal had been rejected, the immigration court found that the petitioner had \"failed [to] present sufficient evidence to show that he would not be a flight risk.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The petitioner appealed the immigration court's decision to the BIA.

Unlike IJ Horn, the BIA expressed no opinion as to whether driving without a license was a violation of the petitioner's bond. The BIA agreed with IJ Hom that driving without a license demonstrated a \"disregard for the laws of this country.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.

The BIA's decision does not address the issue and it is therefore unclear whether the Board relied on the IJ's misstatement of fact in adjudicating whether the petitioner poses a danger to the community. It is clear that the BIA did not correct the error and indeed appeared to follow it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Yeferson Randolfo-Zapaleta, A088 663 984, at 3 (BIA Sept. 7, 2018) (noting that the petitioner's arrest for driving without a license \"occurred only 11 weeks after being granted bond by the Immigration Judge\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The BIA also committed a legal error in describing the legal support for the determination that the petitioner is a flight risk. As described above, the BIA found that the petitioner's prospects of succeeding in his claims against removal have diminished. The petitioner has an ongoing appeal before this Court regarding a previous denial of SIJ status. The BIA found that the petitioner's SIJ status appeal is futile because he \"has now aged out of SIJ status, as he is over the age of 21.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Yeferson Randolfo-Zapaleta, A088 663 984, at 3 n.5 (BIA Sept. 7, 2018). As the government concedes,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the BIA's conclusion with respect to SIJ status is an unambiguous misstatement of the law. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (\"TVPRA\") \u00a7 235(d)(6) explicitly freezes the age of an SIJ status applicant as of the date of the applicant's filing of an SIJ status petition.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(6). Under the TVPRA, as a matter of law, the petitioner cannot \"age out\" of SIJ status eligibility, because he had filed his application at a time when he was eligible for SIJ status. Therefore, a component of the BIA's determination of flight risk was plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   There was legal error in the components of the BIA's determination that the petitioner was a danger to the community and a risk of flight. The Court cannot determine whether, absent those errors, the BIA would have reached the same conclusion. Therefore, the appropriate remedy is to vacate the decision of the BIA and to remand the petitioner's bond revocation proceeding to the BIA for a determination of the petitioner's bond revocation appeal and any other relief the BIA finds appropriate. If the petitioner is not afforded a new appeal before the BIA within thirty (30) days, then the petitioner should be released on his original bond.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the petition is\n   <strong>\n    granted.\n   </strong>\n   The petitioner is entitled to a new appeal before the BIA.

In any event, IJ Hom found that there were materially changed circumstances because the petitioner violated a condition of his release on bond by driving without a valid driver's license. As explained below, there was no support in the record for a finding that the petitioner violated a condition of his release, as found by IJ Hom.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201101\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a) (27) (J) ; 1255(a), (h).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Section 1226(e) provides that \"[t]he Attorney General's discretionary judgment regarding the application of this section shall not be subject to review.

In particular, while the petitioner argues that the government had the burden of proving a material change in circumstances, danger to the community, and risk of flight by clear and convincing evidence, it is unclear that such a standard would make any difference in this case. The Supreme Court recently held that the statute itself does not require the government to carry the burden of showing danger to the community and risk of flight by clear and convincing evidence.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Jennings\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/#p837\">\n     138 S.Ct. at 847\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (holding that \"[n]othing in \u00a7 1226(a)'s text ... even remotely supports the imposition of\" the clear and convincing evidence standard).
