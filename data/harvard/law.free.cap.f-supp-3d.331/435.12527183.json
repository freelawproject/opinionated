Based upon her diagnoses of Crohn's disease and related gastrointestinal and arthritic conditions, the plaintiff employee received both short-term disability and long-term disability benefits under her employer's respective plans. The claims administrator later terminated her long-term disability benefits after the disability definition under the plan changed from merely requiring an inability to perform her own regular occupation to an inability to perform\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   gainful occupation. After the claims administrator denied her appeal of the termination of benefits, the plaintiff filed the instant ERISA action against the administrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Currently before the court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, as well as the plaintiff's alternative motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52, on the issue of whether the termination of long-term disability benefits was arbitrary and capricious. As explained below, the court finds that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the claims administrator's decision to terminate the plaintiff's long-term disability benefits was not without reason, unsupported by substantial evidence, or erroneous as a matter of law. Accordingly, the court will grant the claims administrator's motion for summary judgment and deny the plaintiff employee's motion for summary judgment, as well as her alternative motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The \"Elimination Period\" is the later of 90 calendar days or the end-date of STD benefits. Def.'s Facts at \u00b6 25; Pl.'s Resp. at \u00b6 25; Admin. R. at 178-79. The term \"Disabled\" encompasses three separate definitions for \"during the Elimination Period,\" \"after the Elimination Period,\" and \"after a Monthly Benefit has been paid for 2 years;\" the Policy states that \"Disabled\" means that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   because of an Injury or Sickness, a significant change in Your mental or physical functional capacity has occurred in which:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   a) during the Elimination Period, You are prevented from performing at least one of the Material Duties\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   of Your Regular Occupation\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   on a part-time or full-time basis; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   b) after the Elimination Period, You are:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   1. prevented from performing at least one of the Material Duties of Your Regular Occupation on a part-time or full-time basis; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   2. unable to generate Current Earnings which exceed 80% of Your Basic Monthly Earnings due to that same Injury or Sickness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   After a Monthly Benefit has been paid for 2 years, ...\n   <em>\n    Disabled\n   </em>\n   mean[s] You are unable to perform all of the Material Duties of any Gainful Occupation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Disability is determined relative to Your ability or inability to work.

Thus, the definition of \"Disabled\" \"after the Elimination Period\" adds a requirement of an inability to generate more than 80% of monthly earnings; and more stringent still, the definition of \"Disabled\" \"[a]fter a Monthly Benefit has been paid for 2\n   years\" adds the requirement that the participant cannot perform not just her own Regular Occupation, but \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   Gainful Occupation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Admin.

This arthritis is affecting primarily her bilateral knees, and she does also have radiographic evidence of secondary osteoarthritis. I believe this is contributing primarily to her overall pain. Intraarticular cortisone injections have been administered in the past, as well as viscosupplementation injections, all with minimal relief. She unfortunately cannot take NSAIDs due to her bowel disease. Unfortunately, her job requires her to stand for prolonged periods of time and to move from sitting, standing, and squatting positions during the day.

Reichard's Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Reichard argues that United of Omaha's decision to terminate her LTD benefits was arbitrary and capricious for the following reasons: (1) it failed to conduct a full and fair review of her claim because it does not have a standardized claims procedure, contrary to both the Policy and ERISA regulations; (2) it failed to consider that the side effects of her medications alone render her totally disabled; (3) it did not take her SSDI award into consideration; (4) substantial evidence does not support United of Omaha's decision because each of its medical and vocational reviews and examination contain errors and omissions rendering them unreliable; (5) United of Omaha's use of Dr. Reeder on appeal demonstrates a lack of fiduciary neutrality; (6) United of Omaha disregarded her complaints of pain and fatigue; and (7) United of Omaha failed to consider the cumulative effect of her conditions. The court addresses each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Whether United of Omaha Considered Reichard's Claim with a Standardized Procedure\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Reichard alleges that United of Omaha denied her a full and fair review by failing to follow a standardized procedure in considering her claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. at 2, 17-20. Specifically, United of Omaha did not use a claims manual in considering Reichard's claim, and thus, it \"has no documents which demonstrate compliance with administrative processes and safeguards required under the Regulations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. In support of her argument, Reichard cites a Department of Labor (\"DOL\") regulation enforcing ERISA, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-202\">\n   Every employee benefit plan shall establish and maintain reasonable procedures governing the filing of benefit claims, notification of benefit determinations, and appeal of adverse benefit determinations (hereinafter collectively referred to as claims procedures). The claims procedures for a plan will be deemed to be reasonable only if ... [t]he claims procedures contain administrative processes and safeguards designed to ensure and to verify that benefit claim determinations are made in accordance with governing plan documents and that, where appropriate, the plan provisions have been applied consistently with respect to similarly situated claimants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202560.503-1\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Reichard's argument that United of Omaha failed to comply with this regulation by not utilizing a claims manual, or otherwise adhering to a standardized claim review procedure, is unpersuasive for three reasons. First, the factual foundation of Reichard's claims manual argument relies on evidence outside of the administrative record: United of Omaha's interrogatory response in which it stated that it had not used a claims manual for at least five years. Because Reichard does not allege that this fact relates to a purported conflict of interest that would permit the court considering it as evidence extrinsic to the administrative record, it arguably falls outside of the court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Second, even assuming that the court may properly consider United of Omaha's interrogatory response, section 2560.503-1(b)(5) does not require a separate claims manual. The plain text of the\n   regulation does not reference a claims manual, and Reichard does not cite (nor could the court find) any case law either interpreting the regulation as imposing that requirement or holding that the failure to use a separate claims manual constituted an abuse of discretion. The regulation does not prescribe a precise written format to memorialize a plan's claims procedures. In fact, Reichard herself quotes the DOL's commentary from the Federal Register interpreting section 2560.503-1(b)(5) which rejects a rigid format requirement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-206\">\n   [T]his provision does no more than to require a plan to formalize, as a part of its claims procedures, the administrative processes that it must already have established and be using in operating the plan in order to satisfy basic fiduciary standards of conduct under the Act. The Department has not articulated specific requirements as to how such processes should be designed, believing that plans should have flexibility and are capable of monitoring their internal decisionmaking effectively and efficiently.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   ERISA; Rules and Regulations for Administration and Enforcement; Claims Procedure,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20Fed.%20Reg.%2070%2C252\">\n    65 Fed. Reg. 70,252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Nov. 21, 2000). Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the court may consider United of Omaha's disuse of a claims manual, the fact is inconsequential as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   Third, as a matter of fact, Reichard does not raise any specific shortcomings of the Policy at issue here, which appears to comply with section 2560.503-1(b)(5). The Policy effectively implements the Plan, instructs claimants on how to file a benefits claim, describes how a claimant will receive notice of a determination, and provides for an opportunity to appeal-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   the exact components of \"claims procedures,\" as defined in the regulation. In other words, the Policy here accomplishes precisely what Reichard envisions. Beyond her claims manual argument, Reichard does not clarify how United of Omaha's claims procedures fail conform to the remainder of section 2560.503-1(b)(5). It is also unclear how the Plan failed to, in the language of the regulation, \"contain administrative processes and safeguards ... to ensure ... that ... determinations are made in accordance with governing plan documents.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202560.503-1\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5). Reichard also alleges inconsistent application of plan provisions, but she fails to raise an example of another similarly situated claimant, allowing for a comparison between claims. Thus, she has failed to demonstrate how United of Omaha's claims procedures are defective, let alone arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    United of Omaha's Consideration of the Side Effects of Reichard's Medications\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Reichard argues that United of Omaha abused its discretion by ignoring the side effects of her medications, which she listed in her appeal correspondence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. at 2, 20-22.

Sept. 30, 2016) (distinguishing\n   <em>\n    Charles\n   </em>\n   and finding no abuse of discretion where administrator merely failed to consider the plaintiff's own \"self-diagnosis,\" in which she drew the only connection in the record between medications and her complaints of fatigue and memory loss).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   Reichard's argument is unpersuasive because she fails to cite to a medical opinion in the administrative record (or any opinion other than her own) indicating that the side effects of her medications render her disabled. Nor was her counsel able to identify records in support of her purportedly disabling side effects at oral argument. Other than repeating the side effects listed in her appeal letter to United of Omaha, her statement of undisputed material facts only contains brief references to apparently transitory side effects.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl.'s Facts at \u00b6 46 (quoting Remmel stating, \"She developed blurred vision on Topamax that was discontinued and that improved her vision\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 62, 63 (quoting a May 18, 2015 record stating, \"Discussed irregular menses with her GI doctor who feels that methotrexate may be causing this,\" and then quoting June 23, 2015 record stating, \"Menstrual irregularity seems to be resolving\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66 (describing how Zanaflex helped her headaches, but caused sedation during the day; Remmel advised her to take her dosage at bedtime). Nor does Reichard's appeal letter, brief, or statement of undisputed material facts suggest how her alleged side effects impact her ability to work. In short, by Reichard's own telling, it is unclear how the medical records in this case support the presence of disabling side effects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Accordingly, this case is distinguishable from those cited by Reichard in which courts found that plan administrators acted arbitrarily and capriciously by ignoring disabling side effects. In\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Charles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Dirnberger\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs' physicians opined that medication side effects impeded or foreclosed the plaintiffs' work capacity. Here, no analogous opinion exists. Instead, this case resembles\n   <em>\n    Ackaway\n   </em>\n   , in which the plaintiff's own assertion was the sole source of purportedly disabling side effects. As in\n   <em>\n    Ackaway\n   </em>\n   , the administrator here \"could not have committed an abuse of discretion for failing to consider the plaintiff's self-diagnosis.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205661724\">\n    2016 WL 5661724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   United of Omaha also considered some of the few instances of documented side effects on appeal, contrary to Reichard's argument that non-consideration of side effects belied a full and fair review. Dr. Reeder discussed two examples mentioned above in his summary of the medical evidence-how Reichard discontinued Topamax due to blurred vision, and how Zanaflex caused sedation. On the one hand, blurred vision and sedation are just two of the many side effects Reichard listed in her appeal letter: sweats, chills, fever, stomach pain, upset stomach, diarrhea, anxiety, nervousness, headaches, irritability\n   , joint pain, nausea, bloated feeling, dry mouth, and dizziness. On the other hand, if Reichard's own physicians failed to acknowledge side effects, it is not arbitrary and capricious for United of Omaha to follow suit. Moreover, Dr. Reeder's medical file review and United of Omaha's appeal decision letter explicitly address many of these symptoms, even if they do not label them as side effects. Whether Reichard's conditions or her medications cause these symptoms is immaterial to United of Omaha's determination, so long as it considers the impact of these symptoms on her ability to perform all of the Material Duties of any Gainful Occupation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ideally, Dr. Reeder or United of Omaha would have explicitly acknowledged Reichard's argument in her appeal letter that the adverse determination omitted a consideration of her side effects. Nevertheless, this minor omission falls far short of an abuse of discretion given that Dr. Reeder considered the few documented side effects, and United of Omaha's appeal review addressed many of the same symptoms Reichard classifies as side effects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    United of Omaha's Consideration of Reichard's SSDI Award\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Reichard next argues that United of Omaha's adverse decision on appeal was arbitrary and capricious because it failed to consider her SSDI award. Several hurdles complicate her argument: (1) any notice of the SSDI award that predates United of Omaha's appeal decision is outside of the administrative record; (2) assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that consideration of that notice is proper, the notice was to the Advocator Group, not United of Omaha, requiring a finding that the latter had imputed knowledge; (3) some case law suggests that a plan administrator's failure to consider an SSD award is not an abuse of discretion; and (4) there is no evidence that United of Omaha had knowledge of the records and reasoning upon which the SSA reached a favorable decision. The court discusses each hurdle in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   i. Whether consideration of the award, outside of the administrative record, is proper\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   An inconsistency between a favorable SSA determination and an unfavorable plan administrator determination is not an abuse of discretion when the SSA award was not part of the administrative record when the administrator rendered its decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pearson-Rhoads v. Aetna Life Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. CIV.A. 10-1076,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%205116633\">\n    2011 WL 5116633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *14 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 28, 2011). Here, the only evidence of Reichard's SSDI award in the administrative record is a June 6, 2017 email from the Advocator Group to United of Omaha transmitting her award notice. This postdates United of Omaha's May 2, 2017 appeal decision by more than a month, demonstrating that the award was not part of the administrative record when United of Omaha reached its appeal decision. Therefore, Reichard must rely on evidence outside of the administrative record to further pursue her SSDI argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   The only evidence of the SSDI award that predates United of Omaha's May 2, 2017 appeal decision is an April 12, 2017 letter from the Advocator Group to Reichard, stating, \"As you are aware, we received notice that your [SSD] claim has been awarded. If you have not received a favorable decision or award correspondence, please inform us immediately.\" Decl. of Reichard in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J/Alternative Mot. for J. pursuant\n   to Rule 52 at ECF pp. 1, 4. Reichard has not explained why this evidence fits an exception to the general rule that a court limits its review to the administrative record, and the court agrees with United of Omaha that this evidence is not for the court's consideration. Had discovery produced, for example, correspondence in which the Advocator Group notified United of Omaha of the SSDI award in April 2017, thereby disproving United of Omaha's claim of ignorance, that correspondence would constitute acceptable conflict evidence outside of the administrative record. But because the only proper evidence of United of Omaha's knowledge of the SSDI award postdates its appeal decision, it did not abuse its discretion by failing to consider it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   ii. Whether a finding that United of Omaha had implied knowledge of the award is proper\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Even assuming that the Advocator Group's April 12, 2017 correspondence is proper evidence for review, this court cannot accept Reichard's theory as to how the law imputes the Advocator Group's knowledge of the award to United of Omaha. Reichard argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-222\">\n   [T]he Advocator Group sent an overpayment collection letter on behalf of [United of Omaha] to Reichard on April 12, 2017. The Advocator Group's knowledge of Reichard's SSDI award is imputed as a matter of law to [United of Omaha]....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-223\">\n   ...[A]s [United of Omaha's] agent to collect any possible overpayment as a result of an SSDI award, [t]he Advocator Group knew that Reichard had been awarded SSDI benefits no later than the date of its April 12, 2017[ ] letter,...and that knowledge was clearly material to its duties as [United of Omaha's] agent.

Even resolving questions of assent in Reichard's favor, the degree and nature of control and monitoring that United of Omaha asserted over the Advocator Group is unclear. The record only demonstrates email correspondence from the Advocator Group to United of Omaha updating it on the progress of Reichard's SSDI claim and a statement in the Policy that United of Omaha had partnered with three firms specializing in SSD. There is no evidence that United of Omaha directed the Advocator Group in its SSD advocacy. While United of Omaha stood to benefit financially from the Advocator Group's representation of Reichard in that a SSDI award would offset LTD benefits, she has not explained how this fact alone creates an agency relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   Additionally, to the extent that Reichard agrees with United of Omaha's conclusion that the Advocator Group is an independent contractor,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   United of Omaha's B. Opp. Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J./M. J. (\"Def.'s Opp.\") at 27, Doc.

A non-agent independent contractor is defined as a person who contracts to accomplish something for another or to deliver something to another, but who is not acting as a fiduciary for the other. The distinction between a non-agent independent contractor and an agent independent contractor has been analogized as a firm that contracts to perform a particular, discrete task, such as to build a swimming pool, or to a party who is empowered to speak for another and bind the other in contracts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   <em>\n    King's Choice Neckwear, Inc. v.

Dec. 21, 2007) (citations, quotations, and alterations omitted). Applying the\n   <em>\n    King's Choice Neckwear\n   </em>\n   reasoning to this case, United of Omaha appeared to merely contract with the Advocator Group to deliver an award to offset any LTD obligations by performing the particular, discrete task of representing Reichard before the SSA. There is no evidence that United of Omaha empowered the Advocator group to, for example, speak on its behalf or contractually bind it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   None of the cases Reichard cites is helpful on the threshold inquiry of whether an agency relationship exists here. In\n   <em>\n    Huston\n   </em>\n   , the alleged agency question involved whether two of the defendant's employees qualified as \"management level\" so that their knowledge could be imputed to the employer for Title VII liability purposes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 102. It is unclear how\n   <em>\n    Cephalon\n   </em>\n   is relevant; the agency analysis there again involved imputing knowledge of employees to the defendant employer.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4337667\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/36/527/#p535\">\n    36 F.Supp.3d at 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the brief agency discussion in\n   <em>\n    Schlier\n   </em>\n   involved imputing an attorney's knowledge to a client. It is not apparent to the court, and Reichard does not elucidate, how the relationship between United of Omaha and the Advocator Group is analogous to that between employer and employee or client and attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   Without Reichard presenting further legal and factual support, the court is unwilling to conclusorily find that an agency relationship existed, thereby imputing the Advocator Group's knowledge to United of Omaha. Therefore, in addition to the Advocator Group's April 12, 2017 letter falling outside of proper evidentiary consideration, United of Omaha did not abuse its discretion by failing to consider Reichard's SSDI award because she failed to prove that agency law imputes knowledge of the award to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   iii. United of Omaha's obligation to consider a favorable award\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Even if the court decided that agency law imputes the Advocator Group's knowledge of the SSDI award upon United of Omaha, it is not clear as a matter of law that a failure to consider the award alone constitutes an abuse of discretion.

A disagreement between a favorable SSD determination and an unfavorable LTD benefits determination \"is relevant though not dispositive, particularly ... when the administrator rejects the very diagnoses on which the Social Security benefits determination is based.\"\n   <em>\n    Post v.

Pa. Sept. 26, 2016) (\"Defendant's final appeal denial letter noted that the SSA award had been considered, but that it had reached a different conclusion from the SSA, in part because Defendant had access to Plaintiff's more recent medical information, and in part because of the contents of the vocational report, items which were not presented to the SSA.\");\n   <em>\n    Mann v.

Pa. Nov. 25, 2003) (\"UNUM's record contained a number of medical reports, testing, and surveillance which were not part of the Social Security record.\"). Thus, when the record before the SSA is incomparable to that before a LTD plan administrator, different outcomes on the question of disability are unremarkable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   The point in discussing these cases is not to suggest that the SSA and United of Omaha considered distinguishable records; rather, the record before the SSA is a mystery here defeating any attempt to compare the SSA's and United of Omaha's claims process. Consequently, the relevance of the mere outcome of SSA proceedings without the reasoning and records behind the outcome are of dubious utility to the administrator. Even if United of Omaha had imputed knowledge of the SSDI outcome, it is unclear how it could have put that outcome to use to materially change its adverse decision on appeal. In contrast, the cases above suggest that the plan administrators there had access to, for example, reasoned administrative law judge decisions and compiled medical records before the SSA, thereby providing insight into the SSA's process and reasoning. For the SSDI determination to materially alter United of Omaha's adverse appeal decision, United of Omaha would have had to relinquish its application of the known record here to its own disability standard in favor of the SSA's application of an unknown record to a different disability standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   To be clear, the court agrees with Reichard's argument that a SSD award can be \"highly significant\" given that \"the standard for disability applied by the [SSA] is at least as exacting as the standard under the Plan.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Michaux v. Bayer Corp.\n   </em>\n   , Civil No. 05-1430 (JBS),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%201843123\">\n    2006 WL 1843123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (D.N.J. June 30, 2006) (explaining that,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , SSD disability definition requires inability to hold gainful employment at\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   job, and remanding plaintiff's claim back to plan administrator because it neglected to analyze favorable and concurrent SSD determination and administrative law judge decision). However, that significance is predicated upon an administrator's awareness of the SSA's reasoning and records and an ability to evaluate, compare, and contrast the SSA's reasoning and records with that of the administrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   In sum, Reichard's argument that United of Omaha abused its discretion by failing to consider her SSDI award fails for two independently sufficient reasons: evidence of the award that predates United of Omaha's appeal decision is outside of the administrative record, and the record before the court fails to establish an agency relationship between United of Omaha and the Advocator Group. The Third Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Burk\n   </em>\n   and the lack of records or reasoning behind the SSA's favorable decision further counsel against holding that United of Omaha arbitrarily and capriciously\n   failed to consider Reichard's SSDI award. The court is sympathetic to Reichard's undoubted frustration at this outcome: How is she not entitled to LTD benefits when concurrent SSA proceedings resulted in SSDI benefits under an arguably more exacting disability definition? Unfortunately, ERISA law generally limiting court review to the administrative record, agency law requiring a demonstration that United of Omaha exerted some degree of control over the Advocator Group, Third Circuit case law, and an absence of records and reasoning behind the SSA's determination require finding that United of Omaha did not abuse its discretion by finding her able to work without considering her SSDI award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   d. Whether Substantial Evidence Supports United of Omaha Basing its Determination on its\n   <em>\n    Medical and Vocational Reviews and Examination\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   Reichard next argues that substantial evidence does not support Dr. Liebermann's medical peer review, Dr. Golombek's report following his IME, Palmer's TSA, or Dr. Reeder's medical file review. This section addresses the contentions related to each report in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   i. Dr. Liebermann's medical peer review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   Reichard alleges that Dr. Liebermann erred by failing to consider current records in his analysis and concluding that she had not had significant issues with Crohn's disease since January 2012. Pl.'s Br. at 25. The current records argument appears to be as follows: United of Omaha retained Dr. Liebermann to answer questions relating to Reichard's gastrointestinal diagnoses and restrictions \"for the timeframe of 07/01/2016 to 10/01/2016;\" yet he admits to \"having no gastrointestinal medical information as of July 2016 going forward.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s Opp.\") at 22; Admin. R. at 231-32, 346. This argument is unpersuasive. United of Omaha's questions to Dr. Liebermann were presumably an attempt at determining Reichard's up-to-date condition-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   as of the period from July to October of 2016, and Dr. Liebermann dated his report October 3, 2016. There do not appear to be any gastrointestinal records for that period other than an unremarkable July 27, 2016 colonoscopy - and Reichard does not identify any omitted records. Therefore, Dr. Liebermann reasonably synthesized prior records and inferred her condition for the three-month period requested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Admin. R. at 232 (\"[T]he claimant has been stable with respect to Crohn's disease for months and therefore it is likely that she will remain in remission beyond July 2016, when my information stops.\") Moreover, Dr. Liebermann was open to amending his peer review with updated information for that time, which was ultimately unnecessary because of the absence of gastrointestinal treatment for that period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Admin. R. at 230 (\"Although a flare is possible I reserve the opportunity to comment if the claimant has additional symptoms from the July to September 2016 time-frame if additional information is provided.\"). Because no material records exist for that period, Dr. Liebermann's peer review was not unreasonable vis-\u00e0-vis the records considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   In challenging Dr. Liebermann's conclusion that she had not had significant Crohn's issues since January 2012, Reichard references several records noting persistent gastrointestinal symptoms and treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. at 8-9 (noting,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , increased Humira dosage from September 25, 2014; possible presence of Crohn's disease in right colon on August 6, 2015; abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, joint pain, inflammatory arthritis, and fecal incontinence as symptoms on February 8, 2016; and restarting of Methotrexate\n   to help bowel and bladder issues on February 9, 2016). These records certainly demonstrate that Reichard had Crohn's issues since January 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   But various records from Reichard's own physicians suggest that Dr. Liebermann's conclusion that her issues were not \"significant\" was reasonable. Consider first the totality of records from Dr. Osterman, the lone gastrointestinal provider on file when Dr. Liebermann conducted his peer review. When Dr. Osterman submitted an APS on May 12, 2014, he expected Reichard to return to full-time work in just six months and indicated she could sit, stand, and walk for six to eight hours continuously. He reached this opinion despite noting many of the symptoms Reichard identifies above, as well as others-six bowel movements per day, occasional rectal prolapse, nausea, irregular bowel movements, abdominal pain, and unpredictable and episodic flare-ups-during the spring of 2014. In his final treatment notes in the administrative record, Dr. Osterman did not indicate that her conditions were worsening and largely noted the same symptoms. Given Dr. Osterman's functional expectations, a reasonable peer reviewer could conclude that Reichard's issues with Crohn's disease had not been significant since her bowel resection surgery in January 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Even excluding Dr. Osterman's APS from consideration, the extent of Reichard's symptoms in his notes are unclear, providing leeway for Dr. Liebermann to conclude that her Crohn's issues were not significant. For example, Reichard experienced \"some\" incontinence, according to Dr. Osterman. The significance of this symptom depends on its severity, frequency, and impact on Reichard's daily functions, but Dr. Osterman left ambiguous these factors. Dr. Liebermann was under no obligation to resolve these ambiguities in favor of a finding that her issues with Crohn's were significant. Given the lack of meaningful details pertaining to Crohn's symptoms and the deferential standard of review where the court may not substitute its own judgment for that of Dr. Liebermann's, his conclusion on the significance of her issues with Crohn's was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   Dr. Liebermann also states that he reviewed records from Dr. Chiappetta, which further support a finding that Reichard's Crohn's issues were not significant. Dr. Chiappetta noted in February 2014 that since Reichard's bowel resection surgery in January 2012, \"her bowel symptoms have been relatively stable with intermittent bouts of diarrhea.\" By February 9, 2016, Dr. Chiappetta opined that Reichard was \"doing well from my standpoint without any worsening symptoms,\" while noting continued bowel issues. Although Reichard is correct that her records also refer to changing medications and dosages for treatment of Crohn's, the possible presence of Crohn's in her colon, and the considerable list of symptoms associated with Crohn's detailed above, a reasonable peer reviewer could still conclude from this record that her gastrointestinal issues were not significant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   That said, Dr. Liebermann's review of Reichard's gastrointestinal records contained possible shortcomings. Most prominently, Dr. Liebermann states that Dr. Osterman commented on May 15, 2016, that Reichard's Crohn's disease was \"stable,\" and she was not functionally impaired from a gastrointestinal standpoint. Dr. Liebermann then notes his agreement with those conclusions. The court could not find any record from Dr. Osterman dated May 15, 2016, or an opinion of his memorialized in other treatment records that Reichard's Crohn's was stable or that she was not functionally impaired from a gastrointestinal standpoint. Additionally, although Dr.\n   Liebermann wrote that his review of the records contained a \"special emphasis on the gastrointestinal aspects,\" he omitted some of the symptoms and treatments relating to Crohn's identified above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   Substantial evidence still supports Dr. Liebermann's gastrointestinal analysis for the following four reasons: First, although Reichard states in her LTD appeal letter that she did not see Dr. Osterman on May 15, 2016, she does not appear to be pursuing the argument in this litigation that Dr. Osterman never referred to her Crohn's as \"stable.\" And even in her appeal letter, she only challenged that specific date rather than Dr. Liebermann's assertion that Dr. Osterman concluded that her Crohn's was stable. Without a challenge from Reichard in this litigation, the court hesitates to conclude that Dr. Osterman never reached these conclusions, whether on May 15, 2016, or at any other time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, even if Dr. Osterman never commented that Reichard was not functionally impaired from a gastrointestinal standpoint, his May 2014 APS nevertheless implies the same conclusion. As discussed above, concluding that Reichard could sit, stand, and walk for six to eight hours continuously each is incompatible with a determination that any of Reichard's gastrointestinal symptoms would functionally impair her. For example, if Dr. Osterman believed she could sit for six to eight hours continuously, he could not also believe that her rectal prolapse, fecal incontinence, diarrhea, or relatively large number of bowel movements in a day would materially interfere with that task.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   Third, Dr. Chiappetta used the word \"stable\" to describe Reichard's bowel symptoms in 2014 and noted she was doing well without any worsening symptoms. While Dr. Chiappetta noted inflammatory bowel issues in 2015 and 2016, after the \"stable\" comment, her discussions do not suggest that Reichard's gastrointestinal condition had deteriorated since 2014. Therefore, even if Dr. Osterman never reached a conclusion that Reichard's Crohn's was stable, her primary care physician did, similarly supporting Dr. Liebermann's conclusion. Finally, even though Dr. Liebermann does not appear to have considered all of Reichard's gastrointestinal symptoms and medications, he wrote that \"a flare is possible;\" acknowledged her Crohn's diagnosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and her occasional bouts of abdominal pain and diarrhea; and noted that she maintained normal weight and nutritional status. His admission that a flare is possible suggests that he contemplated the possibility of future gastrointestinal symptoms and weighed them against his understanding of the frequency of her flare-ups as noted in the record. After weighing these factors, he concluded that her issues with Crohn's were not significant, and she was not functionally impaired from a gastrointestinal standpoint. In all, while the shortcomings noted above demonstrate that Dr. Liebermann's peer review was imperfect in its detail and breadth, substantial evidence nevertheless supports his conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   ii. Dr. Golombek's IME report\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   Reichard argues that substantial evidence does not support Dr. Golombek's IME report because he: (1) only spent 20 minutes examining her, (2) cites records of doctors she did not see, (3) fails to address her medication side effects, (4) fails to explain why he disagrees with her doctors who say she cannot work, and (5) otherwise failed to explain his conclusion as to\n   her capacity to work full time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. at 25-26. The court disagrees on each point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   First, a 20-minute examination does not immediately strike the court as deficient, and regardless, Reichard does not detail how more time would have improved the examination. Her second assertion has no relevance to the medical integrity of Dr. Golombek's report: his references to \"Dr. Mark Listerman,\" \"Dr. Ravenelle,\" and \"Ms. Almer\" are typographical errors, referring to Dr. Osterman, Nurse Practitioner Ravenelle, and Palmer. The context in which Dr. Golombek refers to each could not make this more obvious. Third, the court already considered Reichard's side effects argument and, regardless, Dr. Golombek thoroughly addressed her medication regimen in a two-paragraph section of his report. Fourth, the only doctor who said that Reichard could not work once she was on LTD benefits was Dr. Chiappetta.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reichard is correct that Dr. Golombek did not explicitly explain the reasoning behind his disagreement with Dr. Chiappetta. However, Dr. Golombek wrote that he agreed with Dr. Chiappetta's assigned sitting, standing, and walking restrictions, which supported sedentary work and undermined her February 2, 2016 opinion that Reichard could not work. Moreover, because Dr. Chiappetta simply wrote \"no work\" where the February 2, 2016 APS form requested her opinion on specific functional restrictions, and her APS was otherwise compatible with at least sedentary work, it is difficult to imagine how Dr. Golombek could have meaningfully engaged her \"no work\" conclusion. Fifth, because Reichard does not identify any other specific shortcomings in Dr. Golombek's determination that she could work full time, she has failed to demonstrate that substantial evidence does not support his IME report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   iii. Palmer's TSA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   Turning to Palmer's TSA, Reichard argues that it improperly preceded Drs. Liebermann's, Golombek's, and Reeder's reviews; Palmer did not consider the intellectual demands of the jobs he proposed; he did not consider the side effects of her medications; and he did not consider her SSDI award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. at 29-31. She does not identify any erroneous findings or omissions that would suggest a problem with issuing the vocational report prior to those doctors' reviews. She also fails to specify any intellectual demands of the jobs Palmer identified-office nurse, school nurse, medical insurance clerk, hospital-admitting clerk, and administrative clerk-that are beyond her. The court has already addressed her side effects and SSDI arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   Reichard also quotes at length from the Third Circuit opinion in\n   <em>\n    Havens v. Continental Casualty Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752083\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/186/207/\">\n    186 F. App'x 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). There, the court commented on the importance of a vocational analysis to a claimant's work capacity and the minimum standards the analysis must meet to pass arbitrary and capricious review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-257\">\n   The finding that [the claimant] was capable of performing alternate occupations was arbitrary and capricious. The irreducible logical core of such a finding is that a claimant has a residual functional capacity that equals or exceeds the functional requirements of a feasible alternate occupation. These two determinations-the claimant's capacity and the occupation's requirements-must together be detailed enough to make rational comparison possible. Otherwise, the \"finding\" that the claimant can perform\n   alternate occupations consists only of a bald assertion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752083\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/186/207/\">\n    186 F.

His report adopts the restrictions and limitations noted in Nurse Grancer's review, and for each job he identifies, he provides a DOT code corresponding to a description of duties, an exertional level, and a monthly wage. For example, the DOT code for the medical insurance clerk position contains a job description detailing tasks relating to hospitalization insurance coverage verification and itemized hospital bill compilation, none of which appear to conflict with Reichard's abilities. Nor has Reichard specified any aspects of the positions Palmer identified that conflict with her abilities. The court notes one error in Palmer's analysis: The monthly wage for one of the positions, hospital-admitting clerk, is below the Policy's disability definition threshold (sixty percent of her pre-disability wage). However, the four remaining jobs are above the threshold wage, leaving Palmer's overall conclusion as to employment options intact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   iv. Dr. Reeder's Medical File Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   Reichard next argues that substantial evidence does not support Dr. Reeder's medical file review because he: (1) relied upon the purportedly erroneous reviews by Drs. Liebermann and Golombek; (2) failed to wait for forthcoming medical records before submitting his review; and (3) is unqualified because he is not a rheumatologist or gastroenterologist. The court disagrees on each.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   First, as discussed above, Reichard has not demonstrated that the reports of Drs. Liebermann and Golombek were erroneous. While Dr. Reeder considers the possibly erroneous reference to Dr. Osterman's May 15, 2016 conclusion that Reichard's Crohn's was stable, he does not appear to rely on Dr. Osterman's conclusion to a greater extent than Dr. Liebermann. Because substantial evidence supports Dr. Liebermann's gastrointestinal conclusions regardless of his inclusion of Dr. Osterman's possibly nonexistent comment, substantial evidence also supports Dr. Reeder's adoption of Dr. Liebermann's conclusions of no gastrointestinal restrictions or limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   Even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that substantial evidence does not support the reports of Drs. Liebermann and Golombek, Dr. Reeder provides his own independently sufficient reasoning for finding no gastrointestinal or rheumatological restrictions. Considering first Dr. Reeder's gastrointestinal discussion, he accepts Dr. Osterman's opinion that she could sit,\n   stand, and walk for six to eight hours.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also reasoned, similar to the court's analysis in finding that substantial evidence supported Dr. Liebermann's peer review, that, \"While the insured claims that her current disability in part is related to incontinence of rectal prolapse, she had had these symptoms prior to the date of disability.\" Admin. R. at 300. This assertion is on point: If Reichard could work as a registered nurse, a job of medium exertion, prior to her disability, and she experienced rectal prolapse and incontinence while working that job, and there is no evidence that these symptoms materially worsened, why can she not now perform a sedentary or light job? Dr. Reeder also considered updated records from Dr. Blanco, demonstrating that her bowel movements had halved to five per day since her February 2016 visit with Dr. Osterman. He notes that, while Dr. Blanco referred her to a rectal surgeon to consider treatment for rectal prolapse, the record did not suggest that that surgery would impose ongoing work restrictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   Ideally, Dr. Reeder would have engaged in a more extended discussion of some of the implications of her Crohn's symptoms on her ability to perform sedentary or light work-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   the impact of her rectal prolapse, fecal incontinence, or large number of bowel movements on working, say, a desk job. However, this shortcoming is minor given his reasonable explanation above that she previously worked a more rigorous job with prolapse and incontinence, conclusion that there is no evidence that surgical treatment of her rectal prolapse would be disabling, and opinion in his letter to Dr. Blanco that \"she would ordinarily have free access to toilet facilities wherever she worked.\" Thus, Dr. Reeder reached his own conclusion supported by substantial evidence that Reichard was not subject to gastrointestinal restrictions or limitations, independent of his reliance on Dr. Liebermann's conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   The court also notes that any shortcomings in Dr. Reeder's (or Dr. Liebermann's) discussion of Crohn's symptoms are even less consequential when recalling the restrictions Palmer considered in his TSA. Because Palmer adopted Nurse Grancer's restrictions-including the ability to reposition as needed for five to ten minutes every one to two hours-and these restrictions contemplate frequent trips to the bathroom, the Gainful Occupations that Palmer identified account for the workday impacts of her Crohn's symptoms. In other words, United of Omaha could reasonably determine that Reichard's gastrointestinal symptoms did not functionally impair her because its vocational expert found jobs at which she could take frequent bathroom breaks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   Turning to his conclusion that Reichard suffered no rheumatological restrictions or limitations, Dr. Reeder went beyond merely rubber-stamping Dr. Golombek's report. Similar to the court's confusion over Dr. Chiappetta's \"no work\" opinion, he found that Dr. Chiappetta's office notes and claims of impairment were \"internally inconsistent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   This is a reasonable conclusion: On the one hand, the restrictions Dr. Chiappetta imposed on February 2, 2016, and the \"essentially normal findings\" from 2014 and 2015 appointments, are compatible with sedentary and light work. On the other, Dr. Chiappetta wrote \"no work\" on that same date she imposed restrictions compatible with sedentary and light work. Dr. Reeder continues to address her fibromyalgia in his Conclusion section of the medical file review, explaining that she does not take pain medications in significant quantities, and there is no evidence of loss of function from the condition based on muscle testing, range of motion, strength, and gait documented across providers. Therefore, because Dr. Reeder provides sufficient reasons for his disagreement with Dr. Chiappetta, his rheumatological conclusions are not \"procedural anomalies that call into question the fairness of the process [by] relying on the opinions of non-treating over treating physicians without reason.\"\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   , 755 F.Supp.2d at 643. In sum, even if Dr. Golombek's report was erroneous, substantial evidence would still support Dr. Reeder's rheumatological conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   Reichard's second complaint against Dr. Reeder's medical file review, that he completed it knowing that more treatment records were forthcoming, is of her own doing. Roughly three weeks before Dr. Reeder issued his review, Reichard emailed United of Omaha attaching records and stating, \"This is the last of the medical record[s] as of now, so please su[b]mit my appeal. There are two physicians ... that I have appointments for, but no current[ ] medical records for.\" Admin. R. at 320. Thus, as United of Omaha argues, Reichard \"herself explicitly requested that her appeal be considered ...\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   the records she now suggests that United of Omaha should have obtained.\" Def.'s Opp. at 15 (emphasis in original). Moreover, accepting this argument would promote poor policy: Because a claimant is likely to always have future appointments scheduled, Reichard's position here would effectively block an administrator from ever reaching a final claim determination.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swanberg v. PNC Fin. Servs. Grp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. CV 2:15-544,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204493684\">\n    2016 WL 4493684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (W.D. Pa. Aug. 26, 2016) (\"Contrary to [the plaintiff's] allegations, [the administrator] did not turn a 'blind eye' to Dr. Franzen's report; it simply arrived too late for [the administrator] to consider it in making its final determination.\"). Therefore, even if Reichard herself was not responsible for Dr. Reeder proceeding before receiving forthcoming treatment records, her argument would fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   Third, Reichard's own critique of Dr. Reeder's analysis belies her argument that he was unqualified to review her appeal because he was not a rheumatologist or gastroenterologist. In the same paragraph that she challenges his qualifications, she acknowledges the importance of a reviewer \"evaluat[ing] all of her conditions in a holistic fashion.\" Pl.'s Br. at 28. Holistic evaluation appears to be precisely the use of Dr. Reeder as a generalist, board-certified in internal medicine. Reichard's argument falls flatter given that United of Omaha had already sought out physicians in both specialties, Dr. Liebermann and Dr. Golombek. In her brief in opposition to United of Omaha's motion, Reichard also presents a new argument: that Dr. Reeder's reference to a rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis, which is similar but distinct from her true diagnosis of inflammatory bowel diseasearthritis, is erroneous, further demonstrating his lack of qualifications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp. at 14-20. However, as Reichard herself admits, her own doctors document this diagnosis,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Admin. R. at 497, 504, and regardless, she fails to establish how the\n   differences between the two diagnoses, which she admits are similar, would impact her ability to work. In all, Reichard has failed to demonstrate that substantial evidence does not support Dr. Reeder's medical file review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   e.\n   <em>\n    Conflict of Interest Posed by Dr. Reeder's Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   While related to her argument that substantial evidence does not support Dr. Reeder's medical file review, Reichard's argument here is distinct: She alleges that United of Omaha's use of Dr. Reeder demonstrates a lack of fiduciary neutrality and a procedural conflict of interest, a factor weighing towards United of Omaha abusing its discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. at 9-13, 31-33.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, she urges the court to follow other cases that have questioned Dr. Reeder's credibility, and points to his letters to physicians and unfavorable selectivity of considered records as evidence of bias. There is some merit to her arguments, and the court accordingly takes into account the procedural conflict of interest and weighs it as a factor against a finding that United of Omaha did not abuse its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   Reichard primarily relies on three cases for the proposition that United of Omaha's use of Dr. Reeder demonstrates a lack of fiduciary neutrality. The first is inapposite because the court never reached the issue of Dr. Reeder's opinion, and Reichard misleadingly quotes the court's summary of the plaintiff's arguments for support.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ferguson v. United of Omaha Life Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4137511\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/3/474/#p479\">\n    3 F.Supp.3d 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 479 (D. Md. 2014). In the second, the court gave little weight to Dr. Reeder's opinion and questioned his credibility and fairness because he stood \"alone in opining that no objective evidence exists to support the medical diagnoses,\" ignored objective evidence in the record favorable to the claimant, and disagreed with examining specialists despite no demonstrated expertise in those specialties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v. United of Omaha Life Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. CV-11-BE-3948-S,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205519525\">\n    2013 WL 5519525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *14 (N.D. Ala. Sept. 30, 2013). In the third, the court criticized Dr. Reeder's review because he ignored objective evidence (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , an MRI) and a fibromyalgia diagnosis, he self-servingly chose which records to rely upon, and he reached his conclusion without the benefit of an IME.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tassone v. United of Omaha Life Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266766\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/264/867/#p875\">\n    264 F.Supp.3d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 875-76 (N.D. Ill. 2017) (\" 'The report of a non-examining, non-treating physician should be discounted when contradicted by all other evidence in the record.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wilkes v. Unum Life Ins. Co. of Am.\n   </em>\n   , No. 01-C-182-C,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%20926279\">\n    2002 WL 926279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (W.D. Wis. Jan. 29, 2002) ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Tassone\n   </em>\n   are distinguishable. Unlike those cases, the court cannot find an example of omitted objective evidence or an ignored diagnosis in Dr. Reeder's medical file review, and Reichard does not present an example. Nor is he alone in opining that her diagnoses lack objective evidence, as in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   . He also reached his conclusions with the benefit of Dr. Golombek's IME, unlike his review in\n   <em>\n    Tassone\n   </em>\n   . His summary of the administrative record is thorough, and there are no apparent examples of him ignoring evidence. While Dr. Reeder disagreed with Dr. Chiappetta as to Reichard's work ability, similar to his disagreement with examining\n   specialists in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , he sufficiently justified his disagreement, as discussed above. His review has imperfections, all discussed above: his failure to make clear that he was responding to arguments in Reichard's appeal letter such as the impact of her medication side effects, incorporation of the possible phantom May 15, 2016 comment from Dr. Osterman that Reichard's Crohn's was stable, and under-discussion of Reichard's Crohn's symptoms. Still, these blemishes are insufficient to conclude that Dr. Reeder's review is entitled to little weight or representative of a procedural conflict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   His letters to Reichard's physicians are a different matter. Preliminarily, the court agrees with United of Omaha's argument that \"seeking Plaintiff's doctors' input prior to a final claim determination is a prudent practice that ensures a reasoned, informed claim-determination process ....\" Def.'s Opp. at 32. But the court also agrees with the\n   <em>\n    Tassone's\n   </em>\n   commentary on Dr. Reeder's letters:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-277\">\n   The letters were obviously written in a manner designed to lure the recipient into either agreeing with Dr. Reeder's limited and biased review of the records, or enter into a war of diagnoses with him. There is no upside for any doctor to engage in a dispute with an in-house physician. Thus, the court places no significance on the doctors' silence to such a biased letter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266766\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/264/867/#p875\">\n    264 F.Supp.3d at 875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The problem with Dr. Reeder's letters to Reichard's physicians has nothing to do with his attempt at corresponding with them to seek their viewpoints. For example, Dr. Jiminez signing Dr. Reeder's letter is strong evidence that Reichard's own physician does not consider her headaches disabling. The problem is that Dr. Reeder wrote, \"[I]f I do not hear from you within 10 days of the receipt of this information, I will assume that you are in agreement with the content of this letter.\" Admin. R. at 228, 245, 275, 280. Treatment of a physician's silence as agreement smacks of bias and stains Dr. Reeder's credibility; accordingly, the court considers this aspect of his letters as a procedural conflict of interest and a factor weighing in favor of United of Omaha arbitrarily and capriciously denying Reichard's appeal. However, the factor is minor given that United of Omaha does not appear to rely on any physicians' silence as agreement with Dr. Reeder in its May 2, 2017 denial letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   f.\n   <em>\n    Whether United of Omaha Disregarded Reichard's Complaints of Pain and Fatigue\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   The entirety of Reichard's pain and fatigue argument is a brief description of a recent Third Circuit case,\n   <em>\n    Killebrew v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=723%20F.%20App%27x%20133\">\n    723 F. App'x 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 136 (3d Cir. 2018). There, the court reversed the district court's grant of the defendant's summary judgment motion and held that substantial evidence did not support the defendant's conclusion that \"no evidence\" existed to back the plaintiff's complaints of pain and fatigue. Although the plaintiff's physicians neither referred her to pain management nor prescribed her narcotic pain medication, she took multiple chronic pain medications, belying the defendant's claim of \"no evidence.\" Reichard does not apply\n   <em>\n    Killebrew\n   </em>\n   to the facts of her own case, and there is no apparent example of United of Omaha finding no evidence of pain or fatigue in either Dr. Reeder's review or United of Omaha's denial letter. In fact, Dr. Reeder explicitly references her pain medications in the Conclusion section of his medical file review, finding that she took them in insufficient quantities to demonstrate any loss of function. Accordingly, Reichard fails to establish that United of Omaha abused its\n   discretion by disregarding her complaints of pain and fatigue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   g.\n   <em>\n    The Cumulative Effect of Alleged Procedural Irregularities\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   Reichard's argument here consists of conclusory allegations of United of Omaha turning a blind eye to the faults of its consultants' opinions and cherry-picking medical evidence, case illustrations in which courts held that United of Omaha abused its discretion without an application to the case at hand, and a brief summary of prior arguments. To the extent that Reichard is arguing here that the court should weigh United of Omaha's history of biased claims administration as a procedural conflict of interest factor,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dowling\n   </em>\n   , 871 F.3d at 250, the court declines the invitation. Reichard herself cites a host of cases holding that United of Omaha did not abuse its discretion in denying benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. at 26-27 (listing cases for proposition that United of Omaha routinely uses Dr. Reeder to deny applications, terminate claims, and deny appeals).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   In all, Reichard has failed to persuade the court that United of Omaha's errors, singularly or cumulatively, demonstrate that it arbitrarily and capriciously denied her LTD benefit claim. There were shortcomings in the substance and process of the adjudication of her LTD benefit claim: Dr. Liebermann's reference to the possibly nonexistent May 15, 2016 Dr. Osterman comment and overly brief discussion of Crohn's symptoms; Palmer's reference to an occupation with a wage below the Policy threshold; and Dr. Reeder's failure to explicitly respond to Reichard's side effects argument in her appeal letter,\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   incorporation of Dr. Liebermann's reference to the possibly nonexistent \"stable\" comment by Dr. Osterman, and biased interpretation of physicians' silence as agreement. But the sum of these shortcomings-some of which Reichard herself failed to identify or argue in this litigation-do not establish that United of Omaha's LTD benefit denial was arbitrary and capricious.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Reichard's Alternative Motion for Judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   Reichard supports her alternative motion with just two sentences:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-286\">\n   Since evidence outside the Administrative Record is being offered on [United of Omaha's] conflict of interest, Plaintiff alternatively moves for judgment under Rule 52 because summary judgment may not be appropriate. If the material facts of the evidence outside the Administrative Record are disputed and there\n   is a genuine issue of material fact on these issues, summary judgment is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   proper because the Court for summary judgment purposes must construe such evidence in favor of the non-moving party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-287\">\n   Pl.'s Br. at 13-14 (citations omitted). She does not explain the standard of review under Rule 52 or how Rule 52 better enables this court to review evidence outside the record. Accordingly, the court denies her alternative motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   <strong>\n    3. United of Omaha's Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   In essence, United of Omaha's motion for summary judgment is the converse of Reichard's motion insofar as United of Omaha claims that the court should grant summary judgment in its favor because there are no genuine issues of material fact and it did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in denying Reichard's LTD benefits claim. In addressing all of the arguments raised by Reichard in her motion, the court has addressed the issues raised by United of Omaha in its motion. United of Omaha has shown that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the issue of whether it acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner when it denied Reichard's LTD benefits claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   The court's review of the administrative record in this case shows that there are no genuine issues of material fact that would preclude the entry of summary judgment in this case. More specifically, there are no genuine issues of material fact that would preclude the court from determining that Reichard has not met her burden to establish that United of Omaha's denial of LTD benefits under the Policy was arbitrary and capricious. That is, Reichard has not demonstrated that United of Omaha's failure to follow a claims manual, lack of consideration of medication side effects, failure to address her SSDI award, medical and vocational examinations and reviews, procedural conflict of interest, and lack of consideration of pain and headaches cumulatively show that United of Omaha abused its discretion. Under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review, the court cannot substitute its own judgment for that of United of Omaha and does not find that United of Omaha's LTD benefits denial was without reason, unsupported by substantial evidence, or erroneous as a matter of law. Accordingly, the court will deny Reichard's motion for summary judgment and alternative motion under Rule 52 and grant United of Omaha's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   A separate order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-295\">\n    The court commends the parties for their compilation of the record in this matter and their legal submissions.

At oral argument, United of Omaha stated it was no longer pursuing that argument. To the extent there is any ambiguity to the definition, the court resolves it against United of Omaha's initial interpretation because such a strict definition would disqualify virtually every claimant.

However, as explained in the discussion of the impact of the side effects from her medications, United of Omaha did not abuse its discretion by failing to cite specific complaints in her appeal letter because, by and large, it implicitly addressed her concerns. For example, she suggested that she did not receive records from Dr. Osterman in the review file and that United of Omaha omitted records from Dr. Luchetti.
