Specifically, Commerce relies upon the 2012 VAT Circular that describes the operation of Chinese VAT law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 6-10, 22-26\n   <em>\n    (citing\n   </em>\n   2012 VAT Circular). The 2012 VAT Circular provides several formulae detailing how Chinese VAT is calculated for exported goods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2012 VAT Circular. Two of these formulae provide the basis for Commerce's (1) definition and (2) calculation of irrecoverable VAT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   First, Commerce explains that Article 5.1 of the 2012 VAT Circular provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Tax payable for the current period = output tax for the current period - (input tax for the current period - taxes prohibited from exemption and offset for the current period).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 24\n   <em>\n    (quoting\n   </em>\n   the 2012 VAT Circular at art. 5.1(1) (the \"Tax Payable Formula\") ). In the\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   Commerce clarifies that the term \"irrecoverable VAT\" was intended to describe the \"taxes prohibited from exemption and offset\" amount provided in the above formula.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Second, Article 5.1 of the 2012 VAT Circular provides an additional formula that explains how \"taxes prohibited from exemption and offset\" is calculated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Taxes prohibited from exemption and offset for the current period = FOB of exported goods for the current period x RMB conversion rate of foreign currency\n   x (tax rate applicable to exported goods - tax refund rate for exported goods) - deductions of taxes prohibited from exemption and offset for the current period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12434312\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/269/1316/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 24 (\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   2012 VAT Circular at art. 5.1(1) (the \"Taxes Prohibited from Exemption Formula\") ). The use of \"taxes prohibited from exemption and offset\" in these two formulae sheds light on the source of the apparent inconsistency between Commerce's definition and calculation of irrecoverable VAT. Commerce explains that its definition of irrecoverable VAT (an unrefunded amount of VAT \"paid on inputs and raw materials\") is derived from the Tax Payable Formula in which \"taxes prohibited from exemption and offset\" (aka \"irrecoverable VAT\") are deducted from \"input tax.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 24-25; Tax Payable Formula. Commerce then notes that its calculation of irrecoverable VAT, calculated as \"FOB of exported goods for the current period x (tax rate applicable to exported goods - tax refund rate for exported goods),\" mirrors the calculation of \"taxes prohibited from exemption and offset\" in the Taxes Prohibited from Exemption Formula.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 25; Taxes Prohibited from Exemption Formula. Accordingly, Commerce's definition of irrecoverable VAT describes how \"taxes prohibited from exemption and offset\" is used in the Tax Payable Formula; however, this figure has no direct connection to the amount of input VAT actually assessed on Chinese exported goods.

Commerce did not selectively choose the translation that suited a desired outcome but, rather, considered the record as a whole in deducing the meaning of Shanghai Wells' inconsistent submissions.\"\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 28. Commerce further explained that this accounting code, while assigned slightly different nomenclature in Shanghai Wells' other questionnaire responses\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   , appears to \"describe an irrecoverable tax.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28. Plaintiffs simply fail to demonstrate that Commerce's interpretation of account code X is unreasonable and that the administrative record leads to one, and only one, reasonable interpretation of its meaning and translation. The court sustains as reasonable Commerce's finding that account code X books Shanghai Wells' irrecoverable VAT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Although not persuaded by Plaintiffs' challenge to Commerce's interpretation of Shanghai Wells' questionnaire responses, the court nevertheless has some remaining doubts about the overall reasonableness of Commerce's calculation of irrecoverable VAT. Commerce's analysis of Chinese law certainly helps clarify the relationship between the calculation of irrecoverable VAT and its use within the Chinese VAT system.\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 7-9, 24-26. There is, however, an inherent and lingering issue that Commerce itself acknowledges when it notes that the 2012 VAT Circular \"indicate[s] a link between the input VAT paid and tax paid or refunded.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Although Commerce urges the court not to read this language from the 2012 VAT Circular \"in a way that confuses how the exporter incurs the cost on a transaction level for specific exports,\" Commerce reiterates that the complex rules of the Chinese VAT system confirm a \"link\" between input VAT paid and tax paid or refunded on the aggregate level.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Commerce downplays the relevance of this \"link\" by explaining that Commerce adjusts for irrecoverable VAT at the transaction-specific level rather than on an aggregate level.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9. Commerce further notes that Plaintiffs' alternative methodology for adjusting for irrecoverable VAT, i.e. accounting for input VAT actually paid in the adjustments to EP and CEP, introduces significant distortions to the calculations given that the input VAT figures may include offsets from periods outside of the period of review as well as distortions due to the time lag between the payment of input VAT at production and the subsequent exportation of finished merchandise.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To summarize, Commerce clarified that \"irrecoverable VAT\" refers to \"Taxes prohibited\n   from exemption and offset,\" i.e., an amount of unrefunded tax charged on \"\n   <em>\n    inputs\n   </em>\n   and raw materials.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-10, 24-25 (emphasis added). Commerce further acknowledged that this deduction for \"irrecoverable VAT\" is in some way linked to the amount of\n   <em>\n    input\n   </em>\n   VAT that Shanghai Wells actually pays, but discounts the significance of this link.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. The court is unfortunately still confused and cannot understand how a reasonable mind would conclude that the amount of input tax actually deducted from Shanghai Wells' VAT liability is \"not relevant\" to the adjustment of Shanghai Wells' EP and CEP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Perhaps the phrase \"not relevant\" is causing the problem. Did Commerce instead mean \"not calculable\"? Is the \"link\" between Plaintiffs' input VAT and tax paid or refunded generally not calculable (or knowable) because of the complexity of the Chinese VAT system (meaning it is just not possible)? Or, is it at least theoretically possible to calculate (and account for) the \"link\" but not in this particular case because Plaintiffs have failed to proffer enough information and explanation against a dense and complicated Chinese VAT system to enable Commerce to make the (transaction-specific) adjustment to Plaintiffs' EP and CEP? Or is something else going on? The court therefore must remand this issue again for Commerce to further explain, and reconsider, if appropriate, how its deduction of \"taxes prohibited from exemption and offset\" accounts for an amount of \"input VAT not fully recouped on export sales\" that Shanghai Wells includes in its price for export sales of finished wire hangers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Surrogate Company Financial Statement Selection\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In this, the sixth administrative review, Commerce selected financial statements for calculating surrogate financial ratios from three Thai companies: LS Industries Co. (\"LS Industry\"), Sahasilp Rivet Industrial Co. Ltd. (\"Sahasilp\"), and Thai Mongkol Fasteners Co., Ltd. (\"Mongkol\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Decision Memorandum\n   </em>\n   at 7-10. In\n   <em>\n    Aristocraft\n   </em>\n   the court remanded Commerce's selection of surrogate financial statements for Commerce \"to address reasonably the importance of drawing wire from wire rod as a surrogate company selection criterion.\"\n   <em>\n    Aristocraft\n   </em>\n   , 42 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12434312\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/269/1316/\">\n    269 F.Supp.3d at 1335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On remand, Commerce acknowledged that it prefers \"financial statements from companies that draw wire from wire rod to produce identical or comparable merchandise in order to calculate the surrogate financial ratios of an integrated producer such as Shanghai Wells.\"\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 14. Given that selection criterion, the question for Commerce was whether all three companies or just one, LS Industry, constituted the best available information to use as surrogate companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Commerce noted that it \"did not directly address record evidence purporting to demonstrate that LS Industry drew wire from wire rod, which resulted in an incomplete analysis of the record information.\"\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 17. That evidence is \"six photos of extremely poor quality\" that appeared on the website of LS Industry.\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 19. Plaintiffs argue that the photos contain images that \"obviously resemble\" wire rod coils and wire drawing machinery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Cmts. at 17. The photos, though, have no captions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 31. Commerce, noting its knowledge of \"material and machinery involved in the production of subject merchandise,\" concluded that the \"type of machine is not discernable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. Commerce also noted that \"Shanghai Wells reported that it used a straightening machine to straighten steel wire before it is fed through the hanger forming machine and there is nothing on the record to support the claim that the machine pictured\n   is not, in fact, a straightening machine rather than a wire drawing machine, or any other type of machine.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Commerce also concluded that it could not \"determine whether the material pictured is wire rod or, instead, any number of other products, e.g. steel bar, reinforcing bar, steel strip, or bundles of any other type of coiled materials.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. As a result, Commerce determined \"that the financial statements of LS Industry, Sahasilp, and Thai Mongkol, all represent equally suitable financial statements ... [and a]bsent definitive evidence to the contrary, all three statements represent the best available information on the record of this review for calculating surrogate financial ratios.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs challenge as unreasonable Commerce's conclusion that the three companies \"equally satisfy its selection criteria.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. Plaintiffs, however, do not make the straightforward argument that Commerce's determination is unreasonable because a reasonable mind would have to conclude that the photographs only depict wire rod and wire drawing machinery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-19. Rather, Plaintiffs dismiss Commerce's suggestion that the photographs may depict wire straightening machinery and coiled material other than wire rod as speculation, and argue that Commerce must instead accept Plaintiffs' proffered view that the photographs likely depict wire rod and wire drawing machinery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Plaintiffs, Commerce must accept Plaintiffs' speculative inference about the photographs-that they depict wire drawing machine and wire rod in coils-and reject an alternative, but equally speculative inference-that LS Industry maintains wire straightening machinery and coiled material other than wire rod. The court has no idea which of the two inferences is correct. Both seem plausible. What the court cannot do is direct Commerce to favor Plaintiffs' preferred evidentiary inference over another reasonable inference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mitsubishi Heavy Indus.

This issue ultimately boils down to a problem of proof for Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs could have done much more to remove doubts about the photographs (and undermine any competing inferences). Better quality photos and better authentication would have helped, as would have affidavits from its own operators and fabricators explaining what the photographs depicted.

Without the additional evidentiary proffer, Plaintiffs simply ask too much of the court to wade into fact finding on a sparse record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiffs additionally argue that Commerce unreasonably discounted \"other deficiencies\" in the financial statements of Mongkol and Sahasilp.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Cmts. at 19-21. Plaintiffs note that Sahasilp's \"company profile\" does not list wire rod drawing among its \"Key Manufacturing Process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. Similarly, Plaintiffs observe that Mongkol's website lists various types of machinery but fails to specifically include wire rod drawing machinery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs contend that this absence of evidence indicates that Sahasilp and Mongkol do not even arguably\n   draw wire from wire rod and are accordingly not \"equally suitable\" as surrogate producers of comparable merchandise.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court is not persuaded. Here again Plaintiffs have a problem of proof. Missing is an important evidentiary foundation that companies that draw wire from wire rod would always advertise that fact on their website or list it as a key manufacturing process. Without that foundation on the administrative record, Commerce was able to reasonably conclude that the lack of mention of wire drawing or wire drawing machinery on Mongkol's or Sahasilp's website or online company profile did not provide a sufficient basis to determine whether either company drew wire from wire rod. Accordingly, Commerce found \"that no information on the record demonstrates that any of the potential surrogate financial companies draw wire from wire rod.\"\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The court here cannot muscle aside Commerce and order it to use LS Industry's financial statement alone. Plaintiffs simply failed to establish on the administrative record that LS Industry, and LS Industry alone, was the best available information to use as a surrogate company. Commerce reasonably concluded that \"LS Industry's financial statements are not superior to Sahasilp's or Mongkol's\" and that \"all three financial statements are equally suitable for valuing Shanghai Wells' financial ratios.\"\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 32-33.
