At issue is Defendant U.S. Department of Energy's response to Plaintiff Climate Investigations Center's request for records concerning the funding and development of a clean-coal technology power plant in Mississippi, known as the \"Kemper Project.\" Dissatisfied with Defendant's response, both with respect to the search conducted and the withholdings of portions of responsive records, Plaintiff filed suit in this court, challenging both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The court previously denied the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, concluding that there remained material issues of fact concerning the adequacy of Defendant's search and the appropriateness of its withholdings under two statutory exemptions.

Op. &amp; Order, ECF No. 21 [hereinafter Mem. Op.], the court only summarizes them here. Plaintiff Climate Investigations Center submitted a Freedom of Information (\"FOIA\") request to Defendant Department of Energy in early 2015, seeking information concerning the implementation of certain clean-coal technology at a Mississippi power plant, known as the \"Kemper Project.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Southern Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Mississippi Power Company, are partially responsible for the Kemper Project's development.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Southern Company received a $300 million award from Defendant for the development.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff directed its FOIA request to Defendant's subcomponent, the National Energy Technology Laboratory (\"NETL\"), which oversees the Kemper Project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The request asked for all communications related to the \"development, funding and/or construction and implementation of 'clean coal' technology\" at the Kemper Project, including information regarding the technology developed for use at the plant and the decision to build the plant in Kemper County, Mississippi.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   NETL began to search for responsive documents after receiving the FOIA request,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , but Plaintiff later refined its request to identify six categories of documents from the period beginning January 1, 1998, through December 31, 2011,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. NETL then contacted Defendant's Headquarters (\"DOE Headquarters\"), believing that it would have responsive materials.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In response, DOE Headquarters referred the requests to the Office of Fossil Energy, which it believed was most likely to have the desired records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Office of Fossil Energy conducted manual and electronic searches, and then submitted the results to the Office of Information Resources, which reviewed the records, removed duplicates, and consulted with Southern Company to determine what portions of the responsive material might cause the company harm, if disclosed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Office of Information Resources then redacted those portions that it believed were exempt from disclosure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In total, DOE Headquarters, through the Office of Fossil Energy, turned over 75 records to Plaintiff, some of which contained redactions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In parallel with the Office of Fossil Energy's efforts, NETL began producing responsive records.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Before doing so, however, it consulted with DOE Headquarters about records that pertained to the Office of the Secretary. It also conferred with Southern Company to ascertain how disclosing certain records might\n   adversely affect the company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.

Compl., ECF No. 3. Plaintiff challenged all aspects of Defendant's response to its FOIA request, arguing that Defendant's search for records was inadequate and that its redactions pursuant to statutory exemptions were improper and unsupported.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Both parties moved for summary judgment.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff challenges four aspects of Defendant's response to its FOIA requests: (1) the adequacy of Defendant's search; (2) the withholding of privileged and confidential \"commercial or financial information\" under Exemption 4; (3) the withholding of claimed privileged communications under Exemption 5; and (4) the withholding of names of individuals and other personal information under Exemption 6.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Cross-Mot., Attach. 1, Pl.'s Mem. in Supp., ECF No. 27-1 [hereinafter Pl.'s Mem.]. The court considers each of these challenges in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Adequacy of the Search\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff once more contests the adequacy of Defendant's search for responsive records. In the first round of summary judgment briefing, Plaintiff raised two challenges to Defendant's search: (1) that Defendant should have used different terms when searching the Office of Fossil Energy, and (2) that Defendant should have conducted a separate search of records within the Office of the Secretary, as that office likely held responsive records that would not be captured in the search of the Office of Fossil Energy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Op. at 7. As to the former argument, the court concluded that Defendant had \"employed\n   appropriate search terms\" because they were \"reasonably calculated to capture records responsive to Plaintiff's FOIA Request.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. But as to the latter argument, the court denied summary judgment to both parties, reasoning that Defendant's declarations \"[did] not support its contention that performing a separate search ... would [have been] duplicative of its prior searches.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. The court's determination was based, in part, on the fact that Defendant had produced documents and correspondence that originated in the Office of the Secretary, but had not explained why a search of that Office would have been \"fruitless or redundant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The court identified two means by which Defendant could supplement the record and renew its motion concerning the records search.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. The first option was for Defendant to conduct Plaintiff's desired search of the Office of the Secretary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In the alternative, the court noted that Defendant could \"submit facts explaining: (1) the organizational and record-keeping relationships, if any, among the Office of the Executive Secretariat, Office of the Secretary, NETL, and Office of Fossil Energy; and (2) why NETL's and the Office of Fossil Energy's searches would have reached all responsive records maintained by the Office of the Secretary, such that a separate search is unnecessary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant took the latter approach, opting to supplement the record with additional facts concerning the searches already conducted and Defendant's record-keeping.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Renewed Mot., Attach. 1, Def.'s Mem. of P. &amp; A. in Supp., ECF No. 25-1 [hereinafter Def.'s Mem.], at 6-7. The agency's support comes in the form of a supplemental declaration from Alexander Morris, Defendant's FOIA Officer, who manages all open-records requests sent to DOE Headquarters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Renewed Mot., Second Suppl. Decl. of Alexander C. Morris, ECF No. 25-3 [hereinafter Suppl. Morris. Decl.], \u00b6\u00b6 1-3. In that declaration, Morris says that a separate search of the Office of the Secretary was \"unnecessary and duplicative\" because the search conducted by the Office of Fossil Energy-the \"conduit to the Office of the Secretary\" for the Kemper Project-\"captured any responsive records\" within the Office of the Secretary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17, 26. Morris then proceeds to outline the two routes by which the Office of Fossil Energy\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   would have communicated with the Office of the Secretary about the Kemper Project. Those two routes are an electronic record and tracking system, which is used for formal communications, and email, which is used for informal communications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Morris explains that, as a matter of course, the Secretary's formal correspondence relating to Fossil Energy programs are entered into the Office of Fossil Energy's own electronic records management system. The Office of the Executive Secretariat, within the Office of the Secretary, uses a system called \"eDocs\" to track and maintain the Office of the Secretary's formal correspondence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-14. Specifically, the Office of the Executive Secretariat enters \"Secretarial level actions and information related to [Fossil Energy] programs\" into eDocs; thus, all \"formal correspondence\" between the Office of the Secretary and the Office of Fossil Energy is tracked within that system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. The information in eDocs, in turn, is entered into the Office of Fossil Energy's internal\n   tracking system, \"CorrTrack.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Additionally, correspondence predating the tracking system was manually searched.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. Therefore, Defendant's search of the Office of Fossil Energy's CorrTrack system and the accompanying manual search, according to Morris, would have captured the relevant, formal correspondence within the Office of the Secretary. To belt-and-suspenders the search, Morris states that Defendant also directly searched the Office of the Secretariat's eDocs system \"to ensure all responsive records had been captured by [the Office of Fossil Energy's] searches.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. This search did not produce any \"new\" materials.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The only other way by which the Office of Fossil Energy exchanges information with the Office of the Secretary is by email.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. Emails are considered \"informal\" correspondence, as compared to the formal correspondence logged into CorrTrack.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 7. The Office of Fossil Energy searched the e-mail accounts of \"senior [Fossil Energy] staff\" working on the Southern Company project\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the \"archived email accounts\" of three Fossil Energy officials in response to Plaintiff's FOIA request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Morris Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 20. By electronically searching the Office of Fossil Energy's CorrTrack system and e-mail accounts of senior Fossil Energy staff, Morris states, Defendant searched the \"only two routes to submit information or to receive information from the Office of the Secretary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-26;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Morris notes one more search: that of the Office of History and Heritage Resources, which is located inside the Office of the Secretariat and \"maintains a database with physical records of the former Secretaries of Energy,\" including \"reports, briefing material, and formal communications.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-25. This search of physical records did not yield any responsive records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Notwithstanding this new, detailed information, Plaintiff contends that Defendant's search is inadequate for two reasons. First, Plaintiff contends that Defendant's search of the Office of Fossil Energy did not capture all correspondence on the Kemper Project between Fossil Energy and the Office of the Secretary because a search of the Office of Fossil Energy would capture only \"formal\" correspondence, rather than\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   correspondence, and thus would not include \"short conversational 'informal' emails about any topic, including the subjects of [Plaintiff's] FOIA request.\" Pl.'s Mem. at 6-7. That criticism is misplaced. As explained in Morris's Supplemental Declaration, informal communication with the Office of the Secretary would have been transmitted or received by email with senior staff within the Office of Fossil Energy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Morris Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18. Defendant searched those email accounts.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18, 20. To the extent Plaintiff believes that Defendant's email searches would not have captured all relevant informal correspondence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply in Supp. of Cross-Mot. for Partial Summ. J., ECF No. 31 [hereinafter Pl.'s Second Reply], at 4-5, Defendant's search of the database of physical documents fills that gap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff further insists that Defendant's search of the Office of the Secretary was inadequate because it did not turn up certain types of records. For instance, the search returned no documents concerning the Secretary's visit to the Kemper Project or messages regarding the Project's funding as part of the Department of Energy's budget.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-6 &amp; n.3. The absence of such records does not, however, establish a deficient search. It is not at all surprising that Defendant has not produced\n   records relating to the Secretary of Energy's visit to the Kemper Project, as that visit occurred in November 2013, two years\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the end of the date range of Plaintiff's FOIA request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Op., App. (noting that Plaintiff's FOIA request sought records from the period beginning January 1, 1998, and ending December 31, 2011); Pl.'s Second Reply, App., ECF No. 31-1, at 6-7 (noting that Department of Energy Secretary Moniz toured the Kemper Project's facility on November 8, 2013). Moreover, \"[m]ere speculation that as yet uncovered documents may exist does not undermine the finding that the agency conducted a reasonable search for them.\"\n   <em>\n    SafeCard Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10546712,3488360\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/1197/\">\n    926 F.2d at 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the mere fact that \"there were congressional hearings ... on budget matters,\" yet no records uncovered, does not render the agency's search inadequate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Second Reply at 5-6 &amp; n.3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 7 n.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Second, Plaintiff argues that Defendant's search was inadequate because it did not include two other locations: the Office of General Counsel and the Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 7; Pl.'s Second Reply at 5. Plaintiff has not, however, \"established a sufficient predicate to justify searching\" these locations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Campbell v.

Dunlap, ECF No. 13-3 [hereinafter Dunlap Decl.], \u00b6 48 (stating that, pursuant to Exemption 5 of FOIA, NETL withheld information including \"legal advice sought by NETL staff from ... the Office of the General Counsel at DOE headquarters\"). The clear majority of references to communications with government counsel are with\n   <em>\n    NETL\n   </em>\n   's counsel, not the Office of General Counsel at DOE Headquarters. A one-time reference to the Office of General Counsel, without a more substantial factual predicate, does not merit a search of that entire office.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381288,3668203\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/20/\">\n    164 F.3d at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (providing that an agency need not search every record system, only those that are likely to turn up responsive records). In addition, Plaintiff offers no reason to believe that Congress gave particular attention to the Kemper Project during budget meetings, such that Defendant's Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs is likely to have records. Plaintiff's conjecture alone cannot compel a search of that office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In sum, Defendant's detailed summary of its efforts convinces the court that Defendant's search was \"reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.\"\n   <em>\n    Weisberg v.

Cir. 1989).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In this second round of summary judgment briefing, Defendant presents a far stronger basis for its invocation of Exemption 4. In its supplemental declaration from Ann C. Guy, NETL's FOIA Officer, Defendant sets forth why it believes that companies seeking federal funding might provide it with lower-quality information, or cease pursuing federal funding altogether, should the sensitive business information that those companies provide be made public.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 12-13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Second Suppl. Decl. of Ann C. Guy, ECF No. 25-4 [hereinafter Suppl. Guy Decl.], \u00b6\u00b6 10-20. According to Guy, \"the specificity and accuracy of the information submitted\" in support of applications for federal funding, including the Kemper Project, are \"instrumental to a comprehensive evaluation of the proposal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Guy believes that companies that seek funding \"likely understand that NETL will protect their proprietary information and other information which, if disclosed, could negatively impact their competitiveness for future awards.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Therefore, \"[p]rotecting [companies' sensitive business] information from disclosure to ... competitors is essential to ensuring that [their] proposals contain full and accurate information in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. As Guy sees it, if the information Defendant withheld is disclosed, companies may change their behavior by scaling back the information they provide to NETL or by refraining from pursuing federal funding altogether-both of which could stymie projects that could benefit the country.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For example, disclosure of the redacted portions of the cooperative agreement and its amendments, company software, and cost information \"would likely cause Southern Company, and any other companies with whom DOE may have an interest in partnering in the future, to be less willing to provide DOE with sensitive business information in the future, which ultimately would impact DOE's opportunity to partner with said companies in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. In addition, companies competing for agency funding, Guy states, \"voluntarily provide information beyond the minimum required to enhance their application and increase their likelihood for selection, understanding that NETL will not publicly disclose information provided to it when doing so\" would help their competitors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11 (noting that Southern Company submitted to Defendant information that is \"not available through public sources\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The court has no reservation concluding that Defendant has met its burden to show government harm. Defendant, through Guy's Supplemental Declaration, has set forth why disclosing Southern Company's information, in this instance, would threaten Defendant's ongoing ability to gather information from companies seeking federal funding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Auto Safety v. U.S. Dep't of Treasury\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5902611\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/133/109/#p128\">\n    133 F.Supp.3d 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 128 (D.D.C. 2015). As Guy explains, these applicants may stop applying for federal funding altogether or scale back the information they voluntarily include in their\n   applications-information that goes above and beyond that required but is nevertheless useful to NETL when evaluating proposals. This is a far cry from the tepid and imprecise statement from Southern Company on which Defendant relied during the earlier round of summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ.

Therefore, there is no genuine issue of material fact as to the harm that might flow to the government from disclosure in this instance. In light of Defendant's \"detailed and unchallenged information,\" Defendant is entitled to summary judgment as to the records withheld under Exemption 4.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cavezza v.

Nor would it make sense to impose such a burdensome requirement. The persons most qualified to discuss industry competition and the competitive harm that may befall a company are company officials who know the business and the industry.

NETL relied\n   on the attorney-client privilege to withhold or redact material in five groups of responsive documents: (1) portions of the Site Change Plan, emails and correspondence regarding the Negotiation Memorandum, correspondence with Mississippi Power Company, and other documents including a \"[m]emorandum by Southern Company's counsel discussing Authority to Approve Relocation of Project,\" NETL\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 4-5; (2) \"[e]mails and communications between NETL employees and NETL counsel,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11; (3) communications between NETL staff and NETL counsel regarding tax and other issues,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12; (4) \"[e]mails and communications between NETL counsel, DOE [Headquarters] counsel and management, and Southern Company personnel,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12; and (5) emails with DOE counsel and NETL officials and counsel,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Guy provides additional context about the subject matter of the withheld records and NETL's reasoning for these five withholdings in her Supplemental Declaration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Guy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiff challenges the withholding of \"conversations between Southern Company's counsel and DOE's counsel\" pursuant to the attorney-client privilege, on the ground that the privilege does not protect conversations between an agency attorney and an outside attorney.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 9. This broadly-worded challenge apparently concerns the first and fourth groups of withholdings made by NETL, as those are the only two withholdings, out of the five identified above, in which Defendant's description of the withheld records involve Southern Company counsel.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   NETL\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   DOE Headquarters\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index. The first specific withholding is of \"information showing external deliberations between DOE and Southern Company employees and its counsel regarding the costs involved in [the] changing of the site of the project and modifications and necessary approvals[.]\" NETL\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 4. Guy elaborates, stating that the redactions to emails and the Site Change Plan are \"part of back and forth discussions regarding potential site outcomes and a decision to move the site of Southern's [ ] plant.\" Suppl. Guy Decl. \u00b6 22. Other redactions are to \"emails between counsel for Mississippi Power and Southern Company's counsel relat[ing] to the development of Southern Company's TRIG project.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The other challenged withholding-from the fifth group of produced records-is to \"portions of external communications and emails between NETL counsel and [DOE Headquarters] counsel and Southern Company counsel.\" NETL\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 12. Guy is silent as to this record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Guy Decl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendant's withholding of communications involving Southern Company is improper. The privilege protects only \"confidential communications between\n   <em>\n    an attorney and his client\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Mead Data Cent.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3531381,902110\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/566/242/\">\n    566 F.2d at 252-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the privilege does not apply to communications involving agency personnel, the agency's attorneys,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   a third party-Southern Company's counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3531381,902110\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/566/242/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3531381,902110\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/566/242/\">\n    at 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining the limits of the attorney-client privilege). The inclusion of Southern Company's counsel in such communications renders the privilege inapplicable. Additionally, NETL's and Guy's labeling of the information as \"confidential\" does nothing to bring these records within reach of the attorney-client privilege. While the information may be \"confidential\" in the sense that the exchanges between Defendant and Southern Company counsel were originally shielded from public view, the information does not pertain to legal advice by agency counsel to the agency, which is the relevant inquiry here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Therefore, NETL's invocation of the attorney-client privilege to shield information exchanged with Southern Company is improper. Plaintiff's Motion is granted as to these specific withholdings. Defendant must disclose the four documents withheld under Exemption 5, based upon the attorney-client privilege, listed on pages 4 through 5 of NETL's\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index and the first withholding listed on the same Index at page 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    DOE Headquarters' Withholdings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The court reaches a different conclusion, however, as to the DOE Headquarters' withholding of portions of four email threads.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOE Headquarters\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 5-7, 10-13 (Nos. 10, 11, 15, and 16). As to these materials, Defendant provides context for the records and a sufficient basis for invoking the attorney-client privilege. Specifically, as to each of the withholdings, Morris sets forth the subject matter of the correspondence, the parties to the exchange, and why disclosure would reveal privileged information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Morris Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 44, 48-53, 57-61, 70, 74-78, 82-85. Additionally, Morris explains that all withheld information is confidential.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-52, 58, 60-61, 76-77, 84. And, unlike some of NETL's claimed attorney-client communications, the DOE Headquarters' withholdings do not include outside parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In sum, Defendant has shown that the DOE Headquarters' records withheld based on the attorney-client privilege \"(1) involve[ ] confidential communications between an attorney and his client and (2) relate[ ] to a legal matter for which the client has sought advice.\"\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160009\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/802/185/#p200\">\n    802 F.Supp.2d at 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

NETL's\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index groups these withheld records based on the round of production, rather than by subject matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Per the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index, NETL made attorney-client withholdings in its fourth, eighth, ninth, and tenth productions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NETL\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 5, 10, 11, 13. As to each of those four productions, the Index contains a one-paragraph \"[j]ustification\" for the agency's action. The court previously found these justifications to be vague, however, as they neither made clear that the withheld material \"actually predates an agency decision\" nor \"identif[ied] a single agency action to which the withheld materials contributed.\" Mem. Op. at 21-22. In light of Defendant's failure to \"put forward sufficient information to allow the court to determine whether the deliberative process privilege applies,\" the court denied Defendant's first motion for summary judgment as to these withholdings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   NETL fares no better in this second round. The additional declaration provided by NETL's declarant, Guy, does little to tie the withheld records to specific agency decisions or explain their place in the agency's deliberative process. For starters,\n   Guy addresses only some of the above-listed 21 different documents or groups of documents. Take, for example, the deliberative process withholdings to the documents produced in Defendant's eighth production, which are listed in the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index as: \"funding information,\" \"an informal summary of conference call,\" \"DOE's position on withholding of funds,\" \"comments concerning Environmental Impact Statement,\" and an \"internal memo from NETL's Chair of the CCPI Team.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NETL\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 10. Guy does not discuss these five records or groups of records in her Supplemental Declaration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Guy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-29. Moreover, even when Guy elaborates on withheld material, she does so indiscriminately, making it difficult to discern the role of individual documents in the agency's decision-making. For instance, the 327 pages of \"emails and correspondence ... between DOE [Headquarters] and NETL personnel\" from NETL's ninth production, as described in the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index, concern multiple subjects, including an \"environmental impact statement,\" \"the site change plan,\" \"the record of decision,\" and \"discussions on project costs.\" NETL\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 11. Guy describes these records as containing \"internal deliberations and opinions about the topics DOE needed to resolve before reaching a decision about whether to locate Southern's IGCC plant\" and \"timing and cost issues that DOE needs to resolve before developing a path forward for Southern's IGCC plant.\" Suppl.

Such a catch-all description of over 320 emails is of little help.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Determining the propriety of NETL's assertion of the deliberative process privilege is an insurmountable task on the present record.

While the Circuit does not prescribe a specific format for an agency's justifications of its withholdings, \"[t]he need to describe each withheld document when Exemption 5 is at issue is particularly acute because 'the deliberative process privilege is so dependent upon the individual document and the role it plays in the administrative process.' \"\n   <em>\n    Animal Legal Def.

Here, Defendant's organization of records centered on the timing of the production, not on any identifiable criteria that would situate a defined group of records within the overall decision-making process. That approach does not give the court the information it needs to evaluate the privilege claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   While the court refrains from making any final determinations as to NETL's withholdings at this juncture, the court offers some observations here to steer this case toward resolution. The court begins with Plaintiff's challenge to Defendant's withholding of the Negotiation Memorandum-the only specific objection Plaintiff raises as to Defendant's deliberative process withholdings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   NETL withheld, in full or in part, \"[t]he Negotiation Memorandum and drafts of the Negotiation Memorandum,\" on the grounds that those documents \"reflect the back-and-forth internal deliberations between agency employees regarding what information needs to be included in the meeting\" regarding the relocation of the plant and \"show the differing opinion of the DOE employees on what topics should be discussed.\" Suppl. Guy Decl. \u00b6 25. Plaintiff argues that the withholding of the final Negotiation Memorandum is improper because \"it is a completed document-not predecisional, and not deliberative.\" Pl.'s Mem. at 10 (citing Suppl. Guy Decl. \u00b6 25). As to this argument, it is unclear why Defendant believes that both drafts of the memorandum\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the final memorandum are \"predecisional.\" Indeed, Guy does not assert that all versions of the \"Negotiation Memorandum\" are drafts; in fact, her description suggests just the opposite.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Guy Decl. \u00b6 25 (referring to \"[t]he Negotiation Memorandum\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   drafts of the Negotiation Memorandum\") (emphasis added). The court also does not see any support for Defendant's claim that the final Memorandum is \"deliberative,\" as that term is used in the FOIA context. The fact that the Negotiation Memorandum contains the topics the subcomponent wanted resolved before Defendant made decisions about relocating Southern Company's IGCC plant does not necessarily make it \"predecisional.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787061,1386646\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/854/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Memorandum very well may contain NETL's\n   <em>\n    final\n   </em>\n   decision as to those topics, thereby placing it outside the deliberations process privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Relatedly, Defendant's understanding of Exemption 5 and \"draft\" documents is overbroad. Defendant asserts that the following documents are protected by the privilege: draft responses to DOE Headquarters; a draft memo to DOE Headquarters with mark-ups; the draft letter\n   requesting to modify terms; draft versions of the nondisclosure agreement; and draft waiver conditions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NETL\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 5, 10, 11, 13. Although Guy does not expressly address these items in her Supplemental Declaration, Defendant argues broadly that NETL's withholding of \"documents in draft form\" is permissible because \"[b]y their very nature, draft documents are predecisional in nature.\" Def.'s Mem. at 17. This is a misstatement of the law. \"The District of Columbia Circuit has made clear that simply designating a document as a 'draft' does not automatically make it privileged under the deliberative process privilege.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilderness Soc'y v.

The deliberative process privilege extends \"\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to those documents that ... were 'generated before the adoption of an agency policy' and may 'inaccurately reflect or prematurely disclose the views of the agency, suggesting as agency position that which is as yet only a personal position.' \"\n   <em>\n    Conservation Force v.

Moreover, a document that was \"predecisional at the time it [was] prepared ... can lose that status if it is adopted, formally or informally, as the agency position on an issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Coastal States Gas Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787061,1386646\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/854/\">\n    617 F.2d at 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Guy's declaration does not reflect consideration of these principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Similarly, the agency does not appear to recognize that documents reflecting official policy are not protected, as they are not predecisional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

For example, the record described as \"DOE's position on withholding of funds\" (or a communication containing that position) presumably sets forth Department of Energy policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NETL\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 10. If so, that document is not \"predecisional.\" Similarly, if the document NETL describes as an \"internal memo from NETL's Chair of the CCPI Team\" sets forth a NETL decision or edict or policy that, too, would not be covered by the exemption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NETL\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Finally, to the extent Defendant seeks to withhold records that were shared or created with Southern Company, Exemption 5 does not shield them from disclosure.

But Southern Company is not a consultant.

In the parties' first cross-motions for summary judgment, Plaintiff challenged Defendant's declarations as insufficient to justify the withholdings, at least insofar as Defendant withheld Southern Company employees' names and positions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s First Mem. of P. &amp; A. in Supp. at 12-13 (referring to Southern Company's names and e-mail addresses); Pl.'s Reply Br., ECF No. 20 [hereinafter Pl.'s First Reply], 6 (referring to the redaction of Southern Company employees' names and positions). Defendant, however, argued that Plaintiff's objection \"appears to be moot\" because Plaintiff had obtained the desired information from a public filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Def.'s First Reply 12. That claim rested on a remark from Plaintiff's senior investigator, who stated in a declaration that \"the redacted names also appear in versions of the same documents public[ly] filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3705344,11910721\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/111/168/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing Pl.'s Cross-Mot. for Partial Summ. J., Attach. 2, Decl. of Dan Zegart, ECF No. 15-2). Plaintiff did not directly respond to Defendant's suggestion of mootness. Instead, it asserted that the availability of the withheld information in the publicly available document demonstrated the inappropriateness of Defendant's redactions. Pl.'s First Reply at 7. Based on this back and forth, the court understood Defendant's mootness argument to cover all invocations of Exemption 6 and found that dispute to be moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Op. at 25-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The court now understands that its ruling went too far.

Circuit made clear that an agency's conclusory assertions of privacy interests for a group of individuals will not stand when there are meaningful differences among those individuals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229457,4222558\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/1142/\">\n    787 F.3d at 1148-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At issue in that case was the Bureau of Prisons' redaction of names and other personal identifying information of individuals who had filed claims against the agency.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229457,4222558\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/1142/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229457,4222558\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/1142/\">\n    at 1147-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In explaining its withholdings,\n   the Bureau of Prisons \"lump[ed] the privacy interests of all claimants and any perpetrator or witness ... into categories based on the\n   <em>\n    type\n   </em>\n   of document in which the individual's information appears.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229457,4222558\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/1142/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229457,4222558\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/1142/\">\n    at 1149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This \"categorical approach\" was improper, the court held, because it made no distinction among individuals with a \"wide range of claims covering various degrees of privacy interests.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229457,4222558\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/1142/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229457,4222558\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/1142/\">\n    at 1150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The same is true here. Defendant has not, for example, shown why \"key officials\" for Southern Company, a publicly-traded energy corporation, have the same or similar \"substantial\" privacy interests as, say, lower-level Southern Company employees and Kemper Project subcontractors. A categorical approach can be appropriate. But Defendant must explain the privacy interests at stake as to each appropriately categorized group of individuals whose names and identifying information it has withheld.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073721,3665058\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/208/\">\n    726 F.3d at 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   There is one more basis for denying Defendant's Motion as to these withholdings: Defendant has not addressed the private interest asserted by Plaintiff. As noted, if the government establishes a substantial privacy interest in the withheld records, then the court must weigh that interest against the public's interest in the disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lepelletier\n   </em>\n   , 164 F.3d at 46. Here, Plaintiff asserts a public interest in knowing \"who is responsible for using and managing government funds.\" Pl.'s Mem. at 11. In any subsequent summary judgment motion, Defendant will have to explain why this claimed public interest is not sufficient to overcome the asserted substantial interest in privacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Accordingly, the court denies the parties' Motions with respect to the Exemption 6 withholding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court grants in part and denies in part Defendant's Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment and Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. In sum:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   1. Plaintiff's Motion is granted as to the documents shared with or created by Southern Company, which Defendant withheld under Exemption 5 based on the attorney-client privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   2. Defendant's Motion is granted as to: (a) the adequacy of the search; (b) the withholdings made under Exemption 4; (c) the remaining withholdings under Exemption 5 pursuant to the attorney-client privilege; and (d) the DOE Headquarters' Exemption 5 withholdings under the deliberative process privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   3.
