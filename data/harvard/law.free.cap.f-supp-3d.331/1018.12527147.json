Cynthia Bashant, United States District Judge\n   This matter is before the Court on notice to Plaintiffs Michael Pemberton and Sandra Collins-Pemberton (the \"Pembertons\") of a possible Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of the claims raised in the First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"). (ECF No. 53.) The Pembertons have filed a response (ECF No. 54), Defendant Nationstar Mortgage LLC (\"Nationstar\") has opposed the response (ECF No. 55), and the Pembertons have replied (ECF No. 60). The parties appeared before the Court on June 7, 2018 for oral argument and the case was submitted. (ECF No. 69.) The matter is ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Overview\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case involves pressing questions about the scope of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6050H, a federal statute which requires an individual who receives at least $600 in home mortgage interest payments during a calendar year to report the amount of interest received to the IRS and the individual who paid the interest. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6050H(a), (d). The fundamental dispute between the parties is whether Section 6050H requires Nationstar to report deferred interest payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2005, the Pembertons obtained a home mortgage loan which permitted them to defer mortgage interest for payment at a later date and added that deferred interest to principal. The Pembertons deferred interest during the earlier years of their loan, which caused the outstanding principal on their loan to increase above the original amount. In 2013, Nationstar became the Pembertons' loan servicer and received mortgage payments from them, which Nationstar applied to interest and principal due on the loan. Thereafter, Nationstar respectively provided the IRS and the Pembertons with Forms 1098, which reported the Pembertons' payments on interest and principal for 2013. The amount of interest reported did not reflect deferred interest, which the Pembertons contend violated Section 6050H.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Federal courts have proceeded with caution in addressing challenges to mortgage lender and servicer Section 6050H reporting, like the challenge the Pembertons raise, even when those challenges present familiar state law claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is because \"[n]either \u00a7 6050H nor its implementing regulations provide explicit direction to recipients on how, whether\n   and when to report capitalized interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Strugala v.

The Pembertons' Loan and 2013 Form 1098 From Nationstar\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Pembertons are California homeowners who obtained an Option ARM mortgage loan in 2005, the terms of which provided an option to make a monthly interest payment less than the full amount due. Under this option, the monthly interest the Pembertons did not pay was added to the principal amount of their loan and treated as principal for the purposes of the loan. When Nationstar began servicing their loan in July 2013, the Pembertons' loan balance was $7,575.41 above the original balance, an amount which the Pembertons allege was charged as interest in the earlier years of their loan but not paid,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   deferred interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Nationstar provided the Pembertons with a Form 1098 showing the amount of mortgage interest it received from them during the 2013 tax year. According to the Pembertons, the amount reported did not account for deferred interest payments despite the presence of deferred interest. The Pembertons allege that interest does not lose its character as interest and so Nationstar was required to apply their payments to retirement of deferred interest before ever applying such payments to principal. When the Pembertons realized the interest amount reported in their Form 1098 did not account for deferred interest payments, they brought the issue to Nationstar's attention. Nationstar contended that the Pembertons had not deferred interest while it serviced their loan and that it had not received any previously deferred interest amounts from the Pembertons' prior servicer. Nationstar did not issue the Pembertons a revised Form 1098 that accounted for deferred interest payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Because the IRS allegedly maintains a policy of rejecting taxpayer attempts to\n   seek a tax deduction for mortgage interest payments higher than the amount reported on a Form 1098, the Pembertons allege that Nationstar's refusal to provide a revised Form 1098 harmed them. The Pembertons relied on the interest amount stated in their 2013 Form 1098 when they filed their taxes, and received a smaller mortgage interest deduction for 2013 than they would have if Nationstar had reported deferred interest payments. The Pembertons sue to recover the damages allegedly caused by Nationstar and to require Nationstar to report deferred interest payments in the Forms 1098 it issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Procedural Posture\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Pembertons initially brought suit against Nationstar for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, negligence, California's unfair competition law, and directly under Section 6050H. (ECF No. 1.) Nationstar moved to dismiss the original complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), which the parties fully briefed. (ECF Nos. 11, 15, 16.) In resolving that motion, the Court dismissed the Pembertons' claim brought directly under Section 6050H on the ground that there is no federal private right of action under the statute. (ECF No. 17.) Without otherwise addressing the merits, the Court imposed a primary jurisdiction stay, reasoning that the Pembertons' claims raised a matter of \"first impression\" regarding whether Section 6050H requires the reporting of deferred interest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a result of the stay, the Court deferred consideration of the Pembertons' state law claims to permit the IRS to weigh in on the scope of Section 6050H in the first instance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During the two-year duration of the stay, the Pembertons submitted status reports to advise the Court of any IRS developments. (ECF Nos. 18, 30.) The reports did not reveal any IRS actions that would help resolve the Pembertons' claims in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In April 2017, the Court dismissed the original complaint when the Pembertons conceded that the complaint failed to show Article III standing in view of the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Bank of America, N.A.\n   </em>\n   , 679 Fed. App'x 549 (9th Cir. 2017). (ECF Nos. 39, 42.) The Pembertons subsequently filed the First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"). (ECF No. 43.) After Nationstar moved to dismiss for lack of Article III standing (ECF No. 47), the Court held that the Pembertons have standing to assert their state law claims and declined to impose another primary jurisdiction stay. (ECF No. 53.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court also provided notice to the Pembertons of a potential Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of their claims and ordered the parties to brief once more the claims' legal sufficiency.

Cal. 2015) (applying the \"plain and ordinary meaning\" to a term because it \"is not defined in the policy\"). As the Court discusses herein, the Pembertons' contract expressly defines the terms \"interest\" and \"principal.\" Thus, the Court need not and cannot look beyond the contract to ascertain their meaning for the purposes of the Pembertons' breach of contract claim. Accordingly, the Court rejects the Pembertons' claim that Section 6050H is an implied contractual term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Pembertons Cannot Plausibly Plead a Breach of the Allocation Provisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Pembertons also argue that they have stated a breach of contract claim based on the allocation provisions of their contract. (ECF No. 54 at 8, 28.) The allocation provisions require that Nationstar apply the Pembertons' payments to interest before principal. (FAC Ex. A at 2.) The specific allegations set forth as part of the Pembertons' breach of contract claim do not allege that Nationstar breached these provisions. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 42-46.) The Court thus construes the Pembertons' argument as a request for leave to amend the FAC to plead a claim on this basis.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lennar Mare Island, LLC v. Steadfast Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196342\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/139/1141/#p1162\">\n    139 F.Supp.3d 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1162 (E.D. Cal. 2015) (construing argument raised in legal memorandum in response to motion to dismiss as request for leave to amend). The Court finds that amendment on this basis would be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The starting point for the Court is the allocation provision of the Pembertons' Note and the conduct alleged in the FAC. Section 3(A) of the Pembertons' Note provides that \"[e]ach monthly payment ... will be applied to interest before Principal.\" (FAC Ex. A at 2.) By its terms, the Note identifies only two categories for payment allocation: interest and principal. There is no separate category for \"deferred interest.\" Thus, the Pembertons must be able to plausibly allege that Nationstar's treatment of deferred interest violated the Note's allocation between interest and principal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Pembertons attempt to allege a violation of the allocation provision by identifying the deferred interest on their loan. They allege that $7,575.41 of their \"loan balance\" was deferred interest at the time Nationstar took over their mortgage loan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) Although they made all payments to Nationstar due under their Note in 2013-an amount of $12,097.80-the 2013 Form 1098 they received from Nationstar reflected $4,197.66 in payments of principal and $7,302.06 in interest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.) The Pembertons contend that these reported amounts reflect a \"method\" of calculating mortgage interest that is \"wrong\" because it \"assumes that the entire loan balance constitutes principal and fails to recognize that interest that was previously deferred does not lose its character as interest[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12; ECF No. 60 at 2.) Central to the Pembertons' allocation theory is their allegation that interest \"does not lose its character as interest.\" (FAC \u00b6 12.) Assuming that premise, the Pembertons allege that Nationstar violated the allocation provision by not crediting payments toward retiring all deferred interest before crediting any payments to principal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 54 at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Pembertons' allocation theory is implausible because multiple provisions of\n   the Note expressly treat deferred interest as principal, which in turn affects how payments are allocated under the contract. The Note contains multiple admonitions that principal due under the Note may increase over the amount originally borrowed. The Note begins with a clear warning that \"THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT TO REPAY COULD BE GREATER THAN THE AMOUNT ORIGINALLY BORROWED ...\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. A. at 1.) The first provision of the Pembertons' Note, titled \"Borrower's promise to pay,\" incorporates the substance of this warning into the Pembertons' contractual promise. Under that provision, the Pembertons specifically agreed that \"[t]he Principal amount may increase\n   <em>\n    as provided under the terms of this Note\n   </em>\n   ...\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1 (emphasis added).) The Note thus leaves no surprise that principal may increase under its terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Pembertons' Note further specifies precisely\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   the principal amount of the Note would increase: through deferment of interest. Specifically, through the Pembertons' exercise of their option to make a \"minimum payment\" \"not sufficient to cover the amount of interest due,\" resulting in negative amortization. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3(C).) Section 3(E), titled \"Additions to my Unpaid Principal,\" expressly discusses how exercising this option would affect principal. The Section provides that \"for each month that my monthly payment is less than the interest portion, the Note Holder will subtract the amount of my monthly payment from the amount of the interest portion and\n   <em>\n    will add the difference to my unpaid Principal\n   </em>\n   ...\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3(E) (emphasis added).) Section 3(E) further states that \"interest will accrue on the amount of this difference at the interest rate required by Section 2,\" which in turn, sets the interest rate for \"unpaid Principal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 2(A); 3(E).) Section 3(E) thus unambiguously adds deferred interest to unpaid principal to be treated, for the purposes of the payments due under the Note, as payments on principal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Based on these unambiguous provisions, the Pembertons cannot plausibly plead that Nationstar breached the Note's \"allocation formula\" by allocating the Pembertons' payments in the manner reflected on their 2013 Form 1098. (ECF No. 54 at 9.) As the Pembertons concede, they \"elected,\n   <em>\n    pursuant to their note\n   </em>\n   , to defer payment of some of their interest that was due for a given month,\" and that such interest \"was capitalized.\" (ECF No. 54 at 2 n.3; (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 5.) In accordance with the Note's treatment of deferred interest as principal, the principal amount increased in the amount of interest the Pembertons' deferred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, the Pembertons allege that the amount of their loan balance in excess of the original principal is their deferred interest. (FAC \u00b6 9.) When the Pembertons' deferred interest became principal under the Note, it became principal for the purposes of the Note's allocation provision as well. In accordance with the Note's identification of only interest and principal as the relevant categories for payment allocation, Nationstar appropriately treated deferred interest as the latter. Nationstar's Form 1098 reporting in turn merely reflected Nationstar's authorized application of the Pembertons'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   payments. The Pembertons therefore cannot plausibly allege a breach of the Note's allocation provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Ignoring the Note, the Pembertons direct the Court to the allocation provision of their deed of trust instead. (ECF No. 54 at 8-9, 28.) Although they are \"not in possession of their deed of trust,\" the Pembertons \"are prepared to allege\" that it contains an allocation provision similar to the one in the\n   <em>\n    Rovai\n   </em>\n   case because both loans originated with First Magnus Financial Corporation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 (citing\n   <em>\n    Rovai\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-cv-1738, ECF No. 1-1 at 5).) The allocation provision in the\n   <em>\n    Rovai\n   </em>\n   deed of trust appears under the section \"Uniform Covenants\" and is titled \"Application of Payments or Proceeds.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It reads in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-55\">\n   Except as otherwise described in this Section 2, all payments accepted and applied by Lender shall be applied in the following order of priority: (a) interest due under the Note; (b) principal due under the Note; (c) amounts due under Section 3 [funds for escrow items]. Such payments shall be applied to each Periodic Payment in the order in which it became due.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Rovai\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-cv-1738, ECF No. 39, Ex. A at 5.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Even assuming that the terms of the Pembertons' deed of trust are identical or substantially similar to those in the\n   <em>\n    Rovai\n   </em>\n   case, the Pembertons' attempt to save their breach of contract claim by shifting to its allocation provision is unavailing. The Pembertons' breach of contract claim concerns how Nationstar allocated payments with respect to deferred interest. As the Pembertons concede, the Note permitted them to defer interest otherwise due. (FAC \u00b6 5; ECF No. 54 at 2 n.3.) It is the Note which specifies the treatment of deferred interest as principal. (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   FAC Ex. A.) The Pembertons offer no explanation as to how the allocation provision in their deed of trust-a document whose terms do not even identify \"deferred interest\" or \"additions to unpaid Principal\" (in the Note's language)-overcomes, controls, or otherwise limits the meaning of the specific provisions in the Note dealing with deferred interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Nor can they. The Note's specific terms necessarily qualify the allocation provision in the deed of trust.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pecarovich v. Allstate Ins.

The Pembertons' argument that Nationstar's \"method\" of calculating interest is \"wrong\" because interest \"does not loses its character as interest\" substantively derives from tax law, not from their contract with Nationstar. (FAC \u00b6 12.) In fact, the\n   Pembertons argue that \"[e]ven in the absence of an allocation agreement, the law presumes that payments on a note are allocable to retiring interest before retiring principal.\" (ECF No. 54 at 8-9.) Central to that argument is the notion that the Pembertons' deferred interest is interest\n   <em>\n    for tax purposes.\n   </em>\n   For example, the Pembertons rely on\n   <em>\n    Old Colony Railroad Company v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5718385\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/284/552/#p561\">\n    284 U.S. 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 561,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5718385\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/284/552/#p561\">\n    52 S.Ct. 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5718385\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/284/552/#p561\">\n    76 L.Ed. 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1932), to assert that the term \"interest\" means \"the amount which one has contracted to pay for the use of borrowed money.\" They argue that their deferred interest satisfies this meaning. They further point to a Tax Court case which determined that although a contract treated \"defaulted interest\" as principal, such interest \"d[id] not become principal for tax purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Motel Corp. v.

Implicit in the Pembertons' argument is that Nationstar's contractual treatment of deferred interest cannot change what counts as interest for tax purposes. (ECF No. 54 at 5) (\"Just as the laws of physics prevent alchemists from transforming lead into gold, well-established tax law prevents transforming interest into principal based on the time of repayment.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Even if the Pembertons are right that deferred interest qualifies as interest for tax purposes, the claim before the Court is one for breach of contract. The terms of the Pembertons' contract plainly treat deferred interest as principal and authorize Nationstar to allocate the Pembertons' payments accordingly. Concluding otherwise is possible only on the assumption that Section 6050H is a term of the Pembertons' contract-an assumption that finds no support in the contract. Accordingly, the Pembertons cannot allege a claim under the allocation provisions and the breach of contract claim is dismissed with prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foman v.

They allege that the covenant imposes duties on Nationstar \"not to conceal and/or fully and unambiguously disclose to Plaintiffs ... that the way it was treating 'deferred interest' payments was against [their] interests and contrary to established tax law.\" (FAC \u00b6 48.) Nationstar allegedly breached the covenant when it failed to report to the IRS deferred interest payments it received from the Pembertons. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.) The Pembertons further allege that Nationstar had a duty to research their contentions that it had failed to accurately report their interest payments and further breached the covenant when it failed to issue revised a Form 1098 to the Pembertons after receiving their complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Nationstar argues that the Pembertons have failed to allege any specific contractual provision with which Nationstar interfered, nor can they plausibly do so.

The Court agrees with Nationstar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   To plead a breach of the implied covenant, a plaintiff must allege: (1) the parties entered into a contract; (2) the plaintiff fulfilled his or her obligations under the contract; (3) the defendant unfairly interfered with the plaintiff's rights to receive the benefits of the contract; and (4) the plaintiff was harmed by the defendant's conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosenfeld v.

(ECF No. 54 at 28.) The Court does not doubt that the misrepresentations to which the Pembertons refer is that the interest amount Nationstar reports in Forms 1098 does not include deferred interest payments. The Court has already rejected as implausible the Pembertons' allegations that such interest amounts were misrepresentations when made in its analysis of the Pembertons' common law fraud claim. Although a fraudulent prong claim \"is distinct from common law fraud and does not require a plaintiff to plead and prove the elements of a tort,\" \"courts have been unwilling to impose liability under the fraudulent prong of the UCL\" when \"a defendant lacked knowledge of the facts that rendered its representations misleading at the time it made the representations.\"\n    <em>\n     Kowalsky v.

Cal. July 24, 2008) (finding UCL fraudulent prong claim implausible when studies relied on by plaintiff to show falsity of representations were published after the defendant's statements at issue in case). For the reasons set forth in the Court's analysis of the Pembertons' fraud claim, the Court concludes that the Pembertons cannot plausibly allege that Nationstar made a false representation to them when it issued their 2013 Form 1098 and dismisses with prejudice the Pembertons' UCL fraudulent prong claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    <strong>\n     2.

(FAC \u00b6 60.) The Pembertons in turn argue that they have stated a UCL claim under the unlawful prong because Nationstar violated Section 6050H by not reporting deferred interest payments, as shown by the Pembertons' construction of Section 6050H. (ECF No. 54 at 25.) Nationstar contends that that \"nothing in [S]ection 6050H addresses whether deferred interest must be included in the amounts reported\" in a Form 1098. (ECF No. 55 at 8, 29.) Nationstar therefore argues that the Pembertons have failed to satisfy the \"unlawful\" aspect of an unlawful prong claim because it did not violate Section 6050H.

Nationstar has never argued that reporting deferred interest payments would impose any meaningful burden on it. At oral argument, it was suggested that reporting deferred interest may be as simple as establishing a computer program that tracks deferred interest and reporting those numbers to the IRS and individuals like the Pembertons. Accordingly, the Court cannot find a meritorious defense of Nationstar's practice at this stage.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Backus v.

First, while Nationstar points to the contract as permitting it to treat deferred interest as\n    principal, no party disputes that the contract does not address Nationstar's reporting of deferred interest for tax purposes. (FAC \u00b6 43; ECF No. 55 at 16-17 (\"The note does not mention Forms 1098. It does not mention the mortgage interest deduction.\").) Respecting the distinction between what is interest and principal for contractual purposes as opposed to tax purposes, the Court is not persuaded that the former makes implausible an unfair prong claim premised on the latter. Second, Nationstar contends that nothing in Section 6050H or its implementing regulations requires reporting of deferred interest. However, this contention carries little weight for the Court because Nationstar does not argue that deferred home mortgage interest is not deductible as a general matter or in the Pembertons' case, or that Nationstar is prohibited from reporting deferred interest. Accordingly, the Court finds that the Pembertons have stated an unfair prong claim based on the balancing test.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    <strong>\n     4. UCL Abstention Is Not Warranted\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Nationstar argues that if the Court finds that the Pembertons have stated a UCL claim, the Court should nevertheless abstain from adjudication due to the IRS's administration of the federal tax scheme.

The Court declines to do so because abstention is not warranted on the unfair prong claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Arising from the equitable nature of the injunction and restitution remedies available under the UCL is a court's discretion to abstain from employing these remedies.\n    <em>\n     Alvarado v.

The allegations show that Nationstar allegedly failed (1) to accurately report the interest it received from the Pembertons during the calendar year in accordance with Section 6050H and, relatedly, (2) to correct any mistakes on the Form 1098 it provided \"as soon as possible after determining that a wrong amount\n    had been reported.\" (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 82-83.)

Alleged Duty of Care In Reporting\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    The Pembertons argue that a duty exists because Section 6050H requires an interest recipient to report interest payment information to the interest payor, as opposed to just the IRS. (ECF No. 54 at 22.) They further argue that the\n    <em>\n     Biakanja\n    </em>\n    factors support a duty because: (1) the transaction,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , provision of a Form 1098 and calculation of the amounts reported therein, was intended to affect them, (2) they have no input whatsoever in how Nationstar reports interest in a Form 1098, (3) borrowers, tax preparers and the IRS all rely on the Forms 1098, (4) there is a \"dollar for dollar\" connection between the amount of misreported interest and their injury, (5) Nationstar has moral blame as a \"sophisticated financial institution whose very business it is to correctly service loans,\" and (6) the policy of preventing future harm favors them because Nationstar can prevent the harm to the Pembertons by simply changing its reporting policy. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 24-25.) For its part, Nationstar argues that \"[a] lender owes its borrower no duty with respect to the borrower's tax obligations\" and, in this instance, an information return issuer \"owes a duty only to the IRS, not the taxpayer.\" (ECF No. 55 at 26.) Nationstar makes no other argument regarding the\n    <em>\n     Biakanja\n    </em>\n    factors, but instead asserts that the lack of a federal right of action under Section 6050H forecloses the Pembertons' negligence claim. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 27.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    After completion of the parties' briefing in this case, one district court dismissed with prejudice a negligence claim concerning Section 6050H reporting. Applying the\n    <em>\n     Biakanja\n    </em>\n    factors, the court determined that the defendant bank's issuance of a Form 1098 is \"for its own benefit, to fulfill its own statutory obligations.\"\n    <em>\n     Neely v.

The court then determined that the foreseeability of harm was \"remote\" because a taxpayer has an \"independent duty to keep records of his interest payments\" under IRS Revenue Ruling 70-647, which attenuated the relationship between the plaintiff's injury and the alleged misreporting.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"281\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20846\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (citing IRS Rev.

However, the allegations show that the injury the Pembertons allege-which assumes that the IRS rejects attempts by taxpayers to claim a higher deduction than the amount reported on a Form 1098-could easily be prevented by Nationstar merely reporting deferred interest. Accordingly, the Pembertons' allegations are sufficient to show a duty of care at the pleading stage.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    As a final issue on the duty alleged to arise from Section 6050H, Nationstar relies on\n    <em>\n     Sierra-Bay\n    </em>\n    to argue that California law does not permit the Pembertons to sue in negligence because Section 6050H lacks a private cause of action.

The Court has noted that Nationstar concedes it does not raise a preemption argument at this stage and the Court declines to undertake such an analysis now.

This duty is related to the duty of care concerning Nationstar's initial Section 6050H reporting, but it separately arises from how Nationstar allegedly investigated and responded to the Pembertons' complaint. Nationstar makes no argument that a duty of care cannot arise from this conduct. (ECF No. 55 at 25-29 (not addressing the issue).)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    The Pembertons allege they brought to Nationstar's attention its alleged failure to report deferred interest payments in their 2013 Form 1098 and requested a revised Form 1098. (FAC \u00b6 15.) Nationstar acknowledged the Pembertons' complaint and referred it to the \"Research Department.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    , Ex. D.) Nationstar subsequently responded to the Pembertons on March 27, 2017-a response which expressly acknowledged that it concerned Form 1098 reporting. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 16, Ex. E) (\"This is in response to your request received March 3, 2014 regarding the 2013 Mortgage Interest Statement Form (Form 1098).\") Nationstar did not contend that deferred interest is not deductible or that it could not report deferred interest amounts in a Form 1098. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 16, Ex. E.) Rather, Nationstar rejected the Pembertons' claim on the grounds that: (1) \"[t]here was [sic] no deferred amounts or negative amortization on your loan for the period of time that Nationstar has been the servicer\" and (2) \"we (sic) were not provided with any previously deferred interest amounts from the prior servicer nor is there any way for us to calculate amounts prior to when we acquired your loan.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 16, Ex. E.) The Pembertons challenge Nationstar's investigation into their complaint by alleging that they were \"easily able\" to obtain their payment history from their prior loan servicer. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 17.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    Applying the\n    <em>\n     Biakanja\n    </em>\n    factors to these allegations, the Court finds that the Pembertons have adequately alleged a separate duty. First, Nationstar's investigation of the Pembertons' complaint and response was intended to affect them because it was expressly directed to the Pembertons and impacted whether they could amend their tax return.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Dougherty v. Bank of Am., N.A.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355272\" index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/177/1230/#p1258\">\n     177 F.Supp.3d 1230\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1258 (E.D. Cal. 2016) (defendant bank's and loan servicer's efforts to assist plaintiff were intended to affect plaintiff because the result of those efforts would affect plaintiff).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    Second, although the Pembertons expressly told Nationstar the basis for their\n    complaint, Nationstar refused to provide the Pembertons with a revised Form 1098. The bases of Nationstar's refusal, however, run contrary to how deferred interest works. First, the fact that the Pembertons did not defer interest while Nationstar was their servicer cannot provide a basis for Nationstar's refusal to account for such interest because deferred interest is paid at a later date. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 4, 12.) Second, Nationstar's allegation that it was not provided deferred interest amounts from the prior servicer cannot be squared with the Pembertons' allegations that they were able to obtain such information and that their overall loan balance was greater than the original amount borrowed. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 9, 17.) The existence of deferred interest would also have been readily apparent from a comparison of the outstanding principal with the original principal. Due to Nationstar's refusal, the Pembertons allege that they have been unable to correctly state their taxes or seek a higher interest deduction. (FAC \u00b6 22.) This alleged conduct shows a high degree of certainty that the Pembertons suffered harm that was foreseeable and closely connected with Nationstar's conduct.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Gerbery v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\n    </em>\n    , No. 13-CV-614-MMA(DHB),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"309\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203946065\">\n     2013 WL 3946065\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *12 (S.D.

Accordingly, the Court concludes that the second through fourth\n    <em>\n     Biakanja\n    </em>\n    factors weigh in favor of a duty.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    Nationstar's moral blame is also greater with respect to the Pembertons' allegations on this issue given its role. Nationstar purchased the Pembertons' loan from a different servicer, services their loan, undertook an investigation into the Pembertons' complaint, and, based on the allegations, had the discretion regarding whether to issue a revised Form 1098.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Gerbery\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203946065\">\n     2013 WL 3946065\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *12. The policy of preventing future harm is particularly compelling. The Pembertons' allegations show that borrowers who have deferred interest and whose loans Nationstar services face the risk of future harm, even when they expressly inform Nationstar regarding its lack of reporting deferred interest. Nationstar acknowledges that loan servicers have \"divergent practices regarding the reporting of capitalized interest.\" (ECF No. 55 at 10.) At oral argument, it became clear that some loan servicers and banks do in fact report deferred interest, even in the absence of clear guidance from the IRS about whether and when to do so. In this context, the Pembertons' allegations counsel that the policy of preventing future harm points toward a duty. Accordingly, the Court finds that the\n    <em>\n     Biakanja\n    </em>\n    factors support finding a duty of care on this conduct.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    <strong>\n     F. The Request for Declaratory Relief Is Subject to Dismissal\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    The Pembertons' fifth cause of action is for a declaratory judgment to \"resolve the issue as to whether Nationstar is correctly reporting Class Members' mortgage interest payments on Form[s] 1098[ ] and whether Nationstar should be required to provide corrected [Forms 1098] to the Class Members for all years in which its policies did not conform to law.\" (FAC \u00b6 66.) Nationstar contends that the Declaratory Judgment Act and the Anti-Injunction Act bar the Pembertons' claim\n    for declaratory relief. (ECF No. 55 at 32.)

The \"Common Law Exclusive Enforcement Doctrine\" Does Not Exist, Nor Does It Warrant Dismissal\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    As a final matter, the Court addresses Nationstar's \"common law exclusive enforcement doctrine\" argument. Nationstar argues that the Pembertons' state law claims are \"barred by the common-law doctrine of exclusive enforcement.\" (ECF No. 55 at 5, 10-16.)\n    <footnotemark>\n     26\n    </footnotemark>\n    According to Nationstar, Congress intended that the IRS would have the \"exclusive\" power to enforce Section 6050H and permitting the Pembertons' claims to proceed would interfere with that power. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 2.) In response, the Pembertons argue that Nationstar's argument is based on a doctrine that does not exist and confuses the question whether there is a federal private right of action under Section 6050H with whether a violation of the statute can be a predicate for state law claims. (ECF No. 54 at 11, ECF No. 60 at 3.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    Nationstar's reliance on the \"exclusive enforcement doctrine\" stems from the district court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Smith v. Bank of America, N.A.\n    </em>\n    , No. 14-cv-6668-DSF(PLA),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"332\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2012979198\">\n     2015 WL 12979198\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (C.D. Cal. Feb. 3, 2015), which was vacated and remanded by the Ninth Circuit, 679 Fed. App'x 549, 550 (9th Cir. 2017). In ruling on Bank of America's initial motion to dismiss, the\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    court determined that the plaintiffs sought to enforce a statute that does not create a private right of action and \"falls within the IRS's comprehensive enforcement and regulatory scheme.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *3. The\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    court identified five \"factors\" as ones that courts have considered to determine whether \"an agency possesses exclusive authority to enforce a statute or claim\": \"(1) whether the statute underlying the plaintiff's claim provides for a private right of action; (2) whether the regulatory scheme includes an administrative enforcement mechanism; (3) whether the plaintiff could obtain administrative relief directly from the agency; (4) whether administrative decisions are judicially reviewable; and (5) whether the agency administers and enforces the law on which the defendant's purported liability is based.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    The\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    court found that the plaintiffs failed each of these factors. Nationstar faults the Pembertons for failing to distinguish their case from the vacated\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    opinion and its \"exclusive enforcement doctrine\" analysis. (ECF No. 55 at 15.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    This Court can ascertain no \"exclusive enforcement doctrine\" which mandates dismissal of the Pembertons' state law claims. What Nationstar dubs as the \"common law\n    exclusive enforcement doctrine\" is in fact familiar inquiries this Court has already undertaken and determined do not preclude the Pembertons' state law claims. For example, the first factor the\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    court identified was \"whether the statute underlying the plaintiffs' claims provides for a private cause of action.\"\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"333\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2012979198\">\n     2015 WL 12979198\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *3.

This Court has already determined that Section 6050H lacks a private cause of action and that the Pembertons may nevertheless be able to assert common law theories of liability. (ECF No. 17.) Although several of the Pembertons' claims are legally insufficient, that is an issue separate from whether the claims may be asserted at all.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    The remaining four factors of the \"exclusive enforcement doctrine\" concern the extent and nature of a federal administrative scheme and do not mandate dismissal. Like Bank of America in the\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    case, Nationstar previously asserted that the IRS has \"exclusive jurisdiction\" over the issues raised in this case. (ECF No. 11 at 12-13.) Although the Court did not explicitly address the argument, the Court suggested that \"[i]t is possible that the Form[s] 1098[ ], if inaccurate, are challengeable with the IRS or under a common law theory[.]\" (ECF No. 17 at 4.) That suggestion necessarily rejected Nationstar's exclusive jurisdiction argument. Likewise, this Court's imposition of a primary jurisdiction stay forecloses the argument that the IRS is the \"exclusive\" authority to address the Pembertons' claims. The primary jurisdiction doctrine \"is a prudential doctrine under which courts may, under appropriate circumstances, determine that\n    <em>\n     initial\n    </em>\n    decisionmaking responsibility should be performed by the relevant agency rather than the courts.\"\n    <em>\n     Syntek Semiconductor Co. v.

The doctrine does not \"implicate[ ] the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11352810\" index=\"343\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/307/775/#p780\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    By its nature, the doctrine recognizes that federal courts and administrative agencies have\n    <em>\n     concurrent\n    </em>\n    jurisdiction over an issue for which agency guidance may be appropriate. The Court's decision to implement a primary jurisdiction stay therefore rested on a rejection of Nationstar's exclusive jurisdiction argument for dismissal. Accordingly, the Court rejects Nationstar's \"common law exclusive enforcement\" argument at this stage as well.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    <strong>\n     IV.
