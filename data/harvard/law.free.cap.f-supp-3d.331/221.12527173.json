Stephen and Kathleen Cole are the sole owners of GDRI and SPS. Thurnau Rule 56.1 \u00b6 8. GDRI was incorporated in or about 1977. ESBOCES Rule 56.1 \u00b6 1. GDRI performs maintenance, installation, and repair of electrically operated partition doors (\"EOPs\") and related safety devices for school gyms. ESBOCES Rule 56.1 \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2001, after unattended EOPs caused at least two fatal accidents, New York State enacted Education Law \u00a7 409-f. The law requires that every EOP:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   be equipped with safety devices which, subject to standards established in rules and regulations promulgated by the commissioner, stop the forward motion of the partition or room divider and stop the stacking motion of the partition or room divider when a body passes between the leading panel of such partition or divider and a wall, or when a body is present in the stacking area of such partition or divider.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Educ. Law \u00a7 409-f(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After the enactment of Education Law \u00a7 409-f, GDRI developed a safety device that could be installed on EOPs to bring the EOP into compliance with the law. The safety device stops the door from moving forward or backward if it senses an obstruction in its path (the \"Safe Path System\"). Thurnau Rule 56.1 \u00b6 13. Beginning in 2003 -- and largely in 2003 and 2004 -- Gym Door installed Safe Path Systems in schools all over New York State. Thurnau Rule 56.1 \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This lawsuit concerns the maintenance of these Safe Path Systems. Broadly, the plaintiffs argue that the regulation implementing Education Law \u00a7 409-f -- 8 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 155.25 (\"Regulation 155.25\") -- requires that the maintenance of Safe Path Systems be accomplished only by the plaintiffs or by technicians that are authorized to work on Safe Path Systems by the plaintiffs. They argue that the defendants have ignored Regulation 155.25 and interfered with the plaintiffs' right to maintain the Safe Path Systems that they installed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Regulation 155.25 was adopted in October 2002. Thurnau Rule 56.1 \u00b6 2. Regulation 155.25 sets forth requirements for the construction, maintenance, and operation of the safety devices that are required to be installed on EOPs. Regulation 155.25(c), (d). With respect to the maintenance of the safety equipment, Regulation 155.25 states: \"All equipment must be maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, including the manufacturer's recommended service interval, and records of such maintenance shall be permanently\n   retained at the district or private school.\" Regulation 155.25(d)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The manufacturer's instructions for the Safe Path Systems \"require the use of certified technicians to maintain and repair SAFE PATH systems.\" Pls.' Response to ESBOCES Rule 56.1 \u00b6 100;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Response to Thurnau Rule 56.1 \u00b6 38. The plaintiffs argue that, because of this language in their manufacturer's instructions, Safe Path Systems must be maintained by either SPS or GDRI, or another dealer that is authorized by SPS or GDRI to complete the maintenance.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pls.' Response to Thurnau Rule 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 37-38; Pls.' Response to Young Rule 56.1 \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The defendants dispute that this is the proper interpretation of Regulation 155.25 and they deny that the Regulation requires schools to hire the plaintiffs or their authorized technicians to maintain the Safe Path Systems.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Thurnau Rule 56.1 \u00b6 32. The defendants argue that any competent individual may maintain an EOP in accordance with the manufacturer's requirements. Thurnau Rule 56.1 \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Relying on their disputed interpretation, the plaintiffs claim that the defendants in this case have -- in various ways -- interfered with the plaintiffs' right under the Regulation to maintain and service the Safe Path Systems and have infringed on the plaintiffs' copyrights relating to the Safe Path System.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   First, the plaintiffs have sued four competitors: the Young Defendants, Total Gym Repairs, the Guardian Defendants, and the Tri-State Defendants. Generally, the plaintiffs allege that these competitors have serviced and maintained -- and sought to service and maintain -- Safe Path Systems in violation of Regulation 155.25. The competitors argue that Regulation 155.25 does not prohibit them from maintaining and servicing Safe Path Systems, and they are merely competing with the plaintiffs for that work and have done nothing improper by seeking bids to complete that work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Second, the plaintiffs have sued ESBOCES, an educational cooperative that provides programs and services to public school districts in Suffolk County, New York. ESBOCES Rule 56.1 \u00b6 8. ESBOCES runs a cooperative bidding program that allows school districts to coordinate some or all of their bidding needs by cooperatively bidding for goods and services. ESBOCES Rule 56.1 \u00b6 180. The plaintiffs claim that ESBOCES conspired with the Young Defendants to interfere with the plaintiffs' prospective business relationships to maintain the Safe Path System in schools associated with ESBOCES. They allege that the Young Defendants submitted illegal bids to ESBOCES, and ESBOCES awarded contracts to the Young Defendants under those bids, knowing they were illegal. ESBOCES and the Young Defendants dispute these allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Third, the plaintiffs have sued a state official, Carl Thurnau. Mr. Thurnau was the Director of the Office of Facilities Planning for the NYSED from November 1999 to August 2016. Thurnau Rule 56.1 \u00b6 5. The Office of Facilities Planning oversees the safety of EOPs and was primarily responsible for drafting the implementing regulation. The plaintiffs allege that Thurnau retaliated against them for reporting noncompliance of public schools with maintaining the Safe Path Systems. Pls.' Response to Thurnau Rule 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 44-52. They allege that Thurnau repeatedly announced that Regulation 155.25 did not require service of Safe Path Systems to be completed by SPS approved technicians, and that this interfered with their business. Pls.' Response to Thurnau Rule 56.1 \u00b6 25. Thurnau disputes these allegations. He argues that his office's interpretation\n   of Regulation 155.25 -- that any competent person can maintain the Safe Path Systems -- is correct and that he did nothing improper by announcing that interpretation to the public schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, the plaintiffs have sued Bellmore Public Schools for copyright infringement. The plaintiffs allege that an employee of Bellmore, Joseph Hendrickson, took copyrighted Safe Path instruction materials, altered them, and used them as part of bid invitation materials. Bellmore Rule 56.1 \u00b6 129. Bellmore argues that it was entitled to fair use of the materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The plaintiffs have previously filed two lawsuits regarding generally the same underlying issues at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   First, in March 2011, the plaintiffs commenced an Article 78 proceeding in New York State Supreme Court. The plaintiffs sought an order requiring the New York State Department of Education to inspect, service and maintain all safety systems in accordance with Educational Law \u00a7 609-f and Regulation 155.25.\n   <em>\n    Gym Door Repairs, Inc. v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Educ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3758749\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/112/1198/\">\n    112 A.D.3d 1198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3758749\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/112/1198/\">\n    977 N.Y.S.2d 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 479-80 (2013). The New York State Supreme Court dismissed the case and the Appellate Division, Third Department affirmed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 480. The Appellate Division held that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they \"were essentially asserting a general challenge to respondents' administration of the relevant statute and regulation\" and because \"their asserted injuries [we]re too speculative and conjectural to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court further found that \"the purpose of the law [ \u00a7 409-f ] was to protect primarily students and not individuals paid to work specifically on the safety devices.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Second, in October 2012, the plaintiffs commenced an action in this Court against the New York City Department of Education and several state officials, alleging violations of their due process rights and First Amendment retaliation.\n   <em>\n    Gym Door Repairs, Inc. v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Educ.\n   </em>\n   , No. 12cv7387,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%204934868\">\n    2013 WL 4934868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 10, 2013). In that case, the plaintiffs argued that the combined effect of Education Law \u00a7 409-f, Regulation 155.25, and their manufacturer's instructions gave them a property interest in installing and maintaining EOPs in all New York City schools and that the defendants had deprived them of that property interest without due process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Judge Sweet dismissed the plaintiffs' complaint for failure to state a claim. With respect to the due process claims, the Court found that Regulation 155.25 did not confer on the plaintiffs the right to maintain all Safe Path Systems and therefore that they held no property interest that the defendants had interfered with.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of the due process claims.\n   <em>\n    Safepath Systems LLC v. N.Y.C.

Those issues are therefore addressed initially. The first issue concerns the proper interpretation of Regulation 155.25.

Judge Sweet was considering the identical issue in the prior action, namely whether Regulation 155.25 established that the plaintiffs \"had a right to be awarded a public contract or to subcontract on a public contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The issue was fully\n   and fairly litigated on a motion to dismiss in the case before Judge Sweet. Relying on his interpretation of Regulation 155.25, Judge Sweet granted the defendants' motion, resulting in the dismissal of the plaintiffs' due process claims. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Judge Sweet's decision dismissing the procedural due process claims on the ground that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated that they held any property interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Safepath Sys.

App'x at 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Because plaintiffs did not possess a cognizable property interest in the Safe Path System being installed in all City schools or in maintaining those that were installed, their procedural due process claim was properly dismissed.\"). This Court is therefore bound by Judge Sweet's prior interpretation of Regulation 155.25, which held that the plaintiffs cannot unilaterally require that all Safe Path Systems be maintained by Safe Path authorized technicians by including language to that effect in their manufacturer's instructions. Regulation 155.25 does not require such a monopoly. Rather, Regulation 155.25 requires only that technicians servicing Safe Path Systems conform to the methods and procedures for maintenance set forth in the Safe Path manufacturer's instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The plaintiffs argue that this Court, in its decision denying the motions to dismiss, already determined that the claims in this case were different from those before Judge Sweet and therefore collateral estoppel did not apply. However, in that motion, the Court was asked to decide whether collateral estoppel applied to bar certain claims on a motion to dismiss. Here, the defendants argue that collateral estoppel bars this Court from relitigating a specific issue that was already decided by Judge Sweet, namely the proper interpretation of Regulation 155.25. Accordingly, the Court did not decide in its decision on the motion to dismiss that collateral estoppel did not apply to the interpretation of Regulation 155.25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The plaintiffs have also failed to present any evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that they suffered any damages from any of the claims they have asserted against the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As an initial matter, the plaintiffs' damages theory -- to the extent any theory can be ascertained from the plaintiffs' disclosures\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   -- rests entirely on their flawed interpretation of Regulation 155.25 to the effect that they are entitled to all contracts to maintain and service Safe Path Systems. The plaintiffs calculate their damages by assuming that they would have serviced and maintained\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   Safe Path Systems but for the defendants' interference and therefore are entitled to recover lost profits for the service and/or maintenance of any Safe Path Systems they did not win a contract to service. But, as discussed above, the plaintiffs' interpretation of Regulation 155.25 is incorrect -- the plaintiffs do not have a right to service and maintain all Safe Path Systems and therefore cannot calculate damages relying on an assumption that they do. The plaintiffs have not put forth any theory of damages other\n   than one relying on their flawed interpretation of Regulation 155.25. The plaintiffs have presented no evidence that they would have successfully obtained contracts to service and maintain any Safe Path Systems that they did not service. The plaintiffs therefore have no evidence of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Moreover, even if the plaintiffs had a plausible theory of damages, the plaintiffs have no viable way to prove damages because nearly all of their evidence relating to damages was excluded as a result of the plaintiffs' discovery violations. At a hearing held on November 27, 2017, this Court adopted sanctions imposed by the Magistrate Judge for the plaintiffs' discovery failures and abuses. Those rulings: precluded the plaintiffs' damages expert from testifying and struck his report; precluded the plaintiffs' customer ledger, invoices, and list of New York City Safe Path Systems; precluded Stephen Cole from testifying about damages; and struck the plaintiffs' third amended initial disclosures, which set forth a damages' estimate. Nov. 27, 2017 Hr'g Tr. 8-13 (Docket No. 497).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The plaintiffs argue that they can still establish damages using \"evidence that was produced on time (e.g., the NYSED records, Plaintiffs['] customer ledgers, [and] the deposition testimony of Stephen and Kathleen Cole), and the trial testimony of Kathleen Cole.\" Pls.' Opp. Br. 62-63. But the plaintiffs' general assertion that they can prove damages using this evidence is insufficient. The plaintiffs do not provide any citations to documents or portions of deposition transcripts that provide support for their damages. They simply do not explain how this evidence will enable them to prove their damages and allow a reasonable jury to determine that they suffered any quantifiable damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The fact that plaintiffs' damages estimates wildly vacillated over the course of this litigation is further evidence that the plaintiffs' have not set forth a reliable theory of damages. The plaintiffs' damages estimate in its initial disclosures, dated November 10, 2016, was $66,100,000. Kleinberg Decl. Ex. W, at 8 (Docket No. 547-48). The second amended disclosures also provided a damages estimate of $66,100,000. Kleinberg Decl. Ex. XXX (Docket No. 547-103).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a report dated September 11, 2017, the plaintiffs' damages expert at the time, Paul Ribaudo, provided a damages estimate of $534,189. Gold Decl. Ex. Q, at 2 (Docket No. 456-20). In their third amended disclosures, served September 25, 2017,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the plaintiffs provided a damages estimate of $3,905,959.26. Soter Decl. Ex. LL (Docket No. 552-38). The plaintiffs have provided no explanation for how they could have reduced their damages calculation from over $60,000,000 to somewhat less than $4,000,000 over the course of the litigation, and have failed to reconcile it with their expert at the time, who came up with a damages estimate of about $500,000. The plaintiffs plainly have failed to present evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that they have any damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Further, the plaintiffs have also failed to comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure with respect to disclosure of their damages, and their failure to do so\n   was not harmless. This failure warrants preclusion of any evidence by the plaintiffs relating to damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires parties to provide to opposing counsel: \"a computation of each category of damages claimed by the disclosing party--who must also make available for inspection and copying as under Rule 34 the documents or other evidentiary material, unless privileged or protected from disclosure, on which each computation is based, including materials bearing on the nature and extent of injuries suffered.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A)(iii). Rule 37(c)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides in relevant part: \"If a party fails to provide information ... as required by Rule 26(a)..., the party is not allowed to use that information ... to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   On November 11, 2016, the plaintiffs provided their Initial Disclosures pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26. Kleinberg Decl. Ex. W (Docket No. 547-48). The disclosures set forth estimated damages of $66,100,000 for tortious interference, trademark infringement, unfair competition, and conspiracy. They allotted $21,000,000 to \"Interference with annual SAFE PATH maintenance and staff training Jan[.] 2010 to present\"; $42,000,000 to \"Interference with SAFE PATH and partition repairs Jan. 2010 to present\"; and $3,100,000 to \"Interference with ESBOCES basketball backstop and bleacher bid.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. The plaintiffs did not provide any background or methodology for how they came up with these estimates, nor did they cite to any documents as a basis for their computation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In their second amended disclosures,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the plaintiffs again estimated damages at $66,100,000. Kleinberg Decl. Ex. XXX, at 9 (Docket No. 547-103). However, the sum of the amounts allotted to the different interferences ($20,130,600; $42,000,000; and \"Unknown at this time\") was only $62,130,600.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiffs did not provide any detail regarding how they came up with these damages estimates, nor did they explain in any way why the numbers had changed from their initial disclosures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The plaintiffs' third amended disclosures were struck by this Court. They set forth briefly a damages methodology that was based on the report by the plaintiffs' then expert, Paul Ribaudo, whose report was also subsequently stricken by this Court and who was precluded from testifying. Soter Decl. Ex. LL, at 9-10 (Docket No. 552-38). But because these disclosures were precluded, they cannot satisfy the plaintiffs' requirement under the Federal Rules to disclose the basis for their damages claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In short, the plaintiffs failed to provide a coherent computation of damages from their initial imaginary computation of over $66,000,000 in damages through their ultimate bald assertion of somewhat less than $4,000,000. The plaintiffs also failed to provide the \"documents or other evidentiary material ... on which computation is based.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A)(iii). The plaintiffs thus violated Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(1)(A)(iii). Accordingly, the plaintiffs should not be permitted to introduce any evidence of damages pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(c)(1). Under Rule 37(c)(1), this is not a case where the failure to make disclosure was \"substantially justified or is harmless.\" There is no plausible explanation for the plaintiffs' dilatory actions in formulating\n   their damages computations and failing to produce supporting documentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Moreover, the disclosure failures were not harmless. The plaintiffs' failure to produce any detail regarding their methodology for computing damages prevented the defendants from obtaining discovery regarding the alleged damages and has hindered the defendants' ability to prepare a defense to the plaintiffs' claim for damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In determining whether to preclude evidence under Rule 37(c)(1), the Court should exercise its sound discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Design Strategy, Inc. v. Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757138\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/469/284/#p297\">\n    469 F.3d 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 297 (2d Cir. 2006). To determine whether preclusion should be applied under Rule 37(c)(1) in the exercise of discretion, the Court should consider: \"(1) the party's explanation for the failure to comply with the [disclosure requirement]; (2) the importance of the ... precluded [evidence]; (3) the prejudice suffered by the opposing party as a result of having to prepare to meet the new [evidence]; and (4) the possibility of a continuance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757138\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/469/284/#p297\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757138\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/469/284/#p297\">\n    at 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (first alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Patterson v.

In this case, these factors point decidedly toward preclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   First, the plaintiffs have provided no satisfactory explanation for their failure to provide a plausible computation of damages and the evidence to support it. The plaintiffs assert that they provided the required disclosure in response to Thurnau's First Set of Interrogatories. But in that response, the plaintiffs state only that their damages \"are equal to the total number of Safe Path Systems installed (approximately 4,700), minus the number of devices being maintained by Plaintiffs (approximately 207)[,] times the annual maintenance ($600) and average cost of repairs ($1,200) per system[,] times the number of years of interference (7).\" Daniels Ex. 171, at \u00b6 2 (Docket No. 621-16). This response is plainly insufficient. The plaintiffs do not explain in any way how they devised the numbers they inputted into this formula. They do not provide any citations to documents or testimony that supports their estimate of the number of Safe Path Systems; the number of Safe Path Systems being maintained by the plaintiffs; the cost of annual maintenance or repairs; or the number of years of interference. The plaintiffs cannot simply assert these numbers that provide the basis for their damages calculation without providing any explanation as to how they devised them, or citing to any documents that support them. Rule 26 requires the plaintiffs to provide disclosure of the documents or other evidentiary material on which their damages computations were based. The plaintiffs failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   While evidence of damages is plainly important, in this case the plaintiffs' evidence of damages has already been independently precluded because of the plaintiffs' numerous discovery abuses found by the Magistrate Judge, which this Court affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The defendants would plainly be prejudiced if they were required to meet any new evidence of damages because it would require wholly new computations of damages, new evidence, and reopening discovery after extensive motions for summary judgment have been filed. That would be unreasonably prejudicial to the defendants. Similarly, a continuance would not solve the problems with the plaintiffs' failure to disclose computations of damages and supporting documentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   This is therefore a case in which the plaintiffs' damages evidence -- whatever it may be -- is properly excluded under Rule 37(c)(1). The plaintiffs' failure to comply\n   with their disclosure requirements with respect to damages calculations and supporting evidence under Rule 26(a) was egregious. The failure was compounded by the wildly inflated initial computation of $66,100,000 in damages, ultimately reduced to somewhat less than $4,000,000, which itself was undermined by the plaintiffs' ultimately excluded expert witness. Preclusion in the Court's discretion is wholly justified under Rule 37(c)(1).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Design Strategy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757138\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/469/284/#p297\">\n    469 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   299 ;\n   <em>\n    Spotnana, Inc. v.

As discussed above, that interpretation is incorrect. Accordingly, the plaintiffs cannot rely on that Regulation to establish that they had a prospective business relationship with every school that has a Safe Path System.

Opp. Br. 21-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Nearly all of these allegations concern events that are barred by the statute of limitations because they occurred prior to June 2, 2012 -- three years before the plaintiffs filed the current lawsuit on June 2, 2015. Some of these events occurred long before June 2, 2012. For example, the plaintiffs cite to an email sent by Thurnau on July 7, 2009 and a memo issued by Thurnau in August 2009.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Daniel Decl. Exs. 113 (Docket No. 619-13) and 144 (Docket No. 620-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Moreover, some of the allegations are plainly unsupportive of -- and unrelated to -- a claim for tortious interference and are, frankly, peculiar. For example, the plaintiffs argue that Thurnau \"prevented Gerald Couse from testifying at the TRO hearing in this case on August 2, 2015 because Couse's testimony would be damaging. Couse died unexpectedly a few months later and was never able to testify.\" Pls.' Opp. Br. 27.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs also argue that Thurnau \"sabotaged the settlement conference before Magistrate Judge Peck by portraying Plaintiffs to the Judge as conspiracy theorists, monopolists and golddiggers. Coming from the Attorney General's Office, these false and defamatory allegations carried special weight.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28. These allegations -- which relate to the conduct of Thurnau's counsel in this litigation -- do not support a claim that Thurnau tortiously interfered with the plaintiffs' prospective business relationships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Setting aside all of the allegations that are barred by the statute of limitations or are otherwise clearly meritless, the plaintiffs have offered only five alleged instances of wrongful conduct by Thurnau. In none of them did Thurnau do anything illegal or improper, or anything other than conduct himself properly as a state official.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The plaintiffs argue that Thurnau interfered with a potential contract with Middle Country Central School District (\"Middle Country\") in April 2016 by discouraging Middle Country from entering into a sole source contract with the plaintiffs for the inspection, repair, and maintenance of the Safe Path Systems. But Thurnau's communication with Middle Country was not improper or illegal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In 2016, Middle Country put out a public, competitive bid for maintenance of the Safe Path Systems. Fiorino Decl. \u00b6 3 (Docket No. 518). The plaintiffs submitted a bid, but it was not the lowest bid and thus the plaintiffs were not awarded the contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Subsequently, Stephen Cole contacted Middle Country and explained\n   that the plaintiffs were entitled to a sole source contract under the New York State regulations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. After this call, Middle Country emailed the NYSED to ask if the plaintiffs were in fact entitled to a sole source contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. In response, Thurnau referred Middle Country to Regulation 155.25 and explained that the NYSED interpretation of that regulation did not require schools to contract with the plaintiffs for the maintenance of the Safe Path Systems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6 &amp; Ex. A. Thurnau also referred Middle Country to a newsletter he had previously issued which explained Regulation 155.25.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Thurnau's communication with Middle Country was not improper or illegal. Thurnau simply conveyed to a school district -- who had sought out a clarification -- the NYSED's interpretation of Regulation 155.25. That interpretation at the time had been endorsed by a Judge of this Court as well as the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. All of Thurnau's statements in the email were truthful. This communication is therefore plainly not supportive of a finding that Thurnau acted solely out of malice or used improper or illegal means to interfere with the plaintiffs' prospective business relationships. It is in fact evidence that Thurnau was simply doing his job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The incident also highlights the deficiencies in the plaintiffs' evidence. They have failed to show that they lost prospective business relationships with school districts because of the alleged interference by any of the defendants as opposed to their failure to submit the lowest competitive bids for prospective business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The plaintiffs also argue that Thurnau interfered with their prospective business relationships when he issued two newsletters in 2015 that discussed EOPs, Education Law \u00a7 409-f, and Regulation 155.25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The June 2015 newsletter contained an article that quoted a short portion of Education Law \u00a7 409-f and informed readers that the statutory provision applied to private and public schools. Docket No. 91-11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Thurnau 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 62-63. The August 2015 newsletter contained an article warning of a possible gap in coverage by safety devices in the pocket or stacking area of EOPs. Docket No. 512-39;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Thurnau Rule 56.1 \u00b6 69. Neither newsletter mentions SPS or GDRI. Thurnau Rule 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 64, 71. The articles also do not discuss Regulation 155.25 or the maintenance of Safe Path Systems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The plaintiffs argue that the June 2015 newsletter was improper because Thurnau \"neglected to include any substantive information about Ed. Law 409-f [which was] a deliberately missed opportunity to provide much needed education to school district officials, many if not most of whom are still unaware of the statutory and regulatory requirements for folding partitions.\" Pls.' Resp. to Thurnau Rule 56.1 \u00b6 63 (Docket No. 575). This argument that Thurnau somehow acted improperly, illegally, or solely out of malice because of an apparent omission does not pass muster. The plaintiffs cannot argue that a state official is performing his job improperly just because they would have done it differently. Everything written in the newsletters was truthful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   With respect to the August 2015 newsletter, the plaintiffs argue that \"anyone familiar with safety devices would know that the article was referring to Safe Path.\" Pls.' Response to Thurnau Rule 56.1 \u00b6 71. This is entirely speculative and cannot support a claim that the newsletter was somehow intended to interfere with the plaintiffs' business relationships when it did not even mention the plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Lastly, the plaintiffs argue that Thurnau's email exchanges in 2013 and 2016\n   with an employee of the Young Defendants were improper. But these emails, again, did nothing more than convey the NYSED's interpretation of Regulation 155.25 in response to an inquiry from the employee. Daniels Decl. Ex. 156 (Docket 621-1) (\"There is no monopoly on approvable systems. Any system that meets the legislation can and will be approved after review and approval by my staff.\"); Daniels Decl. Ex. 166 (Docket No. 621-11) (\"The State has consistently interpreted our regulations to mean that any qualified individual can maintain folding partitions in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.\"). These statements were truthful and plainly not improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    Total Gym Repairs\n   </strong>\n   : The plaintiffs argue that Total Gym Repairs has committed an independent tort that satisfies the wrongful conduct prong based on conduct by Mr. Ramotar, an employee of Total Gym Repairs. The plaintiffs allege that he violated a non-compete agreement he signed with GDRI, his former employer. Specifically, the plaintiffs allege that he sought to do business with Columbia University, New York University, and the Museum of Modern Art in violation of the non-compete. But none of those institutions have a Safe Path System. Total Gym Repairs 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 195-97.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, any allegations that Mr. Ramotar violated his non-compete with respect to those entities is irrelevant to the tortious interference claim in this case, which is solely related to interference with the plaintiffs' alleged prospective business relationships to maintain Safe Path Systems.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Soter Decl.

The plaintiffs argue that, but for the illegal bids by their competitors to perform maintenance and repair work on Safe Path Systems, the districts would have followed Regulation 155.25 and awarded the job to the plaintiffs or a certified Safe Path dealer. But this argument again relies on the incorrect assumption that the plaintiffs are entitled to all contracts for maintaining the Safe Path Systems. That is incorrect. The schools were not required to use the plaintiffs or a Safe Path authorized vendor -- they were free to choose other vendors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Therefore, the plaintiffs must present evidence that they would have won the project in the competitive marketplace -- specifically that they would have been the lowest bidder for the project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gym Door Repairs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%204934868\">\n    2013 WL 4934868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (\"Moreover, under New York law, DOE may only award contracts to the lowest responsible bidder.

The only communications cited by the plaintiffs between Thurnau and third parties that fall within the statute of limitations are: (1) an email exchange with an employee from Middle Country; and (2) two email exchanges with an employee of Young Equipment Sales. Fiorino Decl. Ex. A (Docket No. 518-1); Daniels Decl. Ex. 156 (Docket No. 621-1); Daniels Decl. Ex. 166 (Docket No. 621-11). None of these email exchanges provide any evidence that there was an agreement between Thurnau and Middle Country and/or the Young Defendants to interfere with the plaintiffs' business. As discussed above, in each of these communications, Thurnau was simply responding to an inquiry by a third party regarding the NYSED's interpretation of Regulation 155.25. His truthful response to these third parties is not evidence that there was an agreement between Thurnau and others to harm the plaintiffs' business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    Young Defendants/ESBOCES:\n   </strong>\n   The plaintiffs also have not presented evidence of an agreement between the Young Defendants and ESBOCES to interfere with the plaintiffs' business relationships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The plaintiffs argue that there must have been an agreement between ESBOCES and the Young Defendants, and they both must have intentionally participated in the conspiracy, because ESBOCES accepted a fraudulent bid from the Young Defendants. Pls.' Opp. Br. 59 (\"[T]he evidence of an agreement is indisputable: On three separate occasions, ESBOCES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   accepted fraudulent documents for ... [a bid] and awarded that bid to Young Equipment Sales.\"). As the plaintiffs see it, because ESBOCES awarded work to the Young Defendants pursuant to an allegedly illegal bid -- which the plaintiffs allege amounts to either an intentional crime or gross negligence by ESBOCES,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls. Opp. Br. 59 -- there must have been an agreement between ESBOCES and the Young Defendants to secure the bid for the Young Defendants despite the illegal bid. But this argument amounts to nothing more than conjecture. The plaintiffs have not presented evidence of any discussions between the Young Defendants and ESBOCES where ESBOCES expresses willingness to award the bid to the Young Defendants despite the illegality of the bid. The plaintiffs have also presented no evidence that ESBOCES was aware of any problems with the bid documents when the documents were submitted, which the plaintiffs tacitly admitted by asserting that accepting the bid documents was at least gross negligence. While the Court is required on summary judgment to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, the Court is not required to make inferential leaps that are unsupported by any evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   It is undisputed that ESBOCES took every effort to explain to its member schools that the Young Defendants could not perform work outside the bid that they had submitted, and also remedied the issue by pulling the allegedly false portion from the Young Defendants' bid. ESBOCES Rule 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 227-29, 231-33, 236, 243-46, 249-50, 283.

Opp. Br. 45. They also note that the ESBOCES training materials reference an audiovisual aid and argue that this audiovisual aid must have been the Safe Path video. But these arguments are nothing more than speculation. The plaintiffs provide no evidence that the training materials used by ESBOCES actually included device specific training information from SPS or that ESBOCES used any audiovisual aid, let alone the Safe Path video.

SPS does not control GDRI's use of the SPS marks. S. Cole Dep. 1295-96 (Docket No. 536-13). There is also no evidence that SPS monitors GDRI to guarantee the quality of the products sold by GDRI that bear the SPS trademark. This is a naked license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The plaintiffs argue that they control the use of the SPS marks by limiting the use of the marks to authorized dealers and sending cease and desist letters to entities that use the mark without authorization (or do as they have done here, and sue those entities for infringement). Pls.' Opp. Br. 52. But this says nothing about SPS's naked licensing to GDRI. If SPS keeps others from using the mark, there still may be a naked license to GDRI. The plaintiffs do not offer any evidence regarding whether SPS monitors the quality of products made by GDRI that bear the SPS trademark, which is the \"critical question\" in determining whether there is a naked license.\n   <em>\n    Can't Stop Prods., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523854\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/295/381/#p392\">\n    295 F.Supp.3d at 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And it would not be possible for SPS to monitor GDRI because SPS has no employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Total Gym Repairs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   The plaintiffs argue that Total Gym Repairs infringed on their trademark or unfairly competed by: using a confusingly similar logo to GDRI's; affixing Total Gym Repairs stickers on the Safe Path Systems in an attempt to confuse customers regarding the origin of the systems; representing to schools that it was authorized to install and repair Safe Path Systems; and breaching a non-compete agreement between the plaintiffs and an employee of Total Gym Repairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   First, there is no evidence that Total Gym Repairs ever used Safe Path's logo or another logo that looked similar to Safe Path's logo. Total Gym Repairs Rule 56.1 \u00b6 194. In fact, Mr. Cole testified that he did not believe Total Gym Repairs created a logo that was similar to Safe Path's logo. S. Cole Dep. 1134 (Docket No. 552-6). In their response to Total Gym Repairs' Rule 56.1 Statement, which asserts that Total Gym Repairs \"has not created a logo that is similar to the Safe Path logo,\" the plaintiffs assert that they \"do contend that Total Gym's logo is confusingly similar to GDRI's.\" Pls.' Response to Total 56.1 \u00b6 194 (Docket No. 576). But that assertion is entirely unsupported -- the plaintiffs provide no citation. Moreover, testimony in the record actually directly contradicts this assertion. S. Cole Dep. 1134 (Docket No. 552-6). Therefore, the plaintiffs have not presented any evidence that the Total Gym Repairs logo is confusingly similar to the Safe Path logo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   With respect to the stickers, there is no evidence that Total Gym Repairs or Mr. Ramotar placed any stickers with the Total Gym Repairs logo on the Safe Path Systems, or that those stickers were placed over Safe Path Systems' own logo on the equipment. Mr. Ramotar testified at his deposition that, while he was working at GDRI, he regularly placed stickers baring the GDRI logo on the equipment when he was servicing it. Ramotar Dep. 67-68 (Docket No. 615-9). But he did not provide any testimony regarding whether he continued this practice when he was working at Total Gym Repairs or if he ever put a Total Gym Repairs sticker on a Safe Path System. None of the photos cited by the plaintiffs in their opposition papers show Total Gym Repairs stickers on the Safe Path Systems.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp. Br. 54; Daniels Decl. Ex. 42 (Docket No. 616-22), 97 (Docket No. 618-17), 98 (Docket No. 618-18). Additionally, as discussed above, the plaintiffs have not offered any evidence to support their contention that the placement of the stickers has caused, or is likely to cause, any confusion as to the origin of the Safe Path Systems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   The plaintiffs also argue that Total Gym Repairs unfairly competed by submitting bids to perform maintenance and service work on Safe Path Systems in violation of Regulation \u00a7 155.25. But that argument is plainly untenable. Total Gym Repairs was free to submit bids to perform work on Safe Path Systems. The plaintiffs have provided no evidence that any bids that were submitted by Total Gym Repairs were done by using SPS trademarks, or that Total Gym Repairs ever held itself out to potential customers as Safe Path certified or authorized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Lastly, the plaintiffs argue that an employee of Total Gym Repairs, Mr. Ramotar, unfairly competed with them by soliciting clients in violation of a two-year non-compete agreement that he signed when he left the employ of GDRI. As discussed above, Magistrate Judge Peck limited the scope of the non-compete agreement in this lawsuit to cover only the use of Safe Path Systems at Columbia University, New York University, and the Museum of Modern Art.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Soter Decl. Ex. A, at 3 (Docket No. 650-1) (at a conference regarding\n   discovery disputes, Magistrate Judge Peck noted, \"As to the issue of the noncompete and Columbia/MOMA/NYU, the complaint clearly links it to the Safepath Systems\"). None of those entities had a Safe Path System at the time relevant to this lawsuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sotter Decl. Ex. F, at 1048-50 (Docket No. 552-6). Accordingly, any evidence regarding Mr. Ramotar's interactions with Columbia, New York University, or the Museum of Modern Art is irrelevant to this lawsuit because it could not have concerned the maintenance of a Safe Path System, and therefore does not support the plaintiffs' claims for unfair competition in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <strong>\n    VIII.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Bellmore and ESBOCES have moved for sanctions against the plaintiffs pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. ESBOCES argues that the plaintiffs' claim for copyright infringement is objectively unreasonable, because ESBOCES repeatedly disclosed to the plaintiffs throughout this litigation that they had not accessed the plaintiffs' training materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   The Court will not issue the sanctions requested. As an initial matter, a motion for sanctions must be made \"separately from any other motion\" and cannot be made as part of a motion for summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(2). ESBOCES has failed to comply with this requirement and its motion for sanctions is therefore denied.\n   <em>\n    Karla Otto, Inc. v.

The standard for issuing such sanctions is high, and ESBOCES has not sufficiently demonstrated that the plaintiffs' copyright infringement claim is so objectively unreasonable to justify sanctions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bowman Imp./Exp., Ltd. v.

The defendants argued that these recordings cannot be considered by the Court on the motions for summary judgment because they were previously precluded by Magistrate Judge Peck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The plaintiffs have admitted that the recordings they seek to use in their summary judgment opposition papers were precluded by Magistrate Judge Peck. Docket No. 603. The recordings were precluded by Magistrate Judge Peck on August 10, 2017. Soter Reply Decl. Ex. B, at 11 (Docket No. 650-2). The plaintiffs have not provided any justification for their failure to file a timely objection to Magistrate Judge Peck's preclusion of these materials. They have also failed to demonstrate why these recordings should be considered to avoid an injustice. The recordings were surreptitiously made and contain hearsay and double hearsay. Because these recordings\n   were precluded, the defendants did not seek other discovery related to these recordings, and they would therefore be prejudiced by their use on these motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   The plaintiffs argue that they should be permitted to rely on the recordings because the defendants opened the door to the use of these recordings in their opening papers -- but that is incorrect. None of the recordings were attached as exhibits to the motion of any defendant. And the only reference to these recordings is a single reference to one video recording in a declaration filed on behalf of Thurnau. Szuberla Decl. \u00b6 15 and Ex. D (Docket No. 514). But Thurnau did not seek to introduce the actual video into evidence, nor did he attach the video as an exhibit. This did not open the door to the plaintiffs' use of all of the videos that had been excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Accordingly, the plaintiffs' motion to admit the nine recordings that were previously precluded by Magistrate Judge Peck is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   <strong>\n    X.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   The plaintiffs submitted a letter to the Court dated July 25, 2018 after oral argument on the motions. Docket No. 676. The letter purported to respond to the questions of the Court at oral argument that the plaintiffs had not answered, namely what particular contracts did the plaintiffs show with evidence had been lost through the defendants' alleged interference with the plaintiffs' prospective business relations and what was the evidence that the plaintiffs would have obtained those contracts. Rather than relying on the summary judgment record, the plaintiffs purported to put in new exhibits and raise new arguments. The arguments included documents allegedly created after the close of discovery and included hearsay statements and conclusions of counsel, none of which were supported by an affidavit establishing the admissibility of the alleged evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   The letter was plainly improper. It was submitted after the conclusion of briefing and argument and was submitted without permission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Old Republic Ins. Co. v.

The plaintiffs ignored that order and filed an application to file a cross-motion which sought, among other things, to strike various portions of Thurnau's motion for summary judgment. In an order dated March 15, 2018, the Court denied that application, which was in clear violation of the March 12 order. Docket No. 639. The Court reiterated that no further papers were to be filed in connection with the pending motions for summary judgment, and that the Court might allow the plaintiffs to submit further papers after the argument.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"881958\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/170/361/#p369\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court never gave the plaintiffs such permission, either at or after oral argument.

To the extent not specifically addressed above, the remaining arguments are either moot or without merit.
