Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law is \"a non-profit, non-partisan corporation, organized under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.\" (Compl. \u00b6 12). It describes itself as \"a nonpartisan research and policy institution ... focused on fundamental issues of democracy and justice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In furtherance of that aim, the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program utilizes \"policy recommendations, litigation, and public advocacy to advance effective national security policies,\" including those related to \"ensuring that domestic surveillance and counterterrorism policies are properly targeted to the threat and do not discriminate against particular communities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This dispute concerns FOIA requests that the Brennan Center issued to the following governmental entities: the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), within which Plaintiff seeks records from the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis (\"I &amp; A\"); and the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"), within which Plaintiff seeks records from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\"). (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-14). The following sections detail Plaintiff's requests and Defendants' responses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Countering Violent Extremism Initiative\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"In August 2011, President Obama issued the National Strategy for Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States, which outlined a strategy for the federal government to 'support and help empower American communities and their local partners in their grassroots efforts to prevent violent extremists.' \" (Def. Br. 2 (citation omitted) ). In December 2011, the White House issued a corresponding \"Strategic Implementation Plan\" (or \"SIP\") in furtherance of the President's efforts toward \"countering violent extremism\" (or \"CVE\"); the SIP detailed then-current CVE efforts, as well as initiatives that were to be performed by government agencies and their components, including DOJ, DHS, the U.S. Attorneys' Offices, and the FBI. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Price Decl., Ex. 1). As framed by the Brennan Center, \"CVE aims to deploy the resources of the federal government-both law enforcement and social services-to encourage and assist American Muslim communities in identifying persons who ... might hold extremist views and be at risk of becoming violent.\" (Compl. \u00b6 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Plaintiff's FOIA Requests\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2014 and 2015, Plaintiff issued 13 FOIA requests to various government\n   agencies seeking documents related to CVE initiatives. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-49). At present, a limited number of Plaintiff's requests to two government entities-the FBI and I &amp; A-remain at issue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Br. 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The FOIA Requests to the FBI\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 23, 2014, Plaintiff submitted a FOIA request to the FBI seeking records related to the FBI's participation in CVE programs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hardy Decl., Ex. F). On June 3, 2015, the FBI released 28 pages of documents, some of which contained redactions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Ex. H; Compl. \u00b6 36). On July 31, 2015, Plaintiff appealed the adequacy of the FBI's search and the redactions of the FBI's disclosed materials. (Hardy Decl., Ex. I). On November 24, 2015, the FBI remanded the FOIA request for further processing of records that had previously been withheld. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Also on December 23, 2014, Plaintiff submitted a second FOIA request to the FBI seeking various documents generated by the FBI's Countering Violent Extremism Office (the \"CVEO\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hardy Decl., Ex. A; Compl. \u00b6 31). On January 9, 2015, the FBI acknowledged receipt of the request, and on June 3, 2015, the FBI released 25 pages of responsive documents, some of which contained redactions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hardy Decl., Ex. B-C; Compl. \u00b6 33). On July 31, 2015, Plaintiff appealed the adequacy of the FBI's search and challenged the FBI's redactions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hardy Decl. Ex. D). The FBI denied the appeal on September 15, 2015. (Compl. \u00b6 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On November 4, 2015, Plaintiff submitted an additional FOIA request to the FBI seeking records related to certain CVE-related activities. Among those requests, Plaintiff sought \"records pertaining to the FBI's plan for 'Shared Responsibility Committees,' \" or \"SRCs,\" which were \"described as 'proposed groups of community leaders and FBI representatives who could discuss cases of specific youths.' \" (Hardy Decl., Ex. K (footnote call number omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl. Br. 4). \"By letter dated November 19, 2015, the FBI informed Plaintiff [that] a search of the FBI's Central Records System failed to locate any main file records responsive\" to the request. (Hardy Decl. \u00b6 28). On December 4, 2015, Plaintiff appealed the adequacy of the FBI's search for responsive records, which appeal the FBI denied on January 13, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 30-32).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After Plaintiff filed the Complaint in this action on January 29, 2016, the FBI released additional responsive documents to Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hardy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 14, 24, 33-34). On August 29, 2017, after summary judgment briefing closed, the FBI performed another search and produced additional responsive documents related to the FBI's proposals for SRCs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In addition to a broad-based challenge to the adequacy of the FBI's search for records related to the proposed SRCs, Plaintiff offers specific challenges to the FBI's redactions to two documents: (i) the \"FBI Field Office CVE Model,\" which \"is a PowerPoint presentation that is almost entirely redacted\"; and (ii) an intelligence assessment entitled\n   <em>\n    FBI Strategic Plan to Curb Violent Extremism\n   </em>\n   , which is \"partially redacted.\" (Pl. Br. 4). In addition, from the FBI's supplemental post-briefing disclosure, Plaintiff seeks the release of three documents: (i) a July 2015 draft Memorandum of Understanding reflecting the SRC proposal as of that date; (ii) a March 2015 presentation explaining an SRC proposal;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   and (iii) a November 2015 executive summary of an SRC proposal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The FOIA Requests to DHS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On December 23, 2014, Plaintiff submitted two FOIA requests to DHS regarding that agency's involvement in CVE programs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sepeta Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13). I &amp; A acknowledged receipt of both requests by letter dated January 16, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14). After the initiation of this litigation, I &amp; A provided records responsive to Plaintiff's FOIA request, some of which were released in full and others only in part. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff challenges I &amp; A's redactions to three intelligence assessments: (i)\n   <em>\n    Empowering Somali [redacted] Key for Countering Youth Radicalization and Their Travel Abroad for Terrorism\n   </em>\n   ; (ii)\n   <em>\n    Syria-Based US and UK Persons' Public Social Media Activity Effective but Provides Terrorism Prevention Opportunities\n   </em>\n   ; and (iii)\n   <em>\n    Pre-Travel Activities Exhibited by US Persons Aspiring to Fight in Syria Provide Detection Opportunities.\n   </em>\n   (Pl. Br. 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As mentioned above, Plaintiff filed its Complaint in this action on January 29, 2016. (Dkt. # 1). On May 24, 2016, the Court endorsed a joint letter from the parties setting a schedule for further document processing in an attempt to resolve any remaining disputes between the parties. (Dkt. # 25). The parties could not resolve their disputes fully, however, and on February 15, 2017, the Court approved a schedule for the parties to file cross-motions for summary judgment. (Dkt. # 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On May 1, 2017, Defendants moved for summary judgment, and on June 7, 2017, Plaintiff cross-moved for summary judgment. (Dkt. # 37-41, 45-50). On July 11, 2017, Defendants filed a reply memorandum of law in further support of their motion for summary judgment, and on August 11, 2017, Plaintiff filed its reply in further support of its motion for summary judgment. (Dkt. # 45-51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On September 15, 2017, Plaintiff informed the Court of the FBI's post-briefing disclosure and requested further briefing to address Plaintiff's challenges to the adequacy of that disclosure, which further briefing the Court approved that same day. (Dkt. # 52-53). Accordingly, on October 13, 2017, Defendants submitted a letter brief and accompanying declaration in response to Plaintiff's September 15, 2017 letter. (Dkt. # 57-58). Plaintiff submitted a letter brief in opposition on October 24, 2017. (Dkt. # 59).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On February 28, 2018, the Government informed the Court that it had produced an additional set of documents to Plaintiff; the Government thus requested that Plaintiff be permitted time to review these documents and, by June 8, 2018, inform the Court whether the additional disclosure would require further briefing. (Dkt. # 62). After conferring with the parties via telephone, on March 1, 2018, the Court granted the Government's request and stayed the case pending Plaintiff's review of the additional disclosure. (Dkt. # 63). On June 6, 2018, Plaintiff informed the Court that no further briefing was necessary. (Dkt. # 67). The Court now lifts the stay in order to resolve the parties' motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The Specifics of the FBI's Search\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   To substantiate the adequacy of its search, the FBI has submitted the declaration of David M. Hardy, the Section Chief of the Record/Information Dissemination Section within the FBI. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hardy Decl. \u00b6 1). Hardy attests that upon receipt of Plaintiff's FOIA requests, the FBI searched its Central Records System (\"CRS\") and Sentinel for responsive records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35). He then distinguishes the two systems: CRS \"is an extensive system of records consisting of applicant, investigative, intelligence, personnel, administrative, and general files compiled and maintained by the FBI in the course of fulfilling its integrated missions and functions as a law enforcement, counterterrorism, and intelligence agency.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35 n.3). \"Sentinel is the FBI's next-generation case management system that became effective FBI-wide on July 1, 2012\"; after that date, \"all FBI generated records [have been] created electronically in case files via Sentinel\" and \"indexed for future retrieval.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35 n.4). The FBI determined that because of the design of these two information systems, it would be unable to locate responsive records \"through the FBI's regular search protocols based on the manner in which FBI investigative records are indexed, since the subject matter of [Plaintiff]'s request was not a named individual or victim or a common investigation subject pursued by the FBI.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The FBI determined that its \"Office of Partner Engagement ('OPE'), Countering Violent Extremism Office ('CVEO'), was the office most likely to have records responsive\" to Plaintiff's requests. (Hardy Decl. \u00b6 36). It also ascertained that the SRC proposal was \"reflected in a draft [Memorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\") ], which was never finalized or adopted,\" and that \"all FBI [SRC] records originated with the CVEO.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Thereafter, copies of Plaintiff's FOIA request were distributed to personnel within the CVEO, along with instructions to search paper files and electronic systems \"including the CVE shared drive, email folders ... and personal document folders for any\n   and all responsive documents[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37). \"These personnel searched for records pertaining to the 'Shared Responsibility Committee' using the following search terms: Shared Responsibility Committee, SRC, Memorandum of Understanding and MOU.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In addition, the Acting Section Chief of the CVEO and the Office of General Counsel searched their systems for responsive documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   After conducting these searches and identifying the employee who drafted the MOU regarding the SRC proposal, the FBI concluded that \"[n]either that employee [n]or any other CVEO or other FBI personnel located any records documenting discussions or deliberations regarding\" the SRC proposal that predated the MOU. (Hardy Decl. \u00b6 38). And although the draft MOU was withheld,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the FBI processed and released \"several later communications regarding the draft MOU[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   After receiving Plaintiff's cross-motion for summary judgment, the FBI provided another declaration from Brian J. Murphy, the Section Chief of the FBI's Partner Engagement Section in the OPE, and the individual who had drafted the MOU regarding the SRC proposal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Murphy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 6). Murphy explained that, in response to a FOIA request, the \"FBI's general practice [is] to search its Central Records System to determine if the FBI has records about particular investigative subjects,\" but that this approach was unsuitable for Plaintiff's request because the topics it involved were \"not themselves of an investigative nature.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4). Further, \"following receipt of Plaintiff's cross-motion, the FBI undertook searches of eight additional FBI offices-OPE as a whole and 7 field offices\" in Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Washington, Louisville, and Phoenix. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5). Personnel at these offices followed the same search procedures as those applied to the initial FBI search, which resulted in the discovery of five additional responsive records that, at the time that Murphy executed the declaration, were \"being processed to determine whether they [could] be released in whole or part, or whether they are exempt from disclosure under FOIA.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to a letter from Plaintiff submitted after summary judgment briefing, as a result of this later search, \"[t]he FBI produced 9 pages of material, 2 pages in full and 7 in part, and withheld 65 pages of material.\" (Dkt. # 53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    c. The FBI's Search Was Adequate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The evidentiary showing provided by the FBI suffices to establish that the search it conducted was \"reasonably calculated\" to locate responsive documents.\n   <em>\n    Seife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524164\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/592/#p607\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Hardy Declaration describes the structures of CRS and Sentinel, and it explains why the FBI was not likely to locate materials responsive to Plaintiff's request in either system. This portion of the declaration sufficed to explain why the FBI did not search CRS or Sentinel for responsive documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nolen\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Justice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264764\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/146/89/#p97\">\n    146 F.Supp.3d 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 97 (D.D.C. 2015) (\"[A] search is generally adequate where the agency has sufficiently explained its search process and why the specified record systems are not reasonably likely to contain responsive records.\" (citation omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Instead, the FBI proceeded to search both paper and electronic records within the CVEO, and the Acting Section Chief of the CVEO and the Office of General Counsel also searched their records for responsive documents. As a result, the FBI located the draft MOU reflecting the SRC proposal, as well as several communications regarding the draft MOU. The FBI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   also searched eight additional offices that turned up further responsive documents. In sum, the FBI's search was reasonably calculated to produce responsive documents-and was indeed effective in doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In challenging the adequacy of the FBI's search, Plaintiff contends that the Hardy declaration is \"insufficiently detailed in three ways[.]\" (Pl. Br. 7). The Court addresses, and rejects, these arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff contends that the Hardy Declaration \"does not justify limiting its search to the FBI's Central Records System ('CRS') and Sentinel databases or its failure to search those databases in a way that would be likely to discover responsive documents[.]\" (Pl. Br. 7). As discussed above, the FBI did not so limit its search, but rather extended it to both paper and electronic recordkeeping systems in multiple offices. And the FBI's declarations more than suffice to allow the Court to determine \"that further searches\" within CRS or Sentinel \"would be unreasonably burdensome,\" as the declarations make clear that \"the structure of the agency's file system [would] make[ ] further search difficult.\"\n   <em>\n    Church of Scientology of Ca.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    IRS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1583309,3608271\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/792/146/\">\n    792 F.2d 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 151 (D.C. Cir. 1986). Moreover, despite Plaintiff's contention that the FBI should have \"used Boolean operators\" such as \" 'and,' 'or,' [and] 'not' \" in searching its databases (Pl. Br. 8), this was not the FBI's burden, which is only \"to show that its search efforts were reasonable and logically organized to uncover relevant documents; it need not knock down every search design advanced by every requester.\"\n   <em>\n    DiBacco\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Army\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6786744,4288809\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/795/178/\">\n    795 F.3d 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 191 (D.C.

(Pl. Br. 7-9). But those file systems only included a shared drive, email folders, personal document folders, and paper files; they were not the sort of byzantine recordkeeping system that would require a more elaborate description. As provided by the case law on which Plaintiff relies, an agency need only \"describe at least generally the structure of the agency's file system\" to the extent that it \"renders any further search unlikely to disclose additional relevant information.\"\n   <em>\n    El Badrawi\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Homeland Sec.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3933764\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/583/285/#p298\">\n    583 F.Supp.2d 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 298 (D.

Nor is the Court persuaded by Plaintiff's contention that the FBI's declarations should have explained why its personnel conducted the searches \"without supervision.\" (Pl. Br. 9). Plaintiff has offered no evidence of bad faith, and the Court therefore accepts that these searches were performed as described in the declarations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conti\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec.\n   </em>\n   , No. 12 Civ. 5827 (AT),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201274517\">\n    2014 WL 1274517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *13-14 (S.D.N.Y.

Br. 7). In an apparent response to this argument, the FBI searched OPE as a whole and seven field offices, and the FBI consequently located additional material, of which it disclosed a portion to Plaintiff. After the FBI produced these documents, Plaintiff did not further challenge the sufficiency of the search of these offices, despite raising other post-briefing challenges to the Government's disclosure. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. # 52 (post-briefing letter motion requesting leave for further briefing on separate issue) ). Moreover, the Court will not find that this additional search somehow undermined the adequacy of the search as a whole. To the contrary, it underscores the FBI's diligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Accordingly, as to Plaintiff's FOIA claim challenging the adequacy of the FBI's search, the Court grants the Government's motion for summary judgment and denies Plaintiff's cross-motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

In redacting certain records disclosed to Plaintiff, both the FBI and I &amp; A rely in part on FOIA's third exemption (\"Exemption 3\"), which allows an agency to withhold material in response to a FOIA request if the material is (i) \"specifically exempted from disclosure by [a] statute\" that either (ii) \"requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue,\" or (iii) \"establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Determining whether this exemption applies is straightforward, requiring the agency to show that (i) \"the statute invoked qualifies as an [E]xemption 3 withholding statute,\" and (ii) \"the materials withheld fall within that statute's scope.\"\n   <em>\n    A.

Given the language of these statutes, the Court's task is to determine whether, based on the Government's submissions, \"the withheld material relates to intelligence sources and methods.\"\n   <em>\n    Larson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dep't of State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641880,7330200\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/857/\">\n    565 F.3d 857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 865 (D.C.

Below, the Court first describes each agency's showing with respect to their withholdings under Exemption 3; the Court then considers the challenges that Plaintiff mounts to each agency's withholdings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The FBI's Withholdings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The FBI redacted information under Exemption 3 in only one disclosed document, the intelligence assessment entitled\n   <em>\n    FBI Strategic Plan to Curb Violent Extremism.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Reply 7; Price Decl., Ex. 8, 10). In support of these redactions, the FBI relies again on the Hardy Declaration. Hardy explains that the information withheld in these redactions includes \"violent extremist threat evaluation techniques, threat prioritization methods, methods for identifying violent extremists, and intelligence collection methods used by the FBI in the context of foreign counter-terrorism investigations or operations, and information that would disclose the intelligence gathering priorities of the FBI as they relate to CVE efforts.\" (Hardy Decl. \u00b6 53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    b. I &amp; A's Withholdings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   I &amp; A also redacted information under Exemption 3 from each of three intelligence assessments: (i)\n   <em>\n    Pre-Travel Activities Exhibited by US Persons Aspiring to Fight in Syria Provide Detection Opportunities\n   </em>\n   ; (ii)\n   <em>\n    Empowering Somali [redacted] Key for Countering Youth Radicalization and Their Travel Abroad for Terrorism\n   </em>\n   ; and (iii)\n   <em>\n    Syria-Based US and UK Persons' Public Social Media Activity Effective but Provides Terrorism Prevention Opportunities.\n   </em>\n   (Sepeta Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-19). To support its withholdings, I &amp; A offers the declaration of Arthur R. Sepeta, Chief of the Privacy and Intelligence Oversight Branch of I &amp; A. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1). Sepeta attests that the redactions were justified to protect \"intelligence sources and methods\" for the following reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   The redacted material is intelligence information that I &amp; A acquired, developed, and utilized consistent with its authorities under the Homeland Security Act, ... and as a member of the Intelligence Community, as contemplated by [the National Security Act]. First, the redactions applied in the documents at issue protect the underlying sources of intelligence that I &amp; A relied upon to form its analytical assessments and draft each intelligence product. Second, the redactions protect information that would reveal the Intelligence Community's methods, namely its allocation of resources, determination of targets, and tactics in countering violent extremists, including how these inform analytical insights. This includes, for example, information that would reveal vulnerabilities in intelligence methods for collection, prioritization, and resource allocation that may be exploited by the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) and other terrorist organizations to promote radicalization, common indicators displayed by those radicalizing that may be used in identifying homegrown violent extremists, identification and assessment of the effectiveness of tools and tactics used by ISIS in recruitment, particular subjects of interest to the federal government, and counterterrorism mitigation strategies. The remaining information redacted per Exemption 3 addresses intelligence production methods, such as methods for intelligence collection and analyst evaluations of confidence in their assessments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    c. The FBI's and I &amp; A's Withholdings Pursuant to Exemption 3 Were Proper\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In challenging the FBI's and I &amp; A's withholdings under Exemption 3, Plaintiff makes the sweeping assertion that because the Government \"claims that CVE is not an intelligence gathering or law enforcement program,\"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   documents created by Defendants in relation to CVE \"cannot logically relate to intelligence sources and methods.\" (Pl. Br. 12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 (\"DHS has specifically and unequivocally asserted that CVE is not related to intelligence gathering, so the withheld information does not 'logically' or 'plausibly' relate to intelligence sources and methods.\") ). Plaintiff's position is facially appealing, as certain Government-generated documents in the record emphasize that CVE efforts are designed to further community engagement, awareness, and the intervention of terrorism, rather than to gather evidence that the Government may later wield in a particular investigation or prosecution. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Price Decl., Ex. 2 (Exec. Office of the President of the U.S.,\n   <em>\n    Strategic Implementation Plan for Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States\n   </em>\n   2 (2016) (\"The term\n   'countering violent extremism,' or CVE, refers to proactive actions to counter efforts by extremists to recruit, radicalize, and mobilize followers to violence.... CVE efforts do not include gathering intelligence or performing investigations for the purpose of criminal prosecution.\") );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 3 (U.S. Gov't Accountability Off., GAO-17-300,\n   <em>\n    Countering Violent Extremism, Actions Needed to Define Strategy and Assess Progress of Federal Efforts\n   </em>\n   7 (2017) (describing CVE as \"[c]ommunity engagement and counseling to prevent radicalization to violence,\" as opposed to \"Counterterrorism,\" which is described as \"[c]ollecting evidence and making arrests before an event has occurred\") );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 4 (U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec.,\n   <em>\n    Strategy for Countering Violent Extremism\n   </em>\n   2 (2016) (\"Intelligence and law enforcement investigations are not part of CVE activities[.]\") ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   But these statements do not mean that the FBI and I &amp; A do not, as a factual matter, maintain records that relate to intelligence sources and methods while also containing information regarding CVE initiatives. Indeed, it would be naivet\u00e9 to presume that such documents would not exist, given the focus on national security. Moreover, much of Plaintiff's argument on this point devolves to speculation concerning the underlying source of the information contained in the redacted documents. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl. Br. 13 (stating that one of I &amp; A's documents \"obviously relies on information gathered through CVE initiatives\") ). But the record contains nothing confirming such speculation, and even if it did, this would not eliminate the \"substantial weight and due consideration\" owed to Government affidavits dealing with intelligence sources or methods.\n   <em>\n    Fitzgibbon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    CIA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5676379,10537511\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/911/755/\">\n    911 F.2d 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 762 (D.C.

The FBI's Withholdings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The FBI invoked Exemption 1 in redacting information from one document issued by the CVEO, entitled\n   <em>\n    FBI Strategic Plan to Curb Violent Extremism.\n   </em>\n   (Price Decl. Ex. 8; Def. Reply 7). The Hardy Declaration explains the procedural steps that Hardy carried out in classifying pieces of the document as confidential, including marking each document as classified, clearly indicating which portions were classified and which were exempt from declassification,\n   and declassifying any \"reasonably segregable portion\" of the documents \"that did not meet the standards for classification[.]\" (Hardy Decl. \u00b6 47). Hardy also explains that the redacted information \"pertains to ... intelligence sources or methods\" for the same reasons proffered for the FBI's redactions under Exemption 3. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48). To satisfy Executive Order 13,526's final requirement of a reasonable expectation of damage to national security as a consequence of disclosure, Hardy states that disclosure of the redacted information could offer\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   adversaries ... valuable insight into the FBI's methods for gathering, evaluating, and acting upon intelligence concerning violent extremists. Armed with this information, adversaries could extrapolate and apply these insights to predict the FBI's intelligence gathering strategies and investigative responses, and develop countermeasures to avoid detection and/or disruption by the FBI.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    c. The FBI's Withholdings Pursuant to Exemption 1 Were Proper\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Plaintiff challenges the FBI's redactions under Exemption 1 on several grounds. At the outset, Plaintiff repeats the argument that the FBI may not categorize the information in these documents as relating to intelligence sources and methods in light of their relation to CVE efforts. (Pl. Br. 15). That argument fails for the same reasons provided in the Court's analysis of Exemption 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Plaintiff then raises a number of arguments based on the procedural requirements of categorizing a document as confidential under Executive Order 13,526.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff argues that the FBI has not established whether the document was classified before or after receiving the FOIA request at issue; in the latter case, the FBI would have had to follow additional procedures to protect the documents from disclosure. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Br. 15-16 (citing\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Dep't of Def.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3662885,6047405\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/937/\">\n    715 F.3d 937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 943 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (\"[P]reviously undisclosed information may be classified after an agency has received a FOIA request [under Executive Order 13,526 ] 'only if such classification ... is accomplished on a document-by-document basis with the personal participation or under the direction of the agency head, deputy agency head, or the senior agency official designated under [a section of] this order.' \" (first alteration added) ) ) ). Yet nothing in the record suggests that the documents at issue were only classified as confidential after receipt of Plaintiff's FOIA request. Indeed, Hardy's Declaration-for which there is neither contradictory evidence nor showing of bad faith-suggests just the opposite. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hardy Decl., \u00b6 48 (stating that, after reviewing the information withheld under Exemption 1 in response to Plaintiff's FOIA request, Hardy \"determined the classified information\n   <em>\n    continue[d]\n   </em>\n   to warrant classification at the 'Secret' level\" (emphasis added) ) ). The declaration further states that Hardy \"made certain that all procedural requirements ... were followed in order to ensure that the information was properly classified,\" including that \"each document was marked as required and stamped with the proper classification designation[.]\" (Hardy Decl. \u00b6 47). And as the Government points out (Def. Reply 8), these markings are apparent on the documents themselves (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Price Decl. Ex. 8 (showing markings at top of each page reading \"SECRET//NOFORN\" and \"FBI INTERNAL USE ONLY\" that were stricken through, presumably after reviewing for production) ). This challenge thus fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff argues that the declaration does not make clear that Hardy possesses the proper credentials to categorize\n   a document as classified under \u00a7 1.7(d) of Executive Order 13,526 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. Br. 16), which requires the \"personal participation or ... the direction of the agency head, the deputy agency head, or the senior agency official designated under section 5.4\" of the Executive Order. However, \u00a7 1.7(d) only applies where information is classified as confidential\n   <em>\n    in response to\n   </em>\n   a FOIA request, which, as discussed above, is not the case here. By contrast, \u00a7 1.1 of the Executive Order only requires that \"an original classification authority is classifying the information,\" and \u00a7 1.3 provides that such authority \"may be exercised\" by persons including \"[o]fficials authorized to classify information at a specified level[.]\" Hardy's declaration makes clear that he was \"designated by the Attorney General of the United States as an original classification authority ... pursuant to Executive Order 13[,]526 \u00a7 [ ] 1.3.\" (Hardy Decl. \u00b6 2). Thus, based on the Hardy Declaration, the FBI properly classified the document at issue and the FBI was entitled to rely on Exemption 1 in redacting portions of the\n   <em>\n    FBI Strategic Plan to Curb Violent Extremism.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The FBI's and I &amp; A's Withholdings Pursuant to Exemptions 1 and 3 Are Not Invalid on Account of Prior Official Disclosure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   As a fallback position, Plaintiff argues that the information withheld under Exemptions 1 and 3 has been publicly disclosed previously and thus is not entitled to protection under those exemptions. (Pl. Br. 16). And the law is clear that Exemptions 1 and 3 \"may not be invoked to prevent public disclosure when the government has\n   <em>\n    officially\n   </em>\n   disclosed the\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   information being sought.\"\n   <em>\n    Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Navy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10529947\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/414/#p421\">\n    891 F.2d 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 421 (2d Cir. 1989).

(Pl. Br. 16-17 (quoting Sepeta Decl. \u00b6 25) ). As evidence that I &amp; A's \"common indicators\" of radicalization were disclosed, Plaintiff points to portions of the record indicating that CVE efforts included educating members of the public about signs of potential radicalization. (Pl. Br. 16-17 (quoting Price Decl. Ex. 8, 19) ). And to show that the FBI Field Office CVE Model was officially disclosed, Plaintiff relies on (i) Hardy's statement that the document \"contains proposed CVE program components to be utilized in FBI Field Offices,\" and (ii) Plaintiff's assertion that \"the public-facing role of field offices in the CVE program is well documented.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17 (quoting Hardy Decl. \u00b6 24) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   These arguments also miss the mark. To begin, nothing in the record suggests that any information released to members of the public who were CVE participants was \"as specific as the information\" contained in the records at issue.\n   <em>\n    Hudson River\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10529947\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/414/#p421\">\n    891 F.2d at 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, even if the record demonstrated comparable specificity, the disclosure would only be to a small segment of the public, insufficient to render the disclosure \"public in the sense relevant\n   to the official disclosure doctrine.\" In other words, the information never became \"a matter of public record that could be easily discoverable by any interested member of the public.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3487083\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/586/171/#p186\">\n    586 F.3d at 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hudson River\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10529947\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/414/#p421\">\n    891 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   422 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    5.

The FBI's Withholdings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The FBI relied on Exemption 5 to withhold, either in whole or in part, two documents \"compiled during the developmental stages of the CVE programs\": (i) the \"content of a PowerPoint presentation of a draft FBI CVE Program Model that was being developed for potential use in the FBI field Offices\" (the \"PowerPoint Presentation\"), and (ii) information from three pages of the\n   <em>\n    FBI Strategic Plan to Curb Violent Extremism.\n   </em>\n   (Def. Br. 19 (quoting Hardy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 60-64) ). The FBI completely withheld the contents of the PowerPoint Presentation, asserting that it \"was drafted during the preliminary developmental stages of the CVE program\" and \"does not reflect a final decision regarding the content of the FBI CVE Program Model, let alone a final decision regarding any actual CVE programs.\" (Hardy Decl. \u00b6 62).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   After summary judgment briefing closed, the FBI made a supplemental document production in which it redacted three documents under the deliberative process privilege: (i) \"a July 2015 draft of a Memorandum of Understanding reflecting the SRC proposal as of that date (the 'Draft MOU')\"; (ii) \"a March 2015 presentation setting out an SRC proposal ('SRC Proposal Presentation')\"; and (iii) \"a November 2015 executive summary of an SRC proposal ('SRC Proposal Executive [S]ummary').\" (Dkt. # 57). Plaintiff challenged certain withholdings of these documents, which withholdings Defendants maintain were warranted as concerning \"never-finalized and never-adopted iterations of a proposal within the [FBI] for the formation and operation of [SRCs].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   To support its positions, the Government submitted a supplemental declaration from David Hardy (the \"Supplemental Hardy Declaration\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 58 (\"Supp. Hardy Decl.\") ). With particular respect to the\n   <em>\n    FBI Strategic Plan to Curb Violent Extremism\n   </em>\n   , the FBI redacted portions of three pages relating to the following FBI effort:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   a special interest group (SIG) that the CVEO established on the Law Enforcement Online (LEO) portal. The LEO portal is a portal that allows federal, local, and State law enforcement agencies to interact and coordinate. The SIG is a group on that portal that was created to provide exposure to the CVE mission and initiatives and facilitate communications regarding CVE issues within the law enforcement community. The withheld deliberative material is progress reporting on and proposals for the construction of the SIG site and draft communication strategies. The withheld information consists of pre-decisional, deliberative progress reviews-consisting of preliminary opinions, recommendations, evaluations, and comments-written by CVEO personnel as they worked to develop the SIG and CVEO communication strategies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   (Hardy Decl. \u00b6 63).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    c. The FBI's Withholdings Pursuant to Exemption 5 Were Proper, Except for the PowerPoint Presentation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Hardy Declarations at issue present an exercise in contrast. Although they suffice to justify the FBI's redactions to the\n   <em>\n    FBI Strategic Plan to Curb Violent Extremism\n   </em>\n   and to the documents regarding the 2015 SRC proposals, they fail to satisfy the requirements of the deliberative process\n   privilege as to the PowerPoint Presentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Considering first the redactions to the\n   <em>\n    FBI Strategic Plan to Curb Violent Extremism\n   </em>\n   , the Hardy Declaration establishes that the information withheld was predecisional. The Court is able to \"pinpoint [the] agency decision or policy to which the document contributed,\" namely, the special interest group that the CVEO established on its online portal.\n   <em>\n    Heartland All. for Human Needs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523505\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/291/69/#p79\">\n    291 F.Supp.3d at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the Declaration makes clear that the information at issue-\"consisting of preliminary opinions, recommendations, evaluations, and comments\"-is of the sort properly considered predecisional.\n   <em>\n    Wilderness Soc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9141027\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/344/1/#p11\">\n    344 F.Supp.2d at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court also finds the redacted material to be deliberative, in that it was \"progress reporting on and proposals for the construction of the SIG site and draft communication strategies.\" This type of intra-agency communication reflects \"participat[ion] in the exchange of ideas that have not yet been finalized into a policy that may or may not ultimately be adopted as policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Soghoian\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Office of Mgmt. &amp; Budget\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3884687\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/932/167/#p182\">\n    932 F.Supp.2d 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 182 (D.D.C. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The FBI also offers sufficiently detailed accounts of the roles that the Draft MOU, SRC Proposal Presentation, and SRC Proposal Executive Summary played in its 2015 SRC proposals. The Supplemental Hardy Declaration relates that the Draft MOU, which \"was never finalized or used,\" was \"drafted to be entered by the FBI and SRC members,\" and \"sets out a proposal concerning the FBI's interaction with SRCs and reflects the SRC proposal as it existed in July 2015.\" (Supp. Hardy Decl. \u00b6 7). The \"Draft MOU was reviewed and approved by the ... FBI's Office of General Counsel,\" which was \"comfortable with respect to the legal consequences\" of the Draft MOU, but this was only one step in \"a multi-layer review and approval process before formal adoption and implementation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The Supplemental Declaration also provides that the SRC Proposal Presentation consisted of a \"March 2015 FBI presentation for the FBI's Chicago Field Office that sets out features of the SRC proposal,\" which was \"comprised of pre-decisional, deliberative information setting out features of the SRC proposal at that point in time.\" (Supp. Hardy Decl. \u00b6 13). As to the SRC Proposal Executive Summary, Hardy explains that the document \"is an internal, pre-decisional document,\" a \"summary of an SRC proposal [that] was reviewed and approved by the FBI [Office of General Counsel].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17). The Supplemental Hardy Declaration is thus sufficiently detailed to allow the Court to conclude that the three documents regarding the 2015 SRC Proposals were both predecisional and deliberative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Conversely, the Court is unable to find the same as to the PowerPoint Presentation, the contents of which were entirely withheld. The Hardy Declaration merely recites the fact that the PowerPoint \"was drafted during the preliminary developmental stages of the CVE program\" and \"does not reflect a final decision regarding the content of the FBI CVE Program Model[.]\" (Hardy Decl. \u00b6 62). This vague and conclusory assertion allows neither the Court nor Plaintiff to assess whether the information withheld is predecisional or deliberative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heartland All. for Human Needs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523505\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/291/69/#p79\">\n    291 F.Supp.3d at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (denying deliberative process protection where agency \"merely noted for each section of the [withheld] draft statistical reports that the draft reports 'were part of a continuing process of revisions generated in advance of the adoption of a final [agency] policy' \" (emphasis removed) );\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <em>\n    Heffernan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Azar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525941\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/317/94/#p126\">\n    317 F.Supp.3d 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 126 (D.D.C. 2018) (holding that descriptions of withheld information in draft press release were too \"broad and vague\" to \"assist the [c]ourt in any meaningful manner,\" where they were \"masked with discussions of the draft press releases as a whole\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In defending the FBI's decision to redact the contents of the PowerPoint Presentation, the Government argues that doing so was permissible under Exemption 5 simply because the PowerPoint Presentation is a draft. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Reply 22 (\"Because it is a draft, the draft CVE Program Model ... is protected from disclosure under Exemption 5.\") ).

The FBI's rationale for withholding the contents of the PowerPoint Presentation pursuant to Exemption 5 is thus insufficient, as it fails to detail \"the nature of the specific deliberative process involved,\" \"the function and significance of the [PowerPoint Presentation] in that process,\" and \"the nature and decisionmaking authority vested in the [PowerPoint Presentation]'s author and recipient.\"\n   <em>\n    Heartland All. for Human Needs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523505\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/291/69/#p79\">\n    291 F.Supp.3d at 80-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Given the foregoing, the FBI's withholdings pursuant to Exemption 5 are proper insofar as they concern the\n   <em>\n    FBI Strategic Plan to Curb Violent Extremism\n   </em>\n   , Draft MOU, SRC Proposal Presentation, and SRC Proposal Executive Summary, but not proper as applied to the PowerPoint Presentation.

Plaintiff argues that these withholdings, insofar as they relate to the CVE program, \"are not 'law enforcement' programs and they do not relate to a specific investigation or prosecution.\" (Pl.

Next, Plaintiff argues that I &amp; A's redactions are \"overbroad,\" while citing only one example of a redaction that Plaintiff supposes to withhold I &amp; A's \"analysis of the activities of persons aspiring to travel\"; this information, in Plaintiff's estimation, does not constitute guidelines or techniques and procedures of law enforcement.

Even assuming Plaintiff's surmise as to the content of the redacted material to be correct, its legal conclusion-that such travel trends could not constitute law enforcement guidelines-is not: By focusing on historical travel trends of suspected extremists, I &amp; A is able to focus its future policies toward identifying criminal suspects in the future.
