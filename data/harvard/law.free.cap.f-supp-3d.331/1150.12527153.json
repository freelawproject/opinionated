OVERVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the Court are cross Motions for Summary Judgment filed by the parties. Dkts. 8, 12. After holding oral argument, the Court took the motions under advisement. Upon review, the Court now issues the following decision DENYING Plaintiff Advocates for the West's (\"Advocates\") Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 8) and GRANTING Defendant United States Department of Justice's (\"DOJ\") Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the present suit, Advocates allege that DOJ has violated-and continues to violate-the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") by unlawfully withholding 12 legal memoranda prepared by DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel (\"OLC\") regarding the President of the United States' authority to alter national monuments under the Antiquities Act of 1906.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On or about February 6, 2017, Advocates submitted a FOIA request to DOJ in hopes of obtaining certain records related to this topic. This original request was extremely broad. Through negotiation with DOJ, Advocates agreed to narrow the scope of its request on two occasions, and ultimately sought only \"responsive records located in OLC's database of final legal advice\" concerning certain national monuments and the President's authority to enlarge, shrink, or modify said monuments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 9, 2017, DOJ responded to Advocates by stating that it had identified 38 responsive records. That same day, DOJ released 26 of the 38 records in full, but informed Advocates that it would not be\n   releasing the remaining 12 records pursuant to FOIA \"Exemption 5.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Advocates requested more information, or justification, for withholding the 12 documents. DOJ responded that ten of the records were OLC \"Form and Legality Memoranda\" (\"F &amp; L Memos\") and two of the records were \"File Memoranda Recording Oral Legal Advice\" (\"File Memoranda\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Unsatisfied, Advocates filed an administrative appeal with DOJ on or about July 17, 2017, arguing that OLC did not provide legally sufficient descriptions of the withheld records, nor adequate justification for its purported exemption to disclosure under FOIA Exemption 5. DOJ denied the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 12, 2017, Advocates filed the instant suit under FOIA with a single cause of action: \"Unlawful Invocation of FOIA Exemption Five.\" Advocates now move for summary judgment on the basis that DOJ and/or OLC has no reasonable justification for withholding the 12 records at issue and that FOIA Exemption 5 does not apply. Advocates ask the Court to rule in its favor and immediately order DOJ to turn over the records. DOJ filed a cross-motion for summary judgment alleging that it does have legally sufficient reasons for withholding the records under three different privileges. DOJ urges the Court to rule in its favor and allow the withholdings to stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    A. Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Summary judgment is proper \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). This Court's role at summary judgment is not \"to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Zetwick v.

Following that discussion, the Court will analyze two theories proffered by Advocates that the documents lost their privileged status (assuming arguendo it existed in the first place) because of actions taking by DOJ, OLC, the President, and/or other senior advisors.

In its\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index, DOJ outlines the records it seeks to withhold from disclosure and why. Records 1 and 10 are both File Memoranda.

In support of its position that the index is lacking specificity, Advocates rely primarily upon cases from the D.C. Circuit.

While the law does not require DOJ to list this information, the Fourth Circuit has observed that \"where the list fails to identify either the author or its recipient, those persons' relationships to the decisionmaking process cannot be identified and it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to perceive how the disclosure of such documents would result in a chilling effect upon the open and frank exchange of opinions within the agency.\"\n   <em>\n    Ethyl Corp. v.

Along this same vein, Advocates claim that knowing the persons or entities furnished with the records is necessary to determine whether DOJ has waived any privileges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court notes that while the role of the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index in enabling the adversary process to function in FOIA cases is universally recognized, there are not strict requirements, nor are\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   indices even required in every case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Minier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9047344\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/88/796/#p800\">\n    88 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   804 ;\n   <em>\n    Wiener v.

Here, DOJ has provided a\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index and accompanying affidavit. As shown above, DOJ has included numerous details about the records it seeks to withhold. The accompanying Affidavit of Paul Colborn\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   expounds upon the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index. Advocates seek more details, but were an index to contain every detail, it would to some degree defeat the whole purpose of withholding.

Nevertheless, the Court notes that a\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index has never been the place to list all who eventually see, or pass along, a particular document. Were DOJ to list an individual as a recipient who is outside of the President's \"inner circle,\" such listing\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   destroy certain privileges. However, DOJ has stated since the beginning of this case that all of the documents went to the President and/or his senior advisors and staff-all of whom are covered under the privileges asserted. Speculation as to possible waiver does not require DOJ to list individual recipients in its\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Second, Advocates take issue with the lack of a specific description for each record as well as the lack of details concerning how the various privileges apply to each record. Advocates would like to see the specific name of the national monument or decision at issue listed, as well as the President's decision-making process, and the role the various records played in\n   his decisions. Advocates feel this is necessary in order to assess which privileges might, or might not, apply. As noted above, while specificity is always better for the requesting party, the Court must weigh the competing privacy interest. Where, as here, all the documents at issue are essentially the same, it is not unusual that the descriptions of each document are essentially the same as well. While Advocates see the generic nature of the descriptions as vague and lacking, any more specificity could negate the whole reason for withholding the documents in the first instance. Specifics in a\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index could just as easily lead to the dissemination of information to the public that was the impetus for the withholding in the first instance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In summary, DOJ has carried its burden. The\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index and accompanying affidavit explains with sufficient detail how the information withheld \"logically falls within the claimed exemptions, and [ ] that the justifications are not controverted by contrary evidence in the record or by evidence of [ ] bad faith.\"\n   <em>\n    Hunt v. C.I.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1875108\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/981/1116/#p1119\">\n    981 F.2d 1116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1119 (9th Cir. 1992).

In fact, Advocates do not take issue with this analysis. Rather, Advocates contend that the presidential communications privilege only extends to quintessential Article II powers and is not applicable in this case because DOJ did not produce these records to fulfill any of the President's Article II duties, but instead for the President's statutory duties under the Antiquities Act of 1906.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Advocates pull this interpretation from the same cases cited by DOJ that explain the privilege itself. While the presidential communications privilege in those cases was invoked in relation to Article II powers, that does not necessarily mean that the opposite is not true, i.e. that the privilege does not equally apply to communications regarding non-Article II duties. In fact, at oral argument, Advocates conceded that they could not cite any case that stands for the proposition that the presidential communications privilege is only limited to core powers. Advocates correctly note that the Supreme Court has yet to address this issue because no case has presented facts in which a party is asserting the privilege outside of the Article II context. For all of these reasons, Advocates urge the Court to construe the privilege narrowly, limit it to only core Article II powers, and not allow DOJ to rely upon it in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   DOJ relies upon\n   <em>\n    United States v. Philip Morris USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , for the proposition that the presidential communications privilege is not as limited as Advocates assert.

Sept. 9, 2004). Advocates distinguish\n   <em>\n    Philip Morris\n   </em>\n   by noting that in that case, the United States District Court for the District of D.C. rejected the distinction the parties were trying to make between whether the presidential power at issue was delegable or non-delegable. Advocates claim that is different from its argument here because it is not seeking to distinguish between the delegation of duties, but between the source of the power behind the duty-i.e. whether the power comes from Article II or a statute. This difference aside, the Court finds the\n   <em>\n    Philip Morris\n   </em>\n   Court's analysis instructive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Philip Morris\n   </em>\n   , the Defendants, like Advocates here, relied upon\n   <em>\n    In re Sealed Case\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   , and argued that because both of those landmark presidential communications privilege cases involved \"quintessential, non-delegable Presidential function[s]\" such characteristics were a \"requirement for application of the privilege.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9300487\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/1/#p8\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court rejected this position for three reasons. The Court will quote at length from the\n   <em>\n    Philip Morris\n   </em>\n   Court's decision because the analysis regarding the \"delegable\" distinction argument in\n   <em>\n    Philip Morris\n   </em>\n   applies to Advocates \"source of power\" distinction argument in this case. In other words, a substitution of the word \"Article II\" in place of \"delegable\" (bolded below) leads to a similar outcome.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   First, there is absolutely no language in either\n   <em>\n    In re Sealed Case\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   to suggest that their holdings turned on the fact that a non-\n   <strong>\n    delegable\n   </strong>\n   power was in question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   If the Court of Appeals intended to limit the scope of the privilege in the manner Joint Defendants suggest, it would have clearly spelled out such limitation in setting forth the standard for its application. While the presence of non-\n   <strong>\n    delegable\n   </strong>\n   powers in both cases may have made the case for application of the privilege particularly strong-because the communications were, by definition, tied to presidential decisionmaking-there is nothing to suggest that it was a\n   <em>\n    sine qua non\n   </em>\n   of application of the privilege rather than a mere coincidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Second, limiting the privilege to only those communications regarding non-\n   <strong>\n    delegable\n   </strong>\n   powers would undermine the very purposes for which it exists.

To be clear, there is no doubt that the presidential communications privilege applies to communications directly related to the President's Article II Powers; but the privilege is not so restrictive-as Advocates assert-that it cannot likewise apply to the records at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   DOJ provided the ten F &amp; L Memos to senior presidential advisors in an effort to assist with presidential decision making and deliberations.

While the power vested in the President in this particular circumstance came from a statute, rather than Article II, there is no binding legal authority that restricts the privilege on that basis alone. The presidential communications privilege therefore applies and the Court will not require DOJ to turn over the 12 records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As the presidential communications privilege applies to these documents in their entirety, the Court's inquiry could end here.

This simply is not true. If OLC (on behalf of the AG) approves of the form and substance of a\n   proposal, then it moves on to the next agency. But even if the AG (or in this case OLC) does not approve of the proposal, there is still the possibility that it will go to the President. Advocates rely on the clause \"shall not thereafter be presented to the President ...\" from subsection (e) to support its position.

The F &amp; L Memos are not policy, but rather opinions, recommendations, and advice. Non-approval of a proposal, and the reasons therefore, may be just as important as approval, as the core function of OLC and DOJ is to act as legal advisor to the President and other departments and agencies within the Executive Branch. As Paul Colborn points out in his declaration, providing such advice on difficult and unsettled questions of law, involving matters that can be quite complicated or controversial, is a core component of OLC's mission.\n   <em>\n    Colborn Decl.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 12-3, 26. For the President and Executive Branch officials to robustly and freely deliberate and perform their duties effectively, OLC must be able to give candid legal advice not constrained by concerns about public disclosure. Similarly, Executive Branch policymakers should not feel inhibited from seeking OLC's candid and frank legal advice for fear of subsequent disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Electronic Privacy Information Center v.

The\n   <em>\n    EPIC\n   </em>\n   court soundly rejected this interpretation of those prior cases and noted that \"neither case stands for the unilateral proposition that an agency's conclusive interpretations of law are always \"final opinions\" for purposes of FOIA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5702202\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/249/1/#p6\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Consistent with\n   <em>\n    EPIC\n   </em>\n   , this Court will similarly reject such a narrow interpretation of the deliberative process privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Finally, both sides seem to be trying to split a fine hair in regard to the definition\n   of \"predecisional.\" Advocates argue that, in order for a document to be predecisional, an agency needs to generate the document prior to publication or disclosure of that agency's policy or decision and, since the F &amp; L Memos are OLC's policy or decision, they are not predecisional. DOJ, on the other hand, postures that the documents are predecisional because OLC prepares them for the President in preparation for\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   final decision on a given matter. The Court agrees with the later interpretation. As has been discussed, OLC does not set policy. Even if an F &amp; L Memo could be considered OLC's position on a given matter, such a conclusion would be the result of the specifics of the proposal in question. It does not follow that a single F &amp; L Memo becomes the position of OLC indefinitely. Presumably, OLC's \"policy\" is to follow the law and advise the Executive Branch on the same. Each F &amp; L Memo-and the legal advice therein-would fit the contours of the questions presented, and not necessarily reflect how OLC would treat a similar question in the future under different factual circumstances, new or changed laws, or a different administration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   OLC's F &amp; L Memos were not final policies, but predecisional and deliberative in nature. OLC drafted these memos for the purpose of giving advice, recommendations, and opinions on pending proposals and orders to the President and other senior officials within the Executive Branch. DOJ has appropriately invoked the deliberative process privilege with regard to these memos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    4.

Advocates, on the other hand, argue that this doctrine is in fact applicable to the attorney-client privilege. Advocates argument is based upon the assumption that a document has been incorporated into an agency's policy or otherwise does not fall within the deliberative process privilege. As outlined above, the Court finds that DOJ properly invoked the deliberative process privilege in this case. Advocates position on this topic is, therefore, all but moot. Both parties' positions regarding whether the working law exception applies to the attorney-client privilege are tenuous at best. However, the Court does not need to reach a determination on this issue as the working law doctrine fails in this case for two independent reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   First, even if the Court did find that this doctrine could abrogate both the deliberative process and attorney-client privileges, the presidential communications privilege, which the Court has already determined DOJ properly invoked in this case, would shield the records from disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Second, this doctrine is unavailing on the merits as the Court has also already determined that the F &amp; L Memos (the only documents for which this doctrine would apply) do not represent the policy of the department (i.e., the \"working law\"), but are rather deliberative and predecisional. As noted, although one could consider the F &amp; L Memos OLC's final position as to the specific question at issue, the memos themselves are not formal agency policy. In a similar vein, the F &amp; L Memos are not transformed into the \"working law\" of the agency simply because they might constitute controlling, precedential, authoritative, or final statements of the legal constraints on the President's decisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    EFF\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324329,4085580\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/739/1/\">\n    739 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   9-10 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Campaign of Accountability v.

As with the working law doctrine, the adoption doctrine, if proven, would only abrogate the deliberative process privilege and the attorney-client privilege. So again, because the Court has concluded that the presidential communications privilege applies, there really is no need to go any further. However, as before, this doctrine likewise fails on the merits, as the argument is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \"The touchstone of the express adoption inquiry is whether the agency uses the reasoning contained in a document, and the authority provided by the document, to 'justify' its actions to the public.\"\n   <em>\n    New York Times Co. v.

As discussed above, this is a misreading of the statute. The AG or the Director of OMB can disapprove of any order and it can still go to the President-just not without an accompanying explanation. Furthermore, ever if the AG approves of a proposal's form and legality, the President may elect not to move forward on a proclamation or order for countless reasons. Just because OLC approves a proposal does not mean that the proposal will ever see the light of day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Specific to the facts of this case, Advocates have not provided any evidence that would show adoption has taken place in relation to the 12 records at issue. There is no indication that the President adopted the withheld memoranda or publicly disclosed their contents. One could infer that the President and his advisors had accepted the conclusions of a particular F &amp; L Memo based on the subsequent issuance of a Presidential proclamation or order. However, that does not mean that the President incorporated the reasoning from any of these memoranda. The President could have moved forward with a proclamation or order for any number of reasons, in light of, or in spite of, OLC's recommendations. Thus, DOJ's asserted privileges withstand this doctrine as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <em>\n    7. Segregability Doctrine\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   As a final request, Advocates argue that even if the Court determines the documents are privileged and that DOJ can continue to withhold them, the Court should nonetheless release certain portions of the documents under the doctrine of segregability. Specifically, Advocates ask the Court to sever the F &amp; L Memo cover letters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Under FOIA, the government must disclose \"any reasonably segregable portion of a record ... after deletion of the portions which are exempt.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

Nevertheless, the Court will discuss an additional reason for withholding. As Colborn points out in his declaration, \" \"[a]lthough the attached cover letters do not themselves contain legal advice, their disclosure would reveal the titles of the relevant proclamations, and accordingly would reveal which proclamations were subject to this additional confidential legal advice.\"\n   <em>\n    Colborn Decl.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 12-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Advocates feel this explanation is unpersuasive because the cover letters in question contain similar, if not identical, information as the cover letters DOJ already produced. As for the name of any monument, Advocates do not believe that is a good enough reason to withhold the cover letters because \"that fact is already known. Pursuant to Executive Order 11,030,\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   presidential proclamations are submitted to OLC for legal approval.\" Dkt. 15, at 19. This appears to be an inaccurate statement. While all proclamations or orders that become official were no doubt submitted to OLC for review, that does not mean that all proposals submitted to OLC for review become official. That is the purpose of the process. The President may have chosen, upon receipt of OCL's F &amp; L Memos, to discard a proposal for any number\n   of reasons. The public would most likely never know about these proposals. Thus, even the name of a monument on the cover letter could give away information never intended to become public knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Here, it is clear that DOJ does not want the public to know the contents of these specific F &amp; L Memos, nor does it even want the Court to undertake an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review. There are multiple valid reasons, some of which have been discussed above, for why this might be the case. Simply put, these documents contain legal advice and are protected under three separate privileges from disclosure and, while the cover letters themselves may not contain legal advice, they are part of the memos and may contain sensitive information that DOJ, or the President, do not want revealed. The presidential communications privilege protects the whole document from disclosure, and because the Court has found that DOJ properly invoked this privilege, the Court will not sever or segregate the cover letters from the rest of the withheld documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Advocates argue that (1) DOJ has not meet its burden in providing an appropriate\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index, (2) the presidential communications privilege does not apply as the powers at issue were not Article II powers, and (3) that certain actions taking by DOJ (and others) waived DOJ's other asserted privileges. The Court has reviewed the applicable case law and, under the facts presented, cannot agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   DOJ's\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index, coupled with the affidavit of Paul Colborn is sufficient to put Advocates on notice and preserve the adversarial process. DOJ has persuasively explained what the withheld records are. Even without the specific recipients or name of the monument at issue, the Court can determine that all the records contain legal advice to the President and his advisors and should remain protected. While public disclosure is an important and necessary part of any free society, so too is candor and privacy when those at the highest levels of government strive to determine the best course of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The privileges asserted in this case stand. The presidential communications privilege is not limited to Article II powers and protects these documents in their entirety. The deliberative process privilege and attorney-client privilege also apply. The working law and adoption doctrines do not apply or negate DOJ's privileges. Lastly, the Court will not segregate any of the requested records. DOJ's reliance upon the three privileges under FOIA Exemption 5 stand. DOJ has properly withheld the 12 records in this case and the Court will not require it to turn over any of the protected material to Advocates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.
