Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2007, the plaintiff, Samuel Ballengee, opened Tug Valley Pharmacy (\"Tug Valley\") in Williamson, West Virginia, within two blocks of two notorious pill mills that were eventually shut down by government agencies. Customers formed lines outside of these pill mills daily before they opened. Tug Valley filled eye-popping quantities of pain prescriptions written by reckless doctors at these pill mills. In 2009, Tug Valley filled 42,115 hydrocodone prescriptions in a town with a population of only 3090. This was more than enough to give every man, woman, and child in Williamson a hydrocodone prescription every month of the year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   From 2010 to 2012, several of Mr. Ballengee's customers sued him and Tug Valley for negligently and/or recklessly filling prescriptions and for contributing to the customers' drug addictions. At least one of these customers died of an overdose from prescription opioids. Several customers alleged that they saw drug deals occur right outside of Tug Valley. Customers also alleged that Mr. Ballengee would fill opioid prescriptions before their refill date, particularly if they paid in cash. The State of West Virginia has described Tug Valley as one of \"the most notorious of the pill mill pharmacies in Southern West Virginia.\" Defs.' Mot. Summ. J. (\"Defs.' Mot.\") Ex. 41, at 32 [ECF No. 169-41].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   CBS found this information newsworthy. After extensively investigating the opioid epidemic in West Virginia, CBS showcased Tug Valley during two broadcasts in 2016. Although the government has apparently decided not to take action against Mr. Ballengee, despite the egregious facts that follow, he nonetheless filed this defamation action against CBS. Mr. Ballengee alleges that the CBS broadcasts were defamatory, placed him in a false light, tortiously interfered with various contracts, and amounted to intentional infliction of emotional distress. The court must now decide whether these claims can survive summary judgment. For the reasons stated herein, the court concludes that they cannot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

When Mr. Ballengee opened Tug Valley, he was aware that Mountain Medical Care Center (\"Mountain Medical\") and Dr. Diane Shafer's office were located within one block of the pharmacy. Defs.' Mot. Ex. 3, at 5-6 [ECF No. 169-3]. Both of these offices were notorious pill mills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Tug Valley filled large quantities of controlled substance prescriptions, many of which were pain prescriptions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in a town with a population of 3090.

Defs.' Mot. Ex. 41, at 4 [ECF No. 169-41]. While the State did not name any pharmacies as defendants in the lawsuit, it discussed several pharmacies' practices in its second amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. The State described Tug Valley's role in the lawsuit in regard to AmerisourceBergen as such:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Amerisourcebergen was a distributor of substantial quantities of controlled substances to Tug Valley Pharmacy in Williamson, West Virginia. This pill mill pharmacy was located within yards of\n   two notorious pill mill physicians and their operations in the town of Williamson. Doctors ... operated pill mill clinics whose voluminous illegal prescriptions written for non-medical purposes were filled daily by this pharmacy to which Amerisourcebergen was distributing.... [T]hey distributed to Tug Valley Pharmacy a total of 149,300 hydrocodone (generic of Lorcet, Lortab, Vicodin, Vicoprofen, among others) tablets during the calendar year 2009 for an average supply of 12,441 tablets per month.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. The State also describes Tug Valley's role in the lawsuit in regard to H.D. Smith Wholesale Drug Co.:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [H.D. Smith] made substantial distributions to West Virginia pharmacies of controlled substances widely known to be among those substances which were abused, including ... Tug Valley Pharmacy.... These pharmacies were among the most notorious of the pill mill pharmacies in Southern West Virginia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [H.D. Smith's] distributions to Tug Valley were suspiciously high when standing alone and more so when considered together with the distributions to Hurley [Drug Co., a pharmacy located only four blocks away from Tug Valley in Williamson]. For example, according to [H.D. Smith's] records, on October 18, 2007, H.D. Smith distributed 30,000 hydrocodone... tablets to Tug Valley Pharmacy. On October 16, 2007, H.D. Smith delivered 5000 hydrocodone... to Hurley drug. Then on October 18, 2007, H.D. Smith delivered another 4000 hydrocodone... to Hurley resulting in a total 39,000 hydrocodone delivered within a two (2) day period to a four (4) block area in a town which had a population of 3090 people.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   The volume of oxycodone and hydrocodone pills distributed to Tug Valley Pharmacy by H.D. Smith in view of the town's population, the close proximity to pill-pushing physicians whose reputations were both well-known and the subject of extensive publicity, the close proximity to another pharmacy, existence of other suppliers of controlled substances to this same pharmacy, all should have served to alert a distributor acting with due diligence that the orders were suspicious in nature.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On January 7, 2016, CBS aired a broadcast\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   that discussed the State of West Virginia's problems with opioid pain prescriptions.

SCOTT PELLEY: Last night we showed you remarkable pictures of people lining up down the block to collect painkillers at a doctor's office, an office the authorities say is really just a front for drug dealing. Well, tonight Jim Axelrod and producer Ashley Velie continue their investigation in West Virginia where the State is suing, accusing pharmacies and drug distributors of making millions pushing narcotics to anyone who wants them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   MR. JIM AXELROD: No state has had more trouble with prescription pains [sic] pills than West Virginia and no town in West Virginia more trouble than Kermit, population 400. This undercover video of Kermit's main pharmacy shows scores of people picking up prescriptions inside and at the drive-through window.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   MR.

JIM CAGLE: What you have is some bad doctors and pharmacies who are willing to turn a blind eye because of the money that's involved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   MR. JIM AXELROD: More than three million doses of hydrocodone were ordered by a Kermit pharmacist, James Wooley.

But Cagle told us the problem persists. This pharmacy, Tug Valley, is now being sued for negligently filling prescriptions.

KAREN BOWLING: If you are a distributor, if you are, you know, providing medication, you know, to pharmacies, that someone but, would say, you know, wow, this is a lot. You know, what do we need to do about it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   MR. JIM AXELROD: That's the premise behind the unprecedented lawsuit. Under West Virginia's law, distributors are legally bound to report suspicious orders from pharmacies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   MR. JIM CAGLE: If that distributor has good reason to believe that the prescriptions that are being filled are not for legitimate medical purposes, then they are not to make that delivery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   MR. JIM AXELROD: They have an obligation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   MR. JIM CAGLE: They have a duty, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   MR. JIM AXELROD: AmerisourceBergen is the third largest drug wholesaler in the country and one of 11 defendants in the State's case. Over a five year period they filled orders for 118 million hydrocodone and oxycodone pills, enough to supply every West Virginian with 13 pain pills a year. That's scary math.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   MR. JIM CAGLE: It is. Yes, it is.

Pl.'s Resp. Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. Summ. J. 5 (\"Pl.'s Resp.\") [ECF No. 183]. In an affidavit of Gary Boggs, Senior Director of Regulatory Affairs at McKesson, Mr. Boggs states that the January broadcast \"alerted [him] that Tug Valley Pharmacy was a defendant in a lawsuit in Mingo County that alleged that Tug Valley Pharmacy contributed to the plaintiffs' addictions by dispensing high volumes of controlled substances.\" Defs.' Mot. Ex. 35 (\"Boggs Aff.\"), \u00b6 12 [ECF No. 169-35]. This \"prompted [Mr. Boggs] to initiate a review of Tug Valley Pharmacy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. As part of this review, Mr. Boggs read the plaintiffs' brief in the customers' lawsuit against Tug Valley.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.

In March 2016, Mr. Ballengee was rapidly losing customers and sold Tug Valley.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92. He then attempted to obtain employment as a pharmacist for Wal-Mart, where he had worked for fifteen years prior to opening Tug Valley, but was unable to do so. Pl.'s Resp. 36.

In Count I of the Complaint, the plaintiff alleges that the CBS broadcasts contained both defamatory statements and defamatory implications. The court will address these allegations separately. In West Virginia, the essential elements for a successful defamation action are (1) a defamatory statement; (2) a nonprivileged communication to a third party; (3) falsity; (4) reference to the plaintiff; (5) negligence or actual malice on the part of the publisher;\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (6) resulting injury.\n   <em>\n    Crump v.

Records show Tug Valley was filling more than 150 pain prescriptions a day from one clinic alone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Jan. Tr. 4-5. From the May broadcast, the following statements are at issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   MR.

These statements are not opinions and are capable of harming Mr. Ballengee's reputation and deterring others from associating with him. Therefore, the statements are capable of a defamatory meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Because the allegedly defamatory statements are capable of a defamatory meaning, the court must now analyze the elements of Mr. Ballengee's defamation claim regarding these statements to determine whether there are any genuine disputes of material fact. Because Mr. Ballengee has the burden of proof on each element of his defamation claim, summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine dispute of material fact regarding any one of the required elements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 322,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p325\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The court will begin with the element of falsity. \"The common law of libel takes but one approach to the question of falsity, regardless of the form of the communication.

The first statement at issue appeared in both broadcasts. During the January 7, 2016 broadcast, Mr. Axelrod reported that \"[r]ecords show Tug Valley was filling more than 150 pain prescriptions a day from one clinic alone.\" Jan. Tr. 4. During the May 25, 2016 broadcast, Mr. Axelrod reported \"that Randy Ballengee is facing several lawsuits for negligence, admitting to filling 150 pain pill prescriptions daily for one clinic alone.\" May Tr. 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The plaintiff claims that these statements are false because he never filled more than 150 pain prescriptions \"a day\" / \"daily\" from one clinic alone. Pl.'s Resp. 9. The court disagrees. The defendants submitted records that demonstrate that on at least seven occasions, the plaintiff did fill more than 150 pain prescriptions in a single day from one clinic.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff does\n   not dispute the accuracy of these records, and did not offer any evidence to rebut them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   A \"statement is not considered false unless it 'would have a different effect on the mind of the reader from that which the pleaded truth would have produced.' \"\n   <em>\n    Masson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108062\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/496/#p517\">\n    501 U.S. at 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108062\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/496/#p517\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the pleaded truth, undisputed by the plaintiff, is that, on seven occasions, Tug Valley filled more than 150 pain prescriptions in a single day from one clinic. The allegedly defamatory statement is that \"Tug Valley was filling more than 150 pain prescriptions a day / daily from one clinic alone.\" Thus, based on the undisputed evidence, I conclude that no reasonable juror could find that the broadcast statement \"would have a different effect on the mind of the reader from that which the pleaded truth would have produced.\"\n   <em>\n    Masson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108062\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/496/#p517\">\n    501 U.S. at 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108062\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/496/#p517\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

May Tr. 5. This statement refers to Mr. Ballengee's testimony during a deposition in relation to one of the civil lawsuits in which he was a defendant. The relevant portion of the deposition reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   Q: Okay.

Instead, he stated that he was filling between 150 and 200 prescriptions in a day from Mountain Medical, and that most of those patients received pain medication.

Pl.'s Resp. 17. The plaintiff notes that the January broadcast references several civil lawsuits in which Mr. Ballengee and/or Tug Valley were named as defendants, but the broadcast fails to mention that the lawsuits were filed by former customers of Tug Valley-not the State of West Virginia. Jan. Tr. 3. Mr. Pelley begins the broadcast by stating that \"the State is suing, accusing pharmacies and drug distribut[o]rs of making millions pushing narcotics to anyone who wants them.\" Jan. Tr. 3. A short time later, Mr. Axelrod discusses the lawsuits that were filed against Mr. Ballengee, without stating who was suing him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. A few lines after that, Mr. Axelrod mentions \"the unprecedented lawsuit\" in which the State is suing eleven defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. The broadcast, however, only names one of those defendants-AmerisourceBergen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This series of statements creates a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the broadcast could be reasonably understood to impart that Tug Valley was sued by the State of West\n   Virginia, and whether the broadcast affirmatively suggests that CBS intended or endorsed the inference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chapin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517482\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/993/1087/#p1092\">\n    993 F.2d at 1093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, because a reasonable juror could find that the January broadcast implied that Mr. Ballengee and/or Tug Valley were being sued by the State of West Virginia, the court will now determine whether a reasonable juror could find that this implication defamed Mr. Ballengee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   As an initial matter, the court finds that the implication that Mr. Ballengee and/or Tug Valley were being sued by the State of West Virginia is not an opinion, and is capable of a defamatory meaning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pritt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9475375\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/210/446/\">\n    557 S.E.2d at 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The parties agree that the State of West Virginia did not sue Mr. Ballengee or Tug Valley. However, the defendants submitted evidence that shows that the State of West Virginia did sue eleven pharmaceutical drug distributors for contributing to the prescription drug abuse problem in West Virginia. Defs.' Mot. Ex. 41, at 4. Although the State did not name any pharmacies, including Tug Valley, as defendants in the lawsuit, it discussed several pharmacies' practices in its complaint. Specifically, the State described Tug Valley's relationship with AmerisourceBergen as such:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   Amerisourcebergen was a distributor of substantial quantities of controlled substances to Tug Valley Pharmacy in Williamson, West Virginia. This pill mill pharmacy was located within yards of two notorious pill mill physicians and their operations in the town of Williamson. Doctors ... operated pill mill clinics whose voluminous illegal prescriptions written for non-medical purposes were filled daily by this pharmacy to which Amerisourcebergen was distributing.... [T]hey distributed to Tug Valley Pharmacy a total of 149,300 hydrocodone (generic of Lorcet, Lortab, VicodinVicoprofen, among others) tablets during the calendar year 2009 for an average supply of 12,441 tablets per month.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. The State also described Tug Valley's relationship with H.D. Smith Wholesale Drug Co. as such:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   [H.D. Smith] made substantial distributions to West Virginia pharmacies of controlled substances widely known to be among those substances which were abused, including ... Tug Valley Pharmacy.... These pharmacies were among the most notorious of the pill mill pharmacies in Southern West Virginia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   [H.D. Smith's] distributions to Tug Valley were suspiciously high when standing alone and more so when considered together with the distributions to Hurley [Drug Co., a pharmacy located only four blocks away from Tug Valley in Williamson]. For example, according to [H.D. Smith's] records, on October 18, 2007, H.D. Smith distributed 30,000 hydrocodone... tablets to Tug Valley Pharmacy. On October 16, 2007, H.D.

Smith delivered another 4000 hydrocodone... to Hurley resulting in a total 39,000 hydrocodone delivered within a two (2) day period to a four (4) block area in a town which had a population of 3090 people.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   The volume of oxycodone and hydrocodone pills distributed to Tug Valley Pharmacy by H.D. Smith in view of the town's population, the close proximity to\n   pill-pushing physicians whose reputations were both well-known and the subject of extensive publicity, the close proximity to another pharmacy, existence of other suppliers of controlled substance to this same pharmacy, all should have served to alert a distributer acting with due diligence that the orders were suspicious in nature.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Although Mr. Ballengee may dispute these characterizations of Tug Valley by the State of West Virginia, he does not dispute that the characterizations did in fact appear in West Virginia's complaint against the drug distributors. Thus, the pleaded truth, undisputed by the plaintiff, is that the State of West Virginia did not sue Mr. Ballengee or Tug Valley, but it did describe Tug Valley as \"among the most notorious of the pill mill pharmacies in Southern West Virginia,\" and described in detail some of Tug Valley's concerning practices regarding the distribution of narcotics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Based on the undisputed evidence, I conclude that no reasonable juror could find that the implication that the State of West Virginia was suing Mr. Ballengee or Tug Valley \"would have a different effect on the mind of the reader from that which the pleaded truth would have produced.\"\n   <em>\n    Masson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108062\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/496/#p517\">\n    501 U.S. at 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108062\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/496/#p517\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walters v.

Mr. Ballengee failed to offer any evidence from which a reasonable juror could find that the allegedly defamatory implication is false, rather than a minor inaccuracy. Because there is no genuine dispute of material fact regarding the falsity of the allegedly defamatory implication, summary judgment on this claim is proper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 322,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p325\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202174129\">\n    2018 WL 2174129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (\"Having drawn any permissible inferences from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to petitioner, we concur with the circuit court's finding that petitioner's defamation claim fails as a matter of law because petitioner cannot establish the falsity element of his claim.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The second alleged implication is that Mr. Ballengee was criminally charged or was currently (at the time of the broadcast) under investigation by the State of West Virginia or by federal authorities.

No reasonable juror could find that Mr. Axelrod's statement that \"the problem persists\" could be reasonably understood to refer to criminally charged pharmacists. When viewing the broadcast as a whole, the only rational interpretation of \"the problem\" for any reasonable trier of fact is that it refers to the State's problem with opioid pain prescriptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Additionally, when discussing Mr. Ballengee, Mr. Axelrod says, \"Tug Valley, is now being\n   <em>\n    sued.\n   </em>\n   for\n   <em>\n    negligently.\n   </em>\n   filling prescriptions,\" and Mr. Ballengee is \"named in a\n   <em>\n    lawsuit.\n   </em>\n   alleging\n   <em>\n    substandard care.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (emphasis added). The plain and natural meaning of the words used is that Mr. Ballengee was named in a civil action.

Moreover, given the numerous references to Mr. Ballengee's involvement in\n   <em>\n    civil.\n   </em>\n   lawsuits, no reasonable juror could find that the language of the broadcast affirmatively suggests that CBS intended or endorsed the inference that Mr. Ballengee was\n   <em>\n    criminally.\n   </em>\n   charged.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517482\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/993/1087/#p1092\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, Mr. Ballengee has failed to produce evidence from which a reasonable juror could find that the\n   <em>\n    Chapin\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   elements are satisfied regarding the implication that he\n   was criminally charged or under investigation. Because no reasonable juror could find that the CBS broadcasts contained this implication, summary judgment is proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   The final alleged implication is that Mr. Ballengee \"intentionally acted illegally, acted immorally, and/or contributed to the opioid epidemic for profit.\" Pl.'s Resp. 16-17. As an initial matter, it would not be defamatory for CBS to imply that Mr. Ballengee acted immorally. \"A statement of opinion which does not contain a provably false assertion of fact is entitled to full constitutional protection.\"\n   <em>\n    Pritt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9475375\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/210/446/\">\n    557 S.E.2d at 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In fact, there is no evidence to suggest that the defendants were even aware of Mr. Ballengee's\n   contract with his ex-wife.

In the affidavit, Mr. Boggs states that the January broadcast \"alerted [him] that Tug Valley Pharmacy was a defendant in a lawsuit in Mingo County that alleged that Tug Valley Pharmacy contributed to the plaintiffs' addictions by dispensing high volumes of controlled substances.\" Boggs Aff. \u00b6 12. This \"prompted [Mr. Boggs] to initiate a review of Tug Valley Pharmacy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. As part of this review, Mr. Boggs read the plaintiffs' brief in the customers' lawsuit against Tug Valley.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.

Specifically, Mr. Ballengee claims that, due to the defendants' allegedly defamatory broadcasts, he was unable to secure employment as a pharmacist with Wal-Mart, even though he had worked there for approximately fifteen years prior to opening Tug Valley.

Again, Mr. Ballengee has produced no evidence from which a reasonable juror could find \"that the interference with his contractual relations was either desired by the actor or known by him to be a substantially certain result of his conduct.\" Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 767, cmt. d. There is no evidence to suggest that, at the time of the allegedly defamatory broadcasts, the defendants were aware of Mr. Ballengee's anticipated employment with Wal-Mart. Therefore, Mr. Ballengee has offered no evidence that the defendants\n   <em>\n    intentionally\n   </em>\n   interfered with this prospective business relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   In summary, Mr. Ballengee has offered no evidence from which a reasonable juror could find a prima facie case of tortious interference with his divorce agreement with his ex-wife, his supply agreement with McKesson, or his anticipated employment with Wal-Mart.
