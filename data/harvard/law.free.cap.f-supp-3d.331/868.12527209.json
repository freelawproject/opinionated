Schiltz, United States District Judge\n   Plaintiffs Francesca Allen, John Sterling Ross, and Mary Lou Shank are current and former employees of Wells Fargo &amp; Company (\"Wells Fargo\"). All of them held Wells Fargo stock in their 401(k) accounts. In September 2016, the price of that stock dropped sharply-and plaintiffs suffered significant losses-after Wells Fargo and the United States government announced that thousands of Wells Fargo employees had engaged in grossly unethical sales practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs then brought this lawsuit under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq., against Wells Fargo and corporate insiders who served as fiduciaries of their 401(k) plan. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants violated two distinct duties under ERISA-the duty of prudence and the duty of loyalty-by failing to disclose Wells Fargo's unethical sales practices prior to September 2016. According to plaintiffs, if defendants had disclosed this information earlier, the value of the Wells Fargo stock in their 401(k) accounts would not have dropped as much as it did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs' amended complaint. ECF No. 113. Defendants argued that plaintiffs' prudence claim should be dismissed because plaintiffs had not plausibly alleged-as\n   <em>\n    Fifth Third Bancorp v. Dudenhoeffer\n   </em>\n   requires-\"that a prudent fiduciary in the defendant's position could not have concluded that [earlier disclosure of Wells Fargo's sales practices] ... would do more harm than good to the fund ....\" --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581663\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2459/#p2473\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2473,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581663\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2459/#p2473\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). The Court agreed and dismissed the prudence claim.\n   <em>\n    In re Wells Fargo ERISA 401(k) Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-CV-3405 (PJS/BRT),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204220439\">\n    2017 WL 4220439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.

Defendants have now moved to dismiss that complaint. Defendants argue that the\n   <em>\n    Dudenhoeffer\n   </em>\n   pleading standard should be applied not only to prudence claims, but to loyalty claims-and that, under that standard, plaintiffs' loyalty claim should be dismissed for the same reasons that their prudence claim was dismissed. Defendants also argue that, even if the\n   <em>\n    Dudenhoeffer\n   </em>\n   pleading standard is not applied to plaintiffs' loyalty claim, that claim should nevertheless be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I. APPLICATION OF\n   <em>\n    DUDENHOEFFER\n   </em>\n   TO LOYALTY CLAIMS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants first argue that, even though\n   <em>\n    Dudenhoeffer\n   </em>\n   described only what was necessary to plead viable prudence claims, its pleading standard should also be applied to loyalty claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dudenhoeffer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581663\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2459/#p2473\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We limit our review to the duty-of-prudence claims.\"). To fully understand defendants' argument-and why the Court ultimately rejects it-some background is necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Prior to 1995, the federal courts were burdened with a substantial number of abusive securities-fraud actions. The filing\n   of a securities-fraud action seemed to follow on the heels of every substantial drop in the price of the stock of a publicly traded company. Congress eventually concluded that \"nuisance filings, targeting of deep-pocket defendants, vexatious discovery requests, and 'manipulation by class action lawyers of the clients whom they purportedly represent' had become rampant.\"\n   <em>\n    Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. v.

Thus, in many cases an ESOP fiduciary who fears that continuing to invest in company stock may be imprudent finds himself between a rock and a hard place: If he keeps investing and the stock goes down he may be sued for acting imprudently in violation of \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(B), but if he stops investing and the stock goes up he may be sued for disobeying the plan documents in violation of \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(D).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581663\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2459/#p2473\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   To address this concern, many courts held that ESOP fiduciaries who were sued under ERISA enjoyed a \"presumption of prudence.\" This presumption was \"generally defined as a requirement that the plaintiff make a showing that would not be required in an ordinary duty-of-prudence case, such as that the employer was on the brink of collapse.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581663\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2459/#p2473\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581663\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2459/#p2473\">\n    at 2463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Dudenhoeffer\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court eliminated the presumption of prudence, holding that \"the law does not create a\n   special presumption favoring ESOP fiduciaries.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581663\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2459/#p2473\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581663\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2459/#p2473\">\n    at 2467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

After examining plaintiffs' amended complaint, the Court concluded that \"[p]laintiffs have failed to plead specific facts to make plausible their allegation that, under the circumstances of this particular case, a prudent fiduciary 'could not have concluded' that a later disclosure would result in a smaller loss to the Fund than an earlier disclosure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Dudenhoeffer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581663\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2459/#p2473\">\n    134 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2473 ). For that reason, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' prudence claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   That brings us to plaintiffs' loyalty claim. Defendants concede that\n   <em>\n    Dudenhoeffer\n   </em>\n   was explicitly limited to prudence claims. But, say defendants, just about any prudence claim can easily be recast as a\n   loyalty claim. That is particularly true in insider-information cases. By definition, these are cases in which the defendant was a corporate insider who served as the fiduciary of an ESOP plan, the defendant received negative inside information about the company, and the plaintiff alleges that the defendant breached the duty of prudence by not disclosing or otherwise acting upon that inside information. In that context, defendants argue, turning a prudence claim into a loyalty claim requires nothing more than adding the allegation that, in failing to disclose or otherwise act upon the inside information, the defendant was motivated by a desire to protect his position as a corporate insider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To this point, the Court agrees with defendants. And the Court also agrees with defendants that-given how easy it is for a plaintiff to convert a prudence claim into a loyalty claim in an insider-information case-the Supreme Court would have as much concern about these loyalty claims as it had about the prudence claims in\n   <em>\n    Dudenhoeffer\n   </em>\n   .

In particular, defendants point to the Supreme Court's admonition that, in inside-information cases, \"lower courts ... should ... consider whether the complaint has plausibly alleged that a prudent fiduciary in the defendant's position could not have concluded that stopping purchases ... or publicly disclosing negative information would do more harm than good to the fund ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581663\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2459/#p2473\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581663\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2459/#p2473\">\n    at 2473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants urge that this more-harm-than-good standard should be applied to\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   prudence\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   loyalty claims. Given that the Court has already held that plaintiffs' prudence claim does not meet the standard, defendants argue, the Court must dismiss plaintiffs' loyalty claim for the same reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The problem with defendants' argument is that it wrenches the more-harm-than-good standard out of context. The Supreme Court was very clear in\n   <em>\n    Dudenhoeffer\n   </em>\n   about how district courts should weed out meritless prudence claims: by rigorously applying the\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   plausibility standard. And this Court is confident that, if faced with the question, the Supreme Court would hold that district courts should weed out meritless loyalty claims in the same way: by rigorously applying the\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   plausibility standard.

Or. 2016) (noting that the duty of loyalty \"looks to the fiduciary's subjective motivation in determining whether the fiduciary is in compliance with the rule\"). Thus, a plaintiff who brings a loyalty claim does not have to plead or prove anything about what a hypothetical prudent person would have done under the same circumstances; instead, the plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant acted to further his own interests rather than the interests of the fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   To illustrate: Suppose that two corporate officers serve as fiduciaries of an ERISA plan that exclusively holds their company's stock. Both fiduciaries receive inside information that one of the company's key products is defective and will likely have to be recalled. Both fiduciaries also know that when this information is ultimately disclosed, the price of the company's stock will plummet. Both fiduciaries decide to delay the disclosure of the defect to the public. The first fiduciary delays disclosure because he sincerely believes that a later disclosure will result in less of an impact on the price of the company's stock-and thus less of an impact on plan participants-because the company will be able to pair the announcement of the defect with an announcement of a specific plan to remedy the problem. The second fiduciary delays disclosure because he is scheduled to receive a bonus of 100,000 shares of company stock at the end of the year, and he does not want the price of the company's stock to drop until he gets and sells those shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In this hypothetical, a plaintiff bringing a prudence claim against the two fiduciaries would have to plead and prove that a prudent person would not have delayed disclosure of the defect. If the plaintiff did so, both fiduciaries could be found to have breached the duty of prudence; if the plaintiff failed to do so, neither fiduciary could be found to have breached the duty of prudence. The good intentions of the first fiduciary-and the bad intentions of the second fiduciary-would be irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   By contrast, a plaintiff bringing a loyalty claim against the two fiduciaries would have to plead and prove that the\n   <em>\n    reason\n   </em>\n   that a particular fiduciary delayed disclosure of the defect was to further his own interests, rather than the interests of the fund participants. Because the first fiduciary acted in subjective good faith, he could not be found to have breached the duty of loyalty. But because the second fiduciary did not act in subjective good faith, he could be found to have breached the duty of loyalty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tussey v.

At the heart of any\n   <em>\n    prudence\n   </em>\n   claim is the question of what \"a\n   <em>\n    prudent\n   </em>\n   fiduciary in the defendant's position\" could have done. But it makes no sense for a judge who is applying the\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   plausibility standard to a\n   <em>\n    loyalty\n   </em>\n   claim to ask what \"a prudent fiduciary in the defendant's position\" could have done. That is irrelevant to a loyalty claim-which, again, turns not on whether the fiduciary acted prudently, but on whether the fiduciary acted \"for the exclusive purpose of ... providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201104\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A)(i). Hence, when defendants demand that this Court apply the more-harm-than-good standard to plaintiffs' loyalty claim, defendants are demanding that plaintiffs be required to\n   <em>\n    plead\n   </em>\n   something that they are not required to\n   <em>\n    prove\n   </em>\n   . The law imposes no such requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In sum, the Court finds that the concerns that\n   <em>\n    Dudenhoeffer\n   </em>\n   expressed about prudence claims apply with equal force to loyalty claims, and therefore that judges must be as concerned about weeding out meritless loyalty claims as they are about weeding out meritless prudence claims. The Court also finds that the \"mechanism for weeding out meritless claims\" described in\n   <em>\n    Dudenhoeffer\n   </em>\n   -a rigorous application of the\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   plausibility standard-should be applied to both loyalty and prudence claims.\n   <em>\n    Dudenhoeffer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581663\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2459/#p2473\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This Court has previously held (following the lead of many other courts) that ERISA should not be read to impose \"an affirmative duty on a corporate insider who acts as a fiduciary of a defined-contribution plan to disclose to plan participants nonpublic (i.e., 'inside') information about the corporation that might affect the value of the corporation's stock.\"\n   <em>\n    Wright v.

But\n   this does not save plaintiffs' loyalty claim from dismissal for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   First, the Court is not sure whether plaintiffs actually mean to pursue an affirmative-misrepresentation claim. In their brief, plaintiffs argue only that defendants breached their duty of loyalty \"[t]hrough their silence and inaction.\" ECF No. 202 at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Second, if plaintiffs intended to plead an affirmative-misrepresentation claim, then they have abandoned it. Defendants' opening brief argued that any allegation in the second amended complaint that defendants had \"acted disloyally by making misrepresentations\" was insufficient to state a claim for relief. ECF No. 198 at 23-24. Plaintiffs said nothing in response to that specific argument. In fact, plaintiffs' response brief uses a form of the word \"misrepresent\" only twice-once in a string cite for the proposition that \"courts have upheld conflict of interest claims,\" and once in a string cite for the proposition that \"Eighth Circuit precedent recognizes the ability, and even the obligation, of fiduciaries to disclose material facts to ERISA beneficiaries.\" ECF No. 202 at 21-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Third, although a few paragraphs in the second amended complaint could be read as alleging that defendants made affirmative misrepresentations, nothing in the complaint could be read as alleging that defendants made such misrepresentations\n   <em>\n    in their fiduciary capacity\n   </em>\n   . Public filings or communications that are \"made in a company's corporate capacity-and not in its capacity as an ERISA fiduciary-... do not, without more, constitute fiduciary communications.\"\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4207893\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/607/1033/#p1058\">\n    607 F.Supp.2d at 1054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The second amended complaint alleges that defendants misled the general public in a media interview,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 186 \u00b6 146; in Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\"FINRA\") forms,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 170-71; and in a press release,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 172-73. None of these are plausibly alleged to have been fiduciary communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Fourth, the second amended complaint does not allege that plaintiffs chose to continue holding Wells Fargo stock in their 401(k) account\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   of any affirmative misrepresentation made by defendants. At best, the second amended complaint only makes the general and conclusory allegation that plaintiffs \"lost a significant portion of their retirement investments\" \"[a]s a direct and proximate result of Individual Defendants' fiduciary duty breaches.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 323. This allegation does not make plausible any allegation of reliance. As this Court has previously noted, \"for plaintiffs to recover for defendants' alleged misrepresentations to Plan participants, they must show that a loss 'result[ed] from' the misrepresentations.\"\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%2031501\">\n    2011 WL 31501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201109\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ). It is difficult to see \"how a loss could have 'result[ed] from' a misrepresentation made to a Plan participant unless that participant read and relied on the misrepresentation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201109\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Fifth, and finally, the Court is skeptical that the alleged misrepresentations identified in the second amended complaint are actionable. For example, plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo falsely represented that it had taken \"deadly seriously\" the accusation that its employees had pushed unwanted products on customers. ECF No. 186 \u00b6 146. This representation seems to be more of an (unprovably false) statement of opinion rather than a (provably false) statement of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In short, plaintiffs allege that defendants acted disloyally by failing to avoid conflicts of interest, by failing to disclose inside corporate information to plan participants, and (perhaps) by affirmatively misleading the general public. For the reasons\n   explained above, these allegations are insufficient to make plausible the claim that defendants breached their duty of loyalty under ERISA. Therefore, plaintiffs' loyalty claim is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   III. OTHER CLAIMS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In Count II of their second amended complaint, plaintiffs replead their previously-dismissed prudence claim solely for the purpose of preserving it for appeal. The Court again dismisses this claim for the reasons stated in its previous order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Wells Fargo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204220439\">\n    2017 WL 4220439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Counts III and IV of the second amended complaint are entirely derivative of Counts I and II in that they allege that if one or more defendants breached the duty of loyalty or prudence, other defendants should also be held liable for that breach. Given that the Court has held that plaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege that any of the defendants breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA, Counts III and IV also fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   ORDER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Based on the foregoing, and on all of the files, records, and proceedings herein, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   1. Defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' second amended complaint [ECF No. 196] is GRANTED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   2. Plaintiffs' second amended complaint [ECF No. 186] is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   LET JUDGMENT BE ENTERED ACCORDINGLY.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    At oral argument, defendants agreed with this description of the contrasting nature of prudence and loyalty claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 209 at 3-6. In their brief, however, defendants cite\n    <em>\n     In reTarget Corp. Securities Litigation\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12419016\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/275/1063/#p1089\">\n     275 F.Supp.3d 1063\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1089 (D. Minn. 2017), to argue that the duty of loyalty standard is objective. ECF No. 198 at 21 n.9. But when the Court reads\n    <em>\n     In re Target\n    </em>\n    in context, the Court believes that the order was simply making the point that a fiduciary's decision should not be deemed disloyal just because it turns out to be a poor decision in hindsight.\n    <em>\n     In re Target\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12419016\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/275/1063/#p1089\">\n     275 F.Supp.3d at 1089\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . To the extent that\n    <em>\n     In re Target\n    </em>\n    suggests something more-specifically, that whether a defendant has breached the duty of loyalty is evaluated under an objective standard-the Court respectfully disagrees, for the reasons described above. The only authority cited by\n    <em>\n     In re Target\n    </em>\n    in support of its statement that the duty of loyalty standard \"is objective\" is\n    <em>\n     Braden\n    </em>\n    . But\n    <em>\n     Braden\n    </em>\n    does not say that the duty of loyalty is objective; instead,\n    <em>\n     Braden\n    </em>\n    says that ERISA's \"\n    <em>\n     prudent\n    </em>\n    person standard is an objective standard.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Braden\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3495155\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/585/#p595\">\n     588 F.3d at 595\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citation omitted and emphasis added).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
