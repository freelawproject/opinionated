DAVID PROCTOR, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case is before the court on Plaintiffs' Motion for Remand. (Doc. # 3). The parties have fully briefed the motion (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docs. # 3, 11, 12), and the court held oral argument on the motion on July 9, 2018. After careful review, and for the reasons explained below, the court concludes that Plaintiffs' Motion for Remand (Doc. # 3) is due to be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs Laura Ownby and Lisa Wright are Alabama residents who received care from Dr. Paul Castellanos at the University of Alabama Birmingham, Academic and Medical Center (\"UAB Hospital\"). (Doc. # 1-1 at p. 9, \u00b6 1). Dr. Castellanos is an otolaryngologist and airway surgeon who Plaintiffs describe as a \"surgeon of 'last resort' \" for individuals with \"obstructive airway disease, intractable swallowing disorders, and the inability to produce a natural voice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 10, \u00b6 2). Until May 2018, Dr. Castellanos was employed by the University of Alabama at Birmingham (\"UAB\") and the University of Alabama Health Services Foundation, P.C. (\"UAHSF\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 11-12, \u00b6\u00b6 3-4). Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Dr. William Carroll, the department chair of Dr. Castellanos' department, counseled him to focus on \"simpler cases\" in order to improve the department's statistical outcomes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 12, \u00b6 4). Moreover, they allege that no other physician or surgeon at UAB Hospital would treat them or other \"critical airway patients.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 12, 14, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In March 2018, Plaintiffs filed a five-count Complaint in Alabama state court. (Doc. # 1-1 at 8-23). First, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have abandoned patients who need \"further, continued treatment by Dr. Castellanos or a replacement surgeon of the same level of skill, willingness, and experience.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 15, \u00b6 6). Plaintiffs claim that the medical care that has been provided to them by UAB Hospital \"may not be abandoned without reasonable notice or the provision of a competent replacement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Second, Plaintiffs allege that three of the Defendants breached an implied contract in fact to offer them medical services performed by Dr. Castellanos. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 17-18, \u00b6 8). They specifically contend that these Defendants breached the implied contract by interrupting the physician-patient relationships between Dr. Castellanos and themselves. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Third, Plaintiffs allege that Dr. Carroll tortiously interfered with contractual relationships between Plaintiffs, Dr. Castellanos, and Castellanos' employers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 18-19, \u00b6 9). They contend that Dr. Carroll sought to force Dr. Castellanos and his high-risk patients away from UAB Hospital. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Fourth, Plaintiffs allege that Dr. Carroll negligently and wantonly performed his duties as a supervising physician by attempting to force Dr. Castellanos' removal from UAB Hospital's staff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20, \u00b6 10). Finally, Plaintiffs request injunctive relief, including (1) the reversal of UAB's decision to remove Dr. Castellanos from UAB Hospital's staff until, at a minimum, a replacement physician with similar skills and willingness to treat high-risk airway patients can be found, and (2) the reversal of actions taken to interfere with or curtail necessary medical treatment that has been provided to Plaintiffs at UAB Hospital. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 20-22, \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After Plaintiffs filed the Complaint, the parties submitted a stream of motions, most of which do not require discussion. On May 16, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a motion for declaratory and/or injunctive relief after the state court had set a preliminary injunction hearing for May 24, 2018. (Doc. # 1-8 at 203-04). On May 17, 2018, Plaintiffs also filed an Amended Complaint that named Dr. Robert Brunner, the chair of UAB Hospital's Credentialing Committee, as a Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 228-29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 23, 2018 (the day before the scheduled preliminary injunction hearing), Defendant Brunner removed this case from state court to this court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1367, and 1441. (Doc. # 1). Brunner explained that the state-law claims in the Complaint implicate substantial federal interests because physician credentialing is governed by the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 (\"HCQIA\") and the Conditions of Participation issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7). Brunner stated that the Complaint implicated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (\"EMTALA\") because Plaintiffs sought to require the hospital to offer specialized capabilities after it terminated Dr. Castellanos. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7). Additionally, Brunner contended that Plaintiffs artfully pled their claims to avoid federal questions regarding privileging and staff appointments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8). Finally, Brunner asserted that complete preemption justified this court's jurisdiction because federal law completely preempts any state laws regarding physician credentialing, staff governance, medical staff bylaws, quality assurance, or emergency medical services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs promptly moved to remand the case back to state court. (Doc. # 3). They emphasize in their remand motion that Defendants cannot justify a removal based upon a question of federal law raised as an anticipated defense. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). And, they insist that their claims do not require UAB Hospital or UAHSF to re-credential Dr. Castellanos. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   It is axiomatic that this court has limited jurisdiction and is \"empowered to hear only those cases within the judicial power of the United States as defined by Article III of the Constitution, and which have been entrusted to them by a jurisdictional grant authorized by Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    Univ. of S. Ala. v. Am. Tobacco Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11639398\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/168/405/#p408\">\n    168 F.3d 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 408 (11th Cir. 1999) (internal quotation omitted). The removing party bears the burden of proving the court's jurisdiction, and any doubts about the propriety of federal jurisdiction should be resolved in favor of remand.\n   <em>\n    Adventure Outdoors, Inc. v. Bloomberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011900\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/552/1290/#p1294\">\n    552 F.3d 1290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1294 (11th Cir. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Complete Preemption Does Not Justify This Court's Subject-Matter Jurisdiction Over Plaintiffs' Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In their opposition brief to the Motion to Remand, Defendants UAHSF, UAB Health System Board of Directors, Dr. Carroll, and Dr. Brunner argue that Plaintiffs' claims are completely preempted by the Conditions of Participation issued by CMS. (Doc. # 11 at 17). The court is not convinced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"Complete preemption is a narrow exception to the well-pleaded complaint rule and exists where the preemptive force of a federal statute is so extraordinary that it converts an ordinary state law claim into a statutory federal claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Conn. State Dental Ass'n v. Anthem Health Plans, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3508813,3507733\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/591/1337/\">\n    591 F.3d 1337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1343 (11th Cir. 2009). To date, complete preemption has been held by\n   the Supreme Court to exist only with respect to claims seeking benefits under a plan governed by ERISA, labor contracts governed by the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, and usury claims against federally-chartered banks under the National Bank Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3508813,3507733\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/591/1337/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1343-44 &amp; n. 3. Complete preemption arises only where \"the federal statutes at issue provide[ ] the exclusive cause of action for the claim asserted and also set forth procedures and remedies governing that cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Beneficial Nat'l Bank v. Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896908\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/1/#p8\">\n    539 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896908\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/1/#p8\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896908\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/1/#p8\">\n    156 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003) (referencing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20185\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   &amp; 1132). To decide whether a federal cause of action completely preempts related state-law causes of action, the court assesses Congress's intent in creating the cause of action by examining \"such questions as whether the state claim is displaced by federal law under an ordinary preemption analysis, whether the federal statute provides a cause of action, what kind of jurisdictional language exists in the federal statute, and what kind of language is present in the legislative history to evince Congress's intentions.\"\n   <em>\n    Blab T.V. of Mobile, Inc. v. Comcast Cable Commc'ns, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11548365\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/182/851/#p857\">\n    182 F.3d 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 857 (11th Cir. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Here, Defendants have failed to show that the CMS regulations cited in the notice of removal and their opposition to remand brief create any cause of action, much less an exclusive federal-law cause of action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. # 1 at 8, 11 at 17). Defendants do not specify which federal regulation creates a cause of action related to the causes of action in the Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 11 at 17). Moreover, the statutes cited by Defendants --\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201395\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395c -- reflect no Congressional intent to establish an exclusive federal-law cause of action. Defendants point to no legislative history that would support applying complete preemption to the claims in Plaintiffs' Complaint. Finally, in other contexts, district courts in this circuit have concluded that provisions in the Medicare Act and the Medicaid Act do not completely preempt state law regulating various healthcare fields.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Main &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Ala.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3832609\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/776/1270/#p1281\">\n    776 F.Supp.2d 1270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1281-82 (M.D. Ala. 2011) (concluding that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g), 1395w-22(g)(5), and 1395w-26(b)(3) did not completely preempt the plaintiff's claims that the defendant insurer wrongfully and tortiously failed to reimburse it in accordance with Medicare regulations);\n   <em>\n    Kennedy v. Health Options, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9217483\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/329/1314/#p1316\">\n    329 F.Supp.2d 1314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1316-17 (S.D. Fla. 2004) (concluding that the Medicare Act did not completely preempt breach-of-contract and breach-of-fiduciary-duty claims seeking damages arising from the plaintiff's premature discharge from a hospital). For these reasons, the court cannot exercise subject-matter jurisdiction over these claims under the complete preemption doctrine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. None of Plaintiffs' Claims Require Resolution of a Substantial Federal Question\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In their opposition brief to the Motion to Remand, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' claims raise substantial federal issues because the claims implicate Defendants' duties under the HCQIA, CMS's Conditions of Participation, and the EMTALA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Doc. # 11 at 10). They contend that the HCQIA provides several credentialing standards and guidelines that must be applied in resolving Plaintiffs' claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896908\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/1/#p8\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Similarly, CMS's regulations require UAB Hospital to create certain procedures for credentialing. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896908\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/1/#p8\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896908\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/1/#p8\">\n    at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896908\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/1/#p8\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Finally, according to Defendants, the EMTALA is implicated in this action because Plaintiffs claim that they are entitled to specialized care from UAB Hospital. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896908\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/1/#p8\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896908\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/1/#p8\">\n    at 11-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896908\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/1/#p8\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A claim may arise under federal law, for purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , if it necessarily presents a substantial federal issue. This \"special and small category\" of claims consists of those for which \"a federal issue is: (1) necessarily raised, (2) actually disputed, (3) substantial, and (4) capable of resolution in federal court without disrupting the federal-state balance approved by Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    Gunn v.

Defendants have not pointed to any federal-law cause of action created by Congress that Plaintiffs could have raised under these circumstances. No federal statute or legislative history expresses Congress's intent to remove from a state court to this court claims of abandonment, breach of contract, tortious interference, or negligence where the defendant is a hospital, an entity governing a hospital, or a professional performing services in a hospital.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adventure Outdoors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011900\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/552/1290/#p1294\">\n    552 F.3d at 1303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the defendants there failed to identify \"any provision of the federal criminal law that expresses a\n   congressional intent to remove state defamation cases from state court jurisdiction\").

The court is not persuaded for two reasons. First,\n   <em>\n    Stratienko\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from this case because the plaintiff in that case filed his state-court action while a related federal-court action was pending, so the court there had good reason to find that the plaintiff artfully pled his complaint to avoid federal-question jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%2011342543\">\n    2008 WL 11342543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. Second,\n   <em>\n    Stratienko\n   </em>\n   does not convince the court that federal-question jurisdiction exists here because it fails to discuss the Supreme Court's recent decisions on substantial-federal-question jurisdiction in\n   <em>\n    Grable\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Empire Healthchoice\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Gunn\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stratienko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%2011342543\">\n    2008 WL 11342543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To be sure, it appears that any contractual relationships between Plaintiffs and UAB Hospital required UAB Hospital and its personnel to perform duties in compliance with several federal laws and regulations governing health care. However, the court is not convinced that the specific contractual provision allegedly breached -- an agreement to provide Dr. Castellanos' services -- necessarily raises a question of federal law. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. # 1-1 at p. 17, \u00b6 8).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The court emphasizes that it has reviewed whether it can exercise subject-matter jurisdiction based upon Plaintiffs' current pleadings and their pending motion for declaratory and/or injunctive relief. To date, Plaintiffs have only raised state-law claims, have sought both monetary and equitable relief, and have claimed that they are willing to accept equitable remedies other than Dr. Castellanos' reinstatement at UAB Hospital. To be clear, Plaintiffs' oral argument caused the court to question whether they actually would accept monetary relief for the alleged state-law violations if their preferred equitable relief is barred. Nevertheless, the court must accept Plaintiffs' pleadings and other paper as they now exist. If Plaintiffs later insist on specific forms of equitable relief not specified in their current pleadings and motions, their filings might very well justify re-removal of this action under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(3) at that time.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
