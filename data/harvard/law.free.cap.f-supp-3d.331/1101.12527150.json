BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 17, 2013, Plaintiffs commenced this action by filing a Complaint in this Court. (ECF No. 1). On September 22, 2016, Plaintiffs filed the Fourth Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"), which is the operative complaint in this action. (ECF No. 165). In the FAC, Plaintiffs assert\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims for Fourth Amendment unreasonable seizure and Fifth Amendment due process against Defendant Diaz and Defendant Fisher.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 138-152.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 1, 2017, Defendant Diaz filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. (ECF No. 177). On April 1, 2017, Defendant Fisher filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. (ECF No. 179). On June 26, 2017, Defendants filed a notice of supplemental authority. (ECF No. 190). On July 17, 2017, the Court ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefing on the notice of supplemental authority. (ECF No. 192). On August 15, 2017, the Court heard oral argument on both Motions for Summary Judgment. (ECF No. 197). On August 23, 2017, Defendants filed a second notice of supplemental authority. (ECF No. 198). On September 7, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a response to Defendants' second notice of supplemental briefing. (ECF No. 200).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 21, 2011, Jesus Alfredo Ya\u00f1ez Reyes (\"Ya\u00f1ez\") and Jose Ibarra-Murietta (\"Murietta\") crossed the border from Mexico to the United States through a hole in the primary border fence approximately 1.6 miles west of the San Ysidro Port of Entry. Both Ya\u00f1ez and Murietta were not United States citizens, and entered the United States illegally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At approximately 7:00 p.m., Defendant Diaz observed Ya\u00f1ez and Murietta hiding in the brush on the north side of the primary border fence while sitting in his patrol car. Defendant Diaz radioed for assistance from Agent Nelson, who was the closest Agent in the area; Agent Nelson arrived approximately one minute later. As\n   Defendant Diaz and Agent Nelson got out of their patrol cars to pursue the suspects, Ya\u00f1ez retreated south through the hole in the fence. Meanwhile, Murietta remained on the north side of the primary border fence and physically resisted Agent Nelson's attempt to arrest him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After continuing to struggle with Murietta, Agent Nelson backed away from Murietta to create distance between the two. Murietta then began running eastward away from Agent Nelson. As he was running, Murietta remained in the United States on the northern side of the primary border fence. Agent Nelson chased Murietta until Murietta eventually tripped. Agent Nelson jumped onto Murietta to try and apprehend him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ya\u00f1ez reappeared on the primary border fence above the area where Agent Nelson and Murietta were grappling on the ground. Defendant Diaz and Agent Nelson testified at their respective depositions that, after reappearing on top of the fence, Ya\u00f1ez threw rocks and a wooden board in the direction of Agent Nelson and Murietta. (ECF No. 177-10 at 15-16, 42; ECF No. 182-1 at 22). Murietta testified at his deposition that he did not see Ya\u00f1ez throw anything. (ECF No. 180-3 at 29). Defendant Diaz shouted multiple warnings to Ya\u00f1ez to stop interfering with Murietta's arrest. After Ya\u00f1ez did not comply with Defendant Diaz's instructions, Defendant Diaz drew his service firearm and pointed it at Ya\u00f1ez. Ya\u00f1ez saw the weapon and disappeared back down the south side of the primary border fence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant Diaz attempted to help Agent Nelson apprehend and handcuff Murietta. As Agent Nelson continued to try to handcuff Murietta, Defendant Diaz walked further west in an attempt to surprise Ya\u00f1ez in the event he reappeared on the fence. Defendant Diaz then observed Ya\u00f1ez reappear at the top of the primary border fence, make a fist, and begin the motion of throwing something down towards Agent Nelson and Murietta. Defendant Diaz drew his service weapon and shot Yanez. Murietta was subsequently arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
