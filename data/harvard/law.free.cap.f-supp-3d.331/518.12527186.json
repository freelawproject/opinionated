Defendants Plain Green, LLC (\"Plain Green\") and Great Plains (collectively, \"Defendants\") responded to the Motion for Discovery, (ECF Nos. 43, 45), and Plaintiffs replied, (ECF Nos. 51, 55). Plaintiffs responded to Great Plains's Motion to Stay, (ECF No. 67), and Great Plains replied, (ECF No. 69).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Accordingly, the matters are ripe for disposition. The Court dispenses with oral argument because the materials before it adequately present the facts and legal contentions, and argument would not aid the decisional process. The Court exercises jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 1367.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court granted the Motion for Discovery and denied the Motion to Stay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I.

Allegedly, Defendants offered loans to Plaintiffs in amounts ranging from $300 to $3,000, charging interest rates ranging from 118% to 448%. Plaintiffs bring this suit on behalf of themselves and all individuals similarly situated, alleging that Defendants' lending enterprises violate state and federal lending laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants structured their businesses to benefit from the protections of tribal sovereign immunity even though they do not constitute tribal entities. Defendants did so, Plaintiffs contend, in order to evade state and federal lending laws. Plaintiffs contend that Defendants' fraudulent posture as tribal entities eradicates any potential claim to the protection of tribal sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, Kenneth Rees,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   not a tribal member, orchestrated the so-called \"rent-a-tribe\" scheme at issue in this case. (Compl. \u00b6 26-27, ECF No. 1.) Under a \"rent-a-tribe\" model, a non-tribal entity and a tribe agree to establish a lending company in the tribe's name. The tribe nominally establishes the company, ostensibly extending its sovereign immunity to the new tribal entity, in exchange for a small percentage of the revenue. This is designed to allow the company to evade compliance with state usury laws because, as an arm of the tribe, it cannot be sued by consumers or prosecuted by the government.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas v. Dugan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=168%20F.3d%20483\">\n    168 F.3d 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 1998) (\"Tribal entities and individual tribal officers acting within their representative capacity within the scope of their authority are also shielded by sovereign immunity.\") The non-tribal entity retains the majority of the profits and controls the lending entity, from major business decisions to day-to-day operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that in early 2011, Rees sent a letter to the Chippewa Cree Tribe proposing a joint lending venture with a company owned by Rees. Plaintiffs contend the tribe agreed to participate in the lending scheme within two weeks of receiving this letter, and subsequently formed Plain Green. Shortly thereafter, Rees allegedly contacted the Otoe-Missouria Tribe in Oklahoma with a similar proposal, and that tribe formed Great Plains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plain Green and Great Plains are structured almost identically. According to Plaintiffs, the Chippewa Cree Tribe and the Otoe-Missouria Tribe (collectively, the \"Tribes\") were paid a nominal fee for establishing the entities under their names, but \"otherwise had no control over the income, expenses, or day-to-day operations of the entities.\" (Compl. \u00b6 35.) Plaintiffs state that third parties who were not members of the tribes or located on the reservations performed nearly all activities associated with the companies, including processing payments, maintaining the call centers, and servicing the loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Specifically, Plaintiffs claim Rees controls multiple companies that actually operate the lending businesses and reap the profits. For example, GPL Servicing, Ltd. (\"GPLS\"), owned by Rees, accepted consumer payments on behalf of the Tribes after loan agreements were executed rather than either Plain Green or Great Plains. GPLS, according to Plaintiffs, transferred no more than 4.5% of the revenue to the Tribes, though Plaintiffs allege the actual amount is even lower because \"most of this money was siphoned for the personal benefit of certain tribal members.\" (Compl. \u00b6 46.) Furthermore, Plaintiffs contend, the money lent to Plaintiffs was transferred from a bank account owned and operated by Think Finance, LLC, another company Rees owned. Allegedly, Tailwind Marketing, LLC, also owned by Rees, generated leads to identify potential consumers to solicit. Plaintiffs further contend that Rees's company TC Decision Sciences operated Defendants' websites, served as the administrator of their software, and handled customer service responsibilities at a monthly cost to Defendants. Although Defendants present themselves as the lenders of the loans they issued, Plaintiffs assert that Rees and the companies he formed control day-to-day operations and major business decisions on behalf of Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs filed a five-count putative class action Complaint against Defendants alleging various state and federal violations associated with an illegally usurious loan enterprise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs seek: (1) a declaratory judgment that the loan agreements are void and unenforceable; (2) injunctive relief ordering the defendants to divest themselves of any interest in the enterprise pled in the complaint, including the receipt of racketeering profits, prohibiting the defendants from continuing to engage in the enterprise, and ordering the dissolution of each defendant that has engaged in the enterprise; (3) compensatory damages; and, (4) costs and attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plain Green filed a Motion to Dismiss without Leave to Amend or, in the Alternative, to Compel Arbitration. (ECF No. 26.) Great Plains filed three separate motions: (1) a Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction, (ECF No. 28); (2) a Motion to Compel Arbitration, (ECF No. 30); and, (3) a Motion to Transfer Case, (ECF No. 32). Defendants each moved to dismiss based on a claim of sovereign immunity under Rule 12(b)(1). (ECF Nos. 26, 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs filed the Motion for Discovery, seeking jurisdictional discovery on the issue of Defendants' claim of sovereign immunity. (ECF No. 34.) Defendants each opposed the Motion for Discovery. (ECF Nos. 43, 45.) The Court suspended briefing on Defendants' Motions to Dismiss pending its ruling on the Motion for Discovery. (ECF No. 42.) On May 9, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Authority (\"Plaintiffs' Motion to File Supplemental\n   Authority\"), (ECF No. 62) requesting leave to submit a recent court order in a case they allege is similar to the one at bar.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On May 9, 2018, Great Plains filed the Motion to Stay based on a case development. (ECF No. 64.) Specifically, Great Plains has moved to consolidate and transfer this case in the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (\"JPML\"). (ECF No. 64.) Great Plains seeks to consolidate three cases in a multi-district litigation (\"MDL\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Great Plains requests a stay of these proceedings pending the JPML ruling on Defendants' pending Motion for Consolidation and Transfer filed in\n   <em>\n    In Re: Great Plains Lending, LLC Litigation\n   </em>\n   , MDL No. 2851. The JPML was scheduled to hear the motion on July 26, 2018. No MDL exists until the JPML rules on the Motion for Consolidation and Transfer. On June 13, 2018, Great Plains filed a Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Authority (\"Great Plains's Motion to File Supplemental Authority\"), (ECF No. 71), requesting leave to submit a recent court order granting a stay in one of the two other cases that is part of its JPML request.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

Great Plains fails to show clear or convincing circumstances showing that the interest of judicial economy justifies granting a stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Because Great Plains seeks to consolidate only three cases in the JPML, the risk of needless duplication of work and waste of judicial resources is low. In the context of the motions to consolidate and transfer actions before the JPML, Defendants' three pending actions pale in comparison to the typical number of actions consolidated to MDL. This Court need not make any conclusion regarding the likelihood that the JPML will grant Great Plains's Motion for Consolidation and Transfer to conclude that judicial resources would not be wasted if the case at bar is allowed to proceed. The exceptionally low volume of actions that Great Plains seeks to consolidate and transfer to an MDL by itself evinces a very low risk of duplicative work and judicial waste, even if the actions are ultimately consolidated and transferred. The usual concerns about judicial work duplicated across tens, hundreds, or even thousands of pending actions simply do not pertain to the case at bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Although denying a stay can risk waste, the opposite can also be true:\n   <em>\n    granting\n   </em>\n   a stay may waste judicial resources.\n   <em>\n    Hooker v. Sirius XM Radio, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 4:13CV3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2010937407\">\n    2015 WL 10937407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 3-4 (Sept. 25, 2015) (\"Defendant asserts that not granting a stay would cause a 'waste of time,' but the Court concludes that granting the stay would likely be a greater waste of time.\"). Here, where parties have substantially briefed the Court on various issues and the Court has ruled on the Motion for Discovery, Great Plains falls well short of showing that a stay would serve the interest of judicial economy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Potential Hardship to Great Plains Does Not Justify a Stay\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   With only three actions pending consolidation before the JPML, the potential hardship to Great Plains of having to defend multiple lawsuits across the country is minimal. The two other actions pending transfer to the proposed multi-district litigation pose especially small burdens on Defendants. As Great Plains informed the Court, the Northern District of California has ordered a stay in\n   <em>\n    Brice v. Rees\n   </em>\n   pending the decision of the JPML. (Order Granting Mot. Stay 1, ECF No. 72-1.) The parties in\n   <em>\n    Granger v. Great Plains Lending\n   </em>\n   have agreed to a stay pending mediation. (Great Plains Reply Mot. Stay 4 (referring to No. 1:18-CV-112 (M.D.N.C.) (Orders Granting Joint Motion to Stay).) Great Plains's proferred evidence, therefore, actually weighs against granting a stay. Great Plains's concern that it will be burdened by the need to respond to litigation beyond the present action if a stay is not granted is largely unfounded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   More importantly, the potential inconvenience does not rise to the level of hardship\n   that might justify a stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sehler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205184216\">\n    2013 WL 5184216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *3. In\n   <em>\n    Sehler\n   </em>\n   , similar to the case at bar, the defendants requested a stay pending the JMPL's ruling on the defendants' motion to transfer and consolidate various pending actions across the country.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205184216\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As part of the pending actions, the defendants had taken part in \"over twenty Rule 26(f) conferences and been served with 'ten nearly identical sets of discovery.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3.

In\n   <em>\n    Williford\n   </em>\n   , the court found that even the foreseeable need to relitigate complex asbestosis claims across multiple courts at various times did not outweigh the plaintiff's right to a timely resolution of his case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1882320,6127795\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/715/124/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1882320,6127795\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/715/124/\">\n    at 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The potential burden on Great Plains is lower here than in\n   <em>\n    Williford\n   </em>\n   because fewer actions are pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Great Plains argues that subjecting a sovereign entity to \"unnecessary and burdensome discovery\" is an especially significant hardship that justifies granting a stay here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crawford-El v.

Great Plains attempts to put the proverbial cart before the horse: Plaintiffs have accused Defendants of fraudulently presenting themselves as tribal entities for the purpose of availing themselves of the protections of sovereign immunity. This distinguishes the case at hand from\n   <em>\n    Crawford-El\n   </em>\n   , where the officials' status was not in dispute.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503978\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/574/#p598\">\n    523 U.S. 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503978\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/574/#p598\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Where, as here, the crux of the underlying controversy revolves around a challenge to Defendants' sovereign status, Great Plains's disputed claim of sovereign immunity neither clearly nor convincingly justifies a stay. In short, Defendants cannot invoke the protection of sovereign immunity when that very right to protection is contested.
