When the \"record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party,\" there is no genuine issue of material fact, and summary judgment is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Simmons-Harris v. Zelman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11151175\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/234/945/#p951\">\n    234 F.3d 945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 951 (6th Cir. 2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Once the moving party in a summary judgment motion identifies portions of the record which demonstrate the absence of a genuine dispute over material facts, the opposing party may not then \"rely on the hope that the trier of fact will disbelieve the movant's denial of a disputed fact,\" but must make an affirmative evidentiary showing to defeat the motion.\n   <em>\n    Street v.
