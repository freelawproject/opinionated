MOODY\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the court on the cross motions for summary judgment filed by plaintiffs Christopher Regan and Northwest Indiana Creative Investors Association, Inc. (\"NICIA\") and defendant City of Hammond, Indiana. For the reasons identified below, plaintiffs' motion\n   (DE # 39) will be denied and defendant's motion (DE # 46) will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Christopher Regan owns and leases real property in the City of Hammond. (DE # 1 at 1.) Regan lives in Cook County, Illinois. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff NICIA is a non-profit corporation acting as a trade association for real estate investors who lease real property in Hammond. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) In their complaint, plaintiffs allege that sections of Hammond's municipal code are unconstitutional because the Code requires Hammond property owners who do not reside in their property to obtain licenses, or hire licensed contractors, to complete home repairs, but the Code exempts homeowners who live in their Hammond homes from this requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Hammond municipal code requires persons engaged in \"the business of a building contractor\" in Hammond to be licensed. Hammond Municipal Code \u00a7 150.017. However, the Code specifically exempts resident homeowners from the licensing requirement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (B) Nothing contained in this subchapter shall prohibit the resident homeowner of a private residence from doing building contracting in his or her own private home and surrounding property, providing he or she resides there, is able to establish proof of residency, and is in compliance with all requirement tests and regulations provided by law and this code. Falsification or misidentification of residency is a violation of this section and is subject to penalty as set forth in \u00a7 150.999. A resident homeowner excluded under this section acts as his or her own contractor and assumes all responsibility for work done. All work must be done in a workmanship manner and there must be compliance with all codes and laws. If the owner of the property chooses to hire a contractor, such contractor must be licensed in the city.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Hammond Municipal Code \u00a7 150.017. The Code definition of \"Building Contractor\" for purposes of Section 150.017, includes \"[a]ny person or persons who own a building that they lease or rent;\" but excludes \"[i]ndividuals who remodel the single family residence in which they reside; upon review and inspection(s) by the Building Commissioner.\" Hammond Municipal Code \u00a7 150.015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that these sections of the Code violate the dormant Commerce Clause by imposing an \"improper, unreasonable burden on interstate commerce by charging higher fees to non-city owners of Hammond property than to Hammond-domiciled owners of property.\" (DE # 40 at 1.) Plaintiffs also claim that the Code provisions run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the provisions are not related to any legitimate government interest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant, on the other hand, contends that the ordinance provisions have no effect on interstate commerce because the provisions treat all similarly situated persons the same, regardless of their location. (DE # 46 at 1.) Defendant claims that the City's regulation of for-profit building contractors and landlords, but not resident\n   homeowners repairing their single-family homes, is rationally related to legitimate governmental interests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.) Thus, the City argues, the ordinances survive review under both the dormant Commerce Clause and the Equal Protection Clause. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Both parties have moved for summary judgment.

The Hammond Ordinances are Not Facially Discriminatory\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs insist that the Hammond ordinances fall into the first category of facially discriminatory laws that must withstand strict scrutiny review. They argue that the laws \"expressly discriminate[ ] in favor of city homeowner residents over city homeowner non-residents.\" (DE # 40 at 17.) Plaintiffs repeatedly suggest that the ordinances discriminate against non-resident homeowners in Hammond. This is incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The ordinances do not discriminate between Hammond residents and non-Hammond residents. While the effect of the ordinances is to distinguish (by way of exemption) between resident and non-resident homeowners, a non-resident homeowner is a person who does not live in the home in question-not, as plaintiffs suggest, a person who is not a resident of Hammond. Under the ordinances, building contractors, general contractors, real estate developers, and landlords would all be considered \"non-residents.\" The ordinances treat all of these property owners the same, regardless of whether they reside in Hammond. A Hammond resident who owns and leases a second home in Hammond would be required to obtain a license for certain repairs on the second property, as would a Chicago resident who owns and leases property in Hammond. Thus, the ordinances do not facially discriminate against out-of-state residents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    ii. The Ordinances Do Not Discriminate Against Similarly Situated Persons\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the ordinances \"discriminatorily burden[ ] them over similarly situated (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , property-owning) Hammond residents.\" (DE # 40 at 5.) The Supreme Court has held, \"any notion of discrimination assumes a comparison of substantially similar entities.... [However,] when the allegedly competing entities provide different products ... there is a threshold question whether the companies\n   are indeed similarly situated for constitutional purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    Gen. Motors Corp. v.

Where the entities in question are not similarly situated because they serve different markets, and would continue to serve different markets even if the allegedly discriminatory regulation was removed, there is no competition between favored and disfavored entities and thus there is no local preference or undue burden that could violate the dormant Commerce Clause.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595433\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/278/#p298\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595433\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/278/#p298\">\n    at 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595433\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/278/#p298\">\n    117 S.Ct. 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Landlords, real estate developers, and general contractors developing or improving land as part of for-profit business operations are not similarly situated to resident homeowners making improvements to their own single-family homes. While resident homeowners will bear the risk of their own poor craftsmanship, building contractors and landlords impose the risk of faulty construction upon current or future tenants. Moreover, these classes of persons are not in competition with one another. If the resident homeowner exemption was removed, and all property owners were required to obtain licenses, plaintiffs would be unaffected. The resident homeowner exemption has no negative effect on competition (interstate or otherwise) and therefore \"the dormant Commerce Clause has no job to do.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595433\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/278/#p298\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    iii.

The common thread in each of these cases is that the state or local government (1) barred out-of-state access to the local market, (2) for the benefit of a local interest. Thus, the law violated the dormant Commerce Clause because the law favored a local interest to the exclusion of all other interests, including out-of-state interests. That is not the effect of the Hammond ordinances. Here, the ordinances do not regulate based on location, do not favor a local interest at the expense of outside interests, and do not impede competition or access to the local market. That resident homeowners are not also required to obtain a license is immaterial; their exemption has no effect on competition in the relevant marketplace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Notably, in each of these cases the Supreme Court identified alternative regulations that would not have run afoul of the dormant Commerce Clause. In\n   <em>\n    Dean Milk Co.\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court noted that the city could have required an inspection procedure for all out-of-state milk that entered the city, or could have required that all milk sold in the city meet certain safety standards.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6931384\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/340/349/\">\n    340 U.S. at 354-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6931384\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/340/349/\">\n    71 S.Ct. 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Fort Gratiot\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court noted that the state could have placed an overall limit on the amount of waste each facility could process-rather than a limit based on the source/location of the waste.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729208\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/353/\">\n    504 U.S. at 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729208\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/353/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, in\n   <em>\n    C &amp;\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    A Carbone, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court noted that the town \"has any number of nondiscriminatory alternatives for addressing the health and environmental problems alleged to justify the ordinance in question. The most obvious would be uniform safety regulations enacted without the object to discriminate.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147591\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/383/#p386\">\n    511 U.S. at 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147591\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/383/#p386\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These proposed alternatives are much more akin to the type of regulation imposed in the Hammond ordinances. The Hammond ordinances, like those proposed as alternatives by the Supreme Court, impose a blanket regulation without regard to location. Thus, the ordinances do not have the effect of discriminating against interstate commerce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Conversely, courts have consistently found that when the burden of a regulation is borne equally by both in-state and out-of-state interests, the dormant Commerce Clause is not implicated.

All property owners that do not reside in their homes are \"similarly disadvantaged.\" The fact that the ordinances favor homeowners residing in their homes does not pose a dormant Commerce Clause problem.

These include, but are not limited to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   1. General public safety by ensuring contractors are qualified to do the work and are aware of safety regulations;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   2. General public safety and consumer protection by ensuring contractors are of good character, insured and bonded;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   3. Protecting residential homeowners from the burden of obtaining a license for work on one's own home;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   4. The assumption of risk an individual homeowner takes upon himself when conducting work by him or herself; and,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   5. The general benefit of regulating contractors who do work for and profit from others.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   (DE # 39-5). These justifications certainly survive rational basis review. The primary objective of the ordinances-to regulate building contractors to insure public safety-is plainly a legitimate governmental interest. The licensing requirement for building contractors serves this goal by providing oversight and enforcement of safety regulations. There is also a rational basis for the resident homeowner exemption to the licensing requirement. A homeowner making improvements to his or her own home will be sufficiently motivated to make good quality repairs and improvements because the homeowner will live with the consequences of poor craftsmanship. It is certainly plausible that the Hammond ordinances requiring contractor licenses, but exempting resident homeowners, serves the governmental interests that the City identified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    B. Equal Protection Clause\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that the Hammond ordinances violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (DE # 40 at 23.) They argue that the City of Hammond does not have a rational basis for treating residents differently than out-of-state citizens. As discussed above, the ordinances do not distinguish based on location, but on classification. Moreover, as discussed above, the ordinances survive rational basis review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   None of the cases plaintiffs cite compel a different conclusion. In each of the cases plaintiffs cite, the law at issue violated the Equal Protection Clause because it impermissibly favored in-state residents over out-of-state residents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Metro.
