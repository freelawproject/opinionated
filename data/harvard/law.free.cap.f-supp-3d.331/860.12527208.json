All Defendants filed responses to the respective motions on May 4, 2018. ECF Nos. 32, 33. The matter is fully submitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff State Farm Insurance Company initiated this interpleader action to resolve competing claims to Ricardo Avila's $50,000 life insurance policy insured by State Farm. ECF No. 1. On December 21, 2017, this Court granted State Farm's Motion for Interpleader Deposit, ECF No. 17, and State Farm posted a $46,716.55 bond on January 4, 2018, ECF No. 18. The Court dismissed State Farm from the action on January 29, 2018. ECF No. 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants are Ricardo's children and widow. ECF No. 29-1 \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4. Elaina and Noah are the children of Ricardo and his ex-wife, Bobbi Jo Hoch, f/k/a Bobbi Jo Avila.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. Christina is the daughter of Ricardo and Katherine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Ricardo was married to Katherine both before and following his marriage to Bobbi Jo; he and Katherine were married at the time of his death.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Ricardo purchased the disputed life insurance policy in 2001, during his marriage to Bobbi Jo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1. The policy named Bobbi Jo as the primary beneficiary with Elaina and Noah as the successor beneficiaries. ECF No. 30-1 \u00b6 7. Ricardo and Bobbi Jo divorced in January 2008.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. The dissolution decree required both parties to maintain any and all life insurance policies insuring their lives at the time the decree was entered.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. It also required the parties to name Elaina and Noah as irrevocable beneficiaries of these policies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In March 2008, Ricardo attempted to change beneficiaries under the policy to Christina as the primary beneficiary and Katherine as the successor beneficiary. ECF No. 29-1 \u00b6 4; ECF No. 30-1 \u00b6 12. The parties disagree about whether this change of beneficiary was valid. Elaina and Noah together claim that Ricardo was unable to change beneficiaries under the dissolution decree. ECF No. 30. Thus, they contend that this change of beneficiary is invalid and they are entitled to the proceeds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Christina and Katherine contend the decree did not prevent Ricardo from changing beneficiaries, and therefore, Christina is entitled to the proceeds as the primary beneficiary. ECF No. 29 \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II.

ECF No. 32 at 2. Christina and Katherine do not, however, explain why this distinction is material and do not point to any authority that suggests it is. The Court finds no reason for this distinction to preclude\n    <em>\n     Stackhouse\n    </em>\n    's applicability.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes Ricardo's attempt to change the beneficiary to Christina is unenforceable. Therefore, Elaina and Noah have a superior claim to the disputed insurance proceeds.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    <em>\n     B. Christina and Katherine's Additional Arguments\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Christina and Katherine offer two additional arguments: (1) Elaina and Noah's claim is time-barred and (2) equity requires judgment in their favor. ECF Nos. 29 at 3-4, 32 at 2-3. The Court does not find either argument sufficiently persuasive to deny Elaina and Noah's motion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    1. Whether Elaina and Noah's Claim is Time-Barred\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Christina and Katherine contend that Elaina and Noah's claim to the life insurance proceeds is time-barred. ECF No. 29 at 3 (citing\n    <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Kan.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2059-2239\">\n     Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 59-2239\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ); ECF No. 32 at 3 (same). The Court first notes this Kansas statute does not apply because this case is governed by Iowa law. But even if Kansas law applied, the facts of this case do not implicate this statute because section 59-2239 bars claims against a decedent's estate not filed within six months of the decedent's death.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Kan.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2059-2239\">\n     Kan.

The parties in this case are stating claims to life insurance proceeds not to assets in Ricardo's estate. Therefore, this case falls outside section 59-2239's scope. Accordingly, the Court concludes Elaina and Noah's claim is not time-barred as a matter of law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    2. Whether Equity Requires Judgment in Favor of Christina and Katherine\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Christina and Katherine urge that equity requires judgment in their favor. ECF Nos. 29 at 4, 32 at 2-3. They point first to Ricardo's intent, arguing that \"Christina Avila, Mr. Avila's daughter from a prior relationship, was an intended beneficiary of the life insurance policy in question at\n    the time of the entry of the Decree.\" ECF No. 32 at 2-3. Furthermore, they point to a second life insurance policy maintained by Ricardo, the benefit of which Elaina and Noah have already collected. ECF No. 29 \u00b6 8. They argue this second policy, along with Ricardo's attempt to name Christina as the beneficiary under the disputed policy, shows that Ricardo intended for Christina to receive the proceeds at issue here. ECF No. 32 at 2-3.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Christina and Katherine's arguments do not persuade the Court. In interpreting and enforcing the dissolution decree, the Court declines to speculate on Ricardo's intent based on these actions. Indeed, Iowa courts look to the dissolution court's intent, not the parties' intent, in construing a dissolution decree, as indicated by the decree's four corners.\n    <em>\n     In re Marriage of Anderson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10593264\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/451/187/#p191\">\n     451 N.W.2d 187\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 191 (Iowa Ct. App. 1989). The decree clearly states Elaina and Noah are irrevocable beneficiaries, and Iowa law compels the Court to enforce that provision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Based upon this record, the Court finds Christina and Katherine have not provided any evidence to demonstrate a genuine issue for trial such that a reasonable jury could find for them. For the foregoing reasons, Elaina Avila and Noah Avila's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 30) is GRANTED. Christina Avila and Katherine Cisper Avila's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 29) is DENIED. The net proceeds deposited by State Farm Life Insurance Company shall be disbursed to Elaina Avila and Noah Avila.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-46\">\n     The record shows Ricardo also attempted to change the disputed policy's beneficiary before the dissolution decree was entered. The change of beneficiary form dated June 11, 2007, shows Ricardo naming Bobbi Jo, his ex-wife, and Christina, his daughter with Katherine, as equal beneficiaries. ECF No. 32-2. Although Christina and Katherine mention it in their response, ECF No. 32, neither party states a claim to proceeds under this change of beneficiary; Bobbi Jo is not claiming relief in this case. Instead, Christina states her claim to the proceeds based on the\n     <em>\n      later\n     </em>\n     change of beneficiary. While this attempted change is not at issue here, the court notes the dissolution decree likely supersedes this attempted change. Bobbi Jo's and Christina's interests were \" 'mere expectanc[ies,]' ... which may be disposed of by the dissolution court.\"\n     <em>\n      Sorensen v.
