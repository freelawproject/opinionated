STEIN, United States District Judge\n   This case concerns a contract under which defendant Precision Discovery, Inc., leased certain data storage equipment from plaintiff, Hitachi Data Systems Credit Corporation (\"HDSCC\"). HDSCC alleged in its initial complaint that Precision had breached the contract by failing to make the required monthly rent payments. Precision responded to the complaint with not only an answer, but also nine separate counterclaims and third-party claims which alleged in sum that the contract was a sham and that HDSCC - conspiring with third-party defendants Cold Creek Solutions, Inc., and Hitachi Vantara Corporation\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   - had procured Precision's agreement to the leasing contract through improper means. The motions of HDSCC, Hitachi Vantara, and Cold Creek to dismiss these counterclaims and third-party claims are now before the Court. Because this Court cannot assert personal jurisdiction over the third-party defendants, Precision's third-party claims must be dismissed. Because Precision has failed to state any claim against HDSCC, Precision's counterclaims must also be dismissed. The case will thus revert to being what it truly is: a breach of contract action between a lessor and a lessee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts are drawn from Precision's amended counterclaims and third-party complaint (ECF Doc. 56). The Court assumes the truth of the factual allegations in that document for purposes of these motions to dismiss. The Court also relies on the contract at issue, which was attached to HDSCC's original complaint and is integral to Precision's counterclaims and third-party claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nicosia v. Amazon.com, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055481\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/220/#p230\">\n    834 F.3d 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 230-31 (2d Cir. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Around January 2012, HDSCC and Precision entered into a lease agreement defining the terms under which Precision would lease equipment from HDSCC to be identified in attached schedules. (Def.'s Am. Answer, Counterclaims, and Am. Third-Party Compl. (\"Am. Third-Party Compl.\"), ECF Doc. 56, \u00b6\u00b6 34-35.) These schedules were negotiated \"from time to time\" beginning in January 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) All appeared to be well with the arrangement for approximately the next five years. However, in November 2016 an email from a Hitachi Vantara employee made clear that Schedule J, which had been signed by Precision and HDSCC two months earlier, in September 2016, posed serious problems for Precision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81, 107-108.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Through the terms of Schedule J, Precision had, according to it, agreed to lease from HDSCC only outdated equipment that could not support Precision's data storage needs, and had further agreed to return all of the other equipment it had previously leased from HDSCC under other schedules, or else pay an additional fee to keep it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67-68, 77-81, 86-87, 89, 107-108.) As a result, in order to continue running its business, Precision would need\n   to pay significant rent for outdated equipment inadequate for its needs, as well as additional fees in order to keep using the acceptable equipment it had been using previously. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 86-88, 107-108.) Precision states that it subsequently discovered that Howard Holton, Precision's Chief Information Officer, had been engaged in what Precision calls an \"improper arrangement\" with the third-party defendants in this case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Third-party defendant Hitachi Vantara Corporation is the hardware and software company whose products were leased to Precision under the schedules. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 37.) (HDSCC, the lessor in the contract at issue, was the finance company that Hitachi Vantara utilized for lease transactions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) ) Third-party defendant Cold Creek Solutions, Inc. is an authorized equipment reseller for Hitachi Vantara. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) According to Precision, both Hitachi Vantara and Cold Creek were closely involved in the negotiation of Schedule J, despite the fact that only lessor HDSCC and lessee Precision are parties to Schedule J and the original lease agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Precision's Chief Information Officer Howard Holton was a negotiator and signatory of Schedule J for Precision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44, 58, 81.) Over the months prior to and immediately after the signing of Schedule J, Holton had several interactions with Cold Creek and Hitachi Vantara that Precision characterizes as demonstrating an improper and unethical relationship that created \"obvious, irreconcilable and irrevocable conflicts of interest[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-65.) For instance, while Holton was employed by Precision, he was also secretly earning additional income as a consultant or contractor for Cold Creek. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46-47.) Without Precision's knowledge, Hitachi Vantara and Cold Creek also provided Holton with various expensive gifts allegedly including lavish meals, alcohol, and tickets to sports events. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-56, 65.) Holton had a particularly close relationship with one Hitachi Vantara employee, Billy Metting, who allowed Holton to borrow his truck, eventually selling it to him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58-63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Precision alleges that Cold Creek and Hitachi Vantara, working with HDSCC, leveraged these improper interactions to induce Holton into executing Schedule J on Precision's behalf, all the while knowing that the equipment they were providing was unsuitable for Precision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-43, 64, 66-91.) Precision also alleges that a Cold Creek employee induced Holton to fraudulently sign an installation certificate claiming that the equipment had been installed, when in fact it had not been, in order for the Cold Creek and Hitachi Vantara sales teams to be able to receive their commissions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 92-106.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Finally, Precision alleges that with the help of forensic accountants, it discovered that in addition to improperly inducing Holton to execute Schedule J and sign the installation certificate, HDSCC, Cold Creek, and Hitachi Vantara had \"perpetrated a scheme to defraud Precision Discovery into making approximately $2.5 million in overpayments over the prior six years.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 112.). Precision provides very few details about this scheme, only alleging that \"the overpayments were extremely difficult to detect, as they were the result of HDSCC's business practice of rolling Precision Discovery's existing leases into new leases, and then overcharging Precision Discovery large amounts on equipment that was actually included in the prior leases.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Based on the above facts, Precision asserts five causes of action against both plaintiff HDSCC and third-party defendants Hitachi Vantara and Cold Creek; two causes of action solely against\n   HDSCC; and two causes of action solely against the third-party defendants. Against both HDSCC and the third parties, Precision asserts a claim of fraudulent inducement with regard to Schedule J; a claim of fraud and fraudulent misrepresentation regarding Schedule J; a civil RICO claim based on use of interstate mail and wires to defraud Precision; a civil conspiracy claim; and a claim for breach of the implied warranty of good faith and fair dealing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 115-151.) Against only HDSCC, Precision asserts a claim of conversion regarding the funds it paid to HDSCC pursuant to Schedule J before discovering it was fraudulent, and an unjust enrichment claim regarding those same funds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 152-167.) Against only Hitachi Vantara and Cold Creek, Precision asserts a claim of tortious interference with contract and business relations, arguing that Hitachi Vantara and Cold Creek caused Precision to breach the Schedule J agreement by fraudulently inducing Precision to execute it, and a claim of aiding and abetting HDSCC's conversion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 168-177.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As relief for these claims, Precision requests a declaration that Schedule J is unenforceable; an injunction barring HDSCC, Cold Creek, and Hitachi Vantara from seeking Schedule J's enforcement; and money damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36-37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   HDSCC has now moved to dismiss all of Precision's claims against it for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), and third-party defendants Hitachi Vantara and Cold Creek have also moved to dismiss all third-party claims against them. The third party-defendants move both for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) and for lack of personal jurisdiction over them pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2). This Court subsequently permitted Precision to file an amended version of its counterclaims and third-party complaint meant to respond to the personal jurisdiction arguments raised by Cold Creek and Hitachi Vantara, specifying that the pending motions to dismiss would remain in place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order dated Mar. 19, 2018, ECF Doc. 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As noted above, HDSCC moves pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), while Hitachi Vantara and Cold Creek move pursuant to both Rule 12(b)(6) and Rule 12(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   When considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a court must \"draw all reasonable inferences in [the non-movant's] favor, assume all well-pleaded factual allegations to be true, and determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Faber v.

Lack of Personal Jurisdiction Over Third-Party Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The third-party defendants each argue that they are not subject to personal jurisdiction in New York and that therefore the third-party complaints against them must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. More specifically, both Hitachi Vantara and Cold Creek argue that even assuming that the text of New York's long-arm statute might cover the third-party defendants, the federal Constitution's due process limitations do not permit this Court to exercise either general or specific personal jurisdiction over parties that have had the limited contact with the state of New York that they have had. Precision makes no serious argument to the contrary, almost entirely ignoring the third-party defendants' due process arguments. For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that it does not have personal jurisdiction over either Hitachi Vantara or Cold Creek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. General Jurisdiction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Both third-party defendants contend that they are not subject to general, or all-purpose, jurisdiction in New York because they are not \"essentially at home\" in the state as the federal Constitution requires. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As the U.S. Supreme Court made clear in\n   <em>\n    Daimler AG v. Bauman\n   </em>\n   , due process requires that \"only a limited set of affiliations with a forum will render a defendant amenable to all-purpose jurisdiction there.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/117/#p137\">\n    571 U.S. 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 137,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978,12585500\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/746/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978,12585500\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/746/\">\n    187 L.Ed.2d 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).

In the wake of that decision, the Second Circuit has explained that \"[t]he relevant 'suit-related conduct' ...

Thus, it appears that no suit-related conduct by Hitachi Vantara or Cold Creek occurred in New York. Although Precision does not raise the possibility that personal jurisdiction may nonetheless be constitutionally proper under the \"effects test,\" such an argument would have failed if it had been made. Under the \"effects test,\" even conduct that takes place entirely outside the forum may be enough to allow personal jurisdiction if \"the defendant expressly aimed its conduct at the forum.\"\n    <em>\n     Licci ex rel.

However, the Second Circuit has explained that in the wake of\n    <em>\n     Walden\n    </em>\n    , \"mere knowledge that a plaintiff resides in a specific jurisdiction would be insufficient to subject a defendant to specific jurisdiction in that jurisdiction if the defendant does nothing in connection with the tort in that jurisdiction.\"\n    <em>\n     Waldman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354952\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/835/317/#p327\">\n     835 F.3d at 338\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    That is the scenario we have here. The allegations by Precision and the declarations by officials of Hitachi Vantara and Cold Creek demonstrate that all conduct by Hitachi Vantara and Cold Creek related to this lawsuit - including relevant interactions between Precision and those companies - took place in Colorado. The sole connection between the third-party defendants' suit-related conduct and New York is the allegation that while Cold Creek and Hitachi Vantara were defrauding Precision in Colorado, they knew that Precision's headquarters were located in New York. That knowledge is not enough to subject the third-party defendants to personal jurisdiction in New York.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Although Cold Creek and Hitachi Vantara may have been able to foresee harm in New York as a result of their interactions with Precision in Colorado, \"the fact that harm in the forum is foreseeable ... is insufficient for the purpose of establishing specific personal jurisdiction over a defendant.\"\n    <em>\n     In Re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864585\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/659/#p674\">\n     714 F.3d 659\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 674 (2d Cir. 2013). And although Precision has alleged that Hitachi Vantara has some contacts\n    with New York other than its knowledge of Precision's presence there - such as the fact that it has an office in New York and does business there - there is no allegation of any relationship between these contacts and the alleged wrongdoing.

Thus, Precision has failed to establish closed-ended continuity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The matter of open-ended continuity still remains.

However, as noted above, the actual fraudulent predicates that Precision has alleged are quite limited - they took place over the course of a few months, and all involved Schedule J. They are thus insufficient to give rise to a plausible inference that Cold Creek and Hitachi Vantara regularly conducted business in a fraudulent manner.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Therefore, Precision has adequately alleged neither open-ended nor closed-ended continuity.

To the extent that Precision does allege that Holton's alleged false endorsement of the installation certificate makes out a claim of fraud against HDSCC, that claim must fail. The only false statement alleged to be made with regard to that incident was made by Holton, an employee of Precision.

However, the Court has already determined that Precision has not set forth either a fraud claim or a civil RICO claim. Therefore, no underlying tort has been properly alleged and Precision's civil conspiracy counterclaim against HDSCC must be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      4.

Precision does not allege that HDSCC prevented it from leasing the equipment listed in Schedule J, or failed to provide that equipment as promised, or violated any other obligation contained or presumably intended by that agreement. Rather, Precision asserts that the equipment in Schedule J was not suitable for its purposes, and that HDSCC knew this. Not only did the contract contain no promise that the equipment would be suitable, it contained an explicit disclaimer stating that HDSCC did\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    promise that the equipment would be suitable. January 2012 Lease Agreement \u00a7 6.3.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Therefore, Precision's allegation that HDSCC knowingly induced it to lease unsuitable equipment does not relate to any obligation that HDSCC had under the relevant contract, and cannot be characterized as a violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Precision's claim for a violation of the implied covenant is dismissed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      5.

Am. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 153.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    One necessary element of conversion is that the plaintiff (in this case, Precision), must have a \"possessory right or interest in the property\" and that the defendant (in this case, HDSCC) must have \"dominion over the property or interference with it, in derogation of plaintiff's rights.\"\n    <em>\n     Colavito v.

Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 156. But this allegation assumes in a conclusory fashion that the facts alleged throughout the complaint do, if true, constitute fraudulent inducement or misrepresentation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    The Court has already found that Precision has failed to state any fraud claim against HDSCC. Aside from that rejected theory, Precision has set forth no other basis to suggest that HDSCC acted improperly in accepting and retaining the rent that Precision paid for the Schedule J\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    equipment. Therefore, Precision has failed to allege necessary elements of conversion, and its conversion claim against HDSCC must be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      6.
