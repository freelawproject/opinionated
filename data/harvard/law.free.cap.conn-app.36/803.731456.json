Gillespie, </em>deputy assistant state\u2019s attorney, with whom, on the brief, were <em>James E. Thomas, </em>state\u2019s attorney, and <em>Edward R. Narus, </em>assistant state\u2019s attorney, for the appellant (state).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b827-9\"><em>Matthew J.

See General Statutes \u00a7 54-86g.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>While the record discloses that the trial court found that the state had made a \u201cprima facie\u201d showing of entitlement to videotape the child\u2019s testimony, the record fails to reflect a finding by the trial court that the state had satisfied its statutory burden of establishing \u201cby clear and convincing evidence, that the child would be so intimidated, or otherwise inhibited, by the physical presence of the defendant that a compelling need exists to take the testimony of the child outside the physical presence of the defendant in order to insure the reliability of such testimony.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-86g (a). Thus, it is impossible on the basis of the record before us to ascertain the basis on which the trial court denied the state\u2019s motion for permission to videotape the testimony of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">It is a well established principle of appellate procedure that the appellant has the duty of providing this court with a record adequate to afford review. Practice Book \u00a7 4061; <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>32 Conn. App. 317, 319, 629 A.2d 1137, cert. denied, 228 Conn. 902, 634 A.2d 295 (1993). Where the factual or legal basis of the trial court\u2019s ruling is unclear, the appellant should seek articulation pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4051. <em>Matza </em>v. <em>Matza, </em>226 Conn. 166, 187-88, 627 A.2d 414 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Our review of the trial court\u2019s oral decision leaves us with the firm conviction that the legal and factual predicate for the trial court\u2019s decision is unclear and ambiguous. \u201cMoreover, to the extent that the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision may be viewed as ambiguous in this respect, we read an ambiguous record, in the absence of a motion for articulation, to support rather than to undermine the judgment. <em>Matza </em>v. <em>Matza, </em>[supra, 226 Conn. 188]; <em>Walton </em>v. <em>New Hartford, </em>223 Conn. 155, 165, 612 A.2d 1153 (1992).\u201d <em>Water Street Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Innopak Plastics Corp., </em>230 Conn. 764, 773, 646 A.2d 790 (1994). Because the state, as the appellant, failed to file such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>a motion, we must assume that the trial court acted properly. Id., 773-74; <em>Matza </em>v. <em>Matza, </em>supra, 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b827-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-96 provides: \u201cAppeals from the rulings and decisions of the superior court, upon all questions of law arising on the trial of criminal cases, may be taken by the state, with the permission of the presiding judge, to the supreme court or to the appellate court, in the same manner and to the same effect as if made by the accused.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
