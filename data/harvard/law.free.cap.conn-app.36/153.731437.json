The Gelorminos failed to move for an articulation of the decision and, in oral argument before this court, requested that we remand the matter to the trial court for the purpose of having the court explain the facts it found and the law it relied on. This we decline to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">It is the appellants\u2019 duty to take the necessary steps to provide us with an adequate record for appellate review. Practice Book \u00a7 4061. The Gelorminos could have ensured the adequacy of the record by filing a motion for articulation pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4051 asking the trial court to set forth the basis for and reasoning behind its decision. They elected not to do this. Without an adequate record, we are left to guess or speculate as to the existence of a factual predicate. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosedom, </em>34 Conn. App. 141, 145-46, 640 A.2d 634 (1994). As it is not the function of this court to find facts, we decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-9\"> Robert Gelormino and Shirley Gelormino also challenge the trial court\u2019s denial of their motion to postpone and to strike the case from the trial list. The record, however, contains no indication that this motion was ever acted on. Furthermore, even if we presume the motion was denied, the trial court provided no basis for its decision and the Gelorminos failed to move for articulation. Therefore, we are unable to review this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
