J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALS\">This matter is currently before us on remand from our Supreme Court. <em>Gajewski </em>v. <em>Pavelo, </em>229 Conn. 829, 643 A.2d 1276 (1994). When we first heard this case, we applied the general verdict rule and affirmed a judgment for the defendants that followed the denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to set aside the jury verdict. <em>Gajewski </em>v. <em>Pavelo, </em>32 Conn. App. 373, 629 A.2d 465 (1993), rev\u2019d, 229 Conn. 829, 643 A.2d 1276 (1994). Our judgment was reversed because we should not have applied the general verdict rule. We, therefore, must now reach the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of instructional error not addressed in our initial decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">The facts necessary to the resolution of this appeal were set forth in our earlier decision. \u201cThe plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint consisted of ten counts,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> essentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>involving three causes of action, a product liability claim against Utica Radiator Corporation (Utica) arising out of its manufacture of a gas fired boiler,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a negligence claim against two employees of the city of Bridgeport, Joseph Savino and Guido Yagnini, for failure to inspect or to make reasonable efforts to inspect the installation of the boiler, and an indemnification claim against the city of Bridgeport pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 7-465. Utica denied that its gas fired boiler filled the Gajewski residence with dangerous and toxic levels of carbon monoxide that allegedly caused serious, painful and permanent injuries to the plaintiffs. Utica also denied that it introduced its boilers into the stream of commerce, that its products were expected to reach consumers without substantial change, and that one of its boilers had reached the plaintiffs\u2019 household without substantial change. Utica denied that its boiler was a defective and unreasonably dangerous product and also denied that it had failed to provide proper instructions for installation, had failed to warn the plaintiffs adequately of various dangers arising from use of the boiler and had failed to design a safe product. Further, Utica denied that the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries were proximately caused by its allegedly defective gas boiler. Utica\u2019s answer also raised two special defenses, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>claiming that any injuries sustained by the plaintiffs were caused by their own negligence and carelessness, and the other claiming that the amount of any verdict against Utica should be reduced by any amounts paid or agreed to be paid by any present or prior defendants to the action. Utica filed a cross claim against the Southern Connecticut Gas Company and the city of Bridgeport for indemnification and filed a cross claim against all the codefendants for contribution pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-572o.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Southern Connecticut Gas Company denied all cross claims by Utica.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">\u201cThe plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claim against the two city employees was based on the failure to inspect, to make provisions to inspect, to warn and to establish standards for inspection. The plaintiffs alleged that, as a result of the city employees\u2019 negligence and carelessness, the plaintiffs sustained their injuries. The individual defendants and the city denied all allegations of negligence and denied that any failure to act was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. The individual defendants and the city of Bridgeport also raised four special defenses. The defenses claimed were sovereign immunity, contributory negligence, immunity provided by General Statutes \u00a7 52-557n, and that any verdict against them should be reduced by any amounts paid by Southern Connecticut Gas Company and Arthur Pavelo, the installer of the boiler. They also filed a counterclaim against Jan Gajewski for indemnification claiming that he was primarily liable for the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries because he failed to clean his chimney when advised to do so, replaced a door to the furnace room <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>when advised not to do so and failed to respond to notices calling for inspection of the furnace.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">\u201cThe jury heard evidence that in the fall of 1981 the plaintiffs had a gas fired boiler manufactured by Utica installed in their residence by Pavelo. The plaintiffs had previously used an oil fired boiler, which generated a buildup of soot in the chimney flue. At the time of installation, Pavelo, a licensed plumber, cleaned the chimney sufficiently to render the furnace operational. The plaintiffs were advised by Pavelo, prior to the installation of the boiler, of the necessity of having the chimney thoroughly cleaned but were never directly warned of the necessity by Utica.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">\u201cOn January 9,1982, Maria was found unconscious in her home. Her husband, Jan, and adult son, Janusz, were found semiconscious. They were diagnosed as having carbon monoxide poisoning. The poisonous gases resulted from a buildup of soot in the chimney flue. This buildup prevented proper ventilation of the boiler. At no time prior to January 9, 1982, was the installation of the boiler inspected by the employees of the city of Bridgeport or the gas company, although they had attempted to make appointments for inspection with the plaintiffs. Jan and Janusz substantially recovered from the poisoning. Maria suffered permanent total disability of her nervous system manifested as cognitive impairment and difficulty with speech, coordination and gait. She also experiences bouts of depression due to her condition.\u201d <em>Gajewski </em>v. <em>Pavelo, </em>supra, 32 Conn. App. 375-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>\u201cThe jury returned a handwritten verdict that read: \u2018We, the jury, based upon the evidence presented to us, unanimously agree that all claims against the defendants: The Utica Radiator Corp., The City of Bridgeport et al., and Southern New England Gas Co. are inconclusive. We, therefore, find them not liable for the injuries sustained in the suit brought by the Gajewski family.\u2019 The trial court accepted the verdict and rendered judgment \u2018in favor of Utica Radiator Corporation, the city of Bridgeport, Joseph Savino, Guido Vagnini, and Southern Connecticut Gas Company, and that the plaintiffs recover no damages of said defendants.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Id., 378-79. The plaintiffs moved on December 2,1991, to set aside the verdict as being contrary to law and against the evidence. The plaintiffs subsequently, on February 25, 1992, supplemented their motion to set aside the verdict.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The motion to set aside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>the verdict was denied. The trial court\u2019s refusal to set aside the verdict is entitled to great weight in our assessment of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. <em>Norrie </em>v. <em>Heil Co., </em>203 Conn. 594, 606, 525 A.2d 1332 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The essence of the three claims raised by the plaintiffs on appeal<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> concerns the propriety of the jury instructions as to the defendants Utica, the city of Bridgeport and the city\u2019s employees. The claims on appeal are virtually identical to those raised in the plaintiffs\u2019 supplementary motion to set aside the verdict.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiffs claim that the jury instructions were so contradictory and inconsistent that the jury was left to decide not only the facts of the case but what law to apply. The defendants argue that, viewed as a whole, if there were any inconsistencies in the charge, they were neither harmful nor prejudicial. We agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">To require reversal, any error committed by the trial court in charging the jury must be harmful. <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Greenwich Hospital Assn., </em>191 Conn. 282, 295, 465 A.2d 294 (1983); see also <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Bihary, </em>168 Conn. 269, 273, 362 A.2d 963 (1975). To be harmful, an error must be so fundamental and material that it may work an injustice. <em>West Haven Sound Development Corp. </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>207 Conn. 308, 318, 541 A.2d 858 (1988); <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Bihary, </em>supra, 273, citing <em>Mei </em>v. <em>Alterman Transport Lines, Inc., </em>159 Conn. 307, 316, 268 A.2d 639 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>(1970). Contradictory instructions that force a jury to decide a material question of law in either one of two inconsistent ways are impermissible. <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Bihary, </em>supra, 273, citing <em>Connors </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>86 Conn. 641, 650, 86 A. 600 (1913); W. Maltbie, Connecticut Appellate Procedure (2d Ed. 1957) \u00a7\u00a7 76, 87, 91, 92. Flatly inconsistent statements in close proximity to one another, without any attempted clarification or correction will likely cause a jury to be misled and will result in reversal. <em>Alaimo </em>v. <em>Royer, </em>188 Conn. 36, 40, 448 A.2d 207 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">A charge, however, is to be read as a whole without the dissection of its parts. It will not be the source of reversible error absent a determination that the probable effect of the charge was to lead the jury to an incorrect verdict. <em>Norrie </em>v. <em>Heil Co., </em>supra, 203 Conn. 606; <em>Tripp </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>1 Conn. App. 433, 435-36, 472 A.2d 804 (1984). The charge must be examined to determine whether it fairly presents a case to a jury so that no injustice results and is not to be examined \u201cwith a legal microscope, to search for technical flaws, inexact, inadvertent or contradictory statements.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tripp </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>supra, 436, citing <em>Ubysz </em>v. <em>DiPietro, </em>185 Conn. 47, 57, 440 A.2d 830 (1981). Bearing these axioms in mind, we will now consider the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The plaintiffs argue that the trial court first gave the plaintiffs\u2019 requests to charge and then gave the defendants\u2019 requests to charge. They argue throughout their brief that their requests to charge were correct on the law, but that the defendants\u2019 requests to charge were incorrect statements of the law, and that this inconsistency must have misled the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">The Charge as to Product Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">We first address the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the charge was inaccurate and confusing as to the prod<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>uct liability claim. The plaintiffs argue that the trial court\u2019s instructions concerning the manufacturer\u2019s duty to warn under General Statutes \u00a7 52-572q<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> were contradictory in that the jury was first instructed to use the statutory standard for a breach of the duty to warn in order to be liable in a product liability case, and was then instructed on a common law \u201creasonableness\u201d standard of a duty to warn. According to the plaintiffs, the trial court initially properly instructed the jury that it must determine whether warnings were required, and, if they were required, whether they were adequate, by considering the likelihood of the harm the plaintiffs suffered, the defendant Utica\u2019s ability to anticipate and appreciate the risk of such harm, and, finally, the technological feasibility and cost of warnings and instructions. This was the plaintiffs\u2019 requested charge, which according to the plaintiffs provides the jury with the correct strict liability standard under \u00a7 52-572q.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The plaintiffs take issue with the court\u2019s later set of instructions in which the court told the jury to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>whether the \u201cfurnace was <em>unreasonably </em>dangerous\u201d and that manufacturers are required under Connecticut law to \u201ctake <em>reasonable </em>steps to make the product <em>reasonably </em>safe under <em>reasonable </em>circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plaintiffs argue that this later instruction allowed the jury to apply common law standards of liability and negligence, in contravention of Connecticut\u2019s strict statutory product liability scheme, and in contradiction to the earlier portion of the instructions where the trial court read the plaintiffs\u2019 request to charge. The plaintiffs basically claim that the court was forcing the jury to decide which law to apply, the common law negligence standard or the statutory strict liability standard, rather than instructing it as to which of the two governed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The plaintiffs are correct in their assertion that Connecticut\u2019s present statutory scheme, General Statutes \u00a7 52-572m et seq., was intended to merge the various common law theories of products liability<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> into one cause of action. See <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Haybuster Mfg., </em>Inc., 226 Conn. 282, 292, 627 A.2d 1288 (1993) (summarizing the legislative history of \u00a7 52-572m et seq.). We agree that if the jury had been instructed unequivocally to use a common law negligence standard to determine whether warnings were required and, if they were required, to determine, by using a common law standard, whether they were adequate, there would be a reversible error. An examination of the instructions as a whole, however, shows no inconsistency between that portion of the charge requested by the plaintiffs and that portion that used the word reasonable. The trial court\u2019s use of the word reasonable does not amount to a charge based on negligence standards. <em>See Norrie </em>v. <em>Heil Co., </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>203 Conn. 600. In using the word reasonable, the court clarified for the jury how to determine if warnings were required under \u00a7 52-572q, and, if required, what types of warnings would be technologically feasible. Moreover, in practical terms, there is no difference between the statutory strict liability of \u00a7 52-572q and negligence with respect to the law of warnings. <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Wyatt, Inc., </em>31 Conn. App. 824, 848, 627 A.2d 1347 (1993), aff\u2019d, 230 Conn. 12, 644 A.2d 871 (1994); see also W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, Torts (5th Ed. 1984) \u00a7 99, p. 697. The portion of the instructions that used the word reasonable is therefore complementary, not contradictory, to the earlier portion.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">We next examine the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of inconsistency in the instructions as to whether Pavelo or Utica had the duty to warn and as to the role of the knowledgeable or sophisticated user doctrine. The plaintiffs correctly note in their brief that both parties took exceptions to certain portions of these instructions. The plaintiffs are incorrect, however, in asserting that by charging the jury to examine the product liability claims from different \u201cperspectives,\u201d the court was forcing the jury to decide who had a duty to warn. These portions of the charge demonstrate not that the trial court improperly instructed the jury, but rather that the court correctly interpreted \u00a7 52-572q. Section 52-572q leaves many issues to the trier of fact. These issues include whether there is a duty to warn, whether the manufacturer or the seller<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> is in a better position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>to directly warn the ultimate user, whether the warnings were adequate, and the consideration to be given to the sophisticated user doctrine. Both this court and our Supreme Court, in <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Wyatt, Inc., </em>supra, 230 Conn. 12, and <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Wyatt, Inc., </em>supra, 31 Conn. App. 824,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> have interpreted \u00a7 52-572q as leaving those issues to the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">At oral argument in this court, the plaintiffs insisted that under \u00a7 52-572q, the expected product user to whom the duty to warn is owed is <em>always </em>and <em>only </em>the consumer. The plaintiffs, therefore, conclude that the portion of the jury charge instructing that the duty to warn is owed to the consumer is inconsistent with the court\u2019s later charge that any duty to warn was \u201cto be directed to Mr. Pavelo,\u201d the installer of the product. The plaintiffs appear to argue in their brief, however, that the entity or person to whom the duty to warn was owed may vary when they state that <em>\u201cin this case\u201d </em>the duty was to the Gajewskis. (Emphasis added.) Section 52-572q does not use the word \u201cconsumer\u201d; it confers a cause of action on \u201cclaimants\u201d who have been harmed by defective products and refers to \u201cthe expected product user.\u201d Both prior to and after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>enactment of \u00a7 52-572m et seq., Connecticut courts have noted that unreasonably dangerous products were those considered to be unreasonably dangerous to the consumer <em>or user. See Sharp </em>v. <em>Wyatt, Inc., </em>supra, 31 Conn. App. 833; <em>Coe-Park Donuts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Robertshaw Controls Co., </em>1 Conn. App. 84, 86, 468 A.2d 292 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">\u201cA principal purpose of the product liability statute is to protect people from harm caused by defective and hazardous products. In order to meet this purpose, it is necessary that the statute be read to reach <em>all conduct </em>which affects the safety of a product prior to its entry into the stream of commerce. The terms enumerated in General Statutes \u00a7 52-572m (b) are <em>simply generic categories of conduct which must be read broadly and in relationship to one another in order to accomplish the purposes of the </em>statute.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Rodia </em>v. <em>Tesco Corp., </em>11 Conn. App. 391, 396, 527 A.2d 721 (1987). While most product liability suits are brought by consumers, the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that <em>only </em>consumers may bring such primary suits because they are the only persons or entities to whom a statutory duty is owed is incorrect. See <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Wyatt, Inc., </em>supra, 31 Conn. App. 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The statutory scheme is intended to protect anyone who is injured by a defective product. For example, the plaintiff in <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Wyatt, Inc., </em>supra, 31 Conn. App. 824, was the employee of a retailer, not a consumer. The plaintiffs\u2019 reading of \u00a7 52-572q would bar others, such as installers and store employees who are injured by defective products, from bringing suit, because by the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 52-572q neither group includes consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The plaintiffs are, therefore, not correct in arguing that the court should not have instructed the jury that Utica\u2019s sole duty to warn or to give adequate instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>tions was to the installer, Pavelo. The court did instruct the jury that it was for the jury to decide '\u00bf/'Pavelo was \u201cthe person best able to take precaution against any potential harm associated with the use of the subject product,\u201d and if it so found, then <em>\u201cany duty to instruct or warn as to the precautions necessary to safeguard against the potential harm from the manufacturer is to be directed to Mr. Pavelo.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Wyatt, Inc., </em>supra, 31 Conn. App. 849, this court noted that any warnings issued must ultimately reach \u201cthe ultimate product user.\u201d The foregoing instruction is not that the manufacturer had a duty to warn Pavelo only, but that the jury could find that issuing a warning to Pavelo, as the installer of the product who would come into direct contact with the ultimate product user, might have been the best way for the defendant Utica to warn the ultimate product user. This is not a misstatement of the law, but a statement that conforms with \u00a7 52-572q (d), which directs that \u201c[a] product seller may not be considered to have provided adequate warnings or instructions unless they were devised to communicate with the person best able to take or <em>recommend </em>precautions against the potential harm.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The final alleged inconsistency in the charge on product liability concerns the \u201csophisticated user\u201d doctrine. Under this doctrine, when the product seller \u201chas reason to believe that the purchaser of the product will recognize the dangers associated with the product, no warnings are mandated.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Wyatt, Inc., </em>supra, 31 Conn. App. 847, quoting <em>Goodbar </em>v. <em>Whitehead Bros., </em>591 F. Sup. 552, 561 (W.D. Va. 1984), aff'd, 769 F.2d 213 (4th Cir. 1985). If the product seller is aware of its purchaser\u2019s knowledge and sophistication with respect to the product, it may choose not to issue warnings. See <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Wyatt, Inc., </em>supra, 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>The plaintiffs agree that the court\u2019s initial charge, that the defendant Utica could not rely on the installer\u2019s knowledge, was correct. The court stated that \u201c[i]n order to adequately warn the Gajewskis, the seller had a duty to adequately warn and instruct the installer. The law is that if you determine that the seller could have anticipated that the consumer, the Gajewskis, did not know the dangers, then it was incumbent upon the seller to warn the Gajewskis by adequately warning and instructing the installer, regardless of his knowledge.\u201d The jury could find that a duty to warn ran from the manufacturer to the installer, whether or not the installer was a sophisticated user. The court later charged that \u201cthe importance of [Pavelo\u2019s] status as a skilled tradesperson and knowledgeable user is that under the law, even if one has the duty to warn or instruct, that manufacturer is not liable for failing to warn or instruct a party of facts that the party already knew .... [I]f Mr. Pavelo was aware of what should be done in the installation of the subject furnace, or should have been aware based upon his profession and the knowledge of his fellow employees, the defendant Utica ... is not and cannot be liable for failure to warn him of that which he already knew. The defendant Utica Radiator Corporation had no duty to warn Mr. Pavelo to clean the subject chimney at the time of installation if Mr. Pavelo, or his employees, knew or should have known that the chimney should have been cleaned prior to lighting the furnace, and knew or should have known of the consequences of failing to do so.\u201d In other words, Utica could not be liable for a failure to warn Pavelo of dangers of which he was already aware. There is no inconsistency here.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The court correctly charged that if the jury found that Utica had a duty to warn Pavelo, but did not render <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>such a warning, if it then also found that Pavelo was a knowledgeable user and therefore aware of the danger of installing the boiler without cleaning the chimney, then there could be no liability on the part of Utica. The Connecticut Product Liability Act; General Statutes \u00a7 52-572m et seq.; does not impose a duty to warn of known or open and obvious dangers, and, accordingly, there can be no liability for injuries resulting from open, obvious and known dangers. See <em>Haesche </em>v. <em>Kiss</em>ner, 229 Conn. 213, 216, 640 A.2d 108 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Taking the instructions as a whole, the court instructed the jury that if it found that Utica had a duty to warn, in considering whether Utica effectively discharged that duly or failed to discharge it, it was appropriate to consider the installer\u2019s professional knowledge and skills. This court held in <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Wyatt, Inc., </em>supra, 31 Conn. App. 849, that while the sophisticated user doctrine is not an affirmative defense under Connecticut\u2019s product liability law,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 52-572q \u201chas incorporated the concerns underlying the sophisticated user doctrine. . . . [T]he statute puts the issue of user awareness to the trier of fact <em>along with other factors to be weighed in the aggregate.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The instructions appropriately explained to the jury that if it found that Utica had a duty to warn Pavelo adequately, <em>one of </em>the factors it should consider in determining liability was Pavelo\u2019s expected knowledge as a professional. The instructions were entirely consistent with the holding of <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Wyatt, Inc., </em>supra, 849, in that Connecticut law does not allow \u201csellers and purchasers simultaneously . . . [to] rely on one another to provide warnings with the result that none is issued to the ultimate product user.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The Charge as to the Liability of the Municipal Employees</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The plaintiffs also claim that the court gave inconsistent and confusing instructions on the law pertaining to the liability of municipal employees. Specifically, the plaintiffs contend that the charge was inconsistent as to the order in which the jury was to consider the issues of negligence and municipal immunity, as to the purpose of the Building Officials and Code Administrators Basic Building Code, and as to whether the standard for determining if a city official is immune in the performance of a discretionary act involving identifiable persons is objective or subjective.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">The plaintiffs claim that it was improper for the court initially to tell the jury to consider whether the employees were negligent before considering the defense of sovereign immunity, and then later to reverse the order of consideration of those issues. The gist of the plaintiffs\u2019 argument is that the order in which the jury considered those issues was crucial because, since sovereign immunity is a defense, the defendants, not the plaintiffs, had the burden of proving it. By allowing the jury first to consider whether the employees were negligent, the plaintiffs claim the trial court enlarged their burden of proof. If a trial court\u2019s instructions do enlarge a party\u2019s burden of proof, there may be reversible error. <em>Goodmaster </em>v. <em>Houser, </em>225 Conn. 637, 645, 625 A.2d 1366 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>183 Conn. 17, 28, 438 A.2d 1165 (1981); <em>McSwiggan </em>v. <em>Kaminsky, </em>35 Conn. App. 673, 647 A.2d 5, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 934, 649 A.2d 256 (1994). Here, however, the order in which the issues of negligence and municipal immunity were considered is irrelevant to our determination of whether the jury was correctly charged as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>to the defendants\u2019 liability. <em>Boiselle </em>v. <em>Rogoff, </em>126 Conn. 635, 641, 13 A.2d 753 (1940). The jury in the present case was not told by the court that the plaintiffs need prove, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, anything beyond negligence. In fact, the reversal of the order of consideration of the issues was beneficial to the plaintiffs. If the jury first considered and found negligence, a verdict for the plaintiffs was possible, and the jury might never have considered the sovereign immunity issue. On the other hand, if the jury had considered sovereign immunity first, and found it a bar to recovery, it would not have reached the negligence issue. The plaintiffs cannot claim error in a charge where the alleged error was beneficial to them. <em>Frigon </em>v. <em>Enfield Savings &amp; Loan Assn., </em>195 Conn. 82, 87, 485 A.2d 1305 (1985); <em>Rapuana </em>v. <em>Oder, </em>181 Conn. 515, 520, 436 A.2d 21 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">We have also determined that the purpose of the building code was not misstated. The plaintiffs agree with the court\u2019s initial charge that the purpose of the code was to ensure the safety of \u201coccupants.\u201d Presumably, the plaintiffs agree with this portion of the charge because it instructs the jury that the city employees had a duty under the building code to inspect every boiler installation before that boiler was put into use. By not inspecting the boiler installed in the Gajewski home, that duty was breached because \u201cthe purpose of inspection was the safety of the occupants.\u201d The plaintiffs claim that the court\u2019s later charge that the purpose of the building code is to ensure \u201cpublic safety\u201d and to \u201cbenefit the public\u201d is inconsistent with the charge that the purpose of the code is to benefit the occupants. The plaintiffs do not cite any case law in their brief supporting their contention that these charges were inconsistent. Presumably, their argument is that protecting the safety of the occupants is a narrower purpose than benefiting the public. Since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>occupants are a segment of the population to be benefited, the charge is not inconsistent. If a duty was owed to the public, it must, of necessity, have also been owed to the occupants of the home. Under either purpose, there was a duty to the Gajewskis.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 next attack on the instructions as to the city employees is the charge on discretionary acts. In Connecticut, \u201c '[a] municipal employee . . . has a qualified immunity in the performance of a governmental duty, but he may be liable if he misperforms a ministerial act, as opposed to a discretionary act. . . . The word \u201cministerial\u201d \u201crefers to a duty which is to be performed in a prescribed manner without the exercise of judgment or discretion.\u201d . . .\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Evon </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>211 Conn. 501, 505, 559 A.2d 1131 (1989). One exception to this qualified immunity permits tort actions in circumstances where there is perceptible imminent harm to identifiable persons. This exception applies to both identifiable individuals and narrowly defined identified classes of foreseeable victims. <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>228 Conn. 640, 646, 638 A.2d 1 (1994); see also <em>Sestito </em>v. <em>Groton, </em>178 Conn. 520, 527-28, 423 A.2d 165 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The plaintiffs argue that the court first correctly charged in accordance with <em>Burns, </em>but later contradicted itself. The plaintiffs claim that the court first gave the jury an \u201cobjective\u201d standard by which to consider the exception to immunity, by stating that \u201ceven if the duties upon the city officials are discretionary, they are liable for [the] breach of these duties if that breach subjects an identifiable group to imminent harm.\u201d The plaintiffs argue that a later portion of the charge was inconsistent because it erroneously gave a \u201csubjective\u201d standard by charging that \u201cif you find that any duty the defendants may have had is discretionary, then the only exception [to immunity] would be if it was apparent to [the city employees] that their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>failure subjects an <em>identifiable person </em>to an imminent harm, that there was a <em>specific relationship </em>established between [the employees] and the Gajewskis.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plaintiffs argue that here the trial court incorrectly instructed the jury that it had to find a subjective \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the city employees and the Gajewskis in order for there to be an exception to immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury that it had to find a special relationship was not an instruction to apply a subjective standard. The instruction states a fundamental premise of tort law that before there can be liability, there must be a breach of a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, which, in turn, requires that there be a special relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. See W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, supra, \u00a7 56. In fact, our Supreme Court, in <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 646, used the special relationship language the plaintiffs complain of here in its discussion of the exception to sovereign immunity permitting tort actions where there is a foreseeable class of victims. In <em>Bums, </em>our Supreme Court noted that \u201c[i]n delineating the scope of a foreseeable class of victims exception to governmental immunity, our courts have considered numerous criteria, <em>including </em>the imminency of any potential harm, the likelihood that harm will result from a failure to act with reasonable care, and the identifiability of the particular victim. . . . Other courts, in carving out similar exceptions to their respective doctrines of governmental immunity, have also considered whether the legislature specifically designated an identifiable subclass as the intended beneficiaries of certain acts . . . [and] whether the <em>relationship </em>was of a voluntary nature. . . .\u2019\u2019(Citations omitted; emphasis added.) Id., 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>The plaintiffs cannot isolate certain words and phrases and claim error. The charge must be examined as a whole, and the charge as a whole is not a misstatement of the law on sovereign immunity. See <em>McSwiggan </em>v. <em>Kaminsky, </em>supra, 35 Conn. App. 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The Charge as to Contributory Negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">We now turn to the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the charge on contributory negligence. We have already briefly noted in our initial decision that the charges on contributory negligence and comparative negligence were not improper. <em>Gajewski </em>v. <em>Pavelo, </em>supra, 32 Conn App. 383 n.6. In arguing that these instructions were confusing, the plaintiffs do not pinpoint the alleged errors. Rather, the plaintiffs make a general argument that \u201cdifferent\u201d standards were given by which to consider any contributory and comparative negligence of the parties, and that the wording of the jury\u2019s verdict clearly demonstrates that the jury did not understand the instructions. The wording of the jury verdict was determined to mean that the jury believed that the plaintiffs had failed to meet their burden of proof, and that the jury never reached the issue of the defendants\u2019 special defenses. <em>Gajewski </em>v. <em>Pavelo, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 837-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">The gist of the plaintiffs\u2019 argument appears to be that the jury had too many parties\u2019 actions and too many parties\u2019 claims to consider.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Having examined the entire charge to the jury, we conclude that the instructions on contributory and comparative negligence, consisting of approximately twenty pages,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> are not confusing. We could not find any misstatement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>law. In fact, the trial court gave detailed instructions, complete with accurate hypotheticals. The plaintiffs must show more than that this was a complicated case to support their claim that the jury was confused.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">We conclude that taken as a whole, the trial court\u2019s charge was an adequate guide for the jury and that it was not reasonably possible that the jury was misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b627-10\"> The plaintiffs, Maria Gajewski, Jan Gajewski and Janusz Gajewski, originally sued Arthur Pavelo doing business as Academy Plumbing and Heating, Utica Radiator Corporation, Joseph Savino, Guido Vagnini, the city of Bridgeport, Southern Connecticut Gas Company, and Ruud Water Heater Division of Rheem Manufacturing Company. The plaintiff Jan Gajewski also brought loss of consortium claims against Utica, Savino, Vagnini and the city of Bridgeport. The plaintiffs settled with the estate of Arthur Pavelo, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Southern Connecticut Gas Company, and Ruud Water Heater Division of Rheem Manufacturing Company. We refer herein to Utica Radiator Corporation, Savino, Vagnini and the city of Bridgeport as the defendants. Although Southern New England Gas Company was not a defendant during the trial as to the GajewsMs, it was a third party defendant as to Utica in an indemnification claim and in a contribution claim as a joint tortfeasor. In that capacity, Southern New England Gas Company actively participated in the trial. It, however, is not involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b628-6\"> The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged that the defendant Utica Radiator Corporation was liable for a defective product, the defects being its design and a failure to warn.

App. 824, 833, 627 A.2d 1347 (1993), aff'd, 230 Conn. 12, 644 A.2d 871 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b629-6\"> Although Utica\u2019s answer to the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint contained a cross claim for contribution against \u201call defendants,\u201d the installer of the furnace, Arthur Pavelo doing business as Academy Plumbing and Heating, was not specifically named as a defendant by Utica, although the other defendants were so named.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\"> Prior to trial, the plaintiffs made a motion to sever the cross claims and counterclaims.

The court stated in its charge that it anticipated that there would be interrogatories and verdict forms by the time afternoon deliberations began. Deliberations were over, however, later that same afternoon before the interrogatories or verdict forms were available. No objection was made by the plaintiffs or the defendants to the court\u2019s allowing the jury to deliberate without them.\u201d <em>Gajewski </em>v. <em>Pavelo, </em>supra, 32 Conn.
