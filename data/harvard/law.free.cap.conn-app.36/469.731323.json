The defendant asserts in his motion to dismiss that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal because it was filed after the expiration of the seven day appeal period specified by General Statutes \u00a7 52-325c (b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The plaintiffs brought a breach of contract action seeking damages and an injunction compelling the defendant to convey to them certain property located in Fairfield in accordance with an agreement between the parties. The plaintiffs recorded a notice of lis pen-dens in the Fairfield town clerk\u2019s office on September 16,1993. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-325a (c),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the defendant filed a motion in the trial court for a discharge of the notice of lis pendens on the ground that there was no probable cause to sustain the validity of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion and notice of the court\u2019s order was issued to the parties on September 14,1994. The plaintiffs appealed from the order on September 27, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Our Supreme Court recently considered the effect of statutory appeal periods on an appellate court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction in <em>Ambroise </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>226 Conn. 757, 628 A.2d 1303 (1993). The dispositive issue in <em>Ambroise </em>was whether an appeal from the denial of a prejudgment remedy may be taken after the expiration of the seven day appeal period specified by General Statutes \u00a7 <em>52-278l. </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>court stated that \u201cthe proper analysis of a statutory time limitation on the right to appeal devolves into a question of statutory construction: did the legislature, in imposing the time limitation, intend to impose a subject matter jurisdictional requirement on the right to appeal?\u201d Id., 764. The court reviewed the language, historical background and purpose of \u00a7 <em>52-278l </em>and concluded that the legislature did so intend. As the failure to take an appeal within the time constraints of the statute deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction, dismissal was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Our review of General Statutes \u00a7 52-325c, informed by the <em>Ambroise </em>analysis, leads us to conclude that the failure to appeal within the specified time period deprives this court of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The language of \u00a7 52-325c (b) is clear and is virtually the same as the language of \u00a7 <em>52-278l </em>(b), which the Supreme Court held to impose such a jurisdictional requirement. In <em>Ambroise, </em>the court also stated that \u201c[t]he literal reading of \u00a7 <em>52-278l </em>(b) is buttressed, moreover, by reference to \u00a7 <em>52-278l </em>(c), which reverses the ordinary rules regarding automatic stays on appeal by mandating that the order is not stayed by an appeal unless the party appealing posts a sufficient surety bond.\u201d Id., 765-66. Likewise, a literal reading of the seven day appeal period in \u00a7 52-325c (b) is buttressed by the stay provisions set forth in that statute. Subsections (b) and (c) of \u00a7 52-325c<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> require the appellant to post a bond if a stay is granted beyond the seven day appeal period.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>The purpose of a notice of lis pendens also supports a conclusion that the legislature intended to make the seven day appeal period jurisdictional. That purpose is to ensure \u201cthat the plaintiffs\u2019 claim cannot be defeated by a prejudgment transfer of the property.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>189 Conn. 471, 479, 457 A.2d 290, appeal dismissed, 464 U.S. 801, 104 S. Ct. 46, 78 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1983). The notice of lis pendens affects the defendant\u2019s right to transfer his interest in the real property in question because the notice binds any subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer as if he were made a party to the action described in the lis pendens. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-325 (a) as amended by Public Acts, Spec. Sess., October, 1993, No. 93-4, \u00a7 1; see also <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>217 Conn. 24, 34, 584 A.2d 445 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The manifest purpose of the seven day appeal period following the discharge of a notice of lis pendens is to inform the parties within a very brief period of time whether that order is final or will be challenged. If no appeal is taken during the seven day period, the defendant property owner can transfer his interest in the property free of the notice of lis pendens. A conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>that the seven day appeal period is lengthened beyond that period would undermine that legislative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">In this case, the plaintiffs appealed from the discharge of the notice of lis pendens thirteen days after the notice of that order was issued.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this untimely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-325c provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Any order entered as provided in subsection (b) of section 52-325b shall be deemed a final judgment for the purpose of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">\u201c(b) No appeal shall be taken from such order except within seven days thereof. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b494-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-325a (c) provides in relevant part: \u201cIf the action for which notice of lis pendens was recorded, is pending before any court, the property owner may at any time . . . move that such notice of lis pen-dens be discharged of record.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b495-6\"> It is axiomatic that parties cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction on this court by waiver, nor can this court confer such jurisdiction on itself. <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>229 Conn. 178, 185, 640 A.2d 601 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b495-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-325c provides in relevant part: \u201c(b) No appeal shall be taken from such order except within seven days thereof.

If the party taking the appeal gives such bond the order shall be stayed; or (2) grant the stay; or (3) deny the stay; or (4) condition the granting of the stay upon the giving of such a bond.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b497-19\"> \u201cThe time limited by law for commencing appellate proceedings on the decision, order, decree, denial or ruling shall date from the time when such notice is issued by the clerk.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 51-53 (b); see also Practice Book \u00a7 398.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
