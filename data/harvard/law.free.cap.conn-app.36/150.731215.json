General Statutes \u00a7 31-324; see Practice Book \u00a7 4165.5. Having examined the questions reserved by the board, we conclude that the decision involves principles of law that are <em>not, </em>in fact, free from reasonable doubt and that the public interest <em>does, </em>in fact, require that the questions be determined by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">In 1987, Kenneth Dixon injured his back and neck while employed by United Illuminating Company. United Illuminating paid Dixon workers\u2019 compensation benefits for treatment of those injuries. In 1993, Dixon committed suicide. The plaintiff, Dixon\u2019s widow, sought further benefits, claiming that her husband\u2019s suicide was due to his injuries. United Illuminating contested the compensability of her claim, and the matter was assigned to the fourth district of the workers\u2019 compensation commission. While the case was pending, Jesse M. Frankl, chairman of the commission, was approached by a representative of United Illuminating who claimed that the company was not being treated fairly in the fourth district and identified this case as an instance of such treatment. The representative was not the lawyer representing United Illuminating in this matter. As a result of this conversation, the chairman ordered that the case, which had been the subject of several informal conferences, be transferred to the third district. Thereafter, the plaintiff requested by motion that a hearing be held concerning the transfer and that the transfer order be stayed pending the outcome of the hearing. The motion was denied and no hearing was held.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">In a ruling dated April 12, 1994, the chairman set forth his reasons for transferring the case to the third district. He reasoned that General Statutes \u00a7 31-280 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>provides administrative authority for such transfers and that the legislative history of the statute indicates that workers\u2019 compensation districts cannot be viewed as isolated, autonomous jurisdictions. He stated that General Statutes \u00a7 31-278, as amended by Public Acts 1991, No. 91-339, eliminated any jurisdictional link between the filing of a claim and the district in which it is heard and he concluded that the district \u201cwhere a claim is heard is entirely an administrative matter committed to the sound discretion of the chairman.\u201d The chairman thus denied the motion for hearing and stay, and directed the third district to proceed with the case. The plaintiff subsequently filed a motion to correct, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The plaintiff appealed to the board from the denial of the motion for hearing and stay and the denial of the motion to correct. The board thereupon reserved to this court the following questions: (1) (a) Did the chairman of the workers\u2019 compensation commission properly deny the claimant\u2019s motion for hearing on order of transfer and motion to stay? (b) Was that denial a proper exercise of the chairman\u2019s authority pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-280, specifically subdivisions (6), (14) and (16) of subsection (b)? (2) Does the compensation review board have jurisdiction over appeals taken from the chairman\u2019s exercise of powers conferred to him by General Statutes \u00a7 31-280? Or in the alternative: May a party aggrieved by the chairman\u2019s ruling on a motion relating to an order of transfer seek review and redress before the compensation review board given the limitations of General Statutes \u00a7 31-301 as to the compensation review board\u2019s appellate jurisdiction?</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">This case raises important and previously unanswered questions regarding the administration of Connecticut\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation scheme. As the chairman pointed out in his decision, the legislature in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>1991 made sweeping changes to the portions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act that involve the basic structure of the system. See Public Acts 1991, No. 91-339.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ramifications of these revisions have yet to be considered by either this court or the Supreme Court. We, therefore, conclude that this matter raises issues of first impression that are not, in fact, free from reasonable doubt and that the public interest does, in fact, require that they be determined by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The case is reserved for the opinion of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-12\"> In 1993, the legislature made further extensive changes to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Public Acts 1993, No. 93-228. The 1993 amendments do not have any significant impact on the statutory provisions at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
