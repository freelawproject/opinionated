The pertinent facts are the subject of a stipulation and are undisputed. On September 29, 1987, the plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident caused by the negligence of Joselyn Prishwalko, the operator of a second vehicle. The parties agreed that the plaintiff suffered injuries and damages of $43,000 as a result of the accident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time of the accident, the plaintiff was the insured and a covered person, pursuant to an automobile liability insurance policy issued by the defendant. The policy provided uninsured, underinsured motorist benefits with a $300,000 limit. By letter dated December 18, 1989, the plaintiff demanded underinsured motorist benefits from the defendant. The automobile liability insurance policy issued by the defendant states in pertinent part: \u201cAll claims or suits under part C must be brought within two years of the date of the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The plaintiff filed suit seeking payment of underinsured motorist benefits. While this action was pending in Superior Court, the legislature enacted P.A. 93-77, which provided that no insurance company may limit the time within which any suit or demand for uninsured or underinsured benefits may be brought to a period of less than three years from the date of the accident. The parties stipulated that if \u201csaid Public Act is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>constitutional, the plaintiff has a valid claim for benefits and judgment can enter for the plaintiff in accordance with the stipulation of facts. If the act is unconstitutional, the plaintiff does not have a valid claim and judgment may enter for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">In accordance with the stipulation of the parties and our recent decision in <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty </em>v. <em>Braccidiferro, </em>34 Conn. App. 833, 643 A.2d 1305, cert. granted, 231 Conn. 918, 919, 661 A.2d 98 (1994), the questions reserved for this court\u2019s consideration are answered as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">To the first reserved question \u2014 Is Public Act 93-77 constitutional as applied to the facts of this case? \u2014 we answer \u201cYes.\u201d To the second reserved question \u2014 Does retroactive application of Public Act 93-77 violate the contract clause of the United States constitution as applied to the facts of this case? \u2014 we answer \u201cNo.\u201d To the third reserved question \u2014 Does retroactive application of Public Act 93-77 violate the due process clause of the United States constitution, as applied to the facts of this case? \u2014 we answer \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">No costs will be taxed to either party.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-8\"> The parties also stipulated that the plaintiff received the sum of $20,000 from the tortfeasor, Joselyn Prishwalko, which exhausted any and all liability insurance issued for the benefit of the tortfeasor. The parties further stipulated that this sum should be set off against amounts, if any, recovered from the defendant Aetna Casualty and Surety Company.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
