The trial court determined that the arbitrator properly found that the plaintiff was not underinsured pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 38a-336 (d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff concedes that our Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Covenant Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Coon, </em>220 Conn. 30, 594 A.2d 977 (1991), and <em>American Motorist Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>213 Conn. 625, 569 A.2d 1105 (1990), dictate this result. He, nevertheless, invites this court to review his claims that (1) <em>Coon </em>and <em>Gould, </em>were wrongly decided and (2) \u00a7 38a-336 (d), as interpreted by our Supreme Court and applied to this case, violates the equal protection clauses of the United States<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Connecticut<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">We cannot address the plaintiffs claims that the <em>Coon </em>and <em>Gould </em>cases were wrongly decided as we are bound by Supreme Court precedent. See <em>Somohano </em>v. <em>Somohano, </em>29 Conn. App. 392, 615 A.2d 181 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>We decline to review the plaintiff\u2019s claim that \u201c[\u00a7 38a-336 (d)], as construed in <em>Gould </em>and <em>Coon, </em>is unconstitutional . . . .\u201d Even though the equal protection claims presented here were not raised or considered in <em>Coon </em>and <em>Gould, </em>it is not our function, as an intermediate appellate court, to review whether those decisions render that statute unconstitutional. Whether to overrule a prior Supreme Court decision on grounds not raised in the argument of that case is a matter appropriately reserved for the Supreme Court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>224 Conn. 1, 5-6, 615 A.2d 505 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 38a-336 (d) provides: \u201cFor the purposes of this section, an \u2018underinsured motor vehicle\u2019 means a motor vehicle with respect to which the sum of the limits of liability under all bodily injury liability bonds and insurance policies applicable at the time of the accident is less than the applicable limits of liability under the uninsured motorist portion of the policy against which claim is made under subsection (b) of this section.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b648-9\"> The fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States provides in pertinent part: \u201cNo State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b648-10\"> The constitution of Connecticut, amendment twenty-one, provides in pertinent part: \u201cNo person shall be denied the equal protection of the law . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
