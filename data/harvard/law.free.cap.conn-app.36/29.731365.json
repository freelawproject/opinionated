The defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>ant claims that the trial court improperly (1) allowed an amendment to the application to vacate the award without first taking evidence on why the amendment was filed late, (2) found evident partiality in that the attorney-arbitrator failed to disclose fully the extent of his attorney-client relationship with the in-laws of one of the defendant\u2019s principals, and (3) found that the award violated public policy because the defendant failed to pay prevailing wages in a timely manner to his workers in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 31-71b (a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-53 (b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We decline to review the claim that the trial court improperly allowed the amendment. We conclude that,the trial court improperly found evident partiality and that there was no proper basis for vacating the award on the public policy ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">The plaintiff and the defendant entered into a contract wherein the defendant, a subcontractor, was to render certain construction site services to the plaintiff, a general contractor, for a contract price of $184,200. A contract dispute arose and the parties proceeded to arbitration pursuant to article 6.1<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of their contract. The arbitrator awarded the defendant $44,900 on its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>The plaintiff filed a timely application to vacate the award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> alleging that the award was contrary to public policy because the defendant \u201cfailed to pay its employees lawful wages.\u201d On the date scheduled for the hearing on the application, the plaintiff filed an amended application to vacate the award alleging the additional ground of \u201cevident partiality on the part of the arbitrator which was not fully disclosed.\u201d The defendant objected to the amendment claiming that it was not timely.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>The trial court stated that it would hear evidence on the amended application, reserve decision on the timeliness objection, and allow the parties to file posttrial briefs on all of the issues. Although not ruling directly on the defendant\u2019s timeliness objection, the trial court effectively overruled it by finding evident partiality as a basis for its decision to vacate the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">The trial court found that \u201c[wjhile the arbitrator did disclose that he had represented the defendant\u2019s in-laws in a zoning matter, he failed to disclose that this was an ongoing attorney-client relationship at the time of the arbitration.\u201d The trial court concluded that this failure to disclose required that the award be vacated pursuant to \u00a7 52-418 because of the arbitrator\u2019s evident partiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>The trial court also found that the defendant had an agreement with its workers whereby the balance of their wages \u201cwould be paid at the completion of the project. Such an agreement constitutes a violation of \u00a7 31-53.\u201d The trial court went on to find that \u00a7 31-71b, when read together with \u00a7 31-53, required the \u201cpayment of prevailing wages on a regular pay day.\u201d The court then concluded that because of this agreement the award was in contravention of the public policy expressed in \u00a7\u00a7 31-53 and 31-71b and therefore should be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">\u201c \u2018On appeal, the function of this court is limited solely to the determination of whether the factual findings of the trial court are clearly erroneous or whether the decision is otherwise erroneous in law.\u2019 <em>Public Works Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Eveready Machinery Co., </em>11 Conn.

We review each of the defendant\u2019s claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly permitted the plaintiff to amend its application to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award because there was no evidence to allow such an amendment. The defendant asserts that \u201c[i]t was incumbent upon the plaintiff to put witnesses on the stand to establish an evidentiarybase to support [its] right to file a late amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">No authority, statutory or case law, is cited in support of this claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cWe do not reverse the judgment of a trial court on the basis of challenges to its rulings that have not been adequately briefed.\u201d <em>Latham &amp; Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>218 Conn. 297, 300, 589 A.2d 337 (1991); see Practice Book \u00a7 4065; <em>Gaynor </em>v. <em>Union Trust Co., </em>216 Conn. 458, 482, 582 A.2d 190 (1990); <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Security Title &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>212 Conn. 436, 436-37 n.1, 562 A.2d 510 (1989). We therefore decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s amended application to vacate the arbitration award alleged that there was \u201cevident partiality on the part of the arbitrator which was not fully disclosed.\u201d The trial court concluded that there was evident partiality on the basis of its finding that the arbitrator had failed to disclose <em>fully </em>his <em>attorney-client relationship </em>with the in-laws of Todd Cascella, one of the defendant\u2019s principals. Specifically, the court found that the arbitrator had failed to disclose that the attorney-client relationship was ongoing at the time of the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The defendant asserts, albeit inartfully, that (1) evident partiality based on the attorney-client rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>tionship was not properly raised as an issue before the trial court and, therefore, the court was precluded from making such a finding, and (2) the evidence does not support a finding of evident partiality. The first claim is dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim of evident partiality simply asserts a legal conclusion that was delineated for the first time at the hearing on the application to vacate the award. After the plaintiff\u2019s attorney questioned the arbitrator about his disclosure<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and after the arbitrator stated that he stopped by Todd Cascella\u2019s in-laws\u2019 delicatessen every morning, the trial court interrupted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>the plaintiffs attorney to ask if the disclosure had been placed on the record. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney responded: \u201cWell first of all, Your Honor, there was, there was no record. What I did, when the disclosure was made by Attorney Ehrsam, I went and consulted with my clients. And I relayed the information that Attorney Ehrsam has just indicated was his relationship with the, Mr. Cascella\u2019s bride\u2019s parents to my clients. Which I understood, and counseled my clients, seemed to be just a normal run of the mill professional relationship. A client coming through the office. And because of other factors we decided that we would <em>waive any potential conflict. </em>The information that Attorney Ehrsam has just provided the court, is in fact the information that we just . . . became apprised of .... <em>That he goes into this place every day. </em>And Your Honor, I think that the significance of that, is that that says to me that now we <em>don\u2019t have a professional relationship, </em>but perhaps a <em>personal </em>one as well. Perhaps a personal relationship that pre-dated the professional relationship <em>and that\u2019s a huge difference, Your Honor. </em>...\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">After more statements about the arbitrator\u2019s daily visits to the delicatessen, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney stated that \u201cI don\u2019t think that any further questions need to be asked. <em>That is specifically the issue. That\u2019s the reason for the amendment. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) On redirect examination, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney asked only four questions, none of which related to the disclosure of the attorney-client relationship between the arbitrator and Todd Cascella\u2019s in-laws. Only one other question regarding disclosure was asked by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney: \u201cSo, you did not feel that it would be prudent to disclose that you stop into this delicatessen each morning?\u201d This question was not answered, however, because at this point the court interrupted to inquire whether the attorney-client disclosure had been placed on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>An arbitrator has a duty to disclose circumstances arising after an arbitration proceeding begins that might tend to indicate partiality or bias. <em>Merit Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Leatherby Ins. Co., </em>714 F.2d 673, 678 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1009, 104 S. Ct. 529, 78 L. Ed. 2d 711 (1983); <em>Freeport Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Star Forge, Inc., </em>61 Ill. App. 3d 999, 1005-1006, 378 N.E.2d 558 (1978). In this case, however, <em>any </em>potential conflict arising out of the attorney-client relationship was expressly waived at the arbitration hearing. It is obvious from a review of the transcript of the hearing on the application to vacate that the plaintiff was concerned with a possible previously undisclosed social or personal relationship between the arbitrator and Todd Cascella\u2019s in-laws, not with their attorney-client relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">\u201cIt is a common rule of pleading that the allegations of a complaint limit the issues to be decided on the trial of a case and are calculated to prevent surprise to opposing parties.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>17 Conn. App. 92, 94-95, 550 A.2d 18 (1988). A party also has a right to fair notice \u201cthat a court may render a judgment with respect to a given issue.\u201d <em>Hodge </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>178 Conn. 308, 315, 422 A.2d 280 (1979); <em>Winick </em>v. <em>Winick, </em>153 Conn. 294, 298-99, 216 A.2d 185 (1966). Here, the defendant was faced with a conclusory allegation that did not alert him to any of the plaintiff\u2019s factual claims. Under these circumstances, the defendant was entitled to rely on the statement of the claim placed on the record and the acknowledgment that any claims based on the attorney-client relationship had been waived before the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The rule requiring that claims be raised distinctly and in a timely fashion in the trial court is not only so that the court may give meaningful consideration to the claims but also to prevent counsel from surprising an opponent by interjecting a claim when that opponent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>no longer is in a position to present evidence against such a claim. <em>Swerdloff v. AEG Design/Build, Inc., </em>209 Conn. 185, 189, 550 A.2d 306 (1988); see <em>Oak Leaf Marina, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ertel, </em>23 Conn. App. 91, 95-96, 579 A.2d 568, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 827, 582 A.2d 206 (1990). When the trial court surprises a party by deciding a case on a claim that was not presented to it, that party obviously is no longer in a position to counter the claim. By its ruling, the trial court deprived the defendant of its right to put on evidence regarding the disclosure of the attorney-client relationship by the arbitrator. Our Supreme Court has stated in an action to discharge a mortgage and lis pendens that \u201cthe trial court lacked jurisdiction to determine the validity of the [underlying] note on the usury ground because that issue had not been raised in the pleadings.\u201d <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Tufano, </em>188 Conn. 477, 482, 450 A.2d 852 (1984). This court has held that \u201c[a] judgment granting a prescriptive easement where none was sought and where no pleading raised any issue other than whether the plaintiff had acquired title by adverse possession cannot survive appeal.\u201d <em>Sanford </em>v. <em>Dimes, </em>3 Conn. App. 639, 640, 491 A.2d 398 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">At the hearing before the trial court, the plaintiffs counsel expressly disavowed any interest in the <em>professional </em>attorney-client relationship. Most of the arbitrator\u2019s testimony concerned his morning trips to the delicatessen to pick up a newspaper and an occasional cup of coffee to go. This routine was the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s allegation of evident partiality. Given the articulation of this claim by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, the defendant had no reason to offer evidence on the extent of the disclosure of the arbitrator\u2019s attorney-client relationship with Cascella\u2019s in-laws. As the trial court\u2019s legal conclusion of evident partiality was based on a claim that was not noticed or raised, it cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Our conclusion that the trial court improperly based its decision on the finding of a failure to disclose fully the attorney-client relationship makes it unnecessary to address the question of whether that finding was supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The plaintiff claimed, and the trial court found, that the arbitrator\u2019s award was in violation of the public policy requiring payment of lawful wages in a timely fashion on this construction project, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-53<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and \u00a7 31-71b. The trial court ruled that \u201cwhen viewed together, \u00a7\u00a7 31-71[b]<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and 31-53 require the payment of prevailing wages on a regular pay day. Since the defendant agreed to pay his employees fully only upon completion of the project, the court concludes that General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-71[b] and 31-53 have been violated. Accordingly, the arbitration award should be and is vacated because such an award would be in contravention of public policy as expressed in \u00a7\u00a7 31-53 and 31-71[b].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Todd Cascella testified that he was the \u201cowner\u201d of the defendant construction company. He further testified that he had an agreement with his employees to pay them a portion of the prevailing wage<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> each week with the balance to be paid when the plaintiff paid the defendant. On the basis of all of the evidence before it, the trial court could reasonably and logically have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>found that the defendant violated \u00a7\u00a7 31-53 and 31-71b. The defendant concedes that there may have been a \u201ctechnical violation of the statutes,\u201d but argues that vacating the award is inappropriate. We agree because we conclude that the award does not violate public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">An arbitration award that violates public policy may be vacated but \u201conly when the award is clearly illegal or clearly violative of a strong public policy.\u201d <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>223 Conn. 1, 7, 612 A.2d 742 (1992). This is so \u201c[i]n light of the strong public policy that favors arbitration . . . .\u201d Id.; see also <em>Watertown Police Union Local 541 </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>210 Conn. 333, 339, 555 A.2d 406 (1989). \u201cParties cannot expect an intervening arbitral award approving conduct which is illegal or contrary to public policy to receive judicial endorsement any more than parties can expect a court to enforce such a contract between them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stamford </em>v. <em>Stamford Police Assn., </em>14 Conn. App. 257, 259, 540 A.2d 400 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Arbitration in this case is a result of the contract of the parties. A well recognized principle of contract law is that agreements in violation of public policy will not be enforced by the courts. In <em>Tator </em>v. <em>Valden, </em>124 Conn. 96, 101, 198 A. 169 (1938), our Supreme Court stated that \u201c[i]t is unquestionably the general rule, upheld by the great weight of authority, that no court will lend its assistance in any way toward carrying out the terms of a contract, the <em>inherent purpose of which is to violate the law. </em>In case any action is brought in which it is necessary to prove the <em>illegal contract </em>in order to maintain the action, courts will not enforce it, nor will they enforce any alleged right directly springing from such contract . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) See also <em>Connecticut Importing Co. </em>v. <em>Janowitz, </em>128 Conn. 433, 436, 23 A.2d 514 (1941); <em>State </em>v. <em>Council 4, AFSCME, </em>27 Conn. App. 635, 640, 608 A.2d 718 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>The contract in this case did not have a violation of the law as its inherent purpose. It was simply a contract by the defendant to render certain subcontracting services to the plaintiff. In fact, the contract contains no mention whatever of payment of the prevailing wages, nor was it necessary to prove the illegal wage payment plan in order to prove the defendant\u2019s claim in the arbitration proceedings. In <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Koellmer, </em>11 Conn. App. 375, 380, 527 A.2d 1210 (1987), this court rejected a claim that the trial court should not enforce an employment contract between two parties who were cohabiting in an adulterous relationship because such enforcement would violate public policy. We held that \u201cthe alleged contract was not made for or about the parties\u2019 living arrangements or sexual behavior. The agreement of the parties as pleaded and proved did not involve prohibited acts.\u201d Id. Although the wage agreement that the defendant had with its workers appears to be illegal and violative of the public policy embodied in \u00a7\u00a7 31-53 and 31-71b, the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant did not require any acts prohibited by the prevailing wage statutes.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">As the purpose of the contract was legal, enforcing it by way of an arbitration award would not violate public policy. Indeed, failure to enforce the contract would be much more frustrating of public policy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>the plaintiff to escape liability after breaching the contract would mean that it would not be required to produce the very funds that the defendant and its employees relied on for payment of the prevailing wages. Such a result would work an unjustified forfeiture to the defendant and provide a windfall for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment denying the application to vacate.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-71b (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201c[E]ach employer, by himself, his agent or representative, shall pay weekly all moneys due each employee on a regular pay day . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b54-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-53 (b) provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny person who knowingly or wilfully employs any mechanic, laborer [or] workman ... of any public works project for or on behalf of the state ... at a rate of wage on an hourly basis which is less than the rate customary or prevailing for the same work in the same trade or occupation in the town in which the public works project is being constructed . . . shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars for each offense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b54-7\"> Article 6.1 of the contract provides in pertinent part: \u201cAll claims, disputes and matters in question arising out of or relating to this agreement . . . shall be decided by arbitration . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b55-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cUpon the application of any party to an arbitration, the superior court . . . shall make an order vacating the award if it finds any of the following defects: (1) If the award has been procured by corruption, fraud or undue means; (2) if there has been evident partiality or corruption on the part of any arbitrator; (3) if the arbitrators have been guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause shown or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other action by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced; or (4) if the arbitrators have exceeded their powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b55-7\"> The defendant cited no statute or authority in support of its claim, but stated that the amendment was beyond the \u201cthirty day period.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-420 (b) provides that no motion to vacate \u201cmay be made after thirty days from the notice of the award. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b57-8\"> The defendant\u2019s claim of a \u201clate\u201d amendment does not analyze or implicate the thirty day provision of General Statutes \u00a7 52-420 (b).

This is obviously a typographical error as there is no such statute and the court quotes the following pertinent language from General Statutes \u00a7 31-71b: \u201c(a) Each employer . . . shall pay weekly all moneys due each employee on a regular pay day . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b62-9\"> See footnote 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b64-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-53 (a) requires the insertion of a prevailing wage clause in a contract covered by the statute. We do not know why that provision was not inserted into this contract; however, such a clause would not change our reasoning. The principal purpose of the contract was the rendering of certain subcontracting services with the payment of wages being merely incidental to that purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b64-6\"> Connecticut has a remedy against an employer who fails to pay the prevailing wage. General Statutes \u00a7 31-71g provides for fines and imprisonment for such violations. General Statutes \u00a7 31-72 also provides for civil actions by or on behalf of employees to collect unpaid wages and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b65-12\"> There is no application to confirm the award in the file.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
