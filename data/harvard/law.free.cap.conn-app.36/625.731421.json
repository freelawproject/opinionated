Brody, </em>assistant state\u2019s attorney, with whom, on the brief, were <em>C. Robert Satti, Sr., </em>state\u2019s attorney, and <em>Theresa Ferryman, </em>deputy assistant state\u2019s attorney, for the appellee (state).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b650-5\">O\u2019Connell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Afq\">The defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction, after a jury trial, of breach of the peace in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (l).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury acquitted the defendant of larceny in the sixth degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The defendant claims that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction (1) because her conduct consisting solely of speech is not proscribed by the statute, and (2) because her conduct did not occur in a public place. We reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">The genesis of this case was the defendant\u2019s shopping trip to the Waterford Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket. At the checkout counter, Kim Montigny, a store detective, asked the defendant to accompany her to the store manager\u2019s office on the mezzanine. Once there, Montigny accused the defendant of shoplifting two bags of seafood and a container of cocktail sauce. While in the manager\u2019s office, the defendant became loud and abusive, resulting in a call to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Waterford police officer Mark Willard responded and, after observing the defendant\u2019s behavior, arrested her for shoplifting and breach of the peace. He handcuffed the defendant, and he and Montigny led the defendant down the stairs and out of the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">When asked to cooperate and quiet down, the defendant responded, \u201cFuck you,\u201d several times. The record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>is not clear as to the defendant\u2019s exact location at any of the various times that she used that language.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">While being led down the stairs from the manager\u2019s office, the defendant addressed Montigny, saying, \u201cYou fucking bitch. I hope you burn in hell for all eternity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Montigny also testified that while they were descending the stairs the defendant made a threatening remark to her. The record does not disclose the nature of the threat.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The defendant claims that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. In reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, this court first reviews \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe evidence presented at trial, construing it in the light most favorable to sustaining the facts expressly found by the trial court or impliedly found by the jury.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gomez, </em>225 Conn. 347, 350, 622 A.2d 1014 (1993). The court then determines whether, on the facts thus established and the inferences drawn therefrom, the jury could reasonably have concluded that the cumulative effect of the evidence established the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>220 Conn. 602, 606, 600 A.2d 1300 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>218 Conn. 766, 770-71, 591 A.2d 1225 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The defendant contends that because her conduct consisted solely of language, it is not within the ambit of subdivision (1) of \u00a7 53a-181 (a). It is not disputed that the defendant did not engage in any physical conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">The state argues that the defendant\u2019s language constitutes \u201cfighting words\u201d and thus is not protected speech under the first amendment to the United States constitution. <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 572, 62 S. Ct. 766, 86 L. Ed. 1031 (1942). We do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>not consider constitutional issues, however, unless they are absolutely necessary to the decision of the case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mention, </em>12 Conn. App. 258, 262, 530 A.2d 645, cert. denied, 205 Conn. 809, 532 A.2d 78 (1987). Because this appeal can be determined by construing the breach of the peace statute, we will not address the constitutional \u201cfighting words\u201d issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">A person violates \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1) if he \u201c[ejngages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior . . . .\u201d The issue is whether words alone constitute a violation of this subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">This is not a case of first impression. We have construed the words \u201cviolent or threatening behavior\u201d in this statute to mean \u201cconduct which actually involves physical violence or portends imminent physical violence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lo Sacco, </em>12 Conn. App. 481, 491, 531 A.2d 184, cert. denied, 205 Conn. 814, 533 A.2d 568 (1987). In <em>Lo Sacco, </em>we reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction because his conduct was solely verbal.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">We also look to judicial construction of the parallel provisions of the statute prohibiting disorderly conduct. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The elements of the relevant subdivisions of the two statutes are identical except that the breach of the peace statute concerns behavior in a public place. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>228 Conn. 795, 811, 640 A.2d 986 (1994), which was decided subsequent to the trial in the present case, our Supreme Court reviewed the Connecticut cases and concluded that the \u201ccore of prohibited conduct, as gleaned from the statutory language and its authoritative judicial gloss, is <em>physically </em>violent and <em>physically </em>tumultuous or threatening behavior.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>\u201cThe term \u2018fighting/ by its plain meaning, involves physical force. The phrase \u2018violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior\u2019 also refers to physical action. If two or more words are grouped together, it is possible to ascertain the meaning of a particular word by reference to its relationship with other associated words and phrases under the doctrine of noscitur a sociis. 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (5th Ed. Sands 1992) \u00a7 47-16; <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>[190 Conn. 143, 152, 460 A.2d 26 (1993)]. Applying this doctrine, the Appellate Court, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Lo Sacco, </em>supra, [12 Conn. App. 491] construed \u2018violent or threatening behavior\u2019; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181a (a); to mean \u2018conduct which actually involves physical violence or portends imminent physical violence.\u2019 Id., 491. Similarly, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Duhan, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 665, 668, 460 A.2d 496 (1982), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 194 Conn. 347, 481 A.2d 48 (1984), the Appellate Session of the Superior Court read the term \u2018tumultuous\u2019 in connection with its surrounding words, \u2018violent\u2019 and \u2018threatening,\u2019 and held that, because its meaning should be ascertained by reference to those associated words, \u2018yelling and cursing unaccompanied by violent behavior is not prohibited by\u2019 \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1). In accordance with these decisions, we conclude that the terms \u2018fighting\u2019 and \u2018violent\u2019 lend an aspect of physicality to the more nebulous terms \u2018tumultuous\u2019 and \u2018threatening.\u2019 Thus, we conclude that subdivision (1) of \u00a7 53a-182 (a) prohibits physical fighting, and physically violent, threatening or tumultuous behavior.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 811-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Our case law is clear that \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1) requires proof of physical conduct, and, therefore, there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction in this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because our decision on the defendant\u2019s first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>claim is dispositive of the appeal, we do not reach her second claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment of not guilty of breach of the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of breach of the peace when, with intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he: (1) Engages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior in a public place . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b651-10\"> We note that the defendant was handcuffed at the time the unspecified threatening remark was made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b652-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of disorderly conduct when, with intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he: (1) Engages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b653-6\"> We note that subdivision (5) of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181 (a) expressly prohibits \u201cabusive or obscene language\u201d in a public place. Query as to whether the legislature intended that verbal conduct be prosecuted under this subdivision rather than under subdivision (1)?</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
