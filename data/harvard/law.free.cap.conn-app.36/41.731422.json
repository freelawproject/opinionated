The defendant was an inmate at the Cheshire correctional center (center) and a member of a gang known as the Latin kings. The victim became an inmate at the center on March 27, 1991, and had previously given a statement to the police implicating certain members of the Latin kings in the crime of which he was convicted. On March 28, 1991, while the victim was eating in the dining hall, one of the Latin kings pointed out the victim to a group of Latin king inmates, including the defendant. The group followed the victim as he left the dining hall. The defendant approached the victim from behind and slashed him in the neck with a weapon created by embedding two razor blades into a plastic toothbrush handle.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">At the outset, we note that our Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a claim of noncompliance with \u00a7 54-84 (b) is reviewable on appeal even though the defendant, as here, did not submit a request to charge or take an exception to the instruction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatem, </em>194 Conn. 594, 595, 483 A.2d 1087 (1984); see Prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>tice Book \u00a7 4185; <em>State </em>v. <em>Yurch, </em>229 Conn. 516, 521, 641 A.2d 1387 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>206 Conn. 621, 625, 539 A.2d 114 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">In its final charge, the trial court instructed the jury in part that \u201cyou, as a jury, <em>may not draw any unfair inferences </em>from [the defendant\u2019s] failure to testify.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Pursuant to \u00a7 54-84 (b), \u201c[u]nless the accused requests otherwise, the court <em>shall instruct the jury that they may draw no unfavorable inferences from the accused\u2019s failure to testify. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) \u201c[N]oncompliance with \u00a7 54-84 (b) is plain error because the statute serves to effectuate the fundamental right of a defendant not to testify in his criminal trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>197 Conn. 574, 582, 500 A.2d 539 (1985); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatem, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 595.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Yurch, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 521; <em>State </em>v. <em>Suplicki, </em>33 Conn. App. 126, 128-29, 634 A.2d 1179 (1993); but see <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>22 Conn. App. 321, 327, 577 A.2d 1073, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 828, 582 A.2d 207 (1990) (departure from language of \u00a7 54-84 (b) so minor \u2014 substitution of \u201cadverse\u201d for \u201cunfavorable\u201d \u2014 that deviation \u201cnot improper\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The state has conceded that the trial court did not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 54-84 (b), but argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>that, in light of the instructions given to each panel of prospective jurors, the preliminary remarks to the jury upon the completion of jury selection, and the entire final jury charge, the trial court\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 54-84 (b) was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\u201c[A]n erroneous instruction, even of constitutional dimension, is harmless if, viewed in the context of the charge as a whole, there is no reasonable possibility that the jury were misled. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>187 Conn. 199, 209, 445 A.2d 314 (1982). <em>State </em>v. <em>Carrione, </em>[188 Conn. 681, 685, 453 A.2d 1137 (1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1084, 103 S. Ct. 1775, 76 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1983)]. . . . [W]hether a charge is possibly misleading depends on the substance rather than the form of what is said. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kurvin, </em>186 Conn. 555, 565, 442 A.2d 1327 (1982). <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatem, </em>supra, [194 Conn. 599-600]. Furthermore, when a statutory violation implicates the defendant\u2019s constitutional rightfs] . . . it is the state\u2019s burden to prove harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Yurch, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 522-23. \u201cIn the present context, the state must show that the charge as given conveyed to the jury the substantive meaning of the statutory requirement. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>[199 Conn. 322, 325, 507 A.2d 457 (1986)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>195 Conn. 421, 443, 489 A.2d 350 (1985).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 626; <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>34 Conn. App. 250, 258, 641 A.2d 400, cert. denied, 230 Conn. 902, 644 A.2d 916 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The defendant argues that the phrase \u201cunfair inference\u201d differs substantially from \u201cunfavorable inference,\u201d and that, as a result, the trial court improperly altered the meaning of the statutorily mandated language by affording the jury the opportunity to draw an unfavorable inference from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. The word \u201cunfair\u201d is defined as \u201cunjust\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed.); while \u201cunfavorable\u201d is synonymous with \u201cadverse.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>supra, 22 Conn. App. 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u201cUnfair\u201d and \u201cunfavorable\u201d are not synonyms,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the use of the word \u201cunfair\u201d in place of \u201cunfavorable\u201d conveys a different meaning. The defendant posits, in essence, that the jury reasonably could have been misled to believe that it could draw an unfavorable or adverse inference from his failure to testify if the jury determined that it was fair to draw such an inference in light of the other evidence against him. We agree with the defendant that the use of the word \u201cunfair\u201d imports a meaning different from \u201cunfavorable,\u201d and that the use of the word \u201cunfair\u201d in a given context may result in harmful error.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The state argues, however, that the final charge as a whole, as well as instructions to the prospective jury panel and preliminary instructions to the selected and sworn jurors, rendered harmless the trial court\u2019s improper instruction, and that the trial court did convey the substantive meaning of the statutory requirement. In its instructions to prospective jurors prior to individual voir dire, the trial court correctly explained that selected jurors could draw no unfavorable inference from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. In its preliminary instructions to the sworn jury, the trial court did not use the exact language of \u00a7 54-84 (b), but explained that the defendant had a constitutional right to choose not to take the witness stand or to produce any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>In the final jury charge, the trial court noted several times that the state maintained the burden of proving that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and mentioned that the defendant did not have to produce any evidence. The trial court, however, specifically discussed the defendant\u2019s right not to testify in only the contested portion of the instruction. That section of the instruction provided the following: \u201cNow in this case, the defendant, Mr. Vega, did not testify. And as you have been told, an accused person is under no obligation to become a witness on his own behalf, nor is he obliged to put forth any witnesses on his own behalf. Now, under our law an accused person may testify or not as he sees fit. It is for the state to prove him guilty of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt, and no burden rests upon him in his position as the accused to prove his innocence. Therefore, <em>you, as a jury, may not draw any unfair inferences from his failure to testify. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Yurch, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 521, the trial court improperly instructed the jury that it could draw no <em>unreasonable </em>inference from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. Our Supreme Court determined that this instruction was harmless in light of the language of the charge immediately following the instruction, where the trial court admonished the jury that \u201c \u2018[y]ou must not permit such a fact to weigh in the slightest degree against the defendant. Nor should it enter your discussions or deliberations. A defendant is not required to establish his innocence. He need not produce any evidence whatsoever if he does not choose to do so. As I have told you already, the burden is on the state to prove a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If it fails, a defendant has the right to rely on that failure, and must be of right acquitted.\u2019 \u201d Id., 524. The court determined that this portion of the charge \u201cserved to alert the jury to the fact that it was to draw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number><em>no inference whatsoever </em>from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify\u201d; (emphasis added) id.; and that, therefore, the improper instruction was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Here, the trial court\u2019s final instruction failed to convey the substantive meaning of the statute that the jury could draw no unfavorable inferences from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. The instruction suggested that the jury could draw a fair or just, although unfavorable or adverse, inference from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. Although the trial court instructed prospective jurors that they could draw no unfavorable inference from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify, at least one week elapsed between such instructions and the court\u2019s final charge. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>33 Conn. App. 763, 770-71, 638 A.2d 1084, cert. denied, 229 Conn. 913, 642 A.2d 1207 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>23 Conn. App. 160, 170, 580 A.2d 520 (1990), cert. denied, 216 Conn. 831, 583 A.2d 130, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 981, 111 S. Ct. 1635, 113 L. Ed. 2d 731 (1991) (remarks to prospective jurors \u201cwere temporally unconnected to the court\u2019s final charge and were totally subsumed by the final charge\u201d). Further, we note that \u201c[wjhen preliminary instructions are given, they \u2018do not supersede those given after evidence and arguments under our practice.\u2019 <em>[State </em>v. <em>Woolcock, </em>201 Conn. 605, 623, 518 A.2d 1377 (1986).]\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>220 Conn. 602, 614, 600 A.2d 1330 (1991); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>supra, 770; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">In its final instruction, the trial court charged that the state had the burden of proof and that the defendant did not have to produce any evidence on his behalf. The trial court, however, specifically discussed the defendant\u2019s failure to testify only in the context of the improper portion of the instruction. There, the trial court\u2019s statement that the jury could draw \u201cno unfair inference\u201d together with the language immediately preceding and succeeding that phrase did not preclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>the jury from drawing inferences regarding the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Yurch, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 523-24; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>supra, 195 Conn. 443. The trial court, thus, did not convey that the jury could not consider the defendant\u2019s silence in its deliberations, and left open the reasonable possibility that the jury would misconstrue the charge and assume that it could draw an inference from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. On the basis of the language employed by the trial court, we conclude that there is a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled to understand the charge to allow it to draw a fair, although unfavorable, inference from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Suplicki, </em>supra, 33 Conn.
