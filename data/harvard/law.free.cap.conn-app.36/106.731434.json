The defendant, Lake Spears, was charged by a substitute information<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with committing various crimes while on the Mashantucket Pequot reservation. The defendant moved to dismiss the charges, claiming that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the charged offenses were allegedly committed on the Mashantucket Pequot reservation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>trial court denied that motion, and rendered a judgment of conviction following the defendant\u2019s plea of nolo contendere to the charges of interfering with a peace officer in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167a, assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61, and disorderly conduct in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182. The defendant\u2019s plea was entered conditional on his right to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The following facts are not in dispute. The Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe is a federally recognized tribe that owns and occupies a tribal reservation containing approximately 1800 acres in Ledyard. The defendant is a member of the Narragansett Indian tribe, and not a member of the Mashantucket Pequot tribe.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On November 29, 1991, in response to a telephone call, State Trooper Robert Maynard was dispatched to investigate a disturbance at 8 Elizabeth George Drive, a residential address on the Mashantucket Pequot reservation. Maynard was assisted by Ledyard town constables Sergeant David Guiher and Officers John Craig and William Blanchette. As a result of actions by the defendant, he was arrested by Maynard and Craig, charged, and ultimately presented before the Superior Court. At the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest and presentment, he was \u201can Indian in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Indian territory.\u201d After the trial court found the defendant guilty on the plea of nolo contendere, the defendant appealed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the Connecticut Indian Land Claims Settlement Act of 1983<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Settlement Act) effected a complete grant of criminal jurisdiction over the Mashantucket Pequot reservation to the state in that it (1) found that the plain meaning of \u00a7 6 of the Settlement Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1755,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> fully subjects the reservation to state criminal jurisdiction, and (2) found that the Mashantucket Pequot tribe has consented to state criminal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The state asserts that it possesses criminal jurisdiction over the Mashantucket Pequot reservation pursuant to an express grant by Congress in \u00a7 6 of the Settlement Act. The state does not claim that the tribe is divested of self-government, or that the tribe cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>enact tribal laws that govern the conduct of tribal members, or that the tribe lacks power to enforce such laws.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The parties in this matter are in the curious position of agreeing on the issue, the general principles of law, the relevant authorities and the primary facts. Where the parties differ is on the result that is rendered after the facts are applied to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The defendant claims that the state lacks jurisdiction over criminal offenses committed by Indians while on the Mashantucket Pequot reservation. The state and the defendant agree that states do not have jurisdiction over Indian country unless Congress has specifically authorized such jurisdiction. <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>31 U.S. 515, 8 L. Ed. 483 (1832). They disagree, however, in regard to the application of \u00a7 6 of the Settlement Act. Specifically, they disagree on the issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>whether \u00a7 6 vests the state with jurisdiction over crimes committed by Indians on the Mashantucket Pequot tribe\u2019s reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">We agree with the defendant, and we arrive at our conclusion by way of the following statutory path. Section 6 of the Settlement Act, codified at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1755, addresses the issue of the state\u2019s jurisdiction over the Mashantucket Pequot tribe. This statute refers to portions of Title IY of the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968, codified at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1321 through 1326. The dispute in the present case concerns the impact of 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1755 on \u00a7\u00a7 401 and 406 of the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968, codified at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1321 (a) and 1326, respectively. Specifically, the issue before us is whether 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1755 vests the state with criminal jurisdiction over the Mashantucket Pequot tribe notwithstanding the provision contained in 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321 (a), which otherwise requires that a tribe manifest its consent to jurisdiction prior to a state\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">We begin our analysis by examining the well established principles that govern state jurisdiction over Indians in Indian country.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cCriminal jurisdiction over offenses committed in \u2018Indian country\u2019 ... is governed by a complex patchwork of federal,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> state, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>and tribal law.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks <em>omitted.)

Ed. 2d 457 (1993). \u201cAs a practical matter, this has meant that criminal offenses by or against Indians have been subject only to federal or tribal laws . . . except where Congress in the exercise of its plenary and exclusive power over Indian affairs has \u2018expressly provided that State laws shall apply.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Yakima Indian Nation, </em>439 U.S. 463, 470-71, 99 S. Ct. 740, 58 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1979). \u201cWhen on-reservation conduct involving only Indians is at issue, state law is generally inapplicable, for the state\u2019s regulatory interest is likely to be minimal and the federal interest in encouraging tribal self-government is at its strongest.\u201d <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe </em>v. <em>Bracken, </em>448 U.S. 136, 144, 100 S. Ct. 2578, 65 L. Ed. 2d 655 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">In 1953, pursuant to its plenary authority over Indian affairs, Congress enacted Public Law 83-280,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>federal jurisdictional statute of general applicability to Indian reservation lands; <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Itasca County, </em>426 U.S. 373, 379, 96 S. Ct. 2102, 48 L. Ed. 2d 710 (1976), and \u201cthe primary expression of federal policy governing the assumption by States of civil and criminal jurisdiction over the Indian Nations.\u201d <em>Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation </em>v. <em>Wold Engineering, </em>476 U.S. 877, 884, 106 S. Ct. 2305, 90 L. Ed. 2d 881 (1986) <em>(Three Tribes II). </em>The primary purpose of that legislation was to address the \u201cproblem of lawlessness on certain Indian reservations, and the absence of adequate tribal institutions for law enforcement.\u201d Id.; <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Yakima Indian Nation, </em>supra, 439 U.S. 471; H.R. Rep. No. 848, 83d Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 5-6 (1953). Other purposes of the act were \u201cto [promote] the gradual assimilation of Indians into the dominant American culture and [ease] the fiscal and administrative burden borne by the Federal Government by virtue of its control over Indian affairs.\u201d <em>Three Tribes II, </em>supra, 886; <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Itasca County, </em>supra, 387-88; H.R. Rep. No. 848, supra, pp. 3, 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Public Law 83-280, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> embodied the provision for state criminal jurisdiction over offenses committed by or against Indians on reservations. <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Itasca County, </em>supra, 426 U.S. 380. It effected an immediate grant of criminal jurisdiction over Indian country to five states.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>To the remaining states, it provided an option to assume jurisdiction over criminal offenses in Indian country \u201cwithout consulting with or securing the consent of the tribes that would be affected.\u201d <em>Washington v. Yakima Indian Nation, </em>supra, 439 U.S. 473-74. Section 7 of Public Law 83-280 established a procedure by which all other states could obtain civil or criminal jurisdiction over Indian tribes: \u201cThe consent of the United States is hereby given to any other State not having jurisdiction with respect to criminal offenses or civil causes of action, or with respect to both, as provided for in this Act, to assume jurisdiction at such time and in such manner as the people of the State shall, by affirmative legislative action, obligate and bind the State to assumption thereof.\u201d See <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Yakima Indian Nation, </em>supra, 474 n.9; <em>Schaghticoke Indians of Kent, Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>217 Conn. 612, 622, 587 A.2d 139 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">In 1968, Congress enacted Title IV of the Indian Civil Rights Act,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which repealed \u00a7 7 of Public Law 83-280. Title IV requires that all subsequent assertions of jurisdiction be preceded by tribal consent. <em>Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation </em>v. <em>Wold Engineering, </em>467 U.S. 138, 144, 104 S. Ct. 2267, 81 L. Ed. 2d 113 (1984) <em>(Three Tribes I). </em>\u201cThe impetus for the addition of a consent requirement in the 1968 amendments was congressional dissatisfaction with the involuntary extension of state jurisdiction over Indians who did not feel they were ready to accept such jurisdiction, or who felt threatened by it.\u201d <em>Three Tribes II, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 892, citing S. Rep. No. 721, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 32 (1967). Section 401 of Title IV,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> which addresses the subject of criminal jurisdiction over Indian country, provides: \u201cThe consent of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>States is hereby given to any State not having jurisdiction over criminal offenses committed by or against Indians in the areas of Indian country situated within such State to assume, <em>with the consent of the Indian tribe </em>occupying the particular Indian country or part thereof which could be affected by such assumption, such measure of jurisdiction over any or all of such offenses committed within such Indian country or any part thereof as may be determined by such State to the same extent that such State has jurisdiction over any such offense committed elsewhere within the State, <em>and the criminal laws of such State shall have the same force and effect within such Indian country or part thereof as they have elsewhere within that State.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321 (a). \u201cThe method of a state\u2019s assumption of criminal jurisdiction is not specified by \u00a7 401 [25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321 (a)], but is found in \u00a7 406 codified in 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> . . . <em>Mashantucket Pequot Tribe </em>v. <em>McGuigan, </em>626 F. Sup. 245, 247 (D. Conn. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In 1983, Congress enacted the Settlement Act for the purpose of settling tribal claims to much of the private and public lands located in Ledyard. <em>Mashantucket Pequot Tribe </em>v. <em>McGuigan, </em>supra, 626 F. Sup. 246-47.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Section 6 of the act, codified at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1755, which addresses the subject of state jurisdiction over the Mashantucket Pequot tribe\u2019s reservation, provides: <em>\u201cNotwithstanding the provision relating to a special election in section 4-06 [of the Indian Civil Rights Act], </em>the reservation of the Tribe is declared to be Indian country <em>subject to State jurisdiction to the maximum extent provided in title IV of such Act. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">In the present case, the defendant claims that even if the Settlement Act eliminates the requirement for a special election pursuant to 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, it does not eliminate the general consent requirement contained in 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321 (a). The defendant also claims that since the tribe has never consented to the state\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction over offenses committed by Indians on the Mashantucket Pequot reser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>vation, the state lacks such jurisdiction and, therefore, the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">We first address the issue of whether the Settlement Act dispenses with the special election requirement contained in 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. The trial court concluded that the plain meaning of 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1755 \u201cclearly indicates the intent of Congress to dispense with the special election requirement of \u00a7 406 [of Title IV of the Indian Civil Rights Act, codified at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">\u201cIt is the duty of the court to \u2018interpret statutes as they are written\u2019; <em>Muha </em>v. <em>United Oil Co., </em>180 Conn. 720, 730, 433 A.2d 1009 (1980); and not \u2018by construction read into statutes provisions which are not clearly stated.\u2019 <em>Glastonbury Co. </em>v. <em>Gillies, </em>209 Conn. 175, 179, 550 A.2d 8 (1988).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>227 Conn. 534, 542, 630 A.2d 1059 (1993). Where the \u201c \u2018will of Congress . . . has been expressed in reasonably plain terms, that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Negonsott </em>v. <em>Samuels, </em>supra, 507 U.S. 104, citing <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Oceanic Contractors, Inc., </em>458 U.S. 564, 570, 102 S. Ct. 3245, 73 L. Ed. 2d 973 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Section 1755 of title 25 of the United States Code provides: \u201cNotwithstanding the provision relating to a special election in section 406 of the [Indian Civil Rights Act] . . . .\u201d The plain language of this statute clearly indicates that Congress intended to dispense with the special election requirement that is otherwise required in order for a state to assume criminal jurisdiction over crimes committed by Indians in Indian country. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court properly determined that 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1755 dispenses with the special election requirement contained in 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">We next address the issue of whether the Settlement Act dispenses with the general consent requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>contained in 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321 (a). The trial court stated that \u201c \u2018[t]he primary concern of Congress in enacting Public Law [83-280] that emerges from its sparse legislative history, was with the problem of lawlessness on certain Indian reservations, and the absence of adequate tribal institution for law enforcement.\u2019 . . . Since the Settlement Act dispenses with this special election and grants criminal jurisdiction in the State of Connecticut without the requirements of any such vote, it must be concluded that criminal jurisdiction has been fully vested in the State of Connecticut.\u201d Initially, we note that the language contained in 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1755 is ambiguous because, although it \u201celiminates the consent election provided in 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, it may have created an anomaly by the fact that it does not eliminate the consent requirement of 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321 [a].\u201d <em>Mashantucket Pequot Tribe </em>v. <em>McGuigan, </em>supra, 626 P. Sup. 248. Since the statutory language is unclear, we must determine whether Congress intended to eliminate the general consent requirement contained in \u00a7 401 of Title IV, codified at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\u201cIt is fundamental that statutory construction requires us to ascertain the intent of the legislature and to construe the statute in a manner that effectuates that intent.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 541. \u201cIf the statutory language is unclear, the intent of the legislature may be ascertained by looking to the legislative history and to the purpose that the statute was intended to serve.\u201d Id., 542. \u201cFurthermore, it is a well established rule of statutory construction that repeal of the provisions of a statute by implication is not favored and will not be presumed where the old and the new statutes, in this case [25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321 (a) and 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1755], can peacefully coexist.\u201d <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>217 Conn. 568, 578, 587 A.2d 116 (1991). \u201c \u2018In the interpretation of a statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>a radical departure from an established policy cannot be implied. It must be expressed in unequivocal language.\u2019 \u201d Id. \u201cThe legislature is presumed to be aware and to have knowledge of all existing statutes and the effect which its own action or nonaction may have on them.\u201d <em>Windham First Taxing District </em>v. <em>Windham, </em>208 Conn. 543, 554, 546 A.2d 226 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">As we noted previously, Congress enacted Title IV of the Indian Civil Rights Act in response to \u201ccongressional dissatisfaction with the involuntary extension of state jurisdiction over Indians who did not feel they were ready to accept such jurisdiction, or who felt threatened by it.\u201d <em>Three Tribes II, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 892, citing S. Rep. No. 721, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 32 (1967). Congress concluded that tribes were critical of Public Law 83-280 \u201cbecause it authoriz[ed] the unilateral application of State law to all tribes without their consent and regardless of their needs or special circumstances.\u201d Id. (views of Senator Sam Ervin). The Indian Civil Rights Act amended Public Law 83-280 so that any State not presently having civil and criminal jurisdiction over Indian tribes would be required to obtain the consent of the tribes before assuming such jurisdiction. In order to verify that tribal members were in fact \u201cready to accept such jurisdiction,\u201d Congress enacted \u00a7 406 of Title IV, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. Section 406 provides that tribal consent may be manifested only by a majority vote of the tribe\u2019s enrolled adult Indians, voting in a special election held for that purpose. Ken<em>nerly </em>v. <em>District Court of Montana, </em>400 U.S. 423, 429, 91 S. Ct. 480, 27 L. Ed. 2d 507 (1971).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Essentially, Congress enacted only one tribal consent requirement, embodied in \u00a7 401, codified at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321 (a), and one method by which consent must be demonstrated, embodied in \u00a7 406, codified at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. \u201cThe method of a state\u2019s assumption of criminal jurisdiction is not specified by \u00a7 401 [25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321 (a)], but is found in \u00a7 406 [25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326] . . . wherein the election to effectuate consent is set forth and is mandatory.\u201d <em>Mashantucket Pequot Tribe </em>v. <em>McGuigan, </em>supra, 626 F. Sup. 247. After tribal consent is manifested by the method prescribed in \u00a7 406, \u201cthe criminal laws of such State shall have the same force and effect within such Indian country or part thereof as they have elsewhere within that State.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Id.; see 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">In light of the legislative history of the Indian Civil Rights Act and the case law interpreting \u00a7 401 of the Indian Civil Rights Act, we conclude that Congress, by enacting 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1755, did not intend to dispense with the general consent requirement embodied in 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321 (a). \u201cIf the legislature had intended by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>enacting [25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1755] to do away with the longstanding policy of [the general consent requirement], it could easily have said so.\u201d See <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 217 Conn. 578. In fact, Congress did not do so; it merely removed the specific procedure by which tribal consent must be manifested.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Finally, we address the issue of whether the Mashantucket Pequot tribe has consented to the state\u2019s assumption of criminal jurisdiction over offenses committed by Indians on the Mashantucket Pequot reservation. Both the state and the defendant cite portions of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Ordinance (M.P.T.O.) No. 112091-01<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> to support their argument. As we stated earlier, it is our duty to \u201cinterpret statutes as they are written.\u201d <em>Muha </em>v. <em>United Oil Co., </em>supra, 180 Conn. 730. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>\u201cIn the interpretation of a statute, a radical departure from an established policy cannot be implied. It must be expressed in unequivocal language.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Iacomacci </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>209 Conn. 219, 222, 550 A.2d 640 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The plain language of M.P.T.O No. 112091-01 does not amount to an \u201cunequivocal expression\u201d of tribal consent. On its face, the ordinance merely appears to \u2022acknowledge and address the well established principle that tribal courts lack inherent authority to punish a person who is not Indian on the reservation, and may not exercise such jurisdiction without the consent of Congress. See <em>Oliphant </em>v. <em>Suquamish Indian Tribe, </em>435 U.S. 191, 210, 98 S. Ct. 1011, 55 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1978). Absent an unequivocal expression of consent by the tribe, we are unwilling to imply such consent. Our conclusion that the tribe has not consented to such jurisdiction is also supported by the language contained in subsequent tribal ordinances.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the plain language of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Ordinances does not unequivocally express the tribe\u2019s consent to the assumption by the state of jurisdiction over offenses committed on the reservation by Indians.

Since 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321 (a) requires that tribal consent be manifested prior to \u201cthe criminal laws of the state having the same force and effect within Indian country as they have elsewhere within the state,\u201d and the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe has never consented to the state\u2019s assumption of criminal jurisdiction, we hold that 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1755 does not vest the state with criminal jurisdiction over criminal offenses committed by Indians on the Mashantucket Pequot reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b131-10\"> The defendant was arrested initially on a charge of disorderly conduct involving Keri Spears, his wife, a resident of the reservation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b131-11\"> Although the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss advances two separate grounds for dismissal, the defendant acknowledged at oral argument before the trial court that the second claim in the motion, that the alleged conduct needed to have occurred in a public place, was abandoned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b132-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a provides in pertinent part: \u201cWhen a defendant, prior to the commencement of trial, enters a plea of nolo contendere conditional on the right to take an appeal from the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s . . . motion to dismiss, the defendant after the imposition of sentence may file an appeal within the time prescribed by law.

The first is in maintaining a correct interpretation of the federal statutes at issue here. It claims that the defendant and the tribe\u2019s position is simply an incorrect interpretation of the law. The United States government also claims a strong administrative interest in the outcome of this case because it claims that the logical consequence of the defendant\u2019s position is that the state courts also lack jurisdiction over many criminal prosecutions for crimes committed on the reservation by persons who are not Indians; the corollary being that the federal courts and the federal government must assume the burden of these prosecutions. The government asserts that \u201cthe issue before the [Appellate Court] has large consequences for the United States. Adoption of the defendant\u2019s position would impose a significant burden on the federal judiciary, the federal courts, the United States Attorney\u2019s office, the United States Marshals\u2019 Service and all other federal law enforcement agencies. Without in any way minimizing the enormous caseload in the state courts, the United States must point out that, based on a system that calculates the weight of each case, the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut had one of the heaviest caseloads per judgeship in the federal judicial system.
