Because the appeal was taken from the denial of a motion to dismiss the action, we conclude that no final judgment exists and that the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>The procedural history of this case is not in dispute. The plaintiff brought this personal injury action against the defendant pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 13a-149 for injuries he sustained when he slipped and fell on a sidewalk. The trial court granted the plaintiff s motion for default based on the defendant\u2019s failure to plead. Before a scheduled hearing in damages was held, the defendant filed a motion to open the default, which the trial court denied. The defendant then moved to dismiss the plaintiffs action on the basis of an alleged lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. This appeal and the plaintiffs cross appeal followed. The plaintiff now moves to dismiss the defendant\u2019s appeal for lack of a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u201cThe lack of a final judgment is a threshold question that implicates the subject matter jurisdiction of this court.\u201d <em>Schick </em>v. <em>Windsor Airmotive Division/Barnes Group, </em>31 Conn. App. 819, 822, 627 A.2d 478 (1993), citing <em>Walton </em>v. <em>New Hartford, </em>223 Conn. 155, 162 n.9, 612 A.2d 1153 (1992). Where there is no final judgment, we cannot reach the merits of the appeal. General Statutes \u00a7 52-263; Practice Book \u00a7 4000; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Otis Elevator Co., </em>33 Conn. App. 99, 102, 633 A.2d 731 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">\u201cIt is undisputed that the denial of a motion to dismiss is not ordinarily a final judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Sasso </em>v. <em>Aleshin, </em>197 Conn. 87, 90, 495 A.2d 1066 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Malkowski, </em>189 Conn. 101, 104, 454 A.2d 275 (1983); <em>Kioukis </em>v. <em>Kioukis, </em>185 Conn. 249, 251 n.1, 440 A.2d 894 (1981); <em>Guerin </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>167 Conn. 282, 283, 355 A.2d 255 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucher, </em>119 Conn. 436, 437, 177 A. 383 (1935); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>4 Conn. Cir. Ct. 534, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>536, 236 A.2d 479 (1967). The appeal in this case was taken from the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. The denial of the motion did not terminate the plaintiff\u2019s action. On the contrary, no final judgment has been rendered because the issue of damages remains unresolved and is scheduled for hearing before the trial court. <em>Cannavo Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>194 Conn. 43, 45 n.4, 478 A.2d 601 (1984); <em>Automotive Twins </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>138 Conn. 28, 33, 82 A.2d 146 (1951). Because the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is not a final jdugment, the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">We turn, sua sponte, to whether the plaintiff\u2019s cross appeal is properly here. The plaintiff filed a cross appeal raising the following issue: \u201cWhether the granting of a default against the appellee city of Bridgeport in favor of the appellant Jamie Akerson deems the jurisdictional allegations of fact in the complaint admitted, and, therefore, conclusively finds subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">A cross appeal is an independent appeal and, therefore, may be viable under certain circumstances even though the main appeal is no longer before the court. See <em>Schurman </em>v. <em>Schurman, </em>188 Conn. 268, 270, 449 A.2d 169 (1982). In this case, however, the cross appeal cannot stand independently because it is jurisdiction-ally improper. First, the cross appeal was taken from the denial of the motion to dismiss, which is not a final judgment. Even if the cross appeal had been taken from a final judgment, the plaintiff was not aggrieved by the denial of the motion to dismiss as required under Practice Book \u00a7 4005.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The issue that the cross appeal seeks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>to raise cannot properly be addressed until a final judgment is rendered in the trial court. The cross appeal, therefore, must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The appeal and the cross appeal are dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-7\"> One exception to this rule is that interlocutory appeals may be taken from denials of motions to dismiss based on double jeopardy claims. See <em>Sasso </em>v. <em>Aleshin, </em>197 Conn. 87, 90 n.3, 495 A.2d 1066 (1985). That exception is grounded in constitutionally guaranteed rights and does not apply to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b184-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 4005 provides in relevant part: \u201cAny appellee or appellees aggrieved by the judgment or decision from which the appellant has appealed may jointly or severally file a cross appeal within ten days from the filing of the appeal. . .</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
