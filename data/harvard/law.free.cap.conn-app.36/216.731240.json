He claims on appeal that the habeas court should have found, taking into account several acts of alleged incompetency, that trial counsel denied the petitioner effective assistance of counsel in violation of the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The evidence supporting the petitioner\u2019s conviction was summarized by the Connecticut Supreme Court on direct appeal in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeffrey, </em>220 Conn. 698, 601 A.2d 993 (1991), cert. denied, 505 U.S. 1224, 112 S. Ct. 3041, 120 L. Ed. 2d 909 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Following a jury trial, the petitioner was convicted of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) and kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A). He was given a total effective sentence of twelve years, suspended after eight years, with four years probation. His conviction was upheld on direct appeal to the Supreme Court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeffrey, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">The petitioner asserts that the habeas court incorrectly determined that four alleged omissions in the assistance rendered by the trial counsel did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. The alleged omissions are (1) counsel\u2019s failure to object to the admission into evidence of a sex crimes report, (2) his failure to request a limiting instruction with respect to prior consistent statements of a state\u2019s witness, (3) his failure to investigate potential surrebuttal witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>and documentary evidence, and (4) his failure to object to certain questions asked by the state on cross-examination of \u00e1 defense witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The petitioner\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel is assured by the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. \u201cThe right of a defendant to effective assistance is not, however, the right to perfect representation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>173 Conn. 153, 159-60, 376 A.2d 1108 (1977); <em>Chace </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>19 Conn.

App. 260, 263, 573 A.2d 330 (1990). \u201cIn order to prevail in a habeas corpus challenge, \u2018the petitioner \u201cmust demonstrate a miscarriage of justice or other prejudice and not merely an error which might entitle him to relief on appeal. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>United States, </em>368 U.S. 424, 428, 82 S.

App. 172, 180-81, 572 A.2d 378 (1990). \u201cIn an appeal from the denial of a habeas writ, the burden imposed upon the petitioner is higher than that imposed on him in a direct appeal.\u201d <em>Magnotti </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>22 Conn. App. 669, 674, 579 A.2d 553 (1990); see <em>Biggs </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>26 Conn.

First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. . . . Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. . . . Unless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction . . . resulted from a breakdown in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>adversary process that renders the result unreliable.\u2019 <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, reh. denied, 467 U.S. 1267, 104 S. Ct. 3562, 82 L. Ed. 2d 864 (1984); <em>Aillon </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>211 Conn. 352, 357, 559 A.2d 200 (1989).\u201d <em>Fair </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>211 Conn. 398, 402, 559 A.2d 1094, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 981, 110 S. Ct. 512, 108 L. Ed. 2d 514 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\u201cWith regard to the performance component of this inquiry, \u2018the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Aillon </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 357. \u201cThe constitution guarantees only a fair trial and a competent attorney; it does not ensure that every conceivable constitutional claim will be recognized and raised. <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 134, 102 S. Ct. 1558, 71 L. Ed. 2d 783 (1982). The defendant is also not guaranteed assistance of an attorney who will make no mistakes. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>616 F.2d 1151, 1152 (9th Cir. 1980). \u2018 \u201cWhat constitutes effective assistance [of counsel] is not and cannot be fixed with yardstick precision, but varies according to the unique circumstances of each representation.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Baldi, </em>54 N.Y.2d 137, 146, 429 N.E.2d 400, 444 N.Y.S.2d 893 (1981).\u2019 <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>195 Conn. 636, 649, 490 A.2d 82 (1985).\u201d <em>Giannotti </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>26 Conn. App. 125, 130, 599 A.2d 26 (1991), cert. denied, 221 Conn. 905, 600 A.2d 1359 (1992); see also <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>218 Conn. 403, 425, 589 A.2d 1214 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">\u201cJudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential. It is all too tempting for a defendant to second guess counsel\u2019s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence, and it is all too easy for a court, examining counsel\u2019s defense after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable. . . . A fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time. Because of the difficulties inherent in making the evaluation, a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \u2018might be considered sound trial strategy.\u2019 . . . [C]ounsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 466 U.S. 689-90; see also <em>Quintana </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>220 Conn. 1, 593 A.2d 964 (1991); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>217 Conn. 419, 586 A.2d 582 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Even if trial counsel\u2019s assistance is shown to be ineffective, the petitioner cannot succeed in his claim unless he proves prejudice. <em>Fair </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 407. \u201cThis requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\u201d <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 466 U.S. 687. \u201cAn error by counsel, even if professionally unreasonable, does not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment.\u201d Id., 691. \u201cIt is not enough for the [petitioner] to show that the errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d Id., 693. Rather, \u201c[t]he [petitioner] must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d Id., 694. \u201c \u2018When a [petitioner] challenges a conviction, the question is whether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fair </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Subjected to the foregoing principles of review, the petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance claim cannot succeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The petitioner first submits that trial counsel\u2019s failure to object on hearsay grounds to the admission into evidence of a sex crimes report constituted ineffective assistance. The petitioner did not, however, meet his burden of showing prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Over defense counsel\u2019s objection on grounds of relevance, the trial court admitted into evidence a sex crimes report prepared by the lead investigating officer in the case, Detective Patricia Miranda, based on statements given to Miranda by the victim. The Supreme Court explained and summarized the facts surrounding the compilation and admission of the sex crimes report as follows: <em>\u201cA </em>sex crimes report is a four page form used by the police to compile data concerning sex crimes as required by General Statutes \u00a7 29-7a. It contains spaces for the officer to fill in general information about the victim and the offender, such as their names, addresses and ages. It also contains a checklist of 572 standardized phrases referring to different aspects of sex crimes from which the officer selects those applicable to a particular case. The sex crimes report in this case was admitted into evidence during the direct testimony of Miranda after her statement that, following her interview of the [victim], she prepared the report in the regular course of business in accordance with her statutory duty to do so. The trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection that the report was irrelevant and noted the defendant\u2019s exception to the ruling.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeffrey, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 707-708.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>On direct appeal, the petitioner challenged the trial court\u2019s admission of the report on the ground of relevance, and raised for the first time a hearsay objection as well. The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s determination that the report was relevant and it declined to review the unpreserved hearsay claim on plain error grounds. The court observed that the admission into evidence of the sex crimes report was not likely to change the outcome of the trial as it was largely cumulative testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The habeas court did not rule on the issue of whether trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the report on hearsay grounds fell below the standard of competence, holding instead that the petitioner was not prejudiced.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Our review of the record confirms the habeas court\u2019s conclusion that the petitioner was not prejudiced. The majority of the report would have been admissible even over a hearsay objection. The victim\u2019s statements to Miranda would have been admissible under the constancy of accusation doctrine. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dabkowski, </em>199 Conn. 193, 197, 506 A.2d 118 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Palozie, </em>165 Conn. 288, 294-95, 334 A.2d 468 (1973); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>32 Conn. App. 773, 779, 631 A.2d 333 (1993). Even had the trial counsel pressed a hearsay objection, the state would have been able to establish that portions of the form were Miranda\u2019s own observations or opinions, which she would have been allowed to express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>in oral testimony. These would have then been admissible under the business records exception to the hearsay rule, as Miranda was under a duty to report the information. General Statutes \u00a7 52-180; <em>River Dock &amp; Pile, Inc. </em>v. <em>O &amp; G Industries, Inc., </em>219 Conn. 787, 799, 595 A.2d 839 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Palozie, </em>supra, 294-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">Moreover, even if we assume that a hearsay objection would have prevented admission of the report or certain portions thereof, the petitioner was not prejudiced by its admission. Not only were the victim\u2019s statements properly admissible as constancy of accusation evidence, but also, as the habeas court observed, the victim\u2019s version of the incident was recounted at trial by Miranda herself. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeffrey, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 711. By the assessment of the petitioner\u2019s own expert witness, Miranda was a proficient and effective witness with an impressive grasp of the facts to which she testified, including the victim\u2019s statements to her concerning the sexual assault. The content of the report was therefore cumulative, as substantially the same evidence had been placed before the jury by two testifying witnesses. Thus, its admission was not critical to the outcome of the trial nor did it undermine the fairness and reliability of the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the habeas court correctly determined that the petitioner did not meet his burden of proving prejudice, under the <em>Strickland </em>standard, resulting from counsel\u2019s failure to object on hearsay grounds to the admission of the sex crimes report.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The petitioner next claims that trial counsel\u2019s failure to request an instruction limiting the jury\u2019s consideration of a witness\u2019 prior consistent statements to their impact on her credibility constituted ineffective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>assistance. Katherine Doyle, the petitioner\u2019s friend and the bookkeeper at the Old Saybrook nightclub he managed, testified as a state\u2019s rebuttal witness at the trial. Id. Her testimony contradicted the petitioner\u2019s version of events in significant ways. Id. When cross-examining Doyle, the petitioner tried to portray her as a jilted lover whom he rejected sometime in April, 1989. Id., 712. This would support an inference that Doyle had a motive to falsify testimony against the petitioner. The state was allowed to rehabilitate Doyle by establishing that, in early 1989, she had described the petitioner\u2019s strange behavior not only to his parents but also to the petitioner\u2019s trial counsel. Id., 712-13. No instruction limiting the jury\u2019s consideration of Doyle\u2019s prior statements to their effect on her credibility was requested or delivered. Id., 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">In his amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the petitioner claimed that counsel\u2019s failure to request a limiting instruction amounted to less than reasonably competent performance and that the \u201cunprofessional error\u201d probably affected the outcome of the trial. At the hearing, trial counsel testified that he knew that Doyle\u2019s trial testimony on the petitioner\u2019s whereabouts and conduct on the days in question was damaging to the defense. He also was concerned that Doyle\u2019s testimony had pitted the petitioner\u2019s credibility against that of a second woman, in addition to that of the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The habeas court, again without addressing the claim of deficient performance,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> determined that the lack of a limiting instruction did not result in prejudice. The petitioner did not deny that the sexual encounter had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>occurred, but testified that it had been consensual, and he pitted his own credibility against that of the victim. The limiting instruction that he now claims his counsel should have requested would have told the jury that the rebuttal witness\u2019 statements to the petitioner\u2019s lawyer and to his parents that the petitioner had acted abnormally after the encounter should be considered not for its substance but only to establish the witness\u2019 credibility. The habeas court found that such an instruction would have highlighted the overall issue of credibility, and would have called the jury\u2019s attention to a second contest of credibility, that is, the petitioner\u2019s attempt to depict another woman as a liar despite her consistency in making the damaging observation both at a time when she was ostensibly well disposed toward the petitioner and thereafter. The failure to call further attention to this testimony was not prejudicial under the <em>Strickland-Lockhart </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Thus, in the context of this ineffective assistance claim, the absence of a limiting instruction did not prejudice the petitioner. Doyle\u2019s prior statements were properly admitted. The more credible the jury adjudged Doyle to be, as a result of her prior consistent statement, the more likely it was to accept her rebuttal testimony concerning the same facts. The habeas court\u2019s conclusion that the absence of a limiting instruction was not prejudicial and did not lead to an unfair or unreliable outcome was therefore correct and should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The petitioner claims that the habeas court should have found prejudice resulting from counsel\u2019s failure to investigate potential surrebuttal witnesses and documentary evidence that would have impugned Doyle\u2019s testimony concerning the petitioner\u2019s behavior on the days following the incident. This claim too must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>fail, as the petitioner did not show that such witnesses or evidence could have been located within an appropriate period.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">At the habeas hearing, the petitioner\u2019s trial counsel recalled that, after Doyle\u2019s testimony, the petitioner had mentioned some business records that could prove he was at work on the days after the incident. Counsel knew that the nightclub had closed and that its principals and employees had dispersed; according to counsel\u2019s best recollection, the petitioner had given him the impression that the records were not available and \u201cthat there was no realistic hope of getting anything.\u201d Had he known the records were available, he would have advised the petitioner to get them and would have asked the trial court for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Trial counsel had no recollection of the petitioner\u2019s having told him that certain individuals could rebut Doyle\u2019s testimony concerning the petitioner\u2019s whereabouts on the days following the incident. He thought that Doyle\u2019s testimony was very damaging and did not think he would have told his client that rebuttal testimony was not necessary. If the petitioner had mentioned a rebuttal witness, counsel would have had the petitioner tell the witness to come to the courthouse, and would have requested a continuance. Counsel did not remember being shown any written statement concerning the petitioner\u2019s presence at the nightclub on the days in question. He testified that, if he had seen any such document prior to the sentencing, he would have brought it to the attention of the prosecuting attorney and the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The habeas court determined that counsel\u2019s failure to request a continuance did not prejudice the petitioner and, thus, did not amount to ineffective assistance. The court again limited its ruling to the second prong of <em>Strickland, </em>holding that the petitioner was not preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>diced by counsel\u2019s failure to request a continuance to locate and investigate potential witnesses. The court found that, even if trial counsel had requested a continuance, there was \u201cno reasonable likelihood that he would have been able to locate and produce helpful witnesses on the issue of the petitioner\u2019s demeanor and presence at work in the period at issue\u201d within the limited time available.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The petitioner was required to prove that the alleged witnesses were available. <em>Ostolaza </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>26 Conn. App. 758, 765, 603 A.2d 768, cert. denied, 222 Conn. 906, 608 A.2d 692 (1992) (availability of purported witnesses must be shown). The habeas court made findings on that point that are amply supported by the evidence, namely, that the petitioner had no reasonable prospect of locating the purportedly available surrebuttal witnesses within the time period that the trial court would have allowed for a continuance. If the witnesses could not have been located within the time allowed by the trial court, a continuance would have been of no benefit and the petitioner was, therefore, not prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to request one.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the habeas court correctly concluded that counsel\u2019s failure to request a continuance to locate witnesses did not render his assistance ineffective under the <em>Strickland </em>standard, and its judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">The petitioner\u2019s final claim is that counsel was ineffective in failing to object to certain questions asked by the state when cross-examining a witness. At the habeas hearing, the petitioner offered no testimony or evidence on this issue. The petitioner\u2019s habeas counsel informed the court in closing argument, however, that he was still pressing the claim, although he offered no argument on the point. The habeas court, citing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>absence of any evidence tending to prove that counsel\u2019s performance relative to that claim fell below the level of professional competence, considered the claim to be abandoned. The habeas court, in citing its reasons for deeming the issue abandoned, implicitly determined that the petitioner had failed to carry his burden of proof. Our review of the record and transcripts show that the habeas court\u2019s determination was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-6\"> The habeas court\u2019s rejection of the claim after considering only the prejudice prong was proper: \u201c \u2018[A] court need not determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged deficiencies. . . . If it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice . . . that course should be followed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Aillon </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 362, quoting <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>supra, 446 U.S. 697. To the extent that this appeal cannot be resolved on the second prong of <em>Strickland </em>alone, the respondent respectfully requests that this court remand the case to the habeas court for further articulation of findings, as necessary, on the first prong of <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b248-7\"> The habeas court did not articulate findings bearing on the competence prong of <em>Strickland, </em>e.g., whether counsel tactically chose not to request a limiting instruction in order to downplay Doyle\u2019s testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
