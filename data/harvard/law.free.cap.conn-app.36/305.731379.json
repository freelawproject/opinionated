As to the fraudulent conveyance claim, he found that the named defendant was the equitable owner of three properties located in New Haven and North Haven. The referee ordered two of these three properties transferred to the plaintiff. The defendants argue on appeal that (1) the findings with respect to the three properties were not supported by the record, (2) the referee abused his discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees, (3) the fraudulent conveyance of the three properties was not proven by clear and convincing evidence, and (4) the referee abused his discretion in ordering two of the properties transferred to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">We affirm the judgment as to the finding that the properties had been fraudulently conveyed. We must consider, however, who is liable for the payment of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees, as well as whether the court abused its discretion with regard to the amount of the fee awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">The referee found the following facts. The plaintiff and the named defendant were married in 1969 and were separated in 1982. In 1982, after leaving the plaintiff, the named defendant moved in with the defendant Susan Cifarelli. In 1973, the named defendant had purchased a property located at 77 East Pearl Street <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>in New Haven for $8000. He testified that after he \u201cfixed . . . up\u201d the property, he \u201csold it\u201d to the defendant Leon Crockett for the mortgage balance of $4365 and cash of $6000. The referee found that 77 East Pearl Street earns rents of $1000 per month and that the \u201csale\u201d of the property for the price stated was not \u201cbelievable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In 1976, the named defendant and the defendant Pasquale Palmieri bought the second of the subject properties, located at 177-179 Ferry Street in New Haven. The purchase price was $33,000. After the named defendant \u201cremodeled\u201d it, the property returned rents of $2340 per month. In 1978, the named defendant sold his \u201chalf interest\u201d in this property to Palmieri for $7700, who in turn later transferred it to Crockett. The referee found that $7700 was a fraction of what it cost the named defendant to buy the property, and that this \u201csale\u201d also was not \u201cbelievable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The referee noted that according to the testimony at trial, Crockett had formed a corporation, the East Pearl Development Company, to own, hold title to, and administer the two properties at 77 East Pearl Street and 177-179 Ferry Street. After creation of the corporation, Crockett transferred his stock to Cifarelli. The referee therefore found that \u201cwith one stroke of the pen . . . Cifarelli, who had Crockett\u2019s power of attorney, deeded these properties to herself, with her signature, without any consideration being passed.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>The last of the subject properties, 12 Chapel Hill Road in North Haven, was purchased by Cifarelli herself. The referee found, however, that none of the moneys allegedly used to purchase the property came from Cifarelli. Rather, the referee found that the funds came from the named defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The referee farther noted that Darlene Farrell, the daughter of the named defendant, testified \u201cthat she had been told on several occasions by [the named defendant] and . . . Cifarelli that [the named defendant] owned all of the properties and that the East Pearl Development Company had been formed to make sure that the plaintiff . . . would be unable ever to get anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The referee granted the dissolution and ordered that two of the properties, 77 East Pearl Street and 177-179 Ferry Street, be conveyed or transferred to the plaintiff from the defendants, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-66a<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 46b-81.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court farther ordered the defendants Frank Farrell, Cifarelli and Palmieri,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> jointly and severally, to pay the plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fee of $30,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The defendants make several arguments regarding the facts as found by the referee. They first argue that the findings of the referee with respect to the three properties were not supported by the evidence. \u201c \u2018The factual findings of a trial court on any issue are reversible only if they are clearly erroneous. . . .This court cannot retry the facts or pass upon the credibility of the witnesses.\u2019 (Citations omitted.) <em>Holy Trinity Church of God in Christ </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>214 Conn. 216, 223, 571 A.2d 107 (1990).\u201d <em>Rosick </em>v. <em>Equipment Maintenance &amp; Service, Inc., </em>33 Conn. App. 25, 40-41, 632 A.2d 1134 (1993). \u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 41. We are unable to conclude, on the basis of the record before us, that the referee\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The defendants also argue that the trial court incorrectly found by clear and convincing evidence that the three properties had been fraudulently conveyed. \u201cA party who seeks to set aside a conveyance as fraudulent bears the burden of proving that the conveyance was made without substantial consideration and that, as a result, the transferor was unable to meet his obligations (constructive fraud) or that the conveyance was made with fraudulent intent in which the transferee participated (actual fraud).\u201d <em>Tessitore </em>v. <em>Tessitore, </em>31 Conn. App. 40, 42, 623 A.2d 496 (1993). \u201cA fraudulent conveyance must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d Id., 43. Whether a conveyance is fraudulent is purely a question of fact. <em>Tyers </em>v. <em>Coma, </em>214 Conn. 8, 11, 570 A.2d 186 (1990). For the reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>stated above, we cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s factual findings that the properties had been fraudulently conveyed were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Finally, the defendants argue that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering the East Pearl Street and Ferry Street properties transferred to the plaintiff. Specifically, the defendants claim that the court did not consider all of the statutory criteria required by General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (c)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> before ordering the properties transferred to the plaintiff. The trial court specifically noted, however, that it had \u201cproperly considered and weighed the application of all statutory relevant facts prior to deciding this case.\u201d On the basis of the record before us, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering the properties transferred to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The defendants make several arguments with respect to the award of attorney\u2019s fees. They first argue that the court abused its discretion under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62 by awarding attorney\u2019s fees against the non-spouse defendants, Cifarelli and Palmieri.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Pursuant to \u00a7 46b-62, \u201cthe court may order . . . <em>either spouse </em>or <em>either parent </em>to pay the reasonable attorney\u2019s fees of the other in accordance with their respective finan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>cial abilities and the criteria set forth in section 46b-82.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, attorney\u2019s fees in this case may be awarded only against a spouse. While not disputing this, the plaintiff presents several arguments in support of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The plaintiff first argues that since Palmieri did not appeal the judgment, it is conclusive as to him. In <em>Gino\u2019s Pizza of East Hartford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>193 Conn. 135, 141-42, 475 A.2d 305 (1984), however, the Supreme Court noted that a party who fails to appeal a judgment may nonetheless benefit from an appellate decision rendered in the context of an appeal brought by another party in the same case.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The plaintiff argues that the award of counsel fees against the other nonspouse defendant, Cifarelli, was not based on \u00a7 46b-62, but rather on \u201cthe trial court\u2019s common law powers to award attorney\u2019s fees as an element of punitive damages.\u201d In support of this argument, the plaintiff refers to her prayer for relief in the second amended complaint, which included a request for punitive damages against all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Generally, attorney\u2019s fees may not be recovered, either as costs or damages, absent contractual or statutory authorization. <em>O\u2019Leary </em>v. <em>Industrial Park Corp., </em>211 Conn. 648, 651, 560 A.2d 968 (1989); <em>Plikus </em>v. <em>Plikus, </em>26 Conn. App. 174, 179, 599 A.2d 392 (1991). Attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded, however, as a component of punitive damages. <em>O\u2019Leary </em>v. <em>Industrial Park Corp., </em>supra, 651; <em>Plikus </em>v. <em>Plikus, </em>supra, 179. \u201cTo furnish a basis for recovery of such damages, the pleadings must allege and the evidence must show wanton or wilful malicious misconduct, and the language contained in the pleadings must be sufficiently explicit to inform the court and opposing counsel that such damages are being sought.\u201d <em>Markey </em>v. <em>Santangelo, </em>195 Conn. 76, 77, 485 A.2d 1305 (1985). Punitive damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>may be awarded upon a showing of fraud. <em>O\u2019Leary </em>v. <em>Industrial Park Corp., </em>supra, 651; <em>Plikus </em>v. <em>Plikus, </em>supra, 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">In the present case, the referee did not make any findings with regard to wanton or wilful malicious misconduct. He did find, however, that the properties at issue had been fraudulently conveyed; accordingly, he found that the case was controlled by General Statutes \u00a7 52-552,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> governing fraudulent conveyances. Therefore, although there was a finding of fraud, which might justify an award of punitive damages, the fraud in this case falls within the parameters of \u00a7 52-552, which does not provide for an award of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Derderian </em>v. <em>Derderian, </em>3 Conn. App. 522, 529, 490 A.2d 1008, cert. denied, 196 Conn. 810, 811, 495 A.2d 279 (1985). We therefore vacate that portion of the judgment requiring Cifarelli and Palmieri to pay the plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The defendants next argue, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82, that the trial court failed to consider the financial ability of the named defendant to pay the fees. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The award of counsel fees was made after a full trial on the merits. The court specifically stated that the award was issued \u201cin order not to undermine the property awards to her, and also because of her physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>condition that necessitates her wearing a full body cast and being unable to work.\u201d The court further noted that the plaintiff has no significant employment skills. On the basis of the foregoing, we cannot say that the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff was an abuse of discretion. <em>Tessitore </em>v. <em>Tessitore, </em>supra, 31 Conn. App. 44; <em>Passamano </em>v. <em>Passamano, </em>28 Conn. App. 854, 860-61, 612 A.2d 141, rev\u2019d on other grounds, 228 Conn. 85, 634 A.2d 891 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The final argument on appeal is that the trial court failed to substantiate on the record the plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s fee request. No motion for articulation was filed, however, requesting that the trial court articulate on the record the basis on which it ordered the payment of counsel fees. See Practice Book \u00a7 4051. Without some evidence to the contrary, we will not presume that the trial court improperly applied the law. See <em>Passamano </em>v. <em>Passamano, </em>supra, 28 Conn. App. 861.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The judgment is reversed in part and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment as on file except as modified to eliminate the ordered payment of attorney\u2019s fees by the defendants Susan Cifarelli and Pasquale Palmieri.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-8\"> The defendants named in this action were Frank Farrell, Susan Cifarelli, the East Pearl Development Company, Leon Crockett and Pasquale Palmieri. Crockett did not appear in the action and was not present at trial. Palmieri was not present at trial and has not appealed the trial court\u2019s ruling. As used in this opinion, the word defendants refers to Frank Farrell, Cifarelli and the East Pearl Development Company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b331-7\"> With regard to 77 East Pearl Street and 177-179 Ferry Street, the referee\u2019s memorandum of decision further states:</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">\u201cFrank Farrell originally purchased the East Pearl Street and Ferry Street properties, fixed them up himself and \u2018conveyed\u2019 them to Crockett and Palmieri for minimal considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">\u201cAfter holding the properties for a short period of time Crockett and Palmieri each gave them to Cifarelli, the live in girl friend of the defendant Farrell.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">\u201cDuring these brief periods, Susan Cifarelli collected the rents.
