We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">The defendant was arrested on February 26, 1994, and charged with breach of the peace in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181. He was granted accelerated rehabilitation but, on May 6,1994, the trial court terminated it and ordered him, pursuant to \u00a7 54-56d (c), to submit to an examination to determine his competency to stand trial. The defendant has appealed from the court\u2019s ruling ordering him to submit to an examination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">Absent a final judgment, we cannot reach the merits of the appeal. General Statutes \u00a7 52-263; Practice Book \u00a7 4000; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Otis Elevator Co., </em>33 Conn. App. 99, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>102, 633 A.2d 731 (1993). An interlocutory order is a final judgment for purposes of appeal \u201c \u2018(1) where the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding, or (2) where the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ackerson </em>v. <em>Stramaglia, </em>225 Conn. 102, 104, 621 A.2d 1315 (1993), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). Because the order requiring the defendant to submit to an examination is an integral part of the criminal proceeding against the defendant, the final judgment issue in this case implicates only the second prong of the <em>Curdo </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The issue of whether the order so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them focuses on the potential harm to the appellant\u2019s rights. <em>\u201cA </em>presentence order will be deemed final for purposes of appeal only if it involves a claimed right the legal and practical value of which would be destroyed if it were not vindicated before trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Neron, </em>35 Conn. App. 236, 238, 644 A.2d 970 (1994), citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 33-34. \u201cOne must make at least a colorable claim that some recognized statutory or constitutional right is at risk.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The defendant does not assert that a particular claimed right is at risk in this proceeding, nor can we identify any such right. The purpose of the examination that the defendant opposes is to determine whether he is capable of understanding the proceedings against him and assisting in his own defense. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (a). The examination is for the defendant\u2019s own benefit and there is no claimed right in this case that would be destroyed if not vindicated before trial. In fact, if he is found incompetent to stand trial under the statute, there will be no trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>The trial court\u2019s order requiring the defendant to submit to an examination under General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (c) satisfies neither prong of the <em>Curcio </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (c) provides: \u201cIf at any time during a criminal proceeding it appears that the defendant is not competent, counsel for the defendant or for the state, or the court, on its own motion, may request an examination to determine the defendant\u2019s competency.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b160-11\"> The defendant has not attempted to appeal from the order terminating his participation in the accelerated rehabilitation program. This is proper because such an order is not an appealable final judgment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>194 Conn. 650, 659 n.8, 485 A.2d 139 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
