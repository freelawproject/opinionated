On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) failed to conduct an inquiry into alleged jury misconduct and (2) twice gave the jury a so called \u201cChip Smith\u201d charge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s claim concerning the absence of the trial judge from the bench during the voir dire was withdrawn at the time of the oral argument.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. In September, 1990, the victim met the defendant at a nightclub in Port Chester, New York. Thereafter, a relationship developed between them, and for the next three weeks the defendant and the victim saw each other almost daily. At that time, the victim and the defendant began a voluntary sexual relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In October, 1990, the defendant began looking for an apartment with a friend. In the interim, the victim allowed the defendant to move into her apartment in Greenwich, which she occupied with two roommates. By December, the defendant had stopped working and the relationship began to deteriorate. The financial strain of supporting herself and the defendant eventually became unbearable for the victim. In addition, the defendant began to show signs of jealousy and would become outraged when male friends or exboyfriends called the victim. In order to alleviate their situation, the victim encouraged the defendant to look for work and often loaned him her vehicle so that he could get to job interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">By January, 1991, the relationship between the defendant and the victim had become more strained. They fought frequently and the victim decided that she wanted the defendant to leave the apartment, but the defendant refused. On or about February 20,1991, the victim received a telephone call from the White Plains, New York, police department. She was informed that the defendant had been arrested and that her car had been used in the commission of a crime. The news of the defendant\u2019s criminal activities upset the victim sufficiently for her to tell the defendant that their relationship was at an end. The victim collected the defendant\u2019s belongings from her apartment and had them removed by a friend of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Throughout February, the defendant continued to call the victim, attempting a reconciliation. He claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>that if she would not see him at her apartment, he would follow her to work or to her parents\u2019 house. He began sleeping in the victim\u2019s basement, and the victim became frightened of the defendant\u2019s obsessive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">On three occasions in March, 1991, the defendant appeared uninvited at the victim\u2019s apartment and forced her to have sexual intercourse with him. The victim did not report'any of these instances to the police because she was afraid of the defendant and because she believed that the defendant would soon be going to jail for the incident in White Plains. She did, however, tell the police that the defendant had been physically abusive and that he had come into her apartment uninvited. On March 27,1991, she obtained a restraining order against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">On April 15,1991, the defendant entered the victim\u2019s apartment through a window while she was asleep. The victim awoke to see the defendant standing in the doorway of her bedroom. The defendant entered the room and locked the door. He then turned on the radio and turned up the volume. The victim hurried to pull on a pair of jeans that were on the floor by her bed, but the defendant restrained her from getting dressed. WTien the victim reminded the defendant that she had a restraining order against him, he laughed and said, \u201cI am going to jail anyway. ... It doesn\u2019t matter if I have a rape on my record.\u201d When she asked him if he was going to rape her, he replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The victim curled herself into a ball on the bed so that the defendant could not touch her in a sexual manner. The defendant grabbed her from behind and covered her mouth. He then pulled off her shirt and brassiere, climbed on top of her, and had sexual intercourse with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>After the defendant ejaculated, he got up from the bed while the victim lay crying. When she got up to go to the bathroom, the defendant followed her and watched her. He then walked her back into the bedroom and had sexual intercourse with her again, despite her sobbing and asking him to stop. As soon as the defendant left, the victim called the police to report that she had been sexually assaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Jury deliberations commenced on November 19,1991. On November 21, 1991, at approximately 12:10 p.m., the trial court received a note from the jury foreperson stating: \u201cCurrently we are at an impasse. We can agree on one count and are not in agreement on the other two counts. There appears to be no movement by the jurors to agree.\u201d As a result of the indication of possible jury deadlock, the trial court gave the jury a \u201cChip Smith\u201d charge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. Smith, 49 Conn. 376, 386 (1881).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">At approximately 2:20 p.m., the proceedings resumed and the jury foreperson presented the trial court with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>another note. This note read as follows: \u201cOne of the jurors has made it plain that he/she had made up her mind prior to the trial how he/she would vote based on the presence or absence of specific testimony. He/she claims to have made her stand clear to the prosecuting attorney in the voir dire. This specific testimony is not in the evidence that has been presented to us. He/she is basing his/her decision on the fact that specific testimony has not been introduced in evidence. We are at an impasse.\u201d The trial court instructed the jurors that they were not to consider anything not in evidence. The trial court stated in part: \u201cIt\u2019s not a popularity contest to be determined by which lawyer you think has done a better job. That\u2019s not what this is about. It\u2019s not about that at all. . . . It\u2019s not about what hasn\u2019t been introduced as evidence. It\u2019s only about what has been introduced as evidence. And you\u2019re not entitled to draw any inferences from the lack of any evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The trial court then repeated the Chip Smith charge and concluded, \u201cNow with that additional instruction I would ask you to retire to the deliberating room and see if you can\u2019t agree on a unanimous verdict on all three counts.\u201d Once the jury had retired, the trial court asked counsel whether there were any exceptions to its answer to the jury\u2019s questions. Counsel for the defendant took exception only to the reference of the court to the case\u2019s not being a \u201cpopularity contest\u201d between the lawyers but offered no objection to the second Chip Smith charge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>At approximately 4:38, the jury returned with a verdict, finding the defendant guilty of one count of sexual assault in the first degree and one count of burglary in the third degree. The jury returned a not guilty verdict on the second count of sexual assault in the first degree. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The defendant first asserts that the trial court improperly failed to make an inquiry into possible jury misconduct, thereby violating his constitutional right to a fair trial by an impartial jury. The defendant contends that the court should have made such an inquiry, sua sponte, upon receipt of the note concerning possible jury misconduct. Because the issue was not properly preserved at trial and does not meet the requirements for review enumerated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), we decline to review the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Generally, when evidence of possible juror misconduct is brought to the attention of the trial court, the court should determine whether the defendant has been prejudiced. <em>State </em>v. <em>Migliaro, </em>28 Conn. App. 388, 396, 611 A.2d 422 (1992). \u201c \u2018There is no magic formula that the trial court must follow in conducting this inquiry. Rather, it must use whatever inquisitorial tools are necessary and appropriate to determine whether there was a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d of prejudice.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>701 F.2d 867, 871 (11th Cir. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Counsel for the defendant did not, however, request any inquiry of the jury. Upon receipt of the note that a juror considered basing her decision on the absence of specific testimony, the trial court repeated its instruction that the jury consider only that evidence that had been properly admitted at trial. After dismissing the jury for further deliberations, the trial court gave counsel an opportunity to object to its response to the note. Counsel for the defendant objected only to a comment by the trial court that the trial was not a \u201cpopularity contest\u201d between the lawyers and that the jury\u2019s decision should not turn on which lawyer the jury thought did a better job. Counsel did not request that the jury be polled or that the court make further inquiry into what the juror was considering.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The defendant posits, however, that an inquiry into the possible misconduct should have been undertaken by the trial court sua sponte, thus relieving him of his burden to request such action. In support of this contention, the defendant relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Migliaro, </em>supra, 28 Conn. App. 388, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>25 Conn. App. 433, 596 A.2d 443 (1991), aff\u2019d, 222 Conn. 718, 609 A.2d 1003 (1992). Although both cases sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>port the proposition that an inquiry should be made to determine whether the defendant was prejudiced, in neither case did the court act in the absence of a request by counsel. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Migliaro, </em>supra, 392, counsel for the defendant specifically stated his concern about the possibility that a juror had been exposed to extrinsic evidence and asked the court the proper way to handle the situation. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 438, counsel for the defendant and the state both objected to the trial court\u2019s refusal to address the jury\u2019s concern that one of its members had been exposed to extrinsic evidence. Neither case mandates any action by the trial court to investigate misconduct absent a request by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Here, the defendant neither requested an inquiry to clarify the reason behind the note from the jury, nor objected to the trial court\u2019s failure to make such an inquiry sua sponte. The defendant\u2019s objection was limited to the trial court\u2019s comments regarding the trial\u2019s not being a popularity contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 4185 provides in part: \u201cThe court on appeal shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial . . . .\u2019\u2019To preserve this claim for appellate review, the defendant should have either requested that the trial court conduct an inquiry to determine the juror\u2019s conduct or taken an exception to the trial court\u2019s decision not to act sua sponte. The defendant failed to do either.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">The defendant asserts that even if his claim was not properly preserved at trial, it is entitled to review under the standards enunciated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 233. \u201cUnder <em>Golding, </em>a defendant can prevail on an unpreserved claim of constitutional error \u2018only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>(2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>34 Conn. App. 261, 264, 641 A.2d 406, cert. denied, 230 Conn. 903, 644 A.2d 916 (1994), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u201cThe first two conditions [of Golding] are determinations of whether a defendant\u2019s claim will be reviewed, and the third condition involves a review of the claim itself.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 264. This court \u201cremain[s] free to dispose of the claim by focusing on whichever condition is most relevant in the particular circumstances.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pinnock, </em>220 Conn. 756, 778, 601 A.2d 521 (1992). Here, by not providing us with an adequate record to review his claim, the defendant has failed to satisfy the first condition enunciated in <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The note from the jury was ambiguous in that it did not describe the conduct at issue. The defendant assumes that the juror was considering extrinsic evidence, while the note also permits an inference that the juror was considering the effect of the absence of particular evidence. Without such essential information, it is impossible for us to determine whether the actions of the trial court were sufficient under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\u201cOur Supreme Court has stated in <em>Golding </em>that, \u2018[t]he defendant bears the responsibility for providing a record that is adequate for review of his claim of constitutional error. If the facts revealed by the record are insufficient, unclear or ambiguous as to whether a constitutional violation has occurred, we will not attempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>to reconstruct the record, or to make factual determinations, in order to decide the defendant\u2019s claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Strikcani, </em>34 Conn. App. 691, 693, 642 A.2d 1228 (1994). We, therefore, will not afford review of this unpreserved claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\u25a0The defendant next asserts that the trial court improperly repeated the Chip Smith charge to the jury. The defendant failed to preserve this claim properly at trial and we conclude that it is not entitled to review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">As stated in part I, the transcript shows that the defendant objected only to the trial court\u2019s reference to the proceedings not being a popularity contest. The defendant did not object to the substance of the second Chip Smith charge, nor did he claim that repetition of the charge was coercive to dissenting jurors. The defendant did not, therefore, properly preserve this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">The defendant claims, however, that he is entitled to review under <em>Golding. </em>In support of his claim of entitlement to a <em>Golding </em>review, the defendant posits that the repetition of the Chip Smith charge deprived him of his constitutional right to a jury that has not been coerced into determining his guilt or innocence. His claim is, in essence, that the second charge, combined with the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jurors to \u201cretire to the deliberating room and see if you can\u2019t agree on a unanimous verdict,\u201d coerced them into returning a verdict that the defendant considers to be a compromise.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">Despite the constitutional labels attached to this claim by the defendant, we conclude that the defendant has failed to meet the second prong of <em>Golding. </em>\u201cPatently nonconstitutional claims that are unpreserved at trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>do not warrant special consideration simply because they bear a constitutional label.\u201d Id., 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">This court and our Supreme Court have consistently upheld various forms of the Chip Smith charge designed to overcome possible jury deadlock. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pinnock, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 795, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>200 Conn. 268, 281-84, 511 A.2d 321 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>193 Conn. 70, 91-92, 475 A.2d 1087 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>188 Conn. 626, 641-42, 453 A.2d 418 (1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 928, 103 S. Ct. 2088, 77 L. Ed. 2d 299 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stankowski, </em>184 Conn. 121, 145-47, 439 A.2d 918, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1052, 102 S. Ct. 596, 70 L. Ed. 2d 588 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>173 Conn. 541, 378 A.2d 517 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ralls, </em>167 Conn. 408, 425, 356 A.2d 147 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Schleifer, </em>102 Conn. 708, 725, 130 A. 184 (1925). Such a charge does not coerce a jury, but rather reminds jurors of their duties in the deliberative process. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ralls, </em>supra, 424. The Chip Smith charge is a balanced statement that \u201cmakes clear the necessity, on the one hand, of unanimity among the jurors in any verdict, and on the other hand the duty of careful consideration by each juror of the views and opinions of each of his fellow jurors . . . .\u201d Id., 424-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The charge given here closely resembles the Chip Smith charge developed in <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 49 Conn. 386. It in no way coerces dissenting jurors into subverting their opinions to those of the majority, but urges each juror to consider the questions before the jury with \u201cdue regard and deference to the opinions of each other\u201d in an effort to arrive at a unanimous verdict. Although the charge does call on dissenting jurors to reevaluate their conclusions, such a charge is not coercive when considered in its totality.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">In addition, despite the defendant\u2019s claims, repetition of an otherwise appropriate charge does not ere-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>ate an atmosphere of coercion that may threaten a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Pinnock, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 796 (upholding actions of trial court that read Chip Smith charge to jury twice in immediate succession); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ralls, </em>supra, 167 Conn. 423-25 (repetition of Chip Smith charge viewed by Supreme Court as corrective of other remarks allegedly coercing jury to agree on verdict).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\u201cJust as every claim of evidentiary error by the trial court is not truly constitutional in nature; see, e.g., <em>[State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 241]; every claim of instructional error is not truly constitutional in nature. We have recognized, for example, that claimed instructional errors regarding the elements of an offense; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>223 Conn. 535, 543, 613 A.2d 770 (1992); and claimed instructional errors regarding the burden of proof or the presumption of innocence; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>225 Conn. 270, 289, 623 A.2d 42 (1993); are constitutional in nature, so as to satisfy the second <em>Golding </em>requirement.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>227 Conn. 32, 64-65, 630 A.2d 990 (1993). On the other hand, claimed instructional errors regarding general principles of credibility of witnesses have been held to be nonconstitutional in nature; <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatum, </em>219 Conn. 721, 738, 595 A.2d 322 (1991); as have claimed instructional errors regarding the jury\u2019s duty objectively to consider the evidence before them. <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>supra, 64-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The Chip Smith charge from <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 49 Conn. 386, resembles those instructions held to be nonconstitutional in nature in <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatum, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 738, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 64-65. The Chip Smith charge does not concern the elements of a crime, but deals only with the role of the jurors and their duties during the deliberative process. We, therefore, conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>not of constitutional magnitude and does not allege the violation of a fundamental right. <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person (1) compels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such other person ... or by the threat of use of force against such other person . . . which reasonably causes such person to fear physical injury to such person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b202-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-103 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of burglary in the third degree when he enters or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b202-10\"> The \u201cChip Smith\u201d charge was developed in the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>49 Conn. 376, 386 (1881), to instruct the jury as to its duties in the event of deadlock. The jurors are charged, inter alia, to \u201cpay proper respect to each other\u2019s opinions, and listen with candor to each other\u2019s arguments\u201d in order to arrive at an unanimous verdict.
