We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On the evening of September 23, 1989, Tony O\u2019Neal died of multiple gunshot wounds after he was shot near the intersection of Howard Avenue and Putnam Street in New Haven. Earlier that day, there had been an argument concerning drug sales on that street. The dispute involved Gerald Robinson and David Robinson, on one side, and Tony O\u2019Neal and Keith Batchelor, on the other. The Robinsons were complaining about O\u2019Neal and Batchelor\u2019s selling \u201cbeat\u201d or \u201cdummy\u201d bags, that is, bags that contained flour or sugar rather than cocaine, which the Robinsons claimed affected their business. On the night of the murder, several young men, including the Robinsons, their friend Lonnie Jackson, Christopher Shaw, O\u2019Neal and the defendant arrived at the same location. Almost immediately, Jackson and O\u2019Neal began to argue. The defendant approached the two, \u201cnudged\u201d Jackson aside and, with a pistol that he had obtained from Gerald Robinson, fired several bullets into O\u2019Neal. O\u2019Neal died as a result of his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The following additional facts are necessary for the resolution of this appeal. The day after the shooting, when Gerald Robinson was questioned at his home by the New Haven police, he said he knew nothing about the murder. Three days later, the police brought him to the police station and informed him that a witness had told them that she had seen him with a handgun near the scene of the crime. He then changed his story and told police that the defendant was the one who shot O\u2019Neal.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Gerald Robinson\u2019s statements caused police officers to go to the home of the defendant. Initially, the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>ant told them that he had been home at the time of the shooting. Three days later, the police brought the defendant to the police station. There, the defendant identified Shaw as the person who had shot O\u2019Neal. Shaw initially denied having been at the scene of the crime and said that the defendant was not present either. As they had done previously with Gerald Robinson and the defendant, the police took Shaw to the police station to confirm his statement. At the station, the police informed Shaw that he was a prime suspect in the murder of O\u2019Neal. Upon hearing this, Shaw admitted that he had been at the scene of the crime and said that he had seen a \u201cbrown skinned guy\u201d wearing a college \u201cStarter\u201d jacket shoot O\u2019Neal.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">After their initial investigation, the police had three different versions of the shooting. Gerald Robinson had implicated the defendant. The defendant had implicated Shaw. Shaw said that a \u201cbrown skinned guy\u201d had shot O\u2019Neal. The police arrested Shaw for the murder. Immediately after his arrest, Shaw related a new version of the incident. He said that, not only was the defendant present at the scene of the crime, but that the defendant had fired the gun. Thereafter, the police arrested the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">At trial, Gerald Robinson, Shaw, and the defendant provided their versions of what had happened on the night O\u2019Neal was murdered. In their testimony, Robinson and Shaw implicated the defendant. In response, the defendant insisted that Shaw had shot O\u2019Neal. On September 30,1992, the jury found the defendant guilty of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">The defendant claims, and the state agrees, that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the use of prior inconsistent statements. The jury should have been charged that the prior inconsistent statements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>the witnesses should have been considered for their truth and not merely for impeachment purposes. <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 756-57, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">At trial, the defendant requested the following instruction: \u201cThe earlier contradictory statements are admissible only to impeach the credibility of the witness and not to establish the truth of these statements.\u201d In response to that request, the court gave a limiting instruction that \u201c[tjhose prior inconsistent statements are not admitted to prove the facts contained in those prior inconsistent statements but merely to show evidence of conduct inconsistent with the testimony here on the stand in front of you. It goes to the credibility of the witness.\u201d A reasonable interpretation of the defendant\u2019s request to charge and the court\u2019s instruction indicates that the court granted the defendant the limiting instruction that he requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">We first note that the defendant has not properly preserved this claim for appellate review pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 852,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and seeks review of an instruction that he requested and now claims was improper. Ordinarily, action induced by an appellant cannot be ground for error. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>227 Conn. 32, 630 A.2d 990 (1993), where one of the defendants requested and was granted an erroneous <em>pre-Whelan </em>charge, the court determined that no review was warranted because he induced the error. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Scognamiglio, </em>202 Conn. 18, 25, 519 A.2d 607 (1987), the court said, \u201cIt seems a bit disingenuous for the defendant to claim the trial court committed error by instructing the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>on [prior inconsistent statements] when he requested an instruction on that very issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Although it is the general rule that a party cannot be heard to complain about such an instruction when he has requested it; <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 32; <em>State </em>v. <em>Shipman, </em>195 Conn. 160, 165, 486 A.2d 1130 (1985); unpreserved claims of constitutional magnitude, even when induced by the appellant, may be reviewed pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>198 Conn. 77, 81 n.2, 502 A.2d 388 (1985). \u201c[A] defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 239-40; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 61. The defendant claims review under those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 77, which our Supreme Court relied on in <em>Walton, </em>the defendant conceded in his brief that he requested most of the challenged instruction, and the court held that the defendant\u2019s claim was not reviewable as an \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 165 Conn. 70. Applying the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Hinckley </em>to the present case, we conclude that the defendant has failed to satisfy the second condition of <em>Evans-Golding </em>that the claim is an \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d of constitutional magnitude. Our Supreme Court has held that an incorrect <em>Whelan </em>instruction is \u201can evidentiary error that did not involve the violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatum, </em>219 Conn. 721, 738, 595 A.2d 322 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wooten, </em>227 Conn. 677, 701, 631 A.2d 271 (1993). The defendant, therefore, is not entitled to extraordinary review under <em>Evans-Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The defendant claims, in the alternative, that his claim is reviewable under the plain error doctrine. \u201c[I]t is . . . well established that plain error review is reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of the public confidence in the judicial proceedings. ...\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>34 Conn. App. 599, 608, 642 A.2d 738, cert. granted, 231 Conn. 917, 648 A.2d 145 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>223 Conn. 535, 551, 613 A.2d 770 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>207 Conn. 276, 288-89, 542 A.2d 299 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 87-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">In <em>Walton, </em>our Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether an erroneous <em>preWhelan </em>charge rises to the level of plain error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 67-68. In <em>Walton, </em>the Supreme Court held that an erroneous <em>^veWhelan </em>charge \u201cdoes not rise to the level of \u2018plain error,\u2019 as that term of art is generally understood . . . .\u201d Id. The defendant\u2019s claim that the instruction constitutes plain error must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on \u201creasonable doubt\u201d in violation of the due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s definition of reasonable doubt. The trial court defined reasonable doubt as \u201ca doubt for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>a reasonable man or woman can give a valid reason.\u201d We find that definition to.be proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\u201cThe challenged instructions are similar or identical to jury instructions that have previously been approved by our Supreme Court. <em>State </em>v. <em>DePastino, </em>228 Conn. 552, 572, 638 A.2d 578 (1994) (\u2018a doubt for which a valid reason can be assigned\u2019); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gomez, </em>225 Conn. 347, 353, 622 A.2d 1014 (1993) (\u2018a doubt for which a reasonable man or woman can give a valid reason\u2019); <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>225 Conn. 270, 290, 623 A.2d 42 (1993) (\u2018a doubt for which a valid reason can be assigned\u2019); <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>181 Conn. 151, 171, 434 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 499 U.S. 1064, 101 S. Ct. 789, 66 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1980) (\u2018one for which you can, in your own mind, conscientiously give a reason\u2019); <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>29 Conn. App. 584, 590, 617 A.2d 174 (1992) (\u2018a doubt for which a valid reason may be assigned\u2019), appeal dismissed, 228 Conn. 59, 634 A.2d 293 (1993) (certification improvidently granted).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Goodman, </em>35 Conn. App. 438, 441-42, 646 A.2d 879 (1994). The defendant\u2019s claim, therefore, has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The defendant\u2019s final assertion is that the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct during the state\u2019s rebuttal argument violated his federal and state constitutional rights to a fair trial and an impartial jury. The defendant\u2019s claim of misconduct related to the state\u2019s remarks during closing argument urging the jury to care, not only for the victim, but \u201cfor all the other people who live near that intersection\u201d as well as other \u201cpotential victims\u201d who were \u201cendangered\u201d by stray bullets.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">We note, again, that the defendant did not properly preserve this claim for appellate review. Our Supreme Court has held that the failure of counsel for the defendant to take exception to the remarks of the state\u2019s attorney, either at the time they were made or at the close <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s argument, was a waiver of the right of the accused to press this as error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lubesky, </em>195 Conn. 475, 484, 488 A.2d 1239 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Conceding his failure to preserve this claim, the defendant, relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 529 A.2d 653 (1987), seeks review of the claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 165 Conn. 61, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 233. The defendant asserts, alternatively, that the claim is reviewable as plain error under Practice Book \u00a7 4185, which provides that the \u201ccourt may in the interest of justice notice plain error not brought to the attention of the trial court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">We will examine the defendant\u2019s claim to determine whether the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and whether it deprived the defendant of a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Torrence, </em>196 Conn. 430, 435, 493 A.2d 865 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Our Supreme Court has held that although \u201cprosecutorial misconduct of constitutional proportions may arise during the course of closing argument, thereby implicating the fundamental fairness of the trial itself; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>[supra, 204 Conn. 539]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>196 Conn. 32, 33-34, 490 A.2d 515 (1985) . . . <em>Evans </em>review of such a claim is unavailable where the claimed misconduct was not blatantly egregious and merely consisted of isolated and brief episodes that did not reveal a pattern of conduct repeated throughout the trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>214 Conn. 378, 393, 572 A.2d 944 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Our review of the record discloses that the remarks now challenged represented isolated instances of alleged misconduct, unrepresentative of a pattern of conduct repeated throughout the trial. Because the defendant\u2019s claim of alleged misconduct challenges two isolated comments made during closing argument, he cannot establish the clear existence of a violation of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>constitutional rights or his right to a fair trial. Because the unpreserved claim of prosecutorial misconduct was not either blatantly egregious or part of a pattern of misconduct repeated throughout the trial; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Whitfield, </em>21 Conn. App. 622, 628-29, 575 A.2d 1046, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 808, 580 A.2d 66 (1990); we decline to review this claim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>218 Conn. 486, 508, 590 A.2d 901 (1991); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Concerning the defendant\u2019s claim of plain error, \u201c[i]t is . . . well established that plain error review is reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity <em>of </em>and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. ...\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 608. \u201c[W]e do not find, as is necessary to merit plain error review, that those limited instances of improper conduct so pervaded the defendant\u2019s trial as to have impaired the effectiveness or integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tweedy, </em>219 Conn. 489, 509, 594 A.2d 906 (1991). Consequently, the defendant cannot succeed on this claim of impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-13\"> This appeal was taken originally to the Supreme Court.
