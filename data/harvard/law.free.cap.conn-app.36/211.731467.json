On April 13,1990, the plaintiff allegedly suffered injuries as a result of a fall due to a hole in the sidewalk on a bridge in downtown Torrington. On May 7, 1990, she provided notice of this incident to the defendant as required by General Statutes \u00a7 13a-144. In her letter of notice, the plaintiff stated that she had fallen because of a hole in the \u201csidewalk on Route 202, on April 13, 1990, at approximately 11:30 a.m. in the Town of Torrington at the bridge known as \u2018the Center Bridge\u2019 while walking north on the eastern side of said bridge, in the area adjacent to the Downtown Torrington Shopping Center.\u201d Attached to the notice, and made part thereof, was a copy of a police report relating to the incident. The police report included a statement by the plaintiff which indicated that she \u201cleft Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and started to walk north on the Center Bridge when [she] tripped on a hole in the sidewalk located on the bridge.\u201d The notice also reported that both the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>tiff\u2019s attorney and the Torrington police had taken photographs of the accident scene and that these photographs would be available to the defendant upon request.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The plaintiff subsequently brought a civil action against the defendant in connection with this incident. The defendant moved to dismiss the suit on the ground that the notice was defective and the trial court granted the motion. In granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the court found that the description provided by the notice letter of May 7,1990, patently failed to provide the general description of the injury, its cause, and the place and time as required by \u00a7 13a-144. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The plaintiff urges this court to reverse the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint. She correctly notes that the sufficiency of notice \u201cis to be tested with reference to the purpose for which it is required\u201d; <em>Morico </em>v. Cox, 134 Conn. 218, 223, 56 A.2d 522 (1947); and argues that the notice given in this case satisfies the purpose of providing \u201csuch warning as would prompt [the defendant] to make such inquiries as he might deem necessary or prudent for the preservation of his interests, and such information as would furnish him a reasonable guide in the conduct of such inquiries, and in obtaining such information as he might deem helpful for his protection.\u201d <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>25 Conn. Sup. 356, 358-59, 204 A.2d 412 (1964), quoting <em>Cassidy </em>v. <em>South-bury, </em>86 Conn. 45, 49, 84 A. 291 (1912); see also <em>Warkentin </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>223 Conn. 14, 20, 610 A.2d 1287 (1992); <em>Morico </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>supra, 223. We agree with the plaintiff\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">In <em>Lussier </em>v. <em>Dept. of Transportation, </em>228 Conn. 343, 636 A.2d 808 (1994), our Supreme Court reiterated the legal standard against which notice of a claim pursuant to \u00a7 13a-144 is to be measured. \u201cThe notice need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>be expressed with the fullness and exactness of a pleading. . . . [T]he notice must provide sufficient information as to the injury and the cause thereof and the time and place of its occurrence to permit the commissioner to gather information about the case intelligently.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 356-57. \u201c[Reasonable definiteness is all that can be expected or should be required.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 356. \u201cThe plaintiff is not required to be a cartographer in order to be able to describe adequately to the commissioner the location of the defect.\u201d Id., 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">As long as notice provides \u201creasonable definiteness,\u201d it is not patently insufficient and the adequacy of the notice becomes an issue for the jury. Id., 354. In this case, the notice provided by the plaintiff both informed the defendant of the plaintiff\u2019s intent to file a claim and furnished the defendant with a guide as to how to conduct further inquiries to protect its interests. Accordingly, the complaint should not have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Urging us to sustain the dismissal of the complaint, the defendant first notes that \u00a7 13a-144 \u201ccreated a cause of action \u2018wholly unauthorized by the common law.\u2019 . . . Thus, the statutorily required notice is a \u2018condition precedent to the cause of action.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Warkentin </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 17-18. The defendant further notes that, as a statute in derogation of sovereign immunity, \u00a7 13a-144 should be strictly construed. <em>White </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>213 Conn. 307, 312, 567 A.2d 1195 (1990). The defendant argues that Connecticut courts have strictly construed the notice requirement of \u00a7 13a-144, and cites <em>Schaap </em>v. <em>Meriden, </em>139 Conn. 254, 93 A.2d 152 (1952), <em>Ozmun </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>18 Conn. App. 677, 559 A.2d 1143 (1989), and <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Meriden, </em>41 Conn. Sup. 425, 580 A.2d 549 (1990). Our review of these cases finds them inapposite to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>In <em>Schaap </em>v. <em>Meriden, </em>supra, 139 Conn. 254, our Supreme Court found that the notice was defective because it specified only that the injury took place near the edge of a manhole cover, without identifying a particular manhole. In <em>Ozmun </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 18 Conn. App. 677, this court held that the notice was defective because the detailed description in the notice was incorrect, stating south instead of north. Thus, while the notice was specific, it directed the commissioner to an erroneous location. In <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Meriden, </em>supra, 41 Conn. Sup. 425, the Superior Court found that the descriptions of the cause and place of the injury were vague in that the notice provided merely that the injury occurred due to a \u201cdefective and improper condition of the sidewalk . . . \u2018adjacent to the front of the premises known as 243 West Main Street, Meriden, Connecticut.\u2019 \u201d Id., 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">It is quite clear why the notices in <em>Schaap, Ozmun, </em>and <em>Collins </em>were defective. Lack of specificity, misdirection, and vagueness as to the location and cause of the injury undermine the purpose of the statute. In each case, insufficient notice denied the defendant the opportunity to gather information to protect itself in the event of a lawsuit. In the present case, there are no such defects; the notice sent by the plaintiff provided sufficient information about the alleged injury, its cause, and the time and place where it occurred to allow the defendant to gather information about the case and thereby to protect its interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 13a-144 provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person injured in person or property through the neglect or default of the state or any of its employees by means of any defective highway, bridge or sidewalk which it is the duty of the commissioner of transportation to keep in repair . . . may bring a civil action to recover damages sustained thereby against the commissioner in the superior court. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b236-7\"> At oral argument, the plaintiff withdrew all other claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b236-8\"> The notice provision of General Statutes \u00a7 13a-144 provides: \u201cNo such action shall be brought except within two years from the date of such injury, nor unless notice of such injury and a general description of the same and of the cause thereof and of the time and place of its occurrence has been given in writing within ninety days thereafter to the commissioner. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
