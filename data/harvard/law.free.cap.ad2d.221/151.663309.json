The allegedly \"defective condition\u201d, a dog tied to a barrier while its owner was allegedly patronizing defendant restaurant\u2019s establishment, was on a section of the sidewalk on which plaintiff was walking that was outside of the area on which the restaurant was situated <em>(compare, Curtis v City of New York, </em>179 AD2d 432, <em>lv denied </em>80 NY2d 753). There is no claim that \"the de facto boundaries of defendants\u2019 sidewalk cafe extended beyond the guardrail\u201d <em>(MacLeod v Pete's Tavern </em>218 AD2d 551, 552). Moreover, the doctrine normally is applied in situations where injury is caused by an allegedly defective condition <em>in the sidewalk itself (Karr v City of New York, </em>161 AD2d 449 [metal plate in sidewalk]; <em>Schechtman v Lappin, </em>161 AD2d 118 [oil filler cap in sidewalk and abutting hole in concrete]; <em>Giaccotto v New York City Tr. Auth., </em>150 Misc 2d 164, <em>revd on other grounds </em>184 AD2d 355 [unsecured grating in sidewalk]; <em>see also, Gage v City of New York, </em>203 AD2d 118 [terrazzo tile installed on sidewalk]), whereas here, plaintiff allegedly tripped over the dog. Plaintiff offers no authority for her contention that the special use doctrine applies where a patron\u2019s animal obstructs a pedestrian\u2019s path on a section of the public sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>We have considered defendants\u2019 remaining contentions and find them to be without merit.
