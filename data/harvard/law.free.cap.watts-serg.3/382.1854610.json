The referees had no authority to report prior to April term 1839.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-11\">2. The referee's committed a -plain mistake in matter of law, in deciding that because the plaintiff was an infant, he could maintain no action upon such a contract, as that set out in the declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-12\">3. The referees committed a plain mistake in matter of law, and founded their report upon that mistake, in determining that the contract upon which suit was brought, which is correctly set out in the declaration, is a trading contract, and as such is void, both as respects the infant and defendant, and cannot be enforced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-13\">4. The referees erred, and founded their report upon the error, in determining that although the plaintiff had performed his part of the contract, yet the defendants were not responsible for the performance of their part of the same. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-14\">The court overruled the exceptions, and entered a judgment on the award for the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b383-15\"><em>Strong, </em>for plaintiff in errors</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afv1\">insisted only upon the point that the court erred in referring the award back to the same referees, and cited 4 <em>Binn. </em>485; 7 <em>Moore </em>147; 3 <em>Brod. Sy Bing. </em>304; 1 <em>Binn. </em>43; <em>Act of 16th June </em>1836.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b383-16\">\n<em>Bannon, contra,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALE\">argued that the court would presume the consent of the parties to refer the case back to the same referees. 7 <em>Watts </em>357; 3 <em>Penn. Rep. </em>99. But the subsequent appearance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>cured the error if there was one. 13 <em>Serg. \u00a3f Rawle </em>45; 2 <em>Serg. </em>&lt;$\u2022 <em>Rawle </em>459; 4 <em>Yeates </em>336; 3 <em>Serg. </em>dp <em>Rawle </em>133.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b384-6\">Per Ctjriam.</author>\n<p id=\"AB-k\">The court unquestionably transcended its power in referring the matter back; for the provision of the statute which authorizes such a reference in certain cases, has regard to reports under the Act of 1836, and not to a report, such as this expressly was, under the Act of 1705. But though the error would otherwise have been fatal, it was helped by the plaintiff\u2019s appearance and litigation of the merits a second time before the arbitrators. Having done that, he can no more allege the want of a submission than a defendant who had voluntarily appeared to an action, could allege the want of an original writ; he could not take his chance before the arbitrators, and afterwards dispute their jurisdiction. The maxim that a subsequent confirmation is equivalent to a precedent authority, is applicable to every such case. The plaintiff, therefore, is too late with his exception here.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
