June 27th, 1840. It appearing to the court that after the verdict, and before the 1st day of October 1839, the defendants had in good faith made an effort to comply with the verdict, and had, with the knowledge- of the plaintiff, actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>done what they in good faith believed to be a substantial compliance therewith; and that the defendants have since the said 1st day of October 1839, and before the plaintiff moved the court for judgment on the verdict, fully complied with the said verdict, it is considered and adjudged, that the rule for judgment for $7000 be discharged; and that judgment be entered on the verdict for the 1 plaintiff, for the sum of $300, with interest from the 8th of May 1839.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A35\">Annexed to the record brought up, were the affidavit on which the rule to show cause why the execution should not be set aside, was granted, and several depositions read in the court below on the hearing of the rule to show cause.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-7\">The case was argued by</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-8\"><em>E. Ingersoll </em>and C. <em>Ingersoll, </em>for the plaintiff in error; and</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-9\"><em>Williams </em>and <em>Miles, contra.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b92-10\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b92-11\">Sergeant, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aim\">A verdict in the alternative would be erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqm\">But there are many instances, under our practice, in which a cautionary verdict is allowed; as when the verdict is rendered for the plaintiff in ejectment, or for a penal sum in actions for damages, to be enforced, unless the defendant pay a sum of money or does certain things specified. Here the verdict was within the latter description, for $7000, to be released, except $300 thereof on the defendants making their railroad in the middle of the street, at a specified depth, and taking up the existing railroad. The verdict, therefore, seems unobjectionable in form. But who is to judge whether the defendants have complied with the terms imposed by the verdict, and to mould the judgment accordingly? The court only can do this, in the exercise of a power over the process on summary application or motion, in which they are, for the most part, obliged to decide on affidavits and depositions whether the terms have been fulfilled or not: and these constitute no part of the record on which a writ of error lies to this court, nor do the reasons given by the court below. As this court, then, cannot look into the depositions taken, or the reasons of the court in order to ascertain whether the court below did right or not in rendering judgment, it is impossible for us to settle that dispute: and like the granting of a new trial, it is a matter which must rest in the sound discretion of the court below. The form of the judgment may be wrong, in rendering it for $300, instead of entering it for $7000, with a release of all but $300; but, substantially, the effect is the same. We are of opinion that the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
