That if the jury believe that at the time of the sheriff\u2019s sale there was a portion of the debt secured by the Zaccheus Collins\u2019s mortgage not embraced in the covenant from Bredin to Agnew, that the plaintiff cannot recover in this suit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-11\">Parsons, President, charged the jury that the measure of damages claimed by the plaintiff was the true one; and answered both the defendant\u2019s points in the negative.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b301-12\"><em>Gallaher </em>and <em>Biddle, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkvX\">argued that the separate covenants executed by the parties formed but one transaction ; one was the consideration of the other: they were therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>mutual and dependent covenants, and the failure of the plaintiff to show performance of his own was a bar to his recovery against the defendant. <em>Platt on Covts. </em>70, 81; 1 <em>Salk. </em>113, 171; <em>Doug. </em>688; 1 <em>Saund. </em>319, <em>note.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b302-6\"><em>Graham </em>and <em>Watts, contra,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIM\">contended that the covenants were independent, and that the parties so intended them; that the right of action to either depended upon the fact, whether either had sustained damage by the failure of the other to perform. That the plaintiff was damnified by having to pay more for the property by reason of the sheriff\u2019s sale, was not doubted, and therefore he was entitled to recover the difference. If the plaintiff failed, to a small amount, to pay according to his covenant, it would have given a right of action to the defendant\u2019s intestate, only in the event of his having been damnified by it; and it would only be a defence in the same event and to the amount of the damnification; but would not go to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s action. <em>Platt on Covts. </em>90; 2 <em>W.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aoj\">\u2014 Whether covenants are dependent, concurrent, or mutual, depends on the intention of the parties, ascertained by the application of rules of interpretation to the context, from which alone it is to be extracted. Where money is to fall due subsequently to a day appointed for the act, which is the consideration of the contract, performance of the consideration is a condition precedent to a demand of the money, and the covenants are dependent. Where they go to the entire consideration on either side\u2014as where a vendor covenants to convey, the vendee paying the purchase money\u2014they are concurrent. But the case presented by the record is neither of these. It contains no stipulation, express or implied, for priority or concurrence of performance. The parties purchased an estate, burthened with liens to the extent of the purchase money, and reciprocally covenanted that each should pay his share of it, in ease of particular parts of the common burthen; and each relied on the engagement of the other. There was no stipulation that they should go hand in hand; but each had two years to do his part, moving at any pace he should think fit. Were not their covenants, then, mutual in their very nature ? No advantage was to be gained by standing upon the order of their performance. As each payment, by whichsoever made, conduced as much to the benefit of the one party as the other, it was equally the interest of both to proceed as fast as possible; for while a single encumbrance was outstanding, the danger which there was of disturbance from it was mutual. On the contrary, if each had waited for the other to begin, the liens must, in any event, have been pressed to a sale. As it would have been subversive of the object, then, to insist on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>the performance of mutual conditions, it is not to be presumed that the parties meant to create them. Besides, though writings <em>in pari materia </em>are parts of an entire contract, it is of weight, in relation to the question of intention, that each took the covenant of the other on a separate paper as an isolated security. It is plain that the covenants were intended to be mutual and independent; and it is unimportant, that when the property was eventually sold by the sheriff, the plaintiff himself had not done all he was bound to do to preserve it.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The measure of the damages to which he is entitled, is not what he paid for Bredin\u2019s part, but what he paid without an equivalent. <em>Prima facie, </em>that would be the difference between what he was compelled to pay for Bredin\u2019s part, and the price he had given for his own; because the presumption is, that what he got by the sheriff\u2019s sale, was worth the price which had been affixed to it at the preceding purchase. If the presumption were unfounded, the fact might be shown by evidence, and then the proper amount of the damages would depend, as it must to some extent in any view, on the circumstances of the case. The measure proposed by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and adopted by the Judge, was the difference between what he was ultimately compelled to pay for the whole property, and what he and his co-vendee had agreed to give for it. But that contains the principle I have indicated; and the calculation based on it, is only another means to obtain the same result. On both points, therefore, the direction was a proper one.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
