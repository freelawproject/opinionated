The $200 were paid according to the contract, and this suit was brought to November term 1840, to recover the balance of the purchase money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-6\">The intestate, in his lifetime, executed a conveyance to George Hoober of the land clear of encumbrances, but it was not delivered. After his death, and before suit brought, the present plaintiff tendered this deed to the defendant; and the question arose, whether this was such a tender of title as would enable the plaintiff to recover the purchase money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-7\">Woodburn, President, instructed the jury that the delivery of the deed in the life of the intestate was as essential to its validity as the tender of it before suit brought was essential to the plaintiff\u2019s right of action. That the administrator could have no power to deliver a deed unless it were given him by the Orphans\u2019 Court; and directed a verdict for defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b254-8\"><em>Wallace, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWs\">cited 5 <em>Watts </em>514; 1 <em>Serg. fy Rawle </em>72; 1 <em>Cox </em>66; 2 <em>Thos.

It will not be said the purchaser was bound to pay for the land before he had a title for it; and how was he to get it ? Not by tendering the deed prepared by the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, which, for want of delivery, passed nothing in his lifetime, and which his personal representative had no power to complete after his death. The plaintiff had it in his power to make a title by proving the contract according to the provisions of the Act of Assembly; and this he was bound to do before he demanded the purchase money.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
