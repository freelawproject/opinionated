Purpart No. 2, containing 74 acres 10 perches, was taken at the appraisement by Samuel Lutes and Barbara his wife, one of the daughters of John Kitch; and purpart No. 1, by others of the children. Samuel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Lutes entered into recognizance the 15th May 1817, to secure the respective shares, of the children out of the part so taken by him and his wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-6\">There was due to the widow \u2014 the above defendant \u2014 as her proportion out of purpart No. 2, so taken, the interest of $1554.96, t\u00f3 be paid her annually during her life, from the 15th of November 1817. Samuel Lutes also entered into recognizance in the usual form, with sureties to secure the payments to the widow. She intermarried with Peter Leidig before the 11th April 1818, on which day Samuel Lutes and wife, by their deed, conveyed 59 acres 10 perches of purpart No. 2, to Peter Leidig, for $3922.70, stipulating in the deed that it was clear of all encumbrances, and with clause of general warranty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-7\">A judgment was had in the Common Pleas of Cumberland county, at the suit of William Clarke <em>v. </em>Peter Leidig, at April term 1820. <em>A fieri facias </em>was issued, and the land so conveyed to. him by Lutes and wife was levied on, and sold on <em>venditioni exponas </em>to George Beltzhover, for $400; sheriff\u2019s deed dated 12th February 1822.

That it is real estate is clear, from considering, ( that the intestate Act'gives her, where there are children, one- \\ third of her deceased husband\u2019s lands during her life. In case, \\ however, it becomes necessary to sell the lands, in order to make division, then her share, with the interest, is to be and remain chai\u2019ged on the premises, and the amount thereof to be annually and regularly paid by the child, his or her heirs and assigns, holding the lands, to be recovered by the widow by distress or otherwise, as rents in this commonwealth are usually recovered, during <em>( </em>her natural <em>life: Act of 19th April </em>1794, <em>sec. </em>3,22. It is, then, ' a rent charged on <em>the </em>premises, recoverable by distress or otherwise ; and such rent is an incorporeal hereditament\u2014real estate \u2014and is not within the power of the husband, like a chose in action, to reduce into posession or dispose of. It is true a distress for such rent is not the only remedy which the widow possesses. V She may bring debt for the rent or annuity. It is the practice generally, though the Act does not prescribe it, to secure it to her \u25a0 by recognizance; and on this also she has a remedy by action. But these are only collateral or concurrent remedies, designed to fortify the widow\u2019s right, and to enlarge her means of recovery, and not to transfer any greater power to her husband.- Primarily and essentially, her estate is a rent issuing out of the land, and, therefore, an incorporeal hereditament ranking as real estate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>During the lifetime of Peter Leidig, by the events which occurred, the rent was not merged, but only suspended, and on his death the widow\u2019s right revived.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
