It is also my will after my death my body to .be <em>hurried </em>in Christian manner, where I shall rest till the morning of the <em>resserection </em>in hopes of being for ever at rest with my family if God will.

I sign my name to this as my last will and testament, this 19th day of June 1829.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-9\">The court below (Durkee, President) was of opinion that the will created an estate in fee in the devisee.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b419-10\">Hamhly,- for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_g\">cited 6 <em>Binn. </em>94; 12 <em>Serg. </em>4\u201d <em>Rawle 54; 6 Serg. </em>4* <em>Rawle </em>456; <em>Cowp. </em>352.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-11\"><em>Fisher, </em>for defendant in error.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b419-12\">Per. Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"A_O\">Since this Court allowed the words \u201call debts, dues, and demands, real, personal and mixed,\u201d to pass real estate where used in a deed, as it did in <em>M\u2019Williams </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>(12 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle </em>269), it may well allow the words \u201c all what I have, both real and moveable property,\u201d to do as much when used in a will. They include all interests, whether realty or chattels; and are as extensive in their signification as the words \u201c all my estate,\u201d which have been held equivalent to words of limitation in fee, when they were not used to individuate the property. The cases in respect to the last, are numerous as well as trite, and it is not worth our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>while to recur to any of them in particular, as the intention in this instance is too manifest to be mistaken. <em>Loveacres </em>v. <em>Blight, (Coup. </em>352), is nearer to the present case; and there the words \u201c my lands and messuages freely by them to be possessed and enjoyed,\u201d were held to pass a fee. We are of opinion, therefore, that the plaintiff had power to convey, and that the construction put upon the will in the court below, is the true one.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
