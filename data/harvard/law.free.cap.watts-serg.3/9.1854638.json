J. Wharton, </em>(with whom was <em>Rawle), </em>for plaintiff in</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZ\">error, contended that the sheriff\u2019s sale did not discharge the arrears of ground-rent so as to prevent a distress by the owners of the rent for such arrears. They were not bound to come in on the fund raised by the sheriff\u2019s sale. Arrearages of rent ar\u00e9 looked on as the rent itself. <em>Co. Lit. </em>162, <em>a; Gilb. Rents </em>97; <em>Rolls. Ab. </em>672. By the 66th section of the Act of 16th of June 1836, concerning executions, purchasers at .sheriff\u2019s sales are to take under the same rents and services as the debtor. Here we had no right to reenter on the land, or any claim to or interest in it: our remedy was confined merely to the goods and chattels happening to be on the premises. How can this be considered a lien on the land ? It is true that in <em>Bantleon </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>(2 <em>Binn. </em>146), the ground landlord was held entitled to come in in preference to a judgment creditor for the arrearages of his rent; but that was the case of an action of covenant brought and judgment obtained, and moreover there was a right to re-enter. The arrearages in the present case resemble interest on a mortgage, which is not discharged by a sheriff\u2019s sale. The interest is an incident, and follows the principal. In many instances such rents are payable in kind. <em>Co. Lit. </em>142.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b12-7\">\n<em>Ross, contra,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq\">argued that the cases of <em>Bantleon </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>(2 <em>Binn. </em>146), and <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>(1 <em>Watts &amp; Serg. 239), settled the </em>question. In the latter it was held that arrearages of a widow\u2019s third are to be paid out of a sale of the land by the sheriff on a judgment. <em>Luce </em>v. <em>Snively, </em>(4 <em>Watts </em>397), states the policy of the sheriff\u2019s selling free from all liens of which notice exists on record. Wherever the amount can be computed, it is taken out of the proceeds of sale. The exceptions are where it cannot be computed, as of a widow\u2019s rent-charge, or of a ground-rent to grow due <em>in futuro. </em>The latter is real estate, not a claim to a debt or sum of money which arrearages are. <em>St. Mary's College </em>v. <em>Miles, </em>1 <em>Whart. </em>229; 1 <em>Miles </em>291. Reserving a right of re-entry makes no difference. It is not noticed in the cases on the subject.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b12-8\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b12-9\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aa\">\u2014 I have never understood on what principle of lien the case of <em>Bantleon </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>(2 <em>Binn. </em>151), was decided. It seems to have been taken for granted that every charge on land which is liquidated and due at the time of a judicial sale of it, is to come out of the proceeds as a matter of course\u2014a principle far in advance of the one established by us in <em>Willard </em>v. <em>Norris, </em>(2 <em>Rawle </em>56) which was so unpalatable to the profession that a statute was procured to overturn it. But though a wholesome one, in the main, it is not of universal application. Arrears of rent do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>not come out of the purchase money where the term has been sold; and it required a statute to give preference over the lien of an execution levied on personal.chattels, in favour of the landlord, for even a year\u2019s rent. And what difference is there, in this respect, between real and personal interests? The statute of <em>Weslm. </em>2, which created the lien of a judgment, restrained it to land; but a lien independently of the statute is as applicable to a chattel. Yet in <em>Bantleon </em>v. <em>Smith </em>the ground landlord\u2019s preference was carried back beyond the lien of his judgment, so as to shut out an intervening one; and if that could be done, he might have come into court for his ground-rent without a judgment for it. Such indeed was once the practice in regard to purchase money due by the judgment debtor, on the notion, exploded in this state, of the existence, in such a case, of an equitable lien. There is no more reason that a prospective duty charged on land should follow it into the hands of a sheriff\u2019s vendee, than that instalments presently due should follow it; and it could not be tolerated that a ground landlord should be at liberty to throw the arrears of his rent on the lien creditors, or on the purchaser, according to the impulse of his caprice. The remedy by distress of chattels on the land, is as accessible in the one case as in the other; and there is no legal necessity that the arrears should be taken out of the fund in court. Yet it is not my purpose to disturb, or cast the least shadow on the authority of <em>Bantleon </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>or to do more than show that it is not founded in any principle of lien peculiar to the reservation of a ground-rent, which it is necessary to carry out further than the decisions have already carried it. The case of <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Postlethwaite, </em>(2 <em>Dall. </em>131), in which a legacy charged on land was allowed to be taken out of the price of it in the sheriff\u2019s hands, as well as all others of the same stamp, depend for their authority exclusively on precedent, and their very great convenience, as well as on the policy of giving the sheriff\u2019s vendee a clear title, where it is practicable. But neither policy nor convenience will justify an extension of the principle of them to the price of land which was not liable - to be reached for the debt; and in all thp precedents the money was not only charged, but there was a means of subjecting the land to payment of it. In <em>Bantleon </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>there was a clause of re-entry by which the land itself might be seized, and the produce of it applied, if not at law, yet in equity, to payment of the rent; and in <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Postlethwaite, </em>it might have been sold, on judgment and execution, for the legacy: but it was perhaps the difficulty of reaching it, in either of those ways, as well as the principle of policy, which inclined the courts to apply the proceeds of it, when turned into money. Now what is the remedy by distress \u2014 the only one provided in this conveyance ? It is as much a personal one as an action on a covenant in the deed; it is even more so, as the land may be reached by such an action, while it cannot be reached by a distress, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>operates merely on chattels found upon it. Though a rent issues out of the land, it is not an encumbrance on it, for a part of the thing demised cannot be reserved; and a distress for it is no more than a means of extorting payment from the personal property of the tenant. The defendant, therefore, was at liberty to distrain for the arrears due at the sheriff\u2019s sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-6\">Judgment of the court below reversed, and judgment here for the defendant below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
