A bond binding the parties, their heirs, executors and administrators, and <em>each </em>or <em>every </em>of them, was held so in <em>Besore </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>(12 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>154), as well as in subsequent cases; and in <em>Wampler </em>v. <em>Shissler, </em>(1 <em>Watts &amp; Serg. </em>365), a recognizance to be levied of the goods, chattels, lands or tenements of the parties <em>respectively, </em>was held to be joint and several. Here an intent to create a several liability is still more apparent in the style of the promises which were made in the name of the lessee. Thus, it was said, \u201c the said Charles does agree to cut no timber,\u201d &amp;c.; \u201c the said Charles is to pay all taxes,\u201d &amp;c.; \u201c the said Charles does agree to pay the said Kleckner $60 for the first year,\u201d &amp;c.; words which certainly make a several promise by the lessee; and if he is severally bound, so must his surety be. The several recovery against Charles, the lessee, therefore, did not bar the action against his surety; and it was properly sustained in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
