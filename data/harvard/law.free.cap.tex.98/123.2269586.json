This charge was not warranted by the evidence in this case. Jones v. Galveston H. &amp; S. A. Ry. Co., 31 S. W. Rep., 706; International &amp; G. N. Ry. Co. v. Williams, 82 Texas, 344; Texas &amp; P.

That portion of the court\u2019s charge set out in second proposition, supra, was therefore erroneous, misleading and confusing, in that it directed the consideration of the jury only to the question of the apparent danger of using the defective car at the time the order was given, and practically removed from the consideration of the - jury the question as to plaintiff\u2019s negligence in the manner of its use.

The charge complained of in this assignment of error assumes as a fact that the plaintiff used the hand car at the time and place and under the circumstances alleged by him in his petition. This was a controverted issue. In another place in the same charge the court tells the jury that as a matter of law the plaintiff would not be guilty of contributory negligence in using the hand car without a brake, under the direction of a superior officer, unless the danger of such use was so apparent that an ordinarily prudent person would not have used it under the same or similar circumstances, thus assuming that a certain state of facts would not constitute contributory negligence.

Rep., 935.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-7\">The court erred, to the prejudice of this defendant, in that portion of its general charge to the jury which reads as follows: \u201cIf you believe from the evidence in this case that the plaintiff of his own fault permitted his crew to operate the hand car at too rapid a rate of speed, or in too close proximity to the hand car in front of him; or that lie violated any rule or usage of the defendant in the operation of said ear, as alleged by the defendant, and was guilty of contributory negligence, as that term has heretofore been defined and explained to you in any of these respects; or if you believe from the evidence that he occupied a position on said hand car whereby he or his limbs were exposed to injury, and that in this respect he was guilty of contributory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>negligence; or if yon believe from the evidence that the plaintiff neglected to keep a proper lookout along the track over, which he was riding to discover obstructions upon said track, and in this respect was guilty of contributory negligence, as that term has heretofore been defined, then in either, each or all of these alternative events your verdict should be in favor of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-5\">The trial court erred in refusing to give to the.jury special instruction number 11, requested by the defendant, as follows: \u201cYou are charged that if you believe from the testimony that the plaintiff, B. R. Kelly, permitted the hand car upon which he was riding to be operated at the speed of ten or twelve miles per hour, down grade, over a newly constructed track, without a brake upon it, and from fifty to one hundred yards in the rear of another hand car, and that such action on the part of said Kelly was negligence, as that term has heretofore been defined to you, which proximately caused or contributed to the injuries of which he complained, then and in that event, your verdict should be for the defendant railroad company.\u201d Missouri K. &amp; T.

Neff, 87 Texas, 307.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-7\">\u201cThe correct rule is, that defendants had the right to prepare and demand the giving of a charge requiring the jury to find whether the evidence established the existence of any specified group of facts which, if true, would in law establish such plea, and instructing them that if they found such group of facts to be established by the evidence, to find for .defendants. And this would be true if proper charges had been asked as to each of the several pleas of contributory negligence presented by tire record. Any other rule would deprive litigants of their right to have the court explain to the jury the principles of 'law applicable to the very facts constituting a cause of action or defense, so that they may intelligently pass upon the various complicated issues frequently presented for their determination in one case under our practice.\u201d Gulf C. &amp; S.

McGlamory, supra.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-8\">There was error in qualifying the doctrine of assumed risk enunciated in paragraph 5 of the court\u2019s general charge, and there was further error in defining risk ordinarily incident to the employment,\" and the definition given by the court exculpated plaintiff from the' assumption of any risk created by his own negligence or that of defendant\u2019s employes under his control, or by the use of defective machinery known by him to be defective. The charge as given is incorrect, misleading and confusing. Electric Co. v. Robinson, 8 Texas Ct. Rep., 217; Galveston H. &amp; S. A. Ry. Co. v.

St. Louis S. W. Ry. Co. v. Casseday, 92 Texas, 525; Missouri K. &amp; T. Ry. Co. v. McGlamory, 89 Texas, 639; Gulf C. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. v. Shieder, 88 Texas, 152; Galveston H. &amp; S. A. Ry.

Rep., 205.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-6\">Paragraph 9, when construed as a whole, did not limit the jury in their consideration, or unduly qualify them upon the question of plaintiff\u2019s negligence vel non in using the hand car without a brake, in a negligent manner, because after submitting in paragraph 9 the alternative as to whether or not it was negligence on the part of Kelly in using the hand car without a brake in the first instance, in the concluding part of the paragraph the charge submitted the general alternative, that if the jury believed plaintiff used the hand car in a negligent manner they should find for the defendant. It is thus demonstrated beyond peradventure that the court did not limit or unduly qualify the jury in its consideration of the question of contributory negligence, either in using the hand car without a brake in the first instance, or in the manner of its use.

Mitchell, 66 S. W. Rep., 579; \u201cNevertheless, where the court has made a correct general presentation of the issue (though possibly not as specific as it might haveffieen), if the party desires a fuller charge on that issue, he must request a correct one.

(Note: He pleaded that he was, and the Court of Civil Appeals found as a conclusion of fact that he was.,) (b) Whether or not the danger of using the hand car without a brake was so apparent that an ordinarily prudent man would not have used the same under the same or similar circumstances (Note: The Court of Civil Appeals found as a conclusion of fact that Kelly was not guilty of contributory negligence in doing so under the circumstances), and the following corollary as a proposition of law, that if the jury should find in Kelly\u2019s favor upon propositions A and B, that he would not be guilty of contributory negligence in that respect, which meant in the use of the hand car without the brake, in the first instance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-7\">It was not negligence per se for Kelly to use the hand car without the brake, either under the direction of a superior officer or without such direction.

It did not direct the consideration of the jury to the question of the apparent danger of using the defective car at the time the order was given, and it did not remove from the consideration of the jury the question as to plaintiff\u2019s negligence in the manner of its use. An examination of the language of the court as contained in the ninth paragraph of the charge and as embodied in the second proposition will disclose that the attention of the jury was not directed to any time in which the car was being used, but directed the attention of the jury to the question only as to whether or not the plaintiff Kelly was guilty of contributory negligence in using the hand car at any time on-the day of the 13th. In view of the fact that he had been ordered 'to do so by his superior officer, the fact that several hours had intervened between the giving of the allegd order in the morning and the time of the accident did not alter the legal status that existed between the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-10\">It was an absolute impossibility for the jury to have been misled or confused by the instruction complained of upon \"the point presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>in the third proposition, that it removed from the consideration of the jury the question as to plaintiff\u2019s negligence in the matter of its use, because the jury was directly instructed in paragraph 9 of the court\u2019s charge, that notwithstanding the order, etc., if plaintiff used the hand car in a negligent manner, to find for the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-5\">The charge did not assume as a fact that the plaintiff used the .hand car at the time and jilace and under the circumstances alleged by him in his petition.

The plaintiff Kelly alleged in his petition as a ground for recovery the fact that the defendant had negligently allowed an obstruction tc be placed upon the track without notice to him, and that as a direct and proxi-' mate result thereof the hand car upon which he was riding collided with the hand car in front, which had run into the obstruction. The plaintiff did not seek to recover on account of a defective hand car furnished to him for his work, and this question and issue had no place in the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>case, save and except by virtue of the fact that the railway company pleaded the use of the hand car without a brake as an act of contributory negligence on the part of Kelly, as a proximate result of which he was injured.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-3\">The trial court did not err in refusing special charge number <em>12, </em>because it ignored the alleged negligence of the defendant in putting the obstruction across the track, and directs a verdict for the defendant, if the jury believed that the accident was the result of the hand car being minus a brake. This would have been tantamount to a peremptory instruction for the defendant, because indisputably the accident was the result of the use of a hand car minus a brake; indisputably it was also the result of an obstruction placed upon the track without notice to the plaintiff, Kelly.

The statement and questions are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">\u201cThe action was brought by Bernard R. Kelly against the Texas &amp; New Orleans Railroad Company to recover damages for personal injuries received by Kelly while he was in the employment of the company, resulting, as alleged, from its negligence. The petition showed that the plaintiff was at work for the defendant as the foreman of a gang of men in the construction and extension of its line of railroad from Rockland to Cedar, in Nacogdoches County; that while riding on a hand car about noon March 13, 1901, going from his place of work to his camp for dinner, he ran into an obstruction upon the track and was seriously injured. The alleged acts of negligence on the part of the defendant were that it erected and permitted to remain across the track a dangerous and hazardous obstruction consisting of heavy poles, and did not warn the plaintiff of its presence. The defendant answered by general demurrer and general denial, and special pleas in bar of facts to show assumed risk and contributory negligence. One of the facts alleged was that the plaintiff was using a hand car that he knew to be defective in that it was without a brake. In a supplemental petition the plaintiff admitted that the hand ear he was using was defective in the respect alleged, and pleaded that he had been directed to use it by a superior officer. A supplemental answer was filed by the defendant demurring to the supplemental petition, and denying its allegations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>fact. After the court had overruled the demurrers the cause was tried by jury and resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of the plaintiff for $30,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-3\">\u201cAt the time he received the injuries complained of the plaintiff was in the employment of the defendant as foreman of a bridge gang and was working near the town of Nacogdoches in the construction of the extension of the defendant\u2019s railroad from Rockland to Cedar. The company was building its track north from Rockland and had reached a point near Nacogdoches; but that part of the road had not been finished, and trains were running only as far as Huntington, several miles south of the place of the accident. The track over which the plaintiff was riding when he was injured had been constructed only two or three days. It had not been surfaced up and was in an unfinished condition, and had not been turned over to \u201cthe proper department for the operation of trains. As foreman the plaintiff had charge of a gang of men in camp about three miles south of Nacogdoches, and working between the camp* and that town. On the morning of the accident, March 13, 1901, he went out to work with twenty men to fix a cattle-guard and build a bridge, using two hand cars furnished by the company for the transportation of the men and tools. One of the hand cars had no brake on it and had been in that condition for about two weeks. It was the plaintiff\u2019s duty to repair the car and he had made a brake for it on the day before the accident, and on the morning of the day of the accident it was taken out by the men to be put on the car, but after they reached their place of work it was discovered that they had no nut suitable for the purpose and it was not put on. There was evidence introduced on behalf of the plaintiff to show that he had been ordered by his superior officer, Conners, on the morning of the accident to take out the hand car without the brake. In the construction of \u2022 the road temporary cattle-guards were erected at the inclosures consisting of bars across the track made of pine poles with the bark on. In going out to work on the morning of the accident the hand car without the brake went in front with about thirteen men and the rest of the men with the other hand car followed. They passed through four sets of bars which had been put up as temporary cattle-guards and of which the men had previous knowledge. The seven men with the rear car stopped to put in a temporary eattl\u00e9-guard constructed with stringers and a pit, while the others with the car without the brake went on to build a bridge. At noon the men started on their return to camp for dinner, the car without the brake running in the rear. They went through the bars that they had passed through in the morning and were running, according to different estimates given by several witnesses^ from eight to twelve miles an hour on a down grade with a dump and rising grade in front of them, when the car in front ran into a set of bars on the dump which had been erected that morning, of which no notice had been given to the men and of the presence of which they did not know. The men in front succeeded in stopping their car so that it struck the bars with only slight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>force and no one on it was hurt, but the rear car ran violently into the car in front and the plaintiff was injured by the collision. If the car upon which the plaintiff was riding had been equipped with a brake it could have been stopped in time to have avoided the accident. There was evidence tending to show that the defendant was negligent in having the obstruction on the track and in not warning the men of its presence. There was also evidence tending to show that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as alleged in the answer. Copies of the pleadings are here set out.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-4\">The honorable Court of Civil Appeals copied with the statement the pleadings and the entire charge of the court, but the certificate does not present any question based upon the pleadings and involves only three paragraphs of the charge. We therefore omit the pleadings and all of the charge except the three paragraphs mentioned in the questions propounded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">\u201cYou are instructed that the plaintiff, while in the employment of the defendant, assumed as a matter of law all of the risks of injury that were ordinarily incident to the employment in which he was engaged; and if you believe from the evidence that his injuries, if any he received, grew out of a risk that was ordinarily incident to his employment, then your verdict should be for the defendant. But you are further instructed in this connection that by the use of the expression risk ordinarily incident to the employment\u2019 is meant a risk of injury that does not arise or grow out of an act of negligence on the part of the defendant or its servants, and that whenever a risk is created by an act of negligence on the part of a railroad company or its employes, this is not a risk ordinarily incident to the employment.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">\u201cYou are instructed that the undisputed evidence in this case is that the hand car did not have a proper and sufficient brake. If you believe from the evidence in this case in this connection that the plaintiff, Barney Iielfy, was guilty of contributory negligence, as that term has heretofore been defined and explained to jou, in using the hand car at the time and place and under the circumstances alleged by him in his petition, then your verdict should be in favor of the defendant. You are instructed in this connection, however, that if you should believe from the evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s superior officer directed him to use the hand car without a brake, then you are further instructed that unless the danger of using said hand car in that condition was so apparent that an ordinarily prudent man would not have used the same under the same or similar circumstances, the plaintiff would not be guilty of contributory negligence in that respect. But if you should believe from the evidence that the plaintiff was instructed by his superior officer to use the hand car without the brake, and if you believe from the evidence that the' danger of using the hand car at the time and place, and under the circumstances as alleged by the plaintiff in his petition, was one of such apparent danger that an ordinarily prudent man would not have used the same under the same or similar circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>'stances, then your verdict should be in favor of the defendant railroad company, or if you believe from the evidence that plaintiff used the said hand car in a negligent manner, and by reason of negligence plaintiff was injured, then you will find for defendant, although you may believe the defendant was guilt)' of negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">\u2022 \u201cIf you believe from the evidence in this ease that the plaintiff, of his own fault, permitted his crew to operate the hand car at a too rapid rate of speed, or in too close proximity to the hand car in front of him, or that he violated any rule or usage of the defendant in the operation of said car as alleged by the defendant, and was guilty of contributory negligence, as that term has heretofore been defined and explained to you, in any of these respects; or if you believe from the evidence that he occupied a position on said hand car whereby he or his limbs were exposed to injury, and that in this respect he was guilty of contributory negligence; or if you believe from the evidence that the plaintiff neglected to keep a proper lookout along the track over which he was riding, \u25a0 to discover obstructions upon said track, and in this respect was guilty 'of contributory negligence, as that term has been heretofore defined, then in either, each or all of these alternative events your verdict should be in favor of the defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">\u25a0 \u201cThe questions certified for the decision of the Supreme Court arise upon the action of the trial court in giving and refusing instructions to the jury, and are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">\u201c1. Did the trial court err in the ninth paragraph of the charge ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">\u201c2. Did the trial court err in refusing to give the jury special in- , struction number 12 requested by the defendant, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">\u25a0 \u2018\u201cYou are charged that if, under the evidence in this case, you believe that the plaintiff, B. R. Kelly, was in a position to know and realize the dangers, if any, of using the hand car in question in the condition in which it was at the time of the accident, then in that event, even though you should find that George Connors was his superior officer, and should further find that the said Connors directed him to place said hand car upon the track and to go to his work, still the said B. R. Kelly would assume such risks, if any, as were incident to the use of said hand car in its then known condition, and if his injuries, if any, were the result thereof, then he will not be entitled to recover in this case, and your verdict should be for the defendant company ?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-10\">\u201c3. Did the trial court err in the tenth paragraph of the charge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-11\">\u201c4. Did the trial court err in refusing to give to the jury special instruction number 11 requested by the defendant, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-12\">\u201c \u2018You are charged that if you believe from the testimony that the plaintiff, B. R. Kelly, permitted the hand car upon which he was riding to be operated at the speed of ten or twelve miles per hour, down grade, over a newly constructed track, without a brake upon it, and from fifty to one hundred yards in the rear of another hand car, and that such action on the part of said Kelly was negligence, as that term has heretofore been defined to you, which proximately caused or contributed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>the injuries of which he complained, then and in that event, your verdict should be for the defendant railroad company.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-3\">\u201c5. Did the trial court err in the fifth paragraph of the charge ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Answer to the first question: There was no reversible error in giving the ninth paragraph of the court\u2019s charge. The plaintiff in error objects to this charge, first, because it restricts the jury in 'considering, the question of the apparent danger of using the hand car to \u201cthe time, place and circumstance alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s petition.\u201d Plaintiff in error, however, fails to show that there were any other circumstances which surrounded the party materially different from those alleged in the petition by which the act of the plaintiff would be shown to be negligent. In other words, there is nothing shown in support of the objection which indicated that any injury resulted from the unnecessary use of the language objected to.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Plaintiff in error further objects to the charge because of the language, \u201cyou are instructed in this connection, however, that if you should believe from the evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s superior officer directed him to use the hand car without the brake, then you are further instructed,\u201d etc. If, knowing its condition, Kelly had used the defective hand car without any order of his superior officer to do so, but it appeared that under like circumstances a reasonably prudent man would have made the same use of the car, he could not be charged with contributory negligence, but the charge imposed upon Kelley the duty to show in addition that he was, at the time, acting under the order of a superior officer in order to exonerate him from the charge of contributory negligence. Howard Oil Co. v. Farmer, 56 Texas, 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">If the language of the charge were susceptible of the construction placed upon it by the plaintiff in error, it would not be erroneous, for the order of the superior would be a pertinent fact to go to the jury on the question of whether the subordinate, who acted in obedience to such order, was guilty of contributory negligence. Central Railroad Co. v. De Bray, 71 Ga., 420; Chicago &amp; N. W. Ry. Co. v. Bayfield, 37 Mich., 211; Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co. v. Ampey, 93 Va., 108; Illinois Steel Co. v. Schymanowski, 162 Ill., 459; Moline Plow Co. v. Anderson, 19 Ill. App., 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">It is also objected to this charge that it assumes the existence of the fact that Kelly operated the hand car as alleged in his petition. We do not think that the jury could have understood that they were restricted by this language to the consideration of the allegations of the petition alone, for in other parts of the charge the court instructed the jury very carefully with regard to contributory negligence on part of Kelly.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">Answer to the second question: The requested charge which was. refused ignored the proposition that although Kelly might have been guilty of negligence in operating the hand car without a brake, or might have assumed the risk incident to the defects in the car itself, yet if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>accident was caused by the negligence of the defendant railroad company in placing obstructions upon its track and failing to warn its employes of the fact, still Kelly could have recovered for the injuries suffered by reason of such negligence. In no event did Kelly assume the risk of a condition caused by negligence of the railroad company which was independent of and disconnected from the defects in the hand car itself. Missouri Pac. Ry. Co. v. Somers, 78 Texas, 442; Richmond &amp; D. Ry. Co. v. Rudd, 88 Va., 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">In Railway v. Somers, before cited, Chief Justice Gaines said: \u201cBecause a servant knows of one defect he does not take the risk of another of which he has no knowledge, and if both contribute to injure him, he is entitled to recover, provided but for the unknown defect the accident would not have happened.\u201d The charge was properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Answer to the third question: The charge submitted by this question was for the defendant\u2014each hypothesis demanded a verdict for defendant. The railroad company presented a special charge upon the same points, which was given. There was no error in giving the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Answer to the fourth question: The facts grouped in the special charge, refused by the court, were all embraced in and submitted to the jury in the tenth paragraph of the court\u2019s charge and in a special charge asked by the defendant and given by the court. The only differences between the charge here under consideration and those given by the court are, that the speed of the car is here stated at \u201cten to twelve miles per hour\u201d and the distance between the two hand ears is given at \u201cfifty to one hundred yards,\u201d whereas, in the charge given, the distance between the cars is stated as being \u201ctoo close proximity\u201d and the speed of the car as being \u201ctoo rapid rate of speed.\u201d The refused charge also includes the fact that the road was rough and newly constructed, but we do not regard these differences as being of any importance; the charges given covered fairly every phase of the facts. The court rightly refused this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Answer to the fifth question: There was no error in giving the fifth paragraph of the court\u2019s charge. It correctly defines \u201crisks incident to the employment\u201d assumed by one entering the service of a railroad company, and, in doing so, correctly informed the jury that a risk arising from the negligence of the master or his servants is not \u201cordinarily incident to the employment,\u201d but it is not said that such risk, when known to the employe, is not assumed, as counsel for plaintiff in error seem to think. In another paragraph of the charge the court instructed the jury, at the request of the railroad company, that \u201cthe employe is deemed in law to have assumed * * \u2022* such risks as he knows of, or would, in the exercise of ordinary care in the discharge of his own duties, have known of.\u201d The subject was well covered by the charge given.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
