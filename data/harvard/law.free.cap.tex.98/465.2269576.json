M. Jennings, care Moore &amp; Skinner Co., Gladys,'Texas: Come at once. Daughter is very sick.(Signed) Mrs. M. M. Jennings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">There was delay in the delivery of the message after its receipt at defendant\u2019s office at Gladys which constituted negligence unless the defendant made good its defense that the place of business of Moore &amp; Skinner Company was beyond its free delivery limits. In acting upon-the application we were of the opinion, which we still entertain, that upon none of the other points in the case was ground for reversal of the judgment shown, and we have now reached the conclusion that upon this point also the judgment is sustained by the evidence. The dedefendant\u2019s obligation to deliver messages is thus expressed in its rule: \u201cFree delivery limits. Messages will be delivered free within a radius of one-half mile from the office in any city or town of less than five-thousand inhabitants and within a radius of one mile from the office in any city or town of five thousand or more inhabitants. ' Beyond this limit only the actual cost of the delivery service will be collected. The manager will, however, see that such cost is as reasonable as possible.\u201d Opinions of witnesses familiar with the locality were offered by plaintiff that by the nearest route, which did not follow the roads or streets, but, at points, passed diagonally across lots, the distance from defendant\u2019s office to Moore &amp; Skinner Company\u2019s plant was less than a half mile, and defendant proved by two witnesses that they had measured the distance by one route, which they do not further state than that it was the nearest traveled route by the road, and that it was 4904 feet. Opinions on such a question were admissible to be considered as evidence, but we are of the opinion, in granting the writ' of error, that the evidence of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses was too vague and 'uncertain to be allowed to stand against accurate measurement of the same distance about which the opinions were given, when such measurement is conclusively established. But it appears upon further examination that the - measurement made was of the nearest traveled route by the' road, which does not prove that this was the shortest distance, or the same that plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testified about. The test given by the rule is \u201ca radius,\u201d which means a right line from the office to the plant. This is the language of the defendant itself, against whom it must <em>betaken </em>most strongly, even if there were room for construction of it. If the plant was within a half mile by straight line from the office, it was within the defined limits, and the defendant was bound by its undertaking to deliver the message for the ordinary charge for telegraphing which was paid. As above shown there is evidence tending to prove that the distance was less than a half mile, even by a route <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>which was not straight, and this is not displaced by a measurement of a different route. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Ho error in the judgment being shown by the assignments, the judgy ment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
