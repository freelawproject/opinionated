Such is not the attitude of minor heirs or devisees of the wife as to her interest in community property; and in fact the Supreme Court of the State, in first establishing the doctrine that the equitable title was barred, specifically limited the doctrine then laid down by them to the facts of the case before them. Collins v.

Wiess during the coverture between himself and Mary E. Wiess. Therefore the^ legal title, by virtue of the deed to V. Wiess, was vested in him, and only an equitable title in his wife, Mary E. Wiess, and she could only devise such estate as she had; hence, the legal title being in V. Wiess by virtue of the deed itself, with the power conferred on him by the will to manage, control and dispose of the property, he was in the same status and relation to the property after the death of Mary E. Wiess as before. Edwards v. Brown, 68 Texas, 329; Paty v. Middleton, 82 Texas, 594; Kircher v. Murray, 60 Fed. Rep., 52; West v. Keeton, 17 Texas Civ. App., 142.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-7\">However, even if Mary E. Wiess had such estate in the land in controversy as she could devise a legal title to, she, by her will, vested in her husband, V. Wiess, as executor, the legal title to her entire estate, subject to certain charges and trusts, as follows: 1. The entirety was charged with the support of V. Wiess during his life, and the support of the children until they arrived at age. 2. As to the half thereof referred to in Item 3, devised directly to V. Wiess, he was placed in \u201cabsolute and fee simple ownership,\u201d subject only to the limitation and trust that whatever was left at his death in kind, or value, if any, went in shareg of equal value to the children. 3. As to the other half, referred to in Item 4, the trust was fixed and charged thereon, that the portion left after supporting the husband during his life (if he chose to hold it together so long for his support) or so long as he willed, and the children until they arrived at age, should go to the children,' and deeds or bills of sale should be made by V. Wiess, executor, passing the legal title to the children or either of them, at such time as he saw proper to partition among the children, or to deliver to either of them his or her share, free from the further burden of supporting him during his life, and the children during their minority, and free from his control, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>etc. McMurray v.

Mistretta, 20 Texas Civ. App. 241.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-6\">The evidence in this case establishes beyond and without controversy title under the ten years statute of limitations as to all the land in controversy; because ten years\u2019 adverse occupancy accrued in favor of the appellees and against V. Wiess, both in \u25a0 his individual capacity and as trustee under the will, holding the legal title to the property in controversy; and since he held the legal title and was himself barred, there was no error in the court, title by limitation being established without contradiction, to instruct a verdict of the jury in favor of the defendants.

(see note on p. 398).</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-8\">Our courts have held that even though an administrator is negligent for a sufficient period to give title by limitation against him, still the minor heirs are not barred, the reason being that an administrator is not vested with legal title; but a distinction is drawn between a trustee under a deed or under a will, vested with legal title, and an administrator without a legal title; in that a trustee, under a deed or a will\u2014 which is but a deed that takes effect after the testator is dead\u2014being vested with legal title, and being barred, the heirs, though minors themselves, are likewise barred. Collins v. McCarty, 68 Texas, 152; Chubb v. Johnson, 11 Texas, 474; Hank v. Crosby, 64 Texas, 484.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-9\">Adverse possession and occupancy on the part of the defendants is shown by the evidence in this case beyond controversy and without contradiction to have accrued and run for a much greater period than ten years, as against V. Wiess in his individual capacity and as holder as trustee of the legal title for his children. Therefore, title by statute of limitations for ten years is complete, as against both V. Wiess and his said children, and the court did not err in so instructing the jury.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b301-10\">BROWN, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"A8J\">From the opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals we make the following extract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-11\">\u201cV.

And in the event the said husband should not survive me, or should not effect such partition or partitions and delivery during his lifetime, then it is my will and pleasure that my children shall take, have and hold equally, share and share alike, all of my estate, in excess of the payments of my debts, their shares respectively to be valued and set apart to them, in that event, by my beloved brothers, Mark Wiess and William Wiess, their acknowledged deeds, or bills of sale in partition, by virtue hereof to be final herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">\u201c \u2018Item 5. I hereby nominate, constitute and appoint my beloved husband, Valentine Wiess, and in the event of his death, before the full execution of this will, then my beloved brothers-in-law, Mark and William Wiess, as executors of this my last will and testament, and it is my ~will and pleasure that my husband during his lifetime, and my said brothers-in-law, in the event of his death, or either of them surviving, shall exercise full care, management, control and supervision of my estate until this will is fully executed, with full power to bargain, sell, convey, exchange, lease, release, deed, collect, receive, keep or invest the same or any part thereof, as in their discretion, subject to the law, may be deemed to its best interest, and to make, execute any and all deeds or instruments of writing necessary to carry out the above powers and to confirm thereunder, that the same powers shall be exercised for myself, my executor or executors as guardian or guardians of my grandchildren\u2019s persons and estates until they shall become of age, and my entire estate disposed of under this will, that they shall have the control, care and custody of their persons and estates, and the supervision of their education, which I desire should be as liberal and thorough as their circumstances will admit of. It is also my will and pleasure that my said executor or executors shall not be required, as such or as guardians, to give bond or security herein, that no action shall be had in any court of probate jurisdiction in relation to the settlement of my estate, or its management other than the probating and registration of my will and the return of any inventory of my estate, and that my executors shall exercise any and all powers which are necessary to the performance of those hereby expressly delegated.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">\u201cWe hold that title by limitation of ten years is established beyond controversy as against V. Wiess, and this disposes of the assignment questioning the action of the court in assuming the fact to be -established.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">If V. Wiess had the legal title to the land in controversy, and if the facts are such that an action by him was barred by the statute of limitations, this action by the minor children was barred notwithstanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>their disability. Hanks v. Crosby, 64 Texas, 483; Collins v. McCarty, 68 Texas, 150. In the case last cited Chief Justice Willie said: \u201cIt is almost universally held that when suit by the trustee is barred, the right of the cestui que trust to sue is also gone, though he may have been under disability at the time the cause of action arose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Defendant in error claims that Y. Wiess had the legal title to the land sued for: (1) because it was the community property of himself and his deceased wife; (2) by the terms of the will of Mrs. Wiess the legal title to the land was conferred upon Y. Wiess as trustee for the minor children.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">If there had been no will upon the death of Mrs. Wiess the community estate would have vested one-half in her husband and the other half in their children. Rev. Stats., art. 1696; Hanks v. Crosby, 64 Texas, 483. The husband and children would have held as tenants in common. Rowland v. Murphy, 66 Texas, 535. Without administration or qualification as survivor, Wiess would have had no power over the interest of the children, except that which would arise by reason of the analogy to a partnership estate, or as a tenant in common. Whatever may be the character of title of the husband in community property while the wife lives, he has not the legal title with the powers incident thereto after her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">To determine the character of title that the will of Mrs. Wiess vested in the children to the portion bequeathed to them, we must ascertain the intention of the testatrix by considering the whole instrument. Cleveland v. Cleveland, 89 Texas, 449; McMurry v. Stanley, 69 Texas, 227. The third item of the will bequeathed to Y. Wiess one-half of the estate of the testatrix with powers and qualifications not necessary to mention here. The fourth item contains this language: \u201cI will and bequeath the other equal half of all my estate aforesaid, in excess of, as aforesaid, to our beloved children now born or to be born of our said marriage.\u201d The intention to confer the legal title upon the children is further shown by this stipulation: \u201cThe stock, horses and cattle, if any, to be divided between and among my said children and husband as aforesaid in the branding of the calves and colts annually as they accrue to my estate.\u201d If the legal title was to be vested in Y. Wiess to all of the horses, stock and cattle, it would not have been necessary to provide for a partition between him and his minor children. But it was a wise provision if it was intended that he should have the powers of an executor or guardian as subsequent parts of the will show to have been the purpose. Those provisions clearly confer the legal title to the one-half of the estate upon the children and must be given effect, unless other provisions in the will clearly indicate an intention to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">The honorable Court of Civil Appeals bases its conclusion that the legal title was vested in Y. Wiess mainly upoh these grounds: (1) That provision is made for the support of Y. Wiess, which is to continue during his life; (2) that such powers of disposition and control of the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>\u25a0erty are given to V. Weiss as would require for their execution that he have the legal title; and (3) that the time of partition is left entirely to his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The provision for the support and maintenance of V. Wiess out of the half of the estate devised to the children can only be arrived at by inference from very obscure language; that is, that the bequest was made \"of the other half of my estate aforesaid, in excess of, as aforesaid;\u201d and again, \"that during the lifetime of my beloved husband nothing shall be done, any provision in this will appearing to the contrary notwithstanding, to divert or endanger the provision which is hereby made for his comfortable maintenance and support.\u201d That is, the bequest to the children was made subject to these exceptions in the third item of the will: \"I will and bequeath one-half of all my estate, * * * in excess of the payment of my debts as aforesaid, and what may be requisite and used for the proper and comfortable maintenance and support of my dearly beloved husband, Valentine Wiess, during his lifetime.\u201d These stipulations for support, if chargeable upon the estate of the children in the first instance, would not constitute title to the property. Rose v. Eaton, 77 Mich., 247. The power to sell and consume \u2022the portion given to him indicates that V. Wiess was to have his support \u25a0out of that half, if it was sufficient, and the provision quoted from the fourth item shows that it was the intention of the testatrix to charge the support of her husband upon the whole estate, if the half given to him should not be adequate. The property bequeathed to the children \u25a0could not be sold for the support of V. Wiess; no such power is given. The provision for the husband is not inconsistent with the existence \u25a0of the legal title in the children. Rose v. Eaton, before cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The authority given to V. Wiess to dispose of and sell the property bequeathed to him is expressed in the following terms: \"To have and \u25a0exercise all the rights of absolute and fee simple ownership of the said half and to bargain, sell, convey, lease, release, trade or exchange the same to the extent he may see fit during his lifetime, but with remainder in kind or value, if any, of said estate to our said beloved children.\u201d The power to sell, convey, exchange, etc., so as to consume the prop\u25a0erty, is here distinctly limited to the half which was devised to V. Wiess, and that power can not be attributed to the portion of the \u25a0estate which was given to the children. In item 5, V. Wiess is nominated to be executor without bond and without control of the court; full power and control is given over the estate until the will is fully \u25a0executed, \"with full power to bargain, sell, convey, exchange, lease, release, deed, collect, receive, keep or invest the'same or any part thereof, as in their discretion subject to the law, may be deemed to its best interest.\u201d It will be observed that there is this difference in the powers given in the third and fifth items: In the first it is unlimited and is to be exercised for the benefit of V. Wiess himself, going to the length that he may at his own discretion sell, convey and so use as to abso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>lutely consume the estate, but in item 5, wherein is set forth the powers-that apply to the portion given to the minors, are to be exercised \u201csubject to the law and for the best interest of the .estate.\u201d This power off disposition as it applies to that portion bequeathed to the minors is not inconsistent with the existence of the legal title in them, and was not such absolute power and control over the property as would constitute-a legal title in the trustee. We call attention to the fact that in case of V. Wiess\u2019 death the powers enumerated in item 5 are conferred upon Mark and William Wiess as fully as they are upon Valentine Wiess. It can not be claimed that the legal title would have vested in Mark and William Wiess had they become executors. The powers granted to the-executors as such are shown to be consistent with the interest of the minors by these stipulations in the will: \u201cThat the same power shall be exercised for myself, my executor or executors as guardian or guardians of my children\u2019s persons and estates until they shall become of age,, and my entire estate disposed of under this will. That they shall have the control, care and custody of their persons and estates, and the supervision of their education, which I desire should be as liberal and thorough as their circumstances will admit of.\u201d The effect of this language-is to place the executor in the attitude of guardian of the persons and estates of the children, and the language, \u201cuntil they shall become off age,\u201d limits the powers conferred in item 5 as affects their interests to-the time when they shall become of age. The will authorized the executors to do for the minors those things that they could not do for themselves, and limited the powers to their minority, which provision is-consistent with that which vested the legal title in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The honorable Court of Civil Appeals relies upon the cases of Dulin v. Moore, 96 Texas, 135, and McMurry v. Stanley, 69 Texas, <em>227, </em>ta support its judgment in this case. This case is distinguishable from each of those cases in these respects. In Dulin v. Moore, the devisees could not possibly receive possession and control of the estate and had. only the right to the income during their lives, but the trustee was-charged with the duty of controlling the property for the benefit of thedevisees so long as they should live. It is clear from these facts that Dulin v. Moore does not support the 'decision made in this case;</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">In the case of McMurry v. Stanley, before cited, the will gave to N. G. Bagley the property, with the following powers over it: \u201cAnd that, he shall have full power and control over the same to use and dispose-of as he may desire.\u201d The fourth item of the will was in these words:. \u201cIt is my will and desire that at his death, should he have any of said property remaining in his possession not disposed of or used by him,, that the same shall be given by him to my nieces, Jessie McMurry and Flora Brown, daughters of Vina and Taylor Brown.\u201d The question was-whether the nieces took any estate in the property at all, and Judge Stayton for the court said: \u201cIt is evident from an inspection of the will before us, that it was not the intention of the testatrix, by force-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>of the will alone, to vest in Jessie McMurry and Flora Brown a legal estate in remainder to be enjoyed by them after the termination of the life estate of FT. G. Bagley.\u201d In that case there was no bequest made to Jessie McMurry and Flora Brown, and the only title that they could possibly have was to be derived through the action of FT. G. Bagley; \u2022therefore the learned judge who delivered that opinion correctly stated that it was not the intention to vest them with title by the terms of the will alone, but that they must derive their rights from the act of FT. G. Bagley. In this case the will in emphatic terms bequeaths to the-children one-half of the estate, and prescribes that at the discretion of <em>Y. </em>Wiess the property shall be partitioned between them and that his certificate or deed shall be sufficient to determine the rights of those parties. But the children did not derive their title from the act of V. Wiess; his power was simply to distribute what the will gave to them among them in equal proportions. That case is not analogous to this in this respect and, in our opinion, does not support the judgment of the-Court of Civil Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\">V. Wiess had under the will of his wife no power of disposition or ^management of the property bequeathed to their minor children except that given in the fifth item of the will, which powers were limited to the-minority of the children. The exercise of the authority conferred by the fourth item upon V. Wiess to partition the property with the discretion to determine when the division should be made did not require the existence of the legal title in him, therefore it was not inconsistent with the provisions of the will which conferred the legal title upon the children to one-half of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">We conclude that the legal title to one-half of her estate was vested by the will of Mrs. Wiess in her children and that their action was not barred by the statute of limitations, and that the trial court erred in instructing a verdict for the defendants. It is ordered that the judgments of the District Court and the Court of Civil Appeals be reversed and that this cause be remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
