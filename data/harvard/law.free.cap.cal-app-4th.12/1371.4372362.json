(ALR), appeals from a final judgment denying its motion for a supplemental writ of mandate to direct the State Water Resources Control Board (State Board): (1) to set aside the State Board\u2019s reversal of its own previously granted approval of ALR\u2019s application for revised waste discharge requirements (WDR\u2019s) (Wat. Code, \u00a7 13263) under the Porter-Cologne <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number>Water Quality Control Act;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) to prepare an environmental impact report (EIR) to evaluate the potential impacts, cumulative impacts, mitigation measures and alternatives to ALR\u2019s proposed municipal landfill project, prior to taking any action on the merits of ALR\u2019s application. The underlying issue on appeal is whether the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires the State Board to prepare and consider an EIR before it may disapprove a project that might endanger state waters. We concur with the ruling of the lower corn! that CEQA imposes no such requirement, and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">\n<em>The History of the Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">For many years, ALR has operated a landfill on 80 acres of a 302-acre site in the central part of the San Gabriel Valley within the cities of Azusa and Irwindale. The ALR landfill is located in a sand and gravel quarry overlying the Main San Gabriel Groundwater Basin (the Basin), which supplies drinking water for the lion\u2019s share of the San Gabriel Valley\u2019s more than 1,000,000 residents. The landfill is 23 miles from the notorious San Andreas Fault and within several miles of 4 other faults, including the Raymond and Sierra Madre Faults.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">The instant saga began in 1960, when the Los Angeles Regional Water Control Board (Regional Board) first issued WDR\u2019s authorizing ALR\u2019s predecessor, Azusa Rock and Sand Company, to deposit \u201cordinary household and commercial refuse\u201d and \u201cnonwater soluble nondecomposable inert solids\u201d at the landfill site. Such waste is nominally classified \u201cnonhazardous\u201d under the current regulatory scheme (see Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, \u00a7\u00a7 2520 (table 2.1), 2523, 2524), but typically contains known contaminants found in many commonly used household and automobile-related products. Leachates from the decomposition of such nonhazardous solid waste can render groundwater unfit for domestic purposes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In fact, pollution of the Basin already poses a significant threat to public health, and consequently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>the Basin is on the United States Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) national priority list for cleanup under the federal superfund program.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">ALR never used the entire 302-acre site for disposal of solid nonhazardous wastes. It limited such deposits to an 80-acre portion of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">In November 1984, under authority of the Porter-Cologne Act the State Board promulgated new regulations concerning \u201cwater quality aspects of waste discharge to land.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2601 (Chapter 15).) The requirements of Chapter 15 were far more stringent than the WDR\u2019s under which the landfill had been operating since 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">In July 1986, the Regional Board issued Order No. 86-59, which temporarily limited ALR\u2019s disposal of nonhazardous solid waste to the 80-acre portion of the landfill site historically used for that purpose, pending submission and approval of WDR\u2019s for use of the remainder of the site complying with Chapter 15. Subsequently, ALR sought approval from the Regional Board of WDR\u2019s for disposal of nonhazardous solid waste on all 302 acres of the landfill site, proposing a clay liner and leachate collection and removal system to prevent groundwater pollution. At first, the Regional Board rejected ALR\u2019s. proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">ALR submitted revised WDR\u2019s proposing additional measures to fortify its waste containment system at the landfill site. The Regional Board then approved the revised WDR\u2019s in November 1988 in Order No. 88-133, allowing disposal of Class III waste (nonhazardous solid waste and inert waste) on the whole 302 acres. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, \u00a7 2520, table 2.1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">Respondent, the Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (Watermaster), petitioned the State Board for rescission of the order approving ALR\u2019s revised WDR\u2019s. The petition was supported, among others, by respondents, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). In response to concerns expressed by the State Board, ALR proposed additional features to protect against degradation and contamination of groundwater and offered to make sizeable capital contributions to offset the cost of building groundwater treatment plants in the Basin. In October 1989, the State Board denied the Watermaster\u2019s petition and approved ALR\u2019s project, with amendments to the WDR\u2019s. The State Board\u2019s order, No. 89-17, included findings: (1) that ALR\u2019s proposed containment system, including a groundwater barrier and liner, would \u201cadequately protect water quality\u201d; and (2) that ALR\u2019s agreement to pay the costs of constructing treatment plants \u201cwould serve as an additional mitigation measure to offset whatever risks to water quality remain[ed].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1376\">*1376</page-number>The Watermaster, MWD, EDF and the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District (Upper District) filed petitions for writ of mandate in the superior court seeking rescission of the State Board\u2019s order approving revised WDR\u2019s for the expansion of ALR\u2019s nonhazardous solid waste landfill from 80 to 302 acres (Super. Ct. No. C743096). The superior court denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">In an unpublished opinion filed January 14, 1991, we reversed. <em>(Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District </em>v. <em>State Water Resources Control Bd. </em>(Jan. 14, 1991) B050366.) We held that the near tripling of ALR\u2019s solid waste disposal operation was a \u201c \u2018new project,\u2019 \u201d which did not fall within the \u201c \u2018ongoing project\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018existing facilities\u2019 \u201d exemptions of CEQA. Therefore, \u201c[t]he failure to prepare an EIR was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.\u201d We directed the superior court to issue a peremptory writ of mandate requiring the State Board to vacate its Order No. 89-17 and \u201cto permit no farther expanded dumping by [ALR] until the requirements of CEQA have been fully complied with in a manner consistent with this opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">On February 21, 1991, the State Board complied with the writ of mandate issued by the superior court by adopting Order No. 91-01, ordering ALR to refrain from depositing nonhazardous solid wastes in the proposed expansion area pending compliance with the requirements of CEQA. On March 6, 1991, the State Board appended a copy of Order No. 91-01 with its return to the writ of mandate, filed in the superior court. No objections were made to the State Board\u2019s showing of compliance with the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">In May 1991, by letter directed to legal counsel for the Watermaster and ALR, the State Board solicited comment, inter alia, on the authority of the State Board to prohibit further discharges at the ALR landfill without going through the CEQA process. The State Board received numerous written responses both for and against prohibiting expanded use of the landfill without full CEQA review. On June 6, 1991, the State Board held a workshop where the subject was discussed at length by the four sitting board members, with input from representatives of ALR, the Watermaster, and other interested organizations and governmental agencies, as well as private citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">On June 14, 1991, the State Board notified the parties it would render a decision based on the administrative record developed in connection with the adoption of Order No. 89-17, augmented by the record before the courts during writ of mandate and appellate proceedings challenging that order. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>State Board also invited the parties to submit further written comments on the documents filed during judicial proceedings. The parties, including ALR, did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">On July 12, 1991, the State Board notified the parties that it would hold a public hearing and special board meeting on July 24, 1991, to review ALR\u2019s expansion petition. A copy of a draft order disapproving the project was appended to the notice. The draft order prompted additional correspondence among the State Board and representatives of interested parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">At the July 24, 1991, hearing, the State Board heard arguments and received additional evidence concerning its proposed disapproval of the proposed landfill expansion. Among other topics covered by comment or testimony were: the continuation of a five-year drought in the Basin and resulting water shortages; expert opinions regarding the durability and effectiveness of the leachate containment system proposed by ALR as a means of protecting against groundwater contamination; the seismic safety of the site for waste disposal purposes; probable sources of organic water contamination in the vicinity of the ALR landfill other than the landfill itself; water contamination presently attributed to landfill leakage; and the City of Azusa\u2019s potential legal liability for damages resulting from water contamination. At the conclusion of the hearing, the State Board voted, three to one, to adopt, with minor revisions, the draft order disapproving ALR\u2019s revised WDR\u2019s for expanded use of the landfill. The order, No. 91-09, made findings: (1) that the site\u2019s location over a major drinking water aquifer and its highly permeable geology made it unsuitable for the disposal of waste;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) that the aquifer was already suffering from serious pollution problems; and (3) that evidence was conflicting whether the design features of the proposed project could reduce the risk to underlying groundwater to an acceptable level. Based on these findings, the State Board concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>further disposal of nonhazardous solid waste at the ALR landfill posed an unacceptable risk to water quality and should be prohibited.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">ALR filed a \u201cMotion for Supplemental Writ of Mandate\u201d in the superior court to compel the State Board to rescind Order No. 91-09 and prepare and consider an EIR before ruling on the merits of ALR\u2019s landfill expansion project. The motion was opposed by the State Board, the Watermaster, the Upper District, MWD and EDF. The superior court denied the motion, finding that neither CEQA, nor this court\u2019s opinion in the first appeal, nor the superior court\u2019s subsequent writ of mandate to the State Board, nor any other statutory provision required the State Board to prepare an EIR prior to disapproving ALR\u2019s project. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">At the outset we reject, without hesitation, any claim that the State Board\u2019s refusal to prepare and consider an EIR before acting on the merits conflicts with any prior judicial order or decision rendered by this court or the superior court in connection with the challenge to the State Board\u2019s Order No. 89-17, initially approving ALR\u2019s WDR\u2019s for expansion of the landfill. In <em>Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District </em>v. <em>State Water Resources Control Board, supra, </em>B050366, we considered whether the superior court had erred by declining to address the merits of the petitioners\u2019 contention that the State Board had violated CEQA by failing to require an EIR, because the petitioners had not exhausted their administrative remedies, and whether the Regional Board had erred in finding that no EIR was required because the landfill site was an \u201congoing project\u201d for purposes of section 15261, subdivision (b) of the CEQA Guidelines (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14). We neither considered nor expressed any opinion concerning the applicability of CEQA requirements to the State Board\u2019s <em>disapproval </em>of ALR\u2019s revised waste requirements for use of the entire 302-acre site. That question is presented for the first time in this appellate proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">The superior court\u2019s writ of mandate\u2014issued to comply with the remittitur issued by this court\u2014commanded the State Board to vacate Order No. 89-17 and to direct ALR not to deposit class III (nonhazardous solid) wastes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>into any portion of its landfill other than the 80 acres where such disposal was previously permitted \u201cpending compliance with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act. . . .\u201d Considered in the context of this court\u2019s opinion, the order cannot reasonably be read to compel preparation of an EIR in the event the State Board subsequently determined to disapprove of ALR\u2019s landfill expansion project.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">ALR\u2019s related contention, that the so-called \u201cjudicial admissions\u201d of respondents in the prior proceedings mandate an EIR prior to disapproval of ALR\u2019s expansion plans, borders on frivolous. The State Board has consistently maintained that an EIR was unnecessary, even when it proposed to approve ALR\u2019s expansion proposal. The remaining respondents argued that disapproval <em>without </em>an EIR was required by, among other provisions, the Porter-Cologne Act. The necessity of an EIR prerequisite to project approval was argued by respondents as a fallback position. In any event, ALR is hardly in a position to argue that respondents are now bound by positions advanced in the prior action. After all, ALR, having once argued that no EIR was required for project <em>approval, </em>now argues that compliance with the full panoply of CEQA procedures must precede <em>disapproval.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">Appellate court decisions analyzing the policies and purposes of CEQA and the Porter-Cologne Act abound,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> so we focus our review on the narrow issue raised by ALR: whether any provision of CEQA (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21000 et seq.) or the CEQA Guidelines (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 15000 et seq.) requires that the State Board prepare and consider an EIR prior to disapproving on the merits ALR\u2019s revised WDR application under the Porter-Cologne Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">Public Resources Code section 21100 declares, inter alia, that \u201c[a]ll state agencies, boards, and commissions shall prepare, or cause to be prepared by contract, and certify the completion of an environmental impact report on any project <em>they propose to carry out or approve </em>which may have a significant effect on the environment.\u201d (Italics added.) Nearly identical language is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>used in Public Resources Code section 21151, obligating all local governmental agencies to prepare or have prepared an environmental impact report on \u201cany project <em>they intend to carry out or approve </em>which may have a significant effect on the environment.\u201d (Italics added.) Other provisions of CEQA, such as those requiring public notice of public agencies\u2019 decisions (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21108, subd. (a)) or mitigation measures to avoid significant environmental effects (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21002.1, subd. (b)), likewise refer to projects which a public agency \u201capproves,\u201d \u201cdetermines to carry out,\u201d or \u201ccarries out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Considered in pari materia <em>(County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Frisbie </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 634, 639 [122 P.2d 526]), these and other provisions of CEQA leave little doubt that the requirement of an EIR is not even triggered unless a public agency <em>proposes to carry out or approve </em>a project which may have a significant effect on the environment. Any lingering doubt about the Legislature\u2019s intent is expunged by Public Resources Code section 21080, subdivision (b)(5), which expressly declares that CEQA <em>does not apply </em>to \u201c[projects which a public agency rejects or disapproves.\u201d Section 15270, subdivision (a) of the CEQA Guidelines (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14) echoes subdivision (b)(5) of Public Resources Code section 21080, stating: \u201cCEQA does not apply to projects which a public agency rejects or disapproves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Two isolated provisions of CEQA and CEQA Guidelines underlie ALR\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s reliance upon the plain meaning of Public Resources Code section 21080, subdivision (b)(5). ALR points to CEQA Guidelines section 15270, subdivision (b) (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14), which provides: \u201cThis section is intended to allow an initial screening of projects on the merits for quick disapprovals prior to the initiation of the CEQA process where the agency can determine that the project cannot be approved.\u201d ALR argues based on this provision that disapprovals without an EIR are limited to the initial screening phase of project review. Ergo, since ALR\u2019s WDR\u2019s for landfill expansion were originally <em>approved </em>by the State Board, the \u201cinitial screening\u201d phase is long past and the State Board may no longer take advantage of the \u201cquick disapproval\u201d exemption to deny ALR\u2019s application on the merits without preparation and consideration of an EIR.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">We see nothing in the language of this section bespeaking a legislative intent to deprive public agencies of their authority under CEQA or CEQA Guidelines to disapprove of a project at any time prior to the initiation of full CEQA review. The terms \u201cinitial screening\u201d and \u201cquick disapproval\u201d are not defined for purposes of CEQA Guidelines section 15270, subdivision (b) (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14), and it can hardly be debated that disapproval <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>without certification of an EIR would in the normal course of events be \u201cquick\u201d in comparison to disapproval following the necessarily lengthy CEQA review process.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">ALR also points to Public Resources Code section 21061 as evidence that CEQA was intended to require preparation and consideration of an EIR prior to approval or disapproval of any project. Section 21061 provides, in relevant part, that an EIR is \u201can informational document which, <em>when its preparation is required by this division, </em>shall be considered by every public agency prior to its approval or disapproval of a project.\u201d (Italics added.) This provision is singularly unhelpful to ALR\u2019s cause since, on its face, it is limited to situations when an EIR is otherwise required by CEQA. We agree with respondents that Public Resources Code section 21061 merely addresses the possibility that once an agency proposes to carry out or approve a project, and thereafter prepares an EIR, it may conclude based on the information contained therein that disapproval is the wiser course of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Assuming the two provisions cited by ALR render ambiguous the otherwise plain, clear language of CEQA\u2019s project disapproval exemption (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21080, subd. (b)(5)), the legislative history of the exemption offers little support to ALR\u2019s limited construction of the statute. At ALR\u2019s request, the Legislative Intent Service has prepared a legislative history of Public Resources Code section 21080, subdivision (b)(5). As there is ample precedent for an appellate court\u2019s consideration of such documents (see <em>Commodore Home Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 211, 219 [185 Cal.Rptr. 270, 649 P.2d 912]; <em>Youngblood </em>v. <em>Gates </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1302, 1340 [246 Cal.Rptr. 775] [dis. opn. of George, J.]), we have granted ALR\u2019s request to take judicial notice of the documents furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">Section 21080, subdivision (b)(5) was added to the Public Resources Code as a part of Assembly Bill No. 884 (AB 884), first introduced on March 10, 1977. (Assem. Bill No. 884 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) \u00a7 2.) According to legislative documents cited in the Legislative Intent Service\u2019s summary, but not furnished by ALR, AB 884 was sponsored by the Governor\u2019s Office of Planning and Research to expedite the cumbersome, time-consuming procedures for processing applications for development permits and for the preparation and approval of environmental impact reports by state and local agencies. The Legislative Counsel\u2019s Digest confirms that the bill was intended to fill the vacuum of laws governing the review and approval by public agencies of development projects. Among other provisions, the bill established specified time limits for approval or disapproval of development projects by any public agency, and provided for automatic approval of proposed projects consequent to an agency\u2019s failure to timely act. (Legis. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number>Counsel\u2019s Dig., AB 884, 3 Stats. 1977 (Reg. Sess.) Summary Dig., p. 338. )</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Subdivision (b)(5) was not a part of Public Resources Code section 21080 as it was originally proposed. The subdivision was added to the bill by amendments in the Assembly on August 1, 1977. (See AB 884 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) \u00a7 2, as amended Aug. 1, 1977.) The wording of the subdivision was changed slightly by Senate amendment on August 31, 1977, and remained unchanged throughout the rest of the legislative process. (See AB 884 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) \u00a7 2, as amended Aug. 31, 1977.) Regarding the addition of subdivision (b)(5) of Public Resources Code section 21080, the Legislative Counsel\u2019s Digest offers the following explanatory statement: \u201cCertain types of projects and activities are exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act. [ft] This bill would also exempt projects which a public agency rejects or disapproves.\u201d (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., <em>supra, </em>at p.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">339. )</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">Legislative Counsel\u2019s unqualified description of the measure\u2019s impact tends to support the same construction of Public Resources Code section 21080, subdivision (b)(5) favored by the plain meaning rule, i.e., that <em>all </em>project disapprovals by a public agency are exempt from CEQA review. Such an interpretation also finds support in one of the legislative documents furnished by amici curiae. An enrolled bill report for AB 884 prepared by the Department of Finance, dated September 23, 1977, describes the impact of Public Resources Code section 21080, subdivision (b)(5) as exempting from the provisions of CEQA, without any qualification, \u201cprojects which a public agency proposes to reject or to disapprove.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In short, nothing in the legislative history of Public Resources Code section 21080, subdivision (b)(5) convinces us the Legislature either did not know or did not mean what it was saying when it declared project disapprovals exempt from the requirements of CEQA. <em>(Tracy </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 760, 764 [150 Cal.Rptr. 785, 587 P.2d 227].)</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">ALR cites several published judicial decisions in support of its contention that the State Board was obligated to prepare and consider an EIR before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1383\">*1383</page-number>disapproving its proposed WDR\u2019s for expanded use of the landfill. <em>(Wildlife Alive </em>v. <em>Chickering </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 190, 206 [132 Cal.Rptr. 377, 553 P.2d 537]; <em>International Longshoremen\u2019s &amp; Warehousemen\u2019s Union </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 265, 276 [171 Cal.Rptr. 875].) In the <em>Wildlife Alive </em>case, the setting of hunting and fishing seasons by the Fish and Game Commission was found not to be exempt from the requirements of CEQA. <em>(Wildlife Alive, supra, </em>at pp. 198-199.) In the <em>International Longshoremen\u2019s &amp; Warehousemen\u2019s Union </em>case, the Board of Supervisors of San Bernardino County was ordered to comply with CEQA before relaxing district emission standards for oxides of nitrogen for certain county facilities. (116 Cal.App.3d at p. 277.) In each case, however, preparation of an EIR was found necessary because there was the potential for a significant adverse environmental impact caused by affirmative governmental agency action altering the status quo. <em>(Wildlife Alive, supra, </em>at p. 206; <em>International Longshoremen\u2019s and Warehousemen\u2019s Union, supra, </em>at p. 276.) None of the cases cited by ALR required preparation of an EIR by a public agency prerequisite to project disapproval, or other action maintaining the status quo.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">ALR argues that the public policies underlying CEQA are best advanced by requiring an EIR in this case. Ergo, preparation of an EIR would; (1) ensure consideration of mitigation measures and evaluation of no-project and other feasible alternatives (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7\u00a7 21002, 21002.1; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 15126, subds. (c), (d)(2); <em>Citizens of Goleta Valley </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564 [276 Cal.Rptr. 410, 801 P.2d 1161]); (2) require resolution of public controversy and disagreements among experts (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 15064, subd. (h)(1) and (h)(2); <em>City of Carmel-by-the-Sea </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 229, 249 [227 Cal.Rptr. 899]); (3) ensure public participation in the decisionmaking process (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 15201; <em>Environmental Planning &amp; Information Council </em>v. <em>County of El Dorado </em>(1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 350, 354 [182 Cal.Rptr. 317]); and (4) facilitate public oversight of the actions of the State Board (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 15003, subd. (e); <em>Sundstrom </em>v. <em>County of Mendocino </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 296, 311 [248 Cal.Rptr. 352]).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">In making its various public policy arguments, ALR generally assumes that disapproval of the landfill expansion project will result in equally serious adverse environmental consequences, including highway degradation, traffic congestion, fuel consumption and air pollution, due to the rerouting of waste previously disposed of at ALR\u2019s landfill. Whether or not true, the same point could be made for many forms of government inaction. Yet the Legislature has determined for reasons of policy to exempt project disapprovals from environmental review under CEQA. Our state legislators <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1384\">*1384</page-number>evidently concluded that public agencies should not be forced to commit their resources to the costly and time-consuming environmental review process for proposed private development projects slated for rejection, whatever the reason for agency disapproval. This court does not sit in judgment of the Legislature\u2019s wisdom in balancing such competing public policies. <em>(Napa Valley Wine Train, Inc. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Com. </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 370, 376 [267 Cal.Rptr. 569, 787 P.2d 976].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">ALR contends that the State Board\u2019s action deprived it of a fair and impartial hearing and the opportunity to present evidence for the agency\u2019s consideration. This argument is belied by an administrative record memorializing years of scrutiny by the Regional and State Boards of revised WDR\u2019s for expansion of ALR\u2019s nonhazardous solid waste landfill. ALR is free to challenge the State Board\u2019s exercise of discretion under the standards of the Porter-Cologne Act, and is apparently doing so in another action currently pending in the superior court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, the legality of the State Board\u2019s action under Porter-Cologne is beyond the scope of the issues raised by the motion for supplemental writ of mandate from which the instant appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the superior court denying ALR\u2019s motion for a supplemental writ of mandate is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">Gates, Acting P.

Code, \u00a7 13000 et seq.) established a coordinated statewide program of water quality control overseen by the State Board and administered by nine regional boards. Under the Porter-Cologne Act, the regional boards are required to formulate water quality control plans for California\u2019s numerous water basins, subject to approval by the State Board. Any person or entity discharging or proposing to discharge waste which could affect water quality must file a report with the appropriate regional board. (Wat. Code, \u00a7 13260.) The regional board may then prescribe WDR\u2019s consistent with water quality objectives. (Wat. Code, \u00a7 13263; <em>City of Sacramento </em>v. <em>State Water Resources Control Bd. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 960, 964 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 643].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b896-9\"><em>A </em>\u201cleachate\u201d is \u201cany liquid fluid, formed by the drainage of liquids from waste or by the percolation or flow of liquid through waste.

(Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 40060.) It is undisputed that the ALR landfill sits on a sand and gravel quarry, which renders the site particularly inappropriate for waste disposal. Amici curiae (Association of California Water Agencies, San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, Three Valleys Municipal Water District, Municipal Water District of Orange County, Natural Resources Defense Council and Miller Brewing Company) have argued, inter alia, that the judgment of the superior court should be upheld on the ground that expansion of ALR\u2019s landfill operations would violate Public Resources Code section 40060.
