Shell\u2019s main contentions involve interpreting standard comprehensive or commercial general liability (CGL) insurance language and California\u2019s statutory bar against insuring \u201cwilful\u201d acts. Shell challenges numerous rulings made during a long and complex trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">In 1952, Shell assumed a lease of part of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal (Arsenal), a United States Army (Army) complex in Colorado. At the Arsenal Shell manufactured chemicals and pesticides and disposed of its wastes using Army facilities. Over the years, toxic wastes from both Shell and the Army contaminated soil and groundwater. The cost to remedy this pollution has been estimated at $1.8 billion. In December 1983, the United States and the State of Colorado (Colorado) sued Shell for remediation costs and environmental damage. Shell and the United States eventually agreed on Shell\u2019s share of the Arsenal\u2019s cleanup costs. Shell\u2019s liability for pollution at the Arsenal could reach hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Shell maintained a primary layer of liability insurance and multiple layers of excess coverage. During its years at the Arsenal, the company bought approximately 800 CGL policies. Travelers Indemnity Company (Travelers) was Shell\u2019s primary CGL insurer for property damage liability until 1975, when Aetna Casualty and Surety Company (Aetna) and then Insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Company of North America (INA) issued Shell\u2019s primary coverage. A battery of insurers provided excess coverage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">Shell identified six distinct causes of pollution at the Arsenal. Shell asserts each cause was an \u201coccurrence\u201d covered by its insurers, except Oil Insurance Limited (OIL), an insurer Shell owned with other oil industry members. For many reasons, the insurers denied any obligation to indemnify Shell for the Arsenal pollution. Principally, the insurers contend that Shell knew or should have known that its Arsenal operations created a substantial probability of environmental damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">In phase I of the trial, the court interpreted the relevant policy provisions. In phase II, a jury heard extensive testimony on the Arsenal pollution and was instructed on the policy term meanings determined in phase I. The jury found against Shell; the judgment denied any coverage for the Arsenal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">On appeal, Shell attributes error to several elements of the phase I interpretations and the jury instructions. Foremost among Shell\u2019s issues are: (1) the rules the trial court used to interpret the insurance policies; (2) the scope of Insurance Code section 533;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (3) whether \u201cexpected,\u201d as used in the policies and exclusions, implies an objective, reasonable person standard or a subjective test that examines the insured\u2019s state of mind; (4) whether \u201csudden\u201d means only \u201cunexpected\u201d or instead refers to events that are abrupt; (5) whether exclusions for property in Shell\u2019s care, custody, or control were properly submitted to the jury; and (6) whether the insurers\u2019 defense that Shell did not give timely notice of the Arsenal claims should have gone to the jury. Travelers also appeals, contending that OIL must contribute to the nearly $17 million Travelers advanced for Shell\u2019s defense against the United States and Colorado.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">We conclude that two of Shell\u2019s arguments have merit. The insurers did not show substantial actual prejudice caused by untimely notice from Shell, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>but sending this defense to the jury was harmless error. More importantly, we hold that the jury was given a mistaken definition of \u201cexpect\u201d that turned not on what Shell knew, but on what Shell should have known. This error requires that we reverse the judgment in part and remand the case. However, certain policies contained pollution exclusions that preclude coverage of the Arsenal claims. Therefore, we affirm the judgment as to those policies. We also affirm denial of Travelers\u2019 contribution claim because OIL was an excess insurer and the primary insurance was not exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">1. <em>The Arsenal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The Arsenal covers roughly 28 square miles near Denver, Colorado. It was created in 1942 to produce chemical munitions for the Army, including nerve gas, blistering agents, and incendiary devices. The Arsenal was built in six months, using whatever was available to accommodate wartime exigencies. After the war, the Army used the Arsenal to produce, store, and demilitarize chemical warfare agents, but part of the manufacturing capacity became surplus.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The Army offered to lease the Arsenal\u2019s surplus chemical manufacturing plants and equipment. In 1947, the Julius Hyman Company (Hyman) leased part of the Arsenal to manufacture chemical pesticides in the same equipment the Army had used to make chemical weapons. The lease payments covered disposal of manufacturing wastes in the Army\u2019s waste facilities on the Arsenal.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Shell purchased Hyman in May 1952 and merged it into Shell Chemical Company about two years later. With the purchase, Shell assumed the Arsenal lease and hired almost all of Hyman\u2019s employees. Shell used the Arsenal to manufacture agricultural chemicals, such as pesticides and herbicides, and some chemical products for the Army. Shell\u2019s Arsenal operations necessarily generated a stream of toxic wastes. Shell operated its Arsenal facilities 24 hours a day, every day, for years.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">2. <em>The Arsenal Waste System</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">The Arsenal\u2019s effluent wastes drained into large, shallow evaporation basins. A chemical sewer system installed for the Army Corps of Engineers in the early 1940\u2019s carried the wastes to the basins. Shell used the Army\u2019s effluent waste disposal system until 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">The first evaporation basin, Basin A, was built in 1943 by scraping soil from a natural depression. Nothing covered the basin bottom to make it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>impervious to liquids. The wastes sent to the basin were expected to evaporate or seep into the ground and bind with the soil, clay, and gravel underlying the basin. Water and salt made up the greatest portion of the waste sent to the basin.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">Basin A started overflowing as the waste volume increased. To catch the overflow, a series of smaller evaporation basins, Basins C, D, and E, were built in the early 1950\u2019s. These basins were made the same way as Basin A, and relied on the same processes to handle the waste effluent. Basin C, though, was so porous that it was called \u201cstraw bottom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">In the mid-1950\u2019s, complaints of crop damage and salt contamination on farms northwest of the Arsenal led to the construction of Basin F. This basin covered 93 acres and was approximately 10 feet deep. It had a three-eighths-inch-thick asphalt liner to prevent waste effluent from seeping into the groundwater. Shell\u2019s effluent wastes were sent to Basin F from 1956 until 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Wastes that Shell could not put in the chemical sewer it put in drums for disposal in shallow earthen trenches. The trenches were 300 feet long, 20 feet wide, and 10 feet deep. Shell dumped drums of contaminated materials, solid wastes, and sludges into the trenches, or poured in heated, tar-like wastes from a tank truck. When the trenches were nearly full, fuel oil was poured over them and ignited to decontaminate the chemical wastes through incineration. The trenches were then covered with a layer of soil. When air pollution problems halted open trench burnings, Shell stockpiled these wastes in thousands of covered and uncovered drums near the trenches.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">3. <em>Pollution Problems at the Arsenal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Shell\u2019s leasehold included three freshwater lakes near its Arsenal plants. Water to cool the chemical manufacturing equipment was drawn from and returned to the lakes. Wildlife began to die at these lakes the first year Hyman operated at the Arsenal. In 1950, Dr. Hyman himself detected his company\u2019s pesticides in the pipe that returned water to the lakes. Ducks died at the lakes until the mid-1960\u2019s; 1,200 ducks were reported killed in the spring of 1952 alone. In 1956, tests found Shell\u2019s pesticides in tissue samples from waterfowl killed at the lakes; tests in the mid-1960\u2019s found the pesticides in snails and vegetation from the lakes. The lakes were drained, and contaminated mud was scraped from their bottoms and dumped on the ground nearby. The cooling water system was changed so that used water was not returned to the lakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">In 1954, Shell was told that crops on a farm northwest of the Arsenal showed signs of chemical damage after irrigation with well water. It soon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>became clear that water flowing underground from the Arsenal was the most likely cause of the problem, though well water tests found only high salt levels and did not detect the Shell chemicals. After Basin F was built, the unlined basins were not used for effluent disposal, though they were used for storm water collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">By the mid-1960\u2019s, the Army was concerned about the high levels of toxic materials in Basin F and the environmental hazard of their exposed surface storage. The Army told Shell that alternatives to Basin F had to be developed. Throughout the early 1970\u2019s, Shell maintained that evaporation basins could be used safely and were the most economical means of disposal. Army studies in the late 1960\u2019s suggested that Basin F\u2019s liner was deteriorating, though nearby test wells did not establish that the basin was leaking into the groundwater. In May 1970, the Army told Shell that Army engineers had concluded that the chemical mix in Basin F caused the liner to deteriorate and that they assumed the basin\u2019s contents were oozing into the aquifer. The Army told Shell that use of Basin F had to end, and that Shell would have to pay a substantial portion of the costs of new waste facilities and aquifer contamination claims. However, Basin F was used for Shell\u2019s wastes until 1978, and the Army continued to use the basin until 1981 or 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">In 1975, after Shell and Army chemicals were discovered in water sources north of the Arsenal, the Colorado Department of Health ordered that the Army and Shell \u201cimmediately take whatever steps are necessary to clean up all sources\u201d of the chemicals. In meetings with Shell to discuss the response to the cease and desist orders, the Army proposed a 17-year, $345 million environmental restoration plan for the Arsenal. Soon after, the Army asked Shell to participate in the cost of cleaning up the Arsenal. Shell took the position that groundwater contamination was the Army\u2019s responsibility because waste disposal was the Army\u2019s obligation under Shell\u2019s Arsenal lease and related agreements. In 1978, the Army asked Shell to contribute to a $50 million program to clean up Basin F; Shell again asserted that it had no such responsibility. Shell did not notify its insurance carriers of these matters at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">In 1980, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 et seq.), which created categories of responsible parties who would be liable for environmental damage and the costs of cleaning hazardous waste sites (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607). (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>(D.Colo. 1985) 605 F.Supp. 1064, 1068.) In October 1981, Shell learned that the Army intended to hold Shell liable for cleanup costs at the Arsenal. Between January 1982 and June 1983, Shell sent a series of notices to inform its insurers of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>potential liability for the Army\u2019s claims. The last notice asked the insurers for their position on Shell\u2019s insurance coverage for those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">In December 1983, the United States and Colorado filed environmental damage lawsuits against Shell in the United States District Court in Denver, Colorado. The United States\u2019 suit alleged that the environmental damage and pollution cleanup costs at the Arsenal amounted to $1.8 billion. In June 1988, the United States and Shell signed a consent decree to settle the federal claims. Under this decree, Shell\u2019s liability for cleanup costs is open-ended, with Shell being responsible for 50 percent of the first $500 million, 35 percent of the next $200 million, and 20 percent of any amount over $700 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">4. <em>Shell\u2019s Insurers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Shell\u2019s size and diversity required a commensurate insurance program, which was directed by skilled professionals in Shell\u2019s insurance department, assisted by large and experienced insurance brokers. Shell bought CGL insurance from hundreds of insurers and Lloyd\u2019s of London underwriters. Insurance on this scale is purchased in layers, with the first layer of insurance referred to as primary coverage. Additional policies, referred to as excess coverage, have liability limits greater than the primary coverage and can be bought in layers. When the size of a claim exceeds the limits of liability assumed by the insurers at a given layer of coverage, the next higher coverage layer also will respond to the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Shell\u2019s primary coverage was provided by Travelers (1948-1975), Aetna (1975-1978), and INA (1978-1983). Primary CGL coverage typically includes an agreement by the insurer to defend claims against the insured until the primary coverage\u2019s limits of liability are exhausted. Shell\u2019s insurance program employed up to nine layers of excess coverage, often with several insurers participating in the same layer of coverage at the same time. Frequently, insurance policies issued for excess layers will \u201cfollow form,\u201d i.e., conform with the standardized language used by policies in lower layers. Following form gives the insured more uniform coverage and facilitates spreading risks among insurers. Most of Shell\u2019s policies followed form, so certain provisions and phrases recurred throughout Shell\u2019s policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">5. <em>The Trial Court Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">In October 1983, shortly before the United States\u2019 suit was filed, Shell filed this declaratory relief action against insurers which sold CGL coverage to Shell from 1940 to 1983. Shell\u2019s suit involved the meaning and applicability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>of approximately 800 insurance policies. One liability insurer Shell did not sue was OIL, which other insurers made a party by cross-complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Shell sought defense and indemnification by the insurers for the claims concerning the Arsenal and another toxic waste disposal site in Fullerton, California, known as the McColl site. The Arsenal coverage disputes involve the 1952 through 1982 policy years.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The parties agreed to trial in phases. The phase I court trial began on November 4, 1987, and resolved the interpretation of the policies\u2019 terms. The phase I statement of decision became the foundation for jury instructions in phase II.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The phase II jury trial began on August 30, 1988. In that phase, the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the policy provisions was applied to the facts of the Arsenal claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For Shell\u2019s coverage claims and the insurers\u2019 defenses, the parties presented extensive evidence on the Arsenal\u2019s history and pollution. The jury received the 86 pages of instructions both by videotape and a written copy. The court gave the jury a general verdict form that required the jury to decide, for each of the 31 years involved, whether Shell had any coverage for pollution damage at the Arsenal.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">After 60 days of trial, and nearly 6 days of deliberations, the jury returned its verdict against Shell for all 31 years. The final judgment declaring that Shell had no coverage for the Arsenal claims was entered on January 27, 1989; Shell\u2019s motions for a new trial and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict were denied on March 23, 1989. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">1. <em>Rules for Interpreting Insurance Contracts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">Shell contends the trial court used a \u201crenegade interpretative system\u201d to construe the insurance contracts. This contention has no merit for the substantive issues Shell raises on appeal. The trial court\u2019s method for interpreting the pertinent insurance contract provisions was substantially consistent with the rules later endorsed in <em>AIU Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 807 [274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253] (hereafter <em>AIU).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">The analysis in <em>AIU </em>began with the fundamental rule that interpretation of an insurance contract, like any contract, is governed by the mutual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>intent of the parties at the time they form the contract. <em>(AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at pp. 821-822.) The parties\u2019 intent is found, if possible, solely in the contract\u2019s written provisions. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 822.) \u201cThe \u2018clear and explicit\u2019 meaning of these provisions, interpreted in their \u2018ordinary and popular sense,\u2019 unless \u2018used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage\u2019 [citation], controls judicial interpretation. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, if a layperson would give the contract language an unambiguous meaning, we apply that meaning. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Only these basic principles are needed to interpret contract language that is clear and unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">The rules for recognizing ambiguity are also straightforward. Ambiguity exists when an insurance policy provision is susceptible to two or more constructions that are reasonable and not based on strained interpretations. <em>(Producers Dairy Delivery Co. </em>v. <em>Sentry Ins. Co. </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 903, 912 [226 Cal.Rptr. 558, 718 P.2d 920].) Contract language interpretation involves considering the whole instrument and the circumstances of the case; ambiguity is not an abstract question. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 916, fn. 7.) \u201cA word generally has several meanings, even in the dictionary. You have to consider the sentence in which it stands to decide which of those meanings it bears in the particular case, and very likely will see that it there has a shade of significance more refined than any given in the wordbook.\u201d (Holmes, <em>The Theory of Legal Interpretation </em>(1899) 12 Harv.L.Rev. 417.)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">When particular policy language is ambiguous, it is interpreted in the sense the insurer believed the insured understood it at the time of formation. <em>(AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 822.) If that principle cannot remove an ambiguity, as when there is no basis for a belief that the insured understood a term in a specific sense, then the ambiguity is construed against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 822-823; Civ. Code, \u00a7 1654.)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Because insurance policy language usually is the insurer\u2019s, with no meaningful opportunity for insureds to bargain for modifications, courts normally resolve policy ambiguities in favor of finding coverage. <em>(AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 822.)  For the same reasons, courts generally interpret coverage clauses broadly and interpret exclusions narrowly to protect the insured\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Different rules apply when the insured \u201cdoes not suffer from lack of legal sophistication or a relative lack of bargaining power, and where it is clear that an insurance policy was actually negotiated and jointly drafted . . . .\u201d <em>(AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 823; see <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 426, 438 [204 Cal.Rptr. 435, 682 P.2d 1100].) Under such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>circumstances, ambiguities are not necessarily construed in favor of coverage. <em>(AIU, supra, </em>at p. 823; <em>Garcia, supra, </em>at p. 438.) However, this departure from the norm requires evidence that the provision in question was jointly drafted; merely showing that policy terms were negotiated, and that the insured had legal sophistication and substantial relative bargaining power, is not enough. <em>(AIU, supra, </em>at p. 823; <em>Garcia, supra, </em>at p. 438.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">In <em>AIU, </em>the insured was a large corporation with both substantial bargaining power and legal sophistication. <em>(AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 823.) The corporation\u2019s subsidiary drafted CGL policies identical to those involved in that case. <em>(Ibid.) </em>There was evidence that the policies were written on a line-by-line basis through continuing negotiation with the insurer. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 823, fn. 9.) Nevertheless, the court held the insurers responsible for the ambiguities in that case because there was no evidence those particular ambiguous provisions were actually negotiated and jointly drafted. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 823-824.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The court said that policy terms would be construed in the broad sense understood by laypersons absent evidence that the parties intended narrower technical meanings and crafted policy language specially for that purpose. <em>(AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 823.) In <em>AIU, </em>the policy terms in question were taken verbatim from standard CGL policies used by the insurance industry. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 815, 823-824, fn. 9 and accompanying text.) Further, there was no evidence the insurer had cause to believe the insured originally understood the policy language in any technical or restrictive manner. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 823; see Civ. Code, \u00a7 1649.) Therefore, the court construed the ambiguities in favor of coverage. <em>(AIU, supra, </em>at p. 823.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">In all respects material to this appeal, the trial court employed the insurance interpretation rules the Supreme Court endorsed in <em>AIU. </em>The trial court tried to determine the parties\u2019 mutual intent at the time the contracts were formed and used the contracts\u2019 language as the primary evidence of that intent. The trial court applied its understanding of the ordinary and popular meanings of the words used in the contracts. It used specialized meanings only when evidence showed a word was intended in a technical sense or was subject to a particular trade usage.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Shell argues the trial court failed to construe ambiguities against the insurers and improperly applied the \u201csophisticated insured\u201d exception to standardized language common to many CGL policies. Whatever merit this argument may have for other interpretative rulings, it has none for the issues Shell raises on appeal. Each policy interpretation Shell contends was error was decided on unambiguous language or, in one instance, on a plain and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>ordinary meaning that conformed to the parties\u2019 understanding and intention. As we discuss in the following sections, none of the interpretative issues raised by Shell require us to construe an ambiguity against the insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">2. <em>Section 533 and \u201cWilful\u201d Acts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Section 533 states: \u201cAn insurer is not liable for a loss caused by the <em>wilful act </em>of the insured; but [the insurer] is not exonerated by the negligence of the insured, or of the insured\u2019s agents or others.\u201d (\u00a7 533, italics added.) The trial court instructed the jury that under all of Shell\u2019s policies, property damage must be neither expected nor intended. Before 1975, Shell\u2019s primary policies did not explicitly require that property damage be unintended and unexpected; nor did the primary policies contain an intentional acts exclusion before 1966. Thus, Shell claims the instructions improperly subjected all policies to an exclusion expressly stated only in later policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Shell takes the position that section 533 provides the controlling concept of fortuity for all of Shell\u2019s policies and the only exclusion for intentionally caused damage under the policies issued before 1966. Shell contends it must be indemnified for property damage liability, regardless of whether the damage was caused negligently or recklessly, unless it subjectively intended to cause the damage or intentionally committed a wrongful, inherently harmful act. (Citing <em>J. C. Penney Casualty Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>M. K. </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 1009 [278 Cal.Rptr. 64, 804 P.2d 689] [hereafter <em>Penney].)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The narrow question <em>Penney </em>decided was that, as a matter of law, section 533 excludes liability coverage for sexual molestation of a child without proof that the insured subjectively intended harm, because molesting a child is always intentional, wrongful, and harmful. <em>(Penney, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at pp. 1025, 1028.) In reaching this holding, the court discussed the public policy and legislative intent evinced by section 533 <em>(Penney, supra, </em>at pp. 1020-1025) and clarified an earlier decision that appeared to require proof of a \u201c \u2018preconceived design to inflict injury.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1021.)</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Section 533 is an implied exclusionary clause in every insurance contract. <em>(Penney, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 1019; <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Pacific Indemnity Co. </em>(1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 537, 540 [122 Cal.Rptr. 680].) The statute reflects a fundamental public policy of denying coverage for willful wrongs and discouraging willful torts. <em>(Penney, supra, </em>at pp. 1019-1021, fn. 8 and accompanying text.) As a statutory exclusion, section 533 is not subject to the rule of strict construction against an insurer; instead, we construe it according to the Legislature\u2019s intent, for which we refer first to the words of the statute. <em>(Penney, supra, </em>at p. 1020, fn. 9 and accompanying text.)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>The first clause of section 533 precludes indemnity for a \u201cwilful act,\u201d while the second clause qualifies the first by effectively eliminating \u201cnegligence\u201d from the concept of \u201cwilful act.\u201d (\u00a7 533.) This language has remained unchanged since 1873. <em>(Evans </em>v. <em>Pacific Indemnity Co., supra, </em>49 Cal.App.3d at p. 541.) The Supreme Court discussed the origins of the section\u2019s language in <em>McKenzie </em>v. <em>Scottish U. &amp; N. Ins. Co. </em>(1896) 112 Cal. 548 [44 P. 922]. The court noted that insurers traditionally were liable for their insureds\u2019 ordinary negligence, but that other forms of negligence could release the insurer. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 557.) The court said: \u201cTo set at rest questions involving the different degrees of negligence, ... we may reasonably suppose was the object of the framers ....[][] Under section [533] the nice distinctions often made necessary are dispensed with, and the general proposition is established that no form of negligence . . . avoids the policy, unless it amounts to a willful act on the part of the insured.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 557-558, discussing Civ. Code, former \u00a7 2629, which became \u00a7 533.)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Thus, a \u201cwilful act\u201d under section 533 means something more than intentionally doing an act constituting ordinary negligence. <em>(Penney, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 1021.) Under <em>McKenzie, </em>no form of negligence amounting to less than section 533\u2019s \u201cwilful act\u201d precludes coverage. <em>(Penney, supra, </em>at p. 1021.) \u201cIn short, section 533 does not preclude coverage for acts that are negligent or reckless.\u201d <em>(Penney, supra, </em>at p. 1021.) However, excluding negligence and recklessness does not alone establish the meaning of \u201cwilful act\u201d under section 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Before the decision in <em>Penney, </em>some courts interpreted <em>Clemmer </em>v. <em>Hartford Insurance Co. </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 865, 886-887 [151 Cal.Rptr. 285, 587 P.2d 1098], as meaning that section 533 does not bar coverage for acts that are intentional or willful under traditional tort principles unless the acts are done with a preconceived design to injure. (See, e.g., <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Eddy </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 958, 969 [267 Cal.Rptr. 379]; <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Overton </em>(1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 843, 849 [206 Cal.Rptr. 823].) However, <em>Penney </em>explained that when properly understood, <em>Clemmer </em>and the cases on which it relied do not support the view that coverage is barred only when the insured acted with a subjective intent to injure. <em>(Penney, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at pp. 1021-1025; <em>Fire Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Altieri </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1352, 1358 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 360].) The existence of a preconceived design to injure is relevant only when mental capacity is an issue or the insured\u2019s intent or motive might justify an otherwise wrongful act. <em>(Penney, supra, </em>at pp. 1021-1025; <em>B &amp; E Convalescent Center </em>v. <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 78, 96-97 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 894]; <em>Fire Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>at p. 1358.) Thus, section 533 precludes indemnification, whether or not the insured subjectively intended harm, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>insured seeks coverage for an intentional, wrongful act that is inherently and necessarily harmful. <em>(Penney, supra, </em>at p. 1025.) Although <em>Penney </em>established that sexual molestation of a child is a \u201cwilful act\u201d under section 533, the decision does not resolve our question: is any state of mind other than a subjective intent to injure so culpable as to render deliberate actions uninsurable?</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">We are guided by the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of similar language in the Labor and Insurance Codes concerning workers\u2019 compensation awards. Labor Code section 4553 grants additional compensation to an employee injured by an employer\u2019s \u201cserious and willful misconduct. . . .\u201d Likewise, section 11661 prohibits indemnification for the additional compensation recoverable for \u201cserious and willful misconduct. . . .\u201d All three statutes express the same public policy and would refer to the same conduct except that section 533 does not apply to workers\u2019 compensation insurance. <em>(Azevedo </em>v. <em>Abel </em>(1968) 264 Cal.App.2d 451, 458 [70 Cal.Rptr. 710].)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In <em>Mercer-Fraser Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 102 [251 P.2d 955], the Supreme Court examined the Legislature\u2019s intent in using the phrase \u201cserious and willful misconduct\u201d in Labor Code section 4553. <em>(Mercer-Fraser, supra, </em>at p. 116.) The court reviewed common law and statutory interpretations of \u201cwillful misconduct,\u201d \u201cwillful and wanton negligence,\u201d \u201cwanton and reckless misconduct,\u201d and \u201cgross negligence.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 116-120, internal quotation marks omitted.) It concluded that \u201cserious and wilful misconduct is basically the antithesis of negligence, and that the two types of behavior are mutually exclusive; an act which is merely negligent and consequently devoid of either an intention to do harm or of knowledge or appreciation of the fact that danger is likely to result therefrom cannot at the same time constitute wilful misconduct; conversely an act deliberately done for the express purpose of injuring another, or intentionally performed either with knowledge that serious injury is a probable result or with a positive, active, wanton, reckless and absolute disregard of its possibly damaging consequences, cannot properly be classed as the less culpable conduct which is termed negligence. It follows that a finding of serious and wilful misconduct cannot be sustained upon proof of mere negligence of any degree.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 120.)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Defined in these terms, \u201cserious and willful misconduct\u201d meets the requirement that a \u201cwilful act\u201d under section 533 cannot be any form of negligence. (See <em>McKenzie </em>v. <em>Scottish U. &amp; N. Ins. Co., supra, </em>112 Cal. at p. 558.) Logically and semantically, there is no reason to suppose that \u201cserious and willful misconduct\u201d connotes a less culpable state of mind than \u201cwilful act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>Nevertheless, it is now clear that section 533 does not prohibit coverage for reckless conduct. <em>(Penney, supra, 52 </em>Cal.3d at p. 1021.) Also, the Supreme Court has said in dictum that some forms of conduct amounting to a conscious disregard of others\u2019 safety might not constitute an uninsurable \u201cwilful act\u201d under section 533. (See <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 147, 158-159 [181 Cal.Rptr. 784, 642 P.2d 1305].) As a practical matter, the distinction between reckless conduct and \u201cpositive, active, wanton, reckless and absolute disregard of [an act\u2019s] possibly damaging consequences\u201d (Merc<em>er-Fraser Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>40 Cal.2d at p. 120) is too fine to be significant. (See Prosser &amp; Keeton, The Law of Torts (5th ed. 1984) \u00a7 34, pp. 212-214.) After removing any connotation of recklessness, a \u201cwilful act\u201d under section 533 must mean an act deliberately done for the express purpose of causing damage or intentionally performed with knowledge that damage is highly probable or substantially certain to result. (Cf. <em>Hawaiian Pineapple Co. </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 656, 662-663 [255 P.2d 431] [regarding Lab. Code, \u00a7 4553]; <em>Mercer-Fraser Co., supra, </em>at pp. 115-118.) As we discuss in the next section of this opinion, that degree of foreknowledge or belief that a result will occur means the result is expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">This approach is supported by the Restatement Second of Torts\u2019 definition of \u201cintent\u201d and distinction between \u201cintentional misconduct\u201d and \u201crecklessness.\u201d The Restatement uses \u201cintent\u201d to denote that an act\u2019s consequences are desired or believed to be substantially certain to result. (Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 8A.) \u201cAs the probability that the consequences will follow decreases, and becomes less than substantial certainty, the actor\u2019s conduct loses the character of intent, and becomes mere recklessness . . . .\u201d (Rest.2d Torts, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 8A, com. b.) Recklessness, in the Restatement\u2019s view, does not necessarily require actual foreknowledge of the harmful consequences of particular acts; it is enough that a reasonable person would have recognized the aggravated risk. (Rest.2d Torts, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 500, com. a.) A merely reckless person lacks subjective awareness of the near certainty of harm. \u201cWhile an act to be reckless must be intended by the actor, the actor does not intend to cause the harm which results from it. It is enough that he realizes or, from facts which he knows, should realize that there is a strong probability that harm may result, <em>even though he hopes or even expects that his conduct will prove </em>harmless.\u201d (Rest.2d Torts, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 500, com. f, italics added.) Where the actor knows that the harmful consequences are substantially certain to result, and proceeds with the act anyway, the law treats the actor as if the result was desired. (Rest.2d Torts, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 8A, com. b.)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">We conclude that section 533 prohibits indemnification of more than just intentional acts that are subjectively desired to cause harm and acts that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>intentional, wrongful, and necessarily harmful regardless of subjective intent. A \u201cwilful act\u201d under section 533 must also include a deliberate, liability-producing act that the individual, before acting, expected to cause harm. Conduct for which the law imposes liability, and which is expected or intended to result in damage, must be considered wrongful and willful. Therefore, section 533 precludes indemnification for liability arising from deliberate conduct that the insured expected or intended to cause damage. Accordingly, the trial court did not err by instructing the jury that for a liability policy to cover property damage, the insured must neither expect nor intend the damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">3. <em>The Plain Meaning of \u201cExpected or Intended\u2019\u2019</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The central issue in this appeal is the meaning of the word \u201cexpect\u201d as used in policy language that bars coverage for damage that is \u201cexpected or intended.\u201d Our conclusion on section 533\u2019s prohibitions emphasizes the importance of a proper and consistent interpretation of \u201cexpect.\u201d Shell and amicus curiae Aerojet-General Corporation (Aerojet) assert that \u201cexpect\u201d requires a subjective standard that looks to the insured\u2019s actual knowledge and state of mind. The insurers argue that \u201cexpect\u201d imposes an objective standard that depends on the knowledge and state of mind a similarly situated reasonable person would possess. In support of their position, the insurers cite numerous authorities from other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The trial court accepted the insurers\u2019 argument. Jury instruction No. 42 said, in part: \u201c. . . Injury is intended and expected (and hence, there is no coverage) if Shell possessed the intent to damage the property of another, or if Shell intentionally committed an act wherein it should have reasonably been known by Shell that there was a high degree of certainty that damage to the property of another would result from that act. ...\u201d Jury instruction No. 43 said, in part: \u201c \u2018Expected\u2019 is defined as \u2018to look forward to the probable occurrence or appearance of; to consider likely or certain; to consider reasonable or due.\u2019 As contained in the occurrence definitions and in the pollution exclusions, the exclusionary word \u2018expected\u2019 denotes that the actor knew or should have known that there was a substantial probability that certain consequences would result from his or her acts or omissions. \u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b509-18\">The leading case for this objective view of \u201cexpected\u201d is <em>City of Carter Lake </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. and Sur. </em>(8th Cir. 1979) 604 F.2d 1052. That court rejected an insurer\u2019s argument that a result is expected when it is just reasonably foreseeable. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1058.) The court said an insured reasonably expects a CGL policy to cover some negligent acts, but it does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>follow that all negligent acts must be covered. <em>{Ibid.) </em>The court then stated: \u201cFor the purposes of an exclusionary clause in an insurance policy the word \u2018expected\u2019 denotes that the actor knew or should have known that there was a substantial probability' that certain consequences will result from his actions. If the insured knew or should have known that there was a substantial probability that certain results would follow his acts or omissions then there has not been an occurrence or accident as defined in this type of policy when such results actually come to pass.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1058-1059.) Footnote 4 explained: \u201cThe difference between \u2018reasonably foreseeable\u2019 and \u2018substantial probability\u2019 is the degree of expectability. . . . The indications must be strong enough to alert a reasonably prudent man not only to the possibility of the results occurring but the indications also must be sufficient to forewarn him that the results are highly likely to occur.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1059, fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><em>City of Carter Lake </em>offered no reason or authority for injecting the objective \u201cshould have known\u201d test into a definition of \u201cexpected.\u201d Likewise, several courts have adopted the same or a similar interpretation without discussing their rationale for an objective test. (See, e.g., <em>Auto-Owners Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Jensen </em>(8th Cir. 1981) 667 F.2d 714, 719-720 [interpreting Minn, law]; <em>American Mut. Liability Ins. </em>v. <em>Neville Chemical </em>(W.D.Pa. 1987) 650 F.Supp. 929, 932; <em>Weber </em>v. <em>IMT Ins. Co. </em>(Iowa 1990) 462 N.W.2d 283, 287-289; <em>Summit Assoc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. </em>(1988) 229 N.J.Super. 56 [550 A.2d 1235, 1239].)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Some courts adopted an objective test out of concern that a subjective test gives insureds too much of an advantage in coverage disputes. As one court explained: \u201cProbing one\u2019s state of mind is an elusive task at best. Supplanting an objective standard with a subjective standard for determining whether the act or conduct of an insured is \u2018intentional\u2019 or \u2018expected or intended\u2019 for purposes of assessing coverage would emasculate apposite policy provisions by making it impossible to preclude coverage for intentional acts or conduct absent admissions by insureds of a specific intent to harm or injure. Human nature augers against any viable expectation of such admissions.\u201d <em>(Truck Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Pickering </em>(Mo.Ct.App. 1982) 642 S.W.2d 113, 116; see also <em>Western Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Waisanen </em>(D.S.D. 1987) 653 F.Supp. 825, 830 [\u201c[C]ourts have been reluctant to adopt a totally subjective test which would place complete control of the coverage question in the hands of the insured.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">We believe these concerns are misplaced. Intent and knowledge can be proved without an insured\u2019s admission; circumstantial evidence can establish them in civil cases as surely as in criminal prosecutions. (See 1 Witkin, Cal. Evidence (3d ed. 1986) Circumstantial Evidence, \u00a7\u00a7 401-402, 408, pp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>374-376, 381-382.) Claims of ignorance are unlikely to succeed when circumstantial evidence shows the insured expected damage or avoided confirming such a belief in hopes of denying awareness of the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">The other rationale offered for an objective test is an attempt to differentiate the concepts of \u201cintend\u201d and \u201cexpect.\u201d One court stated: \u201c[N]o damage is done to plain English or to the reasonable expectations of the insured to find there is a difference between \u2018expect\u2019 and \u2018intend\u2019 and to find this difference is simply a difference in the degree of probability. \u2018Intend\u2019 means the insured desires to cause the consequences of his act or believes the consequences are substantially certain to result. \u2018Expect\u2019 means the insured realized or should have realized there was a strong probability the consequences in question would result from his acts. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Farm Bureau Town &amp; Country Ins. </em>v. <em>Tumbo </em>(Mo.Ct.App. 1987) 740 S.W.2d 232, 236; see also <em>Steelman </em>v. <em>Holford </em>(Mo.Ct.App. 1989) 765 S.W.2d 372, 377.)</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">However, this extended definition of \u201cexpect\u201d comes about only if \u201cintend\u201d is given the specialized meaning used in the law, as the court did in <em>Farm Bureau. </em>When \u201cintend\u201d is used in tort law, it acquires an extra meaning indistinguishable from a layperson\u2019s sense of \u201cexpect.\u201d (See Rest.2d Torts, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 8A.) If \u201cintend\u201d is given its ordinary meaning of \u201c[t]o have in mind some purpose or design\u201d (American Heritage Dict. (1981) p. 682, col. 2), then \u201cexpect\u201d can have its ordinary meaning, which does not include \u201cintend\u2019s\u201d sense of results desired, purposefully sought, or brought about by design.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">More recent CGL policies use \u201cexpect\u201d in a context that makes applying an objective, \u201cshould have known\u201d standard awkward. Policies that base coverage on an \u201coccurrence\u201d commonly define the term as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended <em>from the standpoint of the </em>insured.\u201d (Italics added.) The insurance industry apparently adopted the phrase, \u201cfrom the standpoint of the insured,\u201d to clarify that whether an event is an \u201caccident\u201d is evaluated from the insured\u2019s perspective, not the injured victim\u2019s, as some courts had decided. <em>(Patrons-Oxford Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dodge </em>(Me. 1981) 426 A.2d 888, 890-891.) Regardless of the motive for including the phrase, it focuses the inquiry on <em>the insured\u2019s </em>actual, subjective expectation, not the expectation of a hypothetical reasonable person. (See <em>Brown Foundation </em>v. <em>St. Paul Ins. Co. </em>(Ky. 1991) 814 S.W.2d 273, 279.) Even if the reference to \u201cthe <em>standpoint </em>of the insured\u201d was meant to invoke an objective test, at best the phrase is ambiguous\u2014 triggering the usual consequences for ambiguous insurance policy language. Thus, this type of \u201coccurrence\u201d definition compels a subjective expectation test.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>Judicial interpretation is controlled by the clear and explicit meanings of words in their ordinary and popular senses, unless the parties adopted a special or technical usage. <em>(AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 822.) Even if the reasoning of the insurers\u2019 authorities was compelling, this rule would preclude endorsing an objective, \u201cshould have known\u201d meaning for \u201cexpected.\u201d At trial, the parties offered no evidence that \u201cexpected\u201d and \u201cintended\u201d had other than their plain meanings in Shell\u2019s policies. Therefore, we interpret these words in their ordinary and popular sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Leading dictionaries do not have definitions of \u201cexpect\u201d that are appropriate in the context of Shell\u2019s policies and contain any connotation of \u201cshould have known.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If a person \u201cshould have known\u201d there was a substantial likelihood an event would occur, then the person <em>\u201cshould have </em>expected\u201d it. The plain meaning of \u201cexpected\u201d does not include \u201cshould have known.\u201d Rather, the word comprehends actual belief in the probability of a future event.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">We conclude that the ordinary and popular meaning of \u201cexpected,\u201d in the context of Shell\u2019s CGL policies, is not ambiguous. Our conclusion is reinforced by the sense three dictionaries attribute to \u201cexpect\u201d in contrast with its synonyms. \u201cTo <em>expect </em>is to look forward to the occurrence of something with little reservation as to its likelihood.\u201d (American Heritage Dict., <em>supra, </em>p. 461, col. 2.) \u201cExpect implies confidently believing, usually for good reasons, that an event will occur . . . .\u201d (Random House Dict., <em>supra, </em>p. 501, col. 1.) \u201cExpect usu[ally] implies a high degree of certainty to the point of making preparations or anticipating particular things [or] actions . . . .\u201d (Webster\u2019s Third New Internal. Dict., <em>supra, </em>p. 799, col. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The ordinary and popular meaning of \u201cexpect\u201d connotes subjective knowledge of or belief in an event\u2019s probability. We see no material difference if the degree of that probability is expressed as substantially certain, practically certain, highly likely, or highly probable; the terms are minor shadings of the same idea. All convey the ordinary and popular sense that we do not think of events we \u201cexpect\u201d as absolute certainties. Accordingly, we cannot adopt the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>more restrictive interpretation of some courts that \u201cthe phrase \u2018neither expected nor intended\u2019 should be read only to exclude those damages that the insured knew would flow directly and immediately from its intentional act.\u201d <em>(Hecla Min. Co. </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Ins. Co. </em>(Colo. 1991) 811 P.2d 1083, 1088; see <em>City of Johnstown, N.Y. </em>v. <em>Bankers Standard Ins. </em>(2d Cir. 1989) 877 F.2d 1146, 1150; cf. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Company </em>v. <em>Muth </em>(1973) 190 Neb. 272 [207 N.W.2d 364, 366].) By suggesting that the foreknowledge must be detailed and absolutely certain, such interpretations unacceptably change the plain meaning of a plain word.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Our conclusion on the meaning of \u201cexpected or intended\u201d is not unique. <em>Patrons-Oxford Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dodge, supra, </em>426 A.2d at page 892, adopted essentially the same interpretation, albeit without examining the words\u2019 ordinary and popular meanings. The court decided that damage \u201c\u2018. . . which is either expected or intended from the standpoint of the Insured\u2019 \u201d refers only to damage \u201cthat the insured in fact <em>subjectively wanted </em>(\u2018intended\u2019) to be a result of his conduct or in fact <em>subjectively foresaw as practically certain </em>(\u2018expected\u2019) to be a result of his conduct.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>original italics.) Similarly, <em>Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Abernathy </em>(1984) 393 Mass. 81 [469 N.E.2d 797, 800], held that \u201cexpected\u201d requires a showing that the insured \u201cknew to a substantial certainty\u201d that damage would ensue. \u201cHad the insurer intended a different result, it could have used more appropriate language in the exclusion clause.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Both courts reached their conclusions because they believed the phrase was ambiguous and construed it to favor coverage. <em>(Patrons-Oxford Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dodge, supra, </em>426 A.2d at pp. 890-891; <em>Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Abernathy, supra, </em>469 N.E.2d at pp. 799-800.) We do not share that view. Often courts have difficulty with the phrase because they apply the specialized legal meaning of \u201cintend.\u201d This leaves \u201cexpect\u201d with little to do. When we interpret both words in their ordinary and popular sense, the context renders their meaning clear and explicit. Even if we thought the phrase ambiguous, though, we would still arrive at the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">\u201cExpected or intended\u201d is standard language in many CGL policies. The insurers do not suggest that joint drafting produced the \u201coccurrence\u201d definitions or \u201cexpected\u2019s\u201d use in the pollution exclusions. Nor do they claim a basis for believing Shell understood the words in a particular way. Therefore, if ambiguity existed, we would adopt a reasonable construction favoring coverage <em>(AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at pp. 823-824), which would be the construction we have endorsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">For these reasons, we hold that the jury instructions defining \u201cexpect\u201d contained error. The instructions misdirected the inquiry to what Shell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>should have known instead of limiting consideration to what Shell actually knew or believed. Thus, they deviated from the ordinary, popular meaning of \u201cexpect\u201d and the standard required by section 533. By testing what Shell should have known, the instructions invited denial of coverage for conduct within the realm of negligence, notwithstanding their gloss on the probabilities that reasonably should have been known. The appropriate test for \u201cexpected\u201d damage is whether the insured knew or believed its conduct was substantially certain or highly likely to result in that kind of damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">4. <em>\u201cOccurrences\u201d and \u201cAccidents\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Shell claims the trial court misapplied the fortuity concept in the policies\u2019 \u201coccurrence\u201d definitions and misinterpreted the meaning of \u201caccident.\u201d As a result, some policies would not cover unintended and unexpected damage caused by intended acts. \u201cAccident\u201d is an integral part of the policies\u2019 \u201coccurrence\u201d definitions, and so we examine the role and meaning of \u201caccident\u201d in that context.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Before 1975, Shell\u2019s primary policies used a disjunctive to define an \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201c(1) an <em>accident, or </em>[1] (2) continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which results in . . . property damage during the policy period.\u201d (Italics added.) In contrast, later policies typically defined an occurrence as \u201can <em>accident, including </em>continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which result in . . . property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The trial court instructed the jury that policies defining \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident, or [|] . . . exposure . . .\u201d required only that the resulting damage be unexpected or unintended. For policies defining \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident, including . . . exposure ...\u201d the trial court told the jury \u201cthat both the event or events causing the damage and the damage itself [must] be unexpected and unintended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Shell argues against this distinction between the two \u201coccurrence\u201d definitions. First, Shell contends that the minor change from \u201caccident, or\u201d to \u201caccident, including\u201d should not create the significant change in coverage reflected in the jury instruction because \u201cincluding\u201d normally is a term of enlargement and not limitation. Second, Shell argues that section 533 requires coverage for intentional conduct that results in unexpected or unintended damage because it is not just an exclusion, but also a mandate of coverage for all negligence, regardless of contrary policy language. Third, Shell asserts that \u201caccident\u201d means more than unexpected and unintended causes of damage; the term also includes unexpected and unintended consequences of intentional acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>Shell\u2019s first argument is correct in one respect; \u201cincluding\u201d is a word of enlargement. However, here it enlarges the meaning of \u201caccident\u201d to add exposure to damaging conditions; gradual events can then be \u201caccidents\u201d and \u201coccurrences\u201d under the policies. This change broadened the scope of covered events because some courts required that \u201caccidents\u201d be \u201csudden.\u201d (See, e.g., <em>Geddes &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>v. <em>St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. </em>(1959) 51 Cal .2d 558, 563-564 [334 P.2d 881] (hereafter <em>Geddes).) </em>The more recent \u201coccurrence\u201d definitions include gradual events within the concept of \u201caccident,\u201d but these policies nevertheless maintain a basic requirement that such events be accidents. Under the older policies an \u201coccurrence\u201d was an accident <em>or </em>exposure to damaging conditions, a definition that allowed coverage for damaging exposures that were not accidents. Therefore, as a matter of syntax and semantics, the trial court\u2019s distinction between the two definitions of \u201coccurrence\u201d was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Shell\u2019s second argument relies on the second clause of section 533. Shell asserts that just as the first clause bars coverage for willful acts, the second clause requires coverage for any form of negligence. Shell contends that both clauses are mandatory and cannot be overridden by contrary policy terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The argument misconceives the basic nature of the statute. \u201cSection 533 is \u2018an implied <em>exclusionary clause </em>which by statute is to be read into all insurance policies.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Penney, supra, 52 </em>Cal.3d at p. 1019, italics added.) The section reflects a fundamental public policy of denying coverage for willful wrongs; thus, an insurer cannot cover acts excluded by the section. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1019-1020, fn. 8.) The second clause of section 533 simply excludes any form of negligence from the category of willful acts. Shell provides no authority for the argument that section 533 requires nonwillful acts to be covered and vitiates any contrary policy language. To the contrary, insurers have the right to limit policy coverage in plain and understandable language and can limit the character and extent of the risk assumed. <em>(Continental Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Phoenix Constr. Co. </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 423, 432 [296 P.2d 801, 57 A.L.R.2d 914]; <em>Masonite Corp. </em>v. <em>Great American Surplus Lines Ins. Co. </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 912, 919 [274 Cal.Rptr. 206].) Thus, an insurer may place more restrictions on the liability it assumes than those set by section 533. <em>(American Guar. &amp; Liability </em>v. <em>Vista Medical Supply </em>(N.D.Cal. 1988) 699 F.Supp. 787, 790 (opn. of Schwarzer, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Shell\u2019s third argument is based on a discussion of the meaning of \u201caccident\u201d in <em>Geddes, supra, </em>51 Cal.2d at pages 563-564.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Shell contends that the court\u2019s reference to an \u201caccident\u201d as an undesigned happening <em>or </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>\u201cconsequence\u201d means that any unexpected or unintended result is an \u201caccident,\u201d even if caused by intended conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Although <em>Geddes </em>referred to an \u201caccident\u201d as a \u201cconsequence,\u201d the reference played no part in the reasoning of the decision. Instead, the court concluded that the door failures involved in that case were accidents because they were unexpected, undesigned, and sudden. (Geddes, <em>supra, </em>51 Cal.2d at p. 564.) The property damage that resulted from the door failures was therefore \u201c \u2018caused by accident,\u2019 \u201d as the policy language required. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 562.)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">For the same reason, the logic and grammar of the post-1974 policies preclude our interpreting \u201caccident\u201d as meaning a \u201cconsequence.\u201d Those policies, which define an \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident, including . . . ,\u201d cover property damage \u201ccaused by\u201d an \u201coccurrence.\u201d Therefore, an \u201coccurrence\u201d is a causal event, defined as an \u201caccident.\u201d In this context, an \u201caccident\u201d cannot mean unintended damage because the causal event also would be the result. Logically, a consequence cannot cause itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">This court interpreted a similar \u201coccurrence\u201d definition in <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1205 [242 Cal.Rptr. 454]. In that case, the insured sought coverage when an employee sued after being fired. The policy covered damages \u201ccaused by an occurrence,\u201d defined as \u201can accident, including, continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in bodily injury or property damage. This injury or damage must be neither expected nor intended by [the insured].\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1206-1207, italics omitted.) The insured conceded that he intended the employee\u2019s termination, but argued for coverage because he did not intend or expect the employee\u2019s severe emotional distress. We found that under this \u201coccurrence\u201d definition, the term \u201caccident\u201d does not apply to an act\u2019s consequences, but instead applies to the act itself. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1208.) When \u201coccurrence\u201d is defined as an \u201caccident,\u201d we concluded that injury caused by expected or intended actions is not covered. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1209; see also <em>Loyola Marymount University </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1217, 1224-1225 [271 Cal.Rptr. 528]; <em>Merced Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Mendez </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 41, 48-50 [261 Cal.Rptr. 273]; <em>Dyer </em>v. <em>Northbrook Property &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1540, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>1547-1549 [259 Cal.Rptr. 298].) The trial court correctly distinguished the effect of the two different \u201coccurrence\u201d definitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">However, we should not be misunderstood as suggesting that an expected or intended act at any point in the causal chain of events means that any resulting damage was not caused by accident. Instead, we hold only that where damage is the direct and immediate result of an intended or expected event, there is no accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">5. <em>\u201cSudden,\u201d as Used to Define \u201cAccident\u201d and as Used in the Pollution Exclusions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Shell contends that the trial court erred by including \u201csudden\u201d in its definition of \u201caccident\u201d and also by defining \u201csudden\u201d so that gradual events were not covered. Shell is joined by amicus curiae Aerojet on the latter contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">A. <em>Accidents Are \u201cSudden\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Shell claims that by including \u201csudden\u201d in the definition of \u201caccident,\u201d the jury instructions limited Shell\u2019s coverage to abrupt events, contrary to <em>Geddes. (Geddes, supra, </em>51 Cal.2d at pp. 563-564.) Jury instruction No. 35 stated: \u201cThe term \u2018accident\u2019 means a casualty, something out of the usual course of events, which happens suddenly and unexpectedly and without the design of the person injured. The term \u2018accident\u2019 requires an element of fortuity and an event or happening which occurs in a spontaneous, instantaneous, abrupt or immediate manner, or which happens or comes without warning or premonition, or takes place or appears all at once, or is discovered unexpectedly and happens without warning.\u201d However, Shell\u2019s argument that this instruction erroneously allowed only abrupt events to be covered has two flaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">First, \u201caccident\u201d is not an isolated term in the policies; rather, it is an integral part of the \u201coccurrence\u201d definition. Just before defining \u201caccident,\u201d the trial court told the jury that \u201coccurrence\u201d included \u201ccontinuous or repeated exposure to conditions\u201d that results in property damage. A covered \u201coccurrence\u201d could include events that are not abrupt because the \u201coccurrence\u201d definitions enlarged the concept of \u201caccident\u201d to encompass events that happen gradually. Considered as a whole, the instructions did not preclude coverage for an \u201coccurrence\u201d that was gradual and not abrupt in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">Second, the trial court\u2019s definition of \u201caccident\u201d was consistent with the interpretation in <em>Geddes. (Geddes, supra, </em>51 Cal.2d at pp. 563-564.) That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>case stated that one defining element of an \u201caccident\u201d is that it \u201c \u2018 \u201chappens suddenly.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 563.) Shell argues that <em>Geddes </em>took this element from an accidental death policy case and that the only definition applicable to Shell appears later in the discussion: \u201c \u2018Accident, as a source and cause of damage to property, within the terms of an accident policy, is an unexpected, unforeseen, or undesigned happening or consequence from either a known or an unknown cause.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 563-564, quoting <em>Hauenstein </em>v. <em>Saint Paul-Mercury Indem. Co. </em>(1954) 242 Minn. 354 [65 N.W.2d 122, 126].) Shell notes that this definition does not include \u201csudden\u201d or \u201csuddenly.\u201d However, <em>Geddes </em>does not purport to specify discrete meanings of \u201caccident\u201d dependent on the kind of insurance involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Shell overlooks the <em>Geddes </em>court\u2019s rationale for concluding that the door failures in question were accidents: \u201cThe door failures were unexpected, undesigned, and unforeseen. . . . Moreover, they occurred suddenly. It bears emphasis that we are concerned, not with a series of imperceptible events that finally culminated in a single tangible harm [citation], but with a series of specific events each of which manifested itself at an identifiable time and each of which caused identifiable harm at the time it occurred. . . . [E]ach door, when it failed, failed suddenly. At one moment it was a usable door, at the next it was not.\u201d <em>(Geddes, supra, </em>51 Cal.2d at p. 564.)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\"><em>Geddes </em>does not support Shell\u2019s view that suddenness should not be used to define \u201caccident.\u201d Moreover, the trial court instructed the jury that \u201ccontinuous or repeated exposure\u201d could be an \u201coccurrence.\u201d The \u201coccurrence\u201d definitions therefore encompassed both sudden and gradual events. Viewed together, the instructions defining \u201caccident\u201d and \u201coccurrence\u201d were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">B. <em>\u201cSudden\u201d Events Start Abruptly</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The second issue concerning \u201csudden\u201d is the subject of substantial judicial disagreement across the country. Shell and Aerojet contend that in pollution exclusions, \u201csudden\u201d need not have a temporal connotation and reasonably can mean just \u201cunexpected\u201d or, as Shell urges with less vigor, \u201cunintended.\u201d They argue that \u201csudden\u201d is ambiguous and that we should construe it to cover unexpected or unintended events without any temporal limitation. They claim the trial court erred by instructing the jury that in the pollution exclusions, \u201c \u2018sudden\u2019 means a happening without warning; unforeseen; a happening coming or appearing unexpectedly; not foreseen or prepared for; and characterized by hastiness, abruptness, quickness, and swiftness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">We first consider the context in which Shell\u2019s policies use \u201csudden.\u201d Before the pollution exclusions were added to those policies in 1969, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>covered liability arising from an \u201coccurrence,\" including \u201ccontinuous or repeated exposure to conditions.\u201d The pollution exclusions changed that. From 1969 through the 1970\u2019s, Shell\u2019s excess insurers\u2019 policies typically stated that they did not cover \u201c[l]oss of, damage to, or loss of use of property directly or indirectly caused by seepage, pollution, or contamination . . . .\u201d Other policies then and later relied on a more detailed exclusion, which stated that the insurance did not apply to \u201cproperty damage arising out of the discharge, dispersal, release or escape of smoke, vapors, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, toxic chemicals, liquids or gases, waste materials or other irritants, contaminants or pollutants into or upon land, the atmosphere or any watercourse or body of water . . . .\u201d This language created a broad exclusion from coverage for any liability resulting from pollution.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">Nevertheless, nearly all the pollution exclusions contained some exception that could reinstate coverage. Two of the standard exceptions to the pollution exclusion used \u201csudden.\u201d In Shell\u2019s policies, the first and most common exception reinstated coverage if the \u201cseepage, pollution or contamination is caused by a <em>sudden, unintended and unexpected happening </em>dining the period of this Insurance.\u201d (Italics added.) The second exception, used in relatively few Shell policies, stated that the \u201cexclusion does not apply if such discharge, dispersal, release or escape is <em>sudden and </em>accidental.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Our interpretation is governed by the context in which \u201csudden\u201d is used and by two basic rules: (1) we interpret policy language in its ordinary and popular sense unless the parties expressed a contrary intent (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1644; <em>AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at pp. 826-827); and (2) \u201c[t]he whole of a contract is to be taken together, so as to give effect to every part, if reasonably practicable, each clause helping to interpret the other.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1641.)  The way we define words should not produce redundancy, but instead should give each word significance. <em>(AIU, supra, </em>at p. 827.)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">These rules create an obvious problem for interpreting the first exception\u2019s \u201csudden\u201d to mean \u201cunexpected\u201d or \u201cunintended.\" If covered pollution has to be \u201ca sudden, unintended and unexpected happening,\u201d then we must distinguish \u201csudden\u201d from \u201cunexpected\u201d and \u201cunintended.\u201d That distinction lies in the temporal connotation inherent in the ordinary meaning of \u201csudden.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The potential for redundancy also appears in the second exception, where a covered \u201cdischarge, dispersal, release or escape\u201d of a pollutant has to be \u201csudden and accidental.\u201d Many courts have wrestled with this phrase and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>disagreed over the meaning of \u201csudden.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit managed to come down on both sides of the question. <em>(Northern Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aardvark Associates </em>(3d Cir. 1991) 942 F.2d 189, 193 [predicting that under Pennsylvania law, \u201csudden and accidental\u201d applies only to discharges that are abrupt and last a short time]; <em>New Castle County </em>v. <em>Hartford Acc. and Indem. Co., supra, </em>933 F.2d at pp. 1194-1195, 1198-1199 [predicting that under Delaware law, \u201csudden and accidental\u201d means \u201cunexpected and unintended\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Several courts have been swayed by the fact that not all dictionary meanings for \u201csudden\u201d include temporal terms. (See, e.g., <em>New Castle County </em>v. <em>Hartford Acc. and Indem. Co., supra, </em>933 F.2d at pp. 1193-1194, 1198; <em>Just </em>v. <em>Land Reclamation, Ltd. </em>(1990) 155 Wis.2d 737 [456 N.W.2d 570, 573]; <em>Claussen </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>(1989) 259 Ga. 333 [380 S.E.2d 686, 688].) These courts concluded that \u201csudden\u201d is ambiguous and must be construed against the insurer to mean \u201cunexpected.\u201d <em>(New Castle County, supra, </em>at pp. 1193-1194, 1198; <em>Just, supra, </em>456 N.W.2d at p. 573; <em>Claussen, supra, </em>380 S.E.2d at p. 688; see also <em>Hecla Min. Co. </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Ins. Co., supra, </em>811 P.2d at pp. 1091-1092.) However, a word\u2019s context in a case can reveal a more refined meaning than those found in the dictionary. (See Holmes, <em>The Theory of Legal Interpretation, supra, 12 </em>Harv.L.Rev. at p. 417.)</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Certainly, one aspect of the meaning of \u201csudden\u201d is \u201cunexpected.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But saying that \u201csudden\u201d means \u201cunexpected,\u201d and nothing more, strips the word of a significant facet of its ordinary meaning. Sudden events derive an \u201cunexpected\u201d quality both from being unforeseen and from having a comparatively quick onset. We cannot reasonably call \u201csudden\u201d a process that occurs slowly and incrementally over a relatively long time, no matter how unexpected or unintended the process. A \u201cdischarge, dispersal, release or escape\u201d of pollutants that happens gradually and continuously for years is not \u201csudden\u201d in the ordinary and popular sense of the word. <em>(American Motorists Ins.

Thus, \u201csudden\u201d necessarily contains a temporal element in addition to its connotation of the unexpected.</p>\n<p id=\"AUC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>This approach also avoids making \u201csudden\u201d and \u201caccidental\u201d redundant. Dictionaries define as \u201caccidental\u201d unexpected and unintended events.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> California law also equates \u201caccident\u201d with unexpected and unintended events. (See <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Midland National Ins. Co. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 553, 559-561 [91 Cal.Rptr. 153, 476 P.2d 825]; <em>Geddes, supra, </em>51 Cal.2d at pp. 563-564; <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>(1891) 89 Cal. 170, 175 [26 P. 762].)</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">An \u201caccidental\u201d event is both unintended and unexpected; omitting either leaves an important part of the word\u2019s meaning unexpressed. A \u201cdischarge, dispersal, release or escape\u201d of pollutants that is expected is not accidental, regardless of whether it was not intended. Therefore, in the phrase, \u201csudden and accidental,\u201d \u201caccidental\u201d conveys the sense of an unexpected and unintended event, while \u201csudden\u201d conveys the sense of an unexpected event that is abrupt or immediate in nature. \u201cSudden and accidental\u201d is not ambiguous if we give the words their full significance. A court should not make a phrase ambiguous by unreasonably truncating a word\u2019s meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Of the many diverse opinions on the meaning of \u201csudden,\u201d we find the better reasoned decisions are exemplified by <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. </em>v. <em>Belleville Ind., supra, </em>555 N.E.2d 568, and <em>U.S. Fidelity and Guar. </em>v. <em>Star Fire Coals, Inc. </em>(6th Cir. 1988) 856 F.2d 31. The Massachusetts high court stated: \u201cFor the word \u2018sudden\u2019 to have any significant purpose, and not to be surplusage when used generally in conjunction with the word \u2018accidental,\u2019 it must have a temporal aspect to its meaning, and not just the sense of something unexpected. . . . The issue is whether the release was sudden. The alternative is that it was gradual. . . . [Si] ... If the word \u2018sudden\u2019 is to have any meaning or value in the exception to the pollution exclusion clause, only an abrupt discharge or release of pollutants falls within the exception. [][]... Surely, the abruptness of the commencement of the release or discharge of the pollutant is the crucial element.\u201d <em>(Lumbermens, supra, </em>at p. 572, fns. omitted.) The Sixth Circuit focused on plain meaning: \u201cWe believe the everyday meaning of the term \u2018sudden\u2019 is exactly what this clause means. We do not believe that it is possible to define \u2018sudden\u2019 without reference to a temporal element that joins together conceptually the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>immediate and the unexpected.\u201d <em>(U.S. Fidelity and Guar., supra, </em>at p. 34.) Or, as one of Shell\u2019s brokers said, \u201cI can\u2019t think of a better description of \u2018sudden\u2019 than sudden, something that happens at a precise point in time.\u201d (Cf. <em>Geddes, supra, </em>51 Cal.2d at p. 564.)</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">We also agree with <em>Lumbermens </em>that \u201csudden\u201d refers to the pollution\u2019s commencement and does not require that the polluting event terminate quickly or have only a brief duration. <em>(Lumbermens Mut. Cas. </em>v. <em>Belleville Ind., supra, </em>555 N.E.2d at p. 572, fn. 6 and accompanying text.) If a sudden and accidental discharge continues for a long time, at some point it ceases to be sudden or accidental. <em>(Ibid.\u2019, </em>see <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. </em>v. <em>SCA Services </em>(1992) 412 Mass. 330 [588 N.E.2d 1346, 1349-1350].) Still, a sudden and accidental discharge of a dangerous pollutant could continue unabated for some period because of a negligent failure to discover it, technical problems or a lack of resources that delay curtailment, or some other circumstance. Liability from such an event could well be covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">We therefore find no error in the jury instructions that defined \u201csudden\u201d in the pollution exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">6. <em>Itemizing CERCLA Response Costs and the \u201cCare, Custody or Control\u201d Exclusions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Shell challenges two other jury instructions. One instruction concerned the CERCLA response costs Shell was to pay under the settlement with the United States. The other dealt with coverage exclusions for damage to property in Shell\u2019s care, custody, or control. Because the CERCLA response costs include remedial activities on Shell\u2019s leasehold at the Arsenal, the two issues are related, and we discuss them jointly.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">Jury instruction No. 39 said that Shell had the burden of itemizing and defining the purpose and nature of the CERCLA response costs for which Shell sought coverage. The jury then had to assign each response cost to one of four categories. The only category not covered was the cleanup of first party property. The trial court told the jury that coverage could be available for remedial measures taken on first party property to prevent imminent damage to others or third party property. First party property was defined as \u201cproperty owned by Shell and in some circumstances, property leased or under the care, custody or control of Shell. Third-party property is all other property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">Jury instruction No. 40 said, in part: \u201c[Sjome of the primary and excess insurance policies issued to Shell by the insurers contain a provision known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>as a care, custody or control exclusion, which excludes coverage for damage to property owned by Shell, or property rented or occupied by Shell, or property in the care, custody or control of Shell. 0[] If Shell proves that there was actual or discernible damage to property, you must determine whether the property which was damaged was owned, leased or occupied by Shell, or in the care, custody or control of Shell, H[] Under certain liability policies issued to Shell, only real property which is owned by Shell is excluded.\u201d The trial court told the jury that this instruction was subject to the CERCLA response costs instruction, and that the jury had to consider Shell\u2019s coverage claims and the insurers\u2019 defenses on a policy-by-policy, year-by-year basis. The court also instructed the jury that the insurers had to prove \u201call of the facts necessary to establish that an exclusion or any exclusionary language applies to limit or abrogate coverage . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">Shell protests that requiring it to prove its CERCLA response costs contravened <em>AIU </em>and imposed on Shell part of the insurers\u2019 burden of proof. Shell also contends that the trial court should not have instructed the jury on the \u201ccare, custody or control\u201d exclusions. In Shell\u2019s view, the exclusions applied only to personal property, not to remedial measures on first party property to protect third party property. Further, Shell argues that the exclusions cannot apply because, as a matter of law, Shell could not have care, custody, or control of the polluted soil and groundwater. None of these assertions has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Nothing in <em>AIU </em>requires that insurance cover all CERCLA response costs. <em>AIU </em>addressed only basic coverage clause language and expressly declined to consider other policy clauses. <em>(AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at pp. 814-815, 818-819, fn. 7, 843.) By contrast, the trial court here dealt with many different exclusions from hundreds of policies. <em>AIU </em>did not mandate coverage of all CERCLA response costs without regard to the nature of those costs or the language of the policies and exclusions involved. Instead, AIU\u2019s main precept is that coverage depends in the first instance on the language of the insurance contract. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 821-824, 843.)</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Shell\u2019s basic coverage clauses, except in some excess policies, are similar to those <em>AIU </em>discussed. <em>(AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at pp. 814-815.) <em>AIU </em>held that the standard basic insuring provisions of CGL policies cover remedial and mitigative CERCLA response costs, including reimbursing government agencies <em>(id., </em>at pp. 828-830) and complying with injunctions <em>(id., </em>at pp. 840-841). The court recognized an exception, described as a \u201climited circumstance\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 843), to the general rule of response costs coverage: \u201cWe do agree that prophylactic costs\u2014incurred to pay for measures taken in advance of any release of hazardous waste\u2014are not incurred \u2018because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>property damage.\u2019 [Citations.] Until such damage has occurred, whether on the waste site itself or elsewhere, there can be no coverage under CGL policies.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>As an example of environmental injunction costs that are prophylactic in nature and not covered under CGL policies, the court offered \u201caltering dumping practices to prevent recurrences of leakage.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 841.) Thus, basic CGL insuring clauses do not necessarily cover all CERCLA response costs. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 832 [\u201c[Government regulations or court orders requiring businesses ... to undertake purely prophylactic measures designed to prevent future discharges of hazardous waste result in costs that are not covered by CGL policies.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><em>AIU </em>does not suggest that an insured need not show the purpose and nature of the response costs for which it seeks coverage. The insured has the initial burden of showing that its claim is within the policy\u2019s basic coverage. <em>(Garvey </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 395, 406 [257 Cal.Rptr. 292, 770 P.2d 704]; <em>Royal Globe Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Whitaker </em>(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 532, 537 [226 Cal.Rptr. 435].) The CERCLA response costs instruction reflected that initial burden. The burden of proof then shifted to the insurers to show that other policy language excluded all or part of the claim. <em>(Garvey, supra, </em>at p. 406; <em>Royal Globe, supra, </em>at p. 537.)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Shell argues it should not have had this burden of proof at all. Shell claims that because the insurers denied coverage, the settlement with the United States was presumptive evidence of both the fact and the amount of its liability. (See, e.g., <em>Isaacson </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 775, 791 [244 Cal.Rptr. 655, 750 P.2d 297].)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The trial court told the jury that the settlement established a presumption of Shell\u2019s liability to the United States. But, as Shell acknowledges in its opening brief, the settlement between Shell and the United States does not obligate Shell to pay a specific amount; Shell\u2019s liability is open-ended. Shell still had to prove the components of its liability under the settlement. The CERCLA response costs instruction properly gave Shell the burden of proving that its response costs obligations under the settlement were within its policies\u2019 basic coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The trial court did not misassign a burden of proof when it had the jury allocate the response costs to various categories, one of which had no coverage. Expenses solely for cleanup of first party property were not covered unless they were necessary to prevent imminent damage to third party property. <em>AIU </em>did not examine this exclusion from basic CGL coverage. <em>(AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at pp. 814, 818-819, fn. 7, 843.) The instruction that defined first party property led the jury to the instruction on the \u201ccare, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>custody or control\u201d exclusions, which the court told the jury were, like all exclusionary language, the insurers\u2019 burden to prove.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">We find no merit in Shell\u2019s argument that the trial court should not have instructed the jury on the \u201ccare, custody or control\u201d exclusions. Contrary to Shell\u2019s contention, the exclusions were not limited to personal property. For example, the exclusions in Travelers\u2019 policies for 1951 to 1966 dealt with real property in the insured\u2019s care, custody, or control. A typical clause provided: \u201cThese exclusions shall not apply to real property, other than property owned by the insured, provided such property is not at the time of the accident in the care, custody or control of the named insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Shell also claims the exclusions do not apply because its response costs related to remedying soil and groundwater contamination. Shell argues that, as a matter of law, it cannot own or have care, custody, or control of groundwater and soil. Although private ownership rights in water may be limited by state law,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> this does not mean that lake waters or groundwater could not be in Shell\u2019s care, custody, or control. Indeed, controlling groundwater quality by interception and treatment is part of the remedial activities under the consent decree. Further, the exclusions plainly apply to soil within Shell\u2019s leasehold or control. Whether Shell\u2019s coverage claims fell within the scope of the exclusion was an issue for the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">We reject Shell\u2019s argument that the \u201ccare, custody or control\u201d instruction suggested that remedial steps on leased property were not covered if the leased property had been damaged. The instruction plainly stated that it was subject to the immediately preceding instruction on CERCLA response costs. That instruction told the jury that remedial measures on first party property to prevent imminent danger to others could be covered. The CERCLA response costs instruction covered the point Shell complains was missing from the \u201ccare, custody or control\u201d instruction. There was no need to repeat the point in both instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">7. <em>The Late Notice Defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">One of the insurers\u2019 many defenses was that Shell failed to give timely notice of the Arsenal pollution claims. The jury instruction on the insurers\u2019 late notice defense stated, in part: \u201cShell\u2019s policies require that Shell provide notice to its insurers. An insurer is not required to provide coverage to Shell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>if Shell violated that part of the insurance contract that required Shell to give timely notice of any claims against it and this failure to give notice caused the insurer to suffer substantial prejudice. To prove this violation, an insurer has the burden of proving two things: [][] 1. That Shell was late in notifying the insurer of the underlying claim; and [&lt;][] 2. That the insurer actually suffered substantial prejudice as a result of this late notification. [SI] \u2018Substantial prejudice\u2019 means the insurer must prove that the lack of timely notice had an adverse effect on the ability of the insurer to investigate and prepare a defense in the underlying claim. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Shell contends the trial court erred by not directing a verdict on the late notice defense. In addition to claiming it gave timely notice, Shell asserts that the insurers failed to show actual prejudice and that they waived the defense by denying coverage. The insurers argue the evidence warranted submitting the defense to the jury. The insurers also urge this defense as an independent basis for affirming the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In Shell\u2019s view, no obligation to notify the insurers arose until late 1981, when Shell says it learned that the Army intended to sue under CERCLA. From January 1982 to June 1983, Shell sent a series of notices to its insurers. Shell sued the insurers for declaratory relief in October 1983, approximately two months before the United States and Colorado sued Shell. Answering Shell\u2019s suit, the insurers denied liability on several grounds, including Shell\u2019s failure to give timely notice. Similarly, Travelers\u2019 January 1985 reservation of rights specified 13 grounds for no coverage, including Shell\u2019s failure to give timely notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The insurers say Shell had to notify them as soon as practicable after learning of an accident or occurrence likely to give rise to a claim under the policies. They assert Shell had that knowledge by May 1970, when the Army first asked Shell to help pay Arsenal pollution claims. We assume for purposes of discussion that Shell did not give timely notice and that notice was due long before Shell knew the Army would sue under CERCLA for the Arsenal cleanup.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">California law is settled that a defense based on an insured\u2019s failure to give timely notice requires the insurer to prove that it suffered substantial prejudice. <em>(Clemmer </em>v. <em>Hartford Insurance Co., supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at pp. 881-883; <em>Billington </em>v. <em>Interinsurance Exchange </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 728, 737-738 [79 Cal.Rptr. 326, 456 P.2d 982]; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 303, 305-307 [32 Cal.Rptr. 827, 384 P.2d 155]; <em>Select Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 226 Cal.App.3d 631, 636-637 [276 Cal.Rptr. 598]; <em>Northwestern Title Security Co. </em>v. <em>Flack </em>(1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 134, 140-143 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>[85 Cal.Rptr. 693].) Prejudice is not presumed from delayed notice alone. <em>(Campbell, supra, </em>at p. 307; <em>Northwestern, supra, </em>at p. 141.) The insurer must show actual prejudice, not the mere possibility of prejudice. <em>(Billington, supra, </em>at p. 737.)</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">In <em>Northwestern, </em>the court explained that, under California\u2019s notice-prejudice rule, \u201cprejudice does not arise merely because a delayed or late notice has denied the insurance company the ability to contemporaneously investigate the claim or interview witnesses. . . . [T]he same rule applies to the denial of the opportunity to make an early settlement of the claim. Again, as pointed out in <em>Billington, </em>the burden was upon [the insurer] to show that, but for the delay in making a prompt investigation and in hiring [an] attorney at the early stages, there was a substantial likelihood that [the insurer] could have prevailed in a negligence action brought against [the insured] or that [the insurer] could have settled the case for a small sum or a smaller sum than that for which [the] insured ultimately settled the claim.\u201d <em>(Northwestern Title Security Co. </em>v. <em>Flack, supra, </em>6 Cal.App.3d at pp. 142-143.) Under the notice-prejudice rule, the Supreme Court has said, \u201cprejudice is not shown simply by displaying end results; the probability that such results could or would have been avoided absent the claimed default or error must also be explored.\u201d <em>(Clemmer </em>v. <em>Hartford Insurance Co., supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 883, fn. 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The insurers say they proved substantial actual prejudice by showing that the Arsenal cleanup\u2019s estimated costs increased dramatically between 1972 and 1982. They also assert that the passage of time made defending the claims more difficult. According to the insurers, Shell denied them the right to investigate and participate in the events at the Arsenal and deprived them of the opportunity to defend or settle the Army\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">To show prejudice from the passage of time, the insurers cite a stipulation listing the names and job titles of 18 persons who were dead or unavailable when Shell\u2019s declaratory relief action was tried. This simple listing fails to establish prejudice. The list does not indicate what additional evidence these people might have provided, nor does it suggest how their unavailability affected either Shell\u2019s liability or the insurers\u2019 ability to mount a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">To support their assertion that the Arsenal cleanup costs escalated, the insurers point to several estimates made over the years. In 1972, the Army envisioned a cleanup cost of $60 million over a five-year period. A 1975 restoration plan was estimated to cost $345 million over 17 years, and in 1976, a preliminary estimate of restoration costs was $500 million. When the United States sued Shell in December 1983, its complaint said the estimated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>cost of remedial action was $1.8 billion. Shell\u2019s settlement with the United States sets Shell\u2019s responsibility for cleanup costs at 50 percent of the first $500 million, 35 percent of the next $200 million, and 20 percent of amounts over $700 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Obviously, there is a substantial difference between $60 million and $1.8 billion. However, the low early Arsenal damage estimates fail to raise a triable inference that the insurers were prejudiced by late notice. The insurers offered no evidence that the low initial estimates would have defined Shell\u2019s CERCLA liability if Shell had given the insurers earlier notice. No evidence suggests that with timely notice by Shell, the insurers would have reduced or eliminated Shell\u2019s CERCLA liability. Ultimately, the record does not support an inference that earlier notice would have changed anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Another factor affecting the insurers\u2019 late notice defense is their wide-ranging denial of any coverage.  This court has stated, \u201cThe law is established that where an insurance company denies liability under a policy which it has issued, it waives any claim that the notice provisions of the policy have not been complied with.\u201d <em>(CNA Casualty of California </em>v. <em>Seaboard Surety Co. </em>(1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 598, 617 [222 Cal.Rptr. 276], citations and internal quotation marks omitted; see <em>Eichler Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London </em>(1965) 238 Cal.App.2d 532, 539 [47 Cal.Rptr. 843]; <em>Comunale </em>v. <em>Traders &amp; General Ins. Co. </em>(1953) 116 Cal.App.2d 198, 202-203 [253 P.2d 495]; cf. <em>Clemmer </em>v. <em>Hartford Insurance Co., supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 883 [\u201cThe fundamental defect in [the insurer\u2019s] position here is that it has at no time suggested that, in the event that a timely tender of the defense of the [underlying claim] had been made, it would have undertaken the defense.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The insurers point out that they raised the late notice defense at the same time they denied coverage on other grounds. Thus, they rely on <em>Select Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d 631. In that case, the trial court granted a summary adjudication that the insurers could not rely on a late notice defense because they denied coverage. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 635.) The appellate court reversed because the denial of coverage by itself does not prove that the insurers would have responded the same way if notice had been timely. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 637.) The court stated, \u201cThe fact that after judgment [against the insured] had been entered, and the opportunity to settle apparently lost, the insurers chose to assert both defenses to coverage and lack of notice does not foreclose the possibility that had the insurers received notice before judgment they would have attempted to settle the case, even over [the insured\u2019s] objection.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 638-639.) The court concluded that the insurers might show this type of prejudice at trial. <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, the court also noted, \u201cIn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>our view <em>Clemmer </em>makes it clear an insurer is not allowed to rely on an insured\u2019s failure to perform a condition of a policy when the insurer has denied coverage because the insurer has, by denying coverage, demonstrated performance of the condition would not have altered its response to the claim. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Select Ins. Co., supra, </em>at p. 637.)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">This last point holds the crux of the issue. In order to demonstrate actual, substantial prejudice from lack of timely notice, an insurer must show it lost something that would have changed the handling of the underlying claim. If the insurer asserts that the underlying claim is not a covered occurrence or is excluded from basic coverage, then earlier notice would only result in earlier denial of coverage. To establish actual prejudice, the insurer must show a substantial likelihood that, with timely notice, and notwithstanding a denial of coverage or reservation of rights, it would have settled the claim for less or taken steps that would have reduced or eliminated the insured\u2019s liability. (Cf. <em>Billington </em>v. <em>Interinsurance Exchange, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 737; <em>Northwestern Title Security Co. </em>v. <em>Flack, supra, </em>6 Cal.App.3d at pp. 142-143.)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">We find the evidence here insufficient to raise an inference of actual, substantial prejudice. Moreover, we see no substantial probability that the insurers\u2019 response to the Arsenal claims would have been different had Shell given earlier notice. We cannot infer from this record any likelihood that, with earlier notice, the insurers would have settled or otherwise resolved Shell\u2019s Arsenal liability for less than Shell agreed to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Therefore, the trial court should have granted Shell\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the insurers\u2019 late notice defense. However, Shell suffered no prejudice when the trial court submitted this issue to the jury. To find prejudice, we must conclude that the error probably misled the jury and influenced its verdict; i.e., we must find it probable that the jury based its verdict on this issue. (See <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Harnischfeger Corp. </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 663, 670 [117 Cal.Rptr. 1, 527 P.2d 353].)  An erroneous instruction on matters for which there is no evidence will not justify reversal unless it misled the jury and prejudiced the appellant. <em>(Mehollin </em>v. <em>Ysuchiyama </em>(1938) 11 Cal.2d 53, 57 [77 P.2d 855].) In evaluating prejudice, we assume the jury understood the instructions and correctly applied them to the evidence. <em>(Gillespie </em>v. <em>Rawlings </em>(1957) 49 Cal.2d 359, 369 [317 P.2d 601].)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">After reviewing the entire record, we are convinced it is not probable that the jury based its verdict on the late notice defense. There was no evidence the insurers suffered substantial prejudice, even under the too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>lenient test of \u201can adverse effect on the ability of the insurer to investigate and prepare a defense in the underlying claim.\u201d Shell notified the insurers of the United States\u2019 potential claim nearly two years before the suit was filed. Shell investigated and defended itself against the underlying claims, the United States\u2019 and Colorado\u2019s suits. Travelers later advanced nearly $17 million for defense costs and agreed to forgo controlling or participating in the defense. We conclude that the jury was not likely to believe the insurers were substantially prejudiced. Although the trial court erred by submitting this defense to the jury, there is no probability that Shell was prejudiced by the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">8.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">9. <em>Travelers\u2019 Appeal and OIL\u2019S Cross-appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Travelers appeals from the judgment for OIL on Travelers\u2019 cross-complaint for contribution to Shell\u2019s defense costs in the suits by the United States and Colorado. Travelers argues that OIL shared the duty to defend Shell because OIL was potentially liable under its first party and third party coverages. Travelers also argues that equitable principles require OIL to contribute to Shell\u2019s defense and that the trial court erred by not submitting Travelers\u2019 cross-complaint to the jury. In a cross-appeal, OIL contends that the trial court, in the phase I statement of decision, misconstrued the \u201coccurrence\u201d definition in OIL\u2019S insurance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">A. <em>OIL\u2019S Cross-appeal</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">B. <em>Travelers\u2019 Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">Travelers offers several reasons why OIL should contribute to Shell\u2019s defense costs in the underlying litigation. First, Travelers argues that because OIL insured Shell for first party claims and third party pollution liability claims, OIL potentially is Shell\u2019s primary insurer for the Arsenal pollution damage. Second, Travelers argues that the \u201csue and labor\u201d clause of OIL\u2019S first party coverage<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> requires that OIL contribute to the defense of third party claims. Third, Travelers argues that equitable principles support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>OIL\u2019S duty to contribute to Shell\u2019s defense costs. (Citing <em>Signal Companies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Harbor Ins. Co. </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 359 [165 Cal.Rptr. 799, 612 P.2d 889, 19 A.L.R.4th 75].)</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">Travelers argues that because OIL\u2019S insuring agreements 1 and 2<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> potentially afford coverage for cleanup of Arsenal property Shell leased and Travelers excluded from coverage, OIL may be Shell\u2019s primary insurer for some cleanup costs. While recognizing that OIL insuring agreements 1 and 2 are first party coverages, Travelers nevertheless argues that OIL\u2019S potential duty to indemnify triggers a duty to defend. However, Travelers cites no authority that a potential duty to indemnify under first party coverage creates a duty to defend against third party claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">First party coverage for damage to the insured\u2019s own property is not the same as third party liability insurance and should be treated differently. (See <em>Garvey </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at pp. 405-408; cf. <em>Prudential-LMI Com. Insurance </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 674, 698 [274 Cal.Rptr. 387, 798 P.2d 1230].) Travelers argues that California law imposes an implied obligation to defend unless the policy clearly and expressly excludes that duty. (Citing <em>Pacific Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 1191, 1200 [223 Cal.Rptr. 312]; <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Certain Underwriters </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 791, 800 [129 Cal.Rptr. 47].) But those cases dealt with excess <em>liability </em>insurers\u2019 duty to defend after a primary liability insurer paid its policy limits. No similar circumstance is presented here. Travelers cites no authority that first party property insurance carries a duty to defend third party liability claims. We see no reason to create such a duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Travelers also argues that the \u201csue and labor\u201d expense clause imposes a duty to contribute to defense costs.  Our Supreme Court described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>the \u201csue and labor\u201d expense clause as follows: \u201cSuch a clause makes express the duty implied in law on the part of the insured to labor for the recovery and restitution of damaged or detained property [citation] and it contemplates a correlative duty of reimbursement separate from and supplementary to the basic insurance contract.\u201d <em>(Young\u2019s Market Co. </em>v. <em>American Home Assur. Co. </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 309, 313 [93 Cal.Rptr. 449, 481 P.2d 817].) \u201cThere is, however, a fundamental limitation upon the insurer\u2019s duty under a \u2018sue and labor\u2019 clause to compensate the insured for expenses incurred in the preservation and protection of insured property: the expenses in question must be incurred to preserve the insured property from a peril insured against under the basic policy.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 314, original italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Travelers argues that Shell, by defending the government suits, affirmatively sought to mitigate OIL\u2019S potential exposure under the first party coverages afforded by insuring agreements 1 and 2. However, Shell\u2019s defense costs in its effort to avoid or minimize its liability in the underlying actions do not come within the OIL policies\u2019 description of \u201csue and labor\u201d expenses or the accepted view of such clauses\u2019 purpose. An insured\u2019s attempts to avoid or reduce a liability to third parties do not constitute efforts to prevent or limit damage to the insured\u2019s covered property.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Travelers also argues that OIL\u2019S third party coverage under insuring agreement 3 required OIL to contribute to Shell\u2019s defense costs.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The OIL policies did not promise to defend Shell in third party suits. Instead, OIL\u2019S policies specified that \u201c[OIL] shall not be called upon to assume charge of the settlement or defense of any claim made or suit brought or proceeding instituted against [Shell] but [OIL] shall have the right and shall be given the opportunity to associate with [Shell], in the defense and control of any claim, suit or proceeding relative to an occurrence where the claim or suit involves, or appears reasonably likely to involve [OIL], in which event [Shell] and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>[OIL] shall cooperate in all things in the defense of such claim, suit or proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">Travelers provided Shell\u2019s primary CGL insurance from 1948 to 1975. Travelers\u2019 policies specifically required it to defend Shell. The policies also provided that defense costs Travelers expended before paying its liability limit would be in addition to that limit. Travelers paid nearly $17 million towards Shell\u2019s defense in the underlying cases, but has not paid any part of its liability limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Travelers argues that because its policies contained a pollution exclusion after 1969, while OIL\u2019S policies expressly provided pollution coverage, OIL potentially provided Shell\u2019s only coverage for the underlying claims. Travelers contends that OIL therefore was in a primary insurer\u2019s position and had a duty to defend.  Travelers points out that an insurance carrier has to defend its insured whenever it ascertains facts\u2014from the complaint, the insured, or another source\u2014that show a potential liability within the policy\u2019s coverage. <em>(Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Insurance Co. </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 263, 275, 276-277 [54 Cal.Rptr. 104, 419 P.2d 168]; <em>CNA Casualty of California </em>v. <em>Seaboard Surety Co., supra, </em>176 Cal.App.3d at pp. 605-607.) However, this test does not apply to an excess insurer so long as the primary insurer has a duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In <em>Signal Companies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Harbor Ins. Co., supra, </em>27 Cal.3d 359, the Supreme Court considered defense cost allocation when the claim\u2019s settlement exceeded the primary insurer\u2019s coverage limit and required the excess insurer\u2019s participation. The insured there was one of many defendants in the underlying action, which sought $25 million in damages. The primary insurer spent $95,000 in defense costs and incurred almost all of these costs before the excess carrier was asked to contribute to a settlement. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 363-364, 365-366.) The primary coverage limit was $25,000, and the claim was settled for $35,000 when the excess insurer promptly agreed to pay $10,000. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 363-364.)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The court rejected the primary insurer\u2019s argument that the excess insurer should share the defense costs once it had notice that the claim might invade its coverage. <em>(Signal Companies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Harbor Ins. Co., supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 366.) The court noted that such a rule would require the excess insurer to contribute though there might never be excess liability and despite explicit provisions in the excess policy. \u201cThis would be contrary to that line of cases which hold that where there is excess coverage, whether by virtue of an excess clause in one policy or otherwise, it is the primary insurer which is solely liable for the costs of defense if the judgment does not exceed primary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>coverage. [Citations.] These cases have held generally that even though the <em>claim </em>against the insured may be for a sum in excess of the primary coverage, the primary insurer is obligated to provide a defense and may not seek contribution from the excess carrier even though its successful settlement or defense relieves the excess insurer from indemnifying the injured party. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 368, original italics.) Further, the court found no compelling equitable basis for shifting to the excess carrier costs that the primary carrier incurred mainly to discharge its own contractual obligations. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 370.)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Under <em>Signal Companies, </em>an excess insurer is not required to participate in the insured\u2019s defense simply because the underlying claim might involve the excess coverage. Moreover, OIL\u2019S policy stated that OIL \u201cshall not be called upon to assume charge of the settlement or defense of any claim . . . .\u201d When an excess policy contains this type of clause, the primary insurer ordinarily must defend until the litigation is resolved; only settlement or payment of the judgment extinguishes the primary insurer\u2019s duty to defend. <em>(Diamond Heights Homeowners Assn. </em>v. <em>National American Ins. Co. </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 563, 574, 577 [277 Cal.Rptr. 906]; <em>Chubb/ Pacific Indemnity Group </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of North America </em>(1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 691, 695-696, 698 [233 Cal.Rptr. 539].)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">We find no merit in Travelers\u2019 contention that the pollution exclusion in its later policies made OIL Shell\u2019s primary liability insurer for pollution claims. The exclusion was not absolute\u2014coverage was available for unexpected and unintended polluting events. OIL\u2019S pollution coverage also was not absolute\u2014it covered only pollution caused by an \u201coccurrence,\u201d i.e., an \u201cevent\u201d or \u201cexposure\u201d or \u201ccondition\u201d Shell neither expected nor intended. When we evaluate the duty to defend, these clauses do not necessarily relieve Travelers or involve OIL.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">As a primary insurer, Travelers had the initial duty to defend Shell in the underlying cases. Travelers\u2019 policies explicitly promised to defend Shell, while OIL\u2019S policies disclaimed this obligation. The claims against Shell were potentially within Travelers\u2019 coverage. Travelers\u2019 policies were \u201cother insurance\u201d under OIL\u2019S insuring agreements and were not exhausted. We conclude that OIL\u2019S policies were excess to Travelers\u2019 primary policies. Therefore, OIL could not have any duty to defend or contribute to defense costs unless the other insurance potentially covering the underlying claims was exhausted. <em>(Olympic Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Employers Surplus Lines Ins. Co. </em>(1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 593, 600-601 [178 Cal.Rptr. 908].)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Travelers also argues that equitable principles require OIL to contribute to Shell\u2019s defense. (Citing <em>Signal Companies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Harbor Ins. Co., supra, </em>27 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>Cal.3d at p. 369.) That court stated: \u201cWe expressly decline to formulate a definitive rule applicable in every case in light of varying equitable considerations which may arise, and which affect the insured and the primary and excess carriers, and which depend upon the particular policies of insurance, the nature of the claim made, and the relation of the insured to the insurers. [Citation.]  Moreover, we affirm the wisdom expressed in <em>Amer. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Seaboard Surety Co. </em>(1957) 155 Cal.App.2d 192, 195-196 [318 P.2d 84]: \u2018The reciprocal rights and duties of several insurers who have covered the same event do not arise out of contract, for their agreements are not with each other .... Their respective obligations flow from equitable principles designed to accomplish ultimate justice in the bearing of a specific burden. As these principles do not stem from agreement between the insurers their application is not controlled by the language of their contracts with the respective policy holders.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Signal Companies, supra, </em>at p. 369.) However, the court concluded that only compelling equitable considerations could justify requiring an excess insurer to reimburse a primary insurer despite contrary policy terms. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">Travelers has not shown compelling equitable considerations. It notes that its liability limits are less than one twenty-fifth of OIL\u2019S limits, but only Travelers contributed to Shell\u2019s defense costs. Travelers also contends that part of those costs defended Shell against first party pollution damages, thereby benefiting OIL. Lastly, Travelers claims Shell tried to shield OIL from liability to avoid a retrospective premium assessment. These matters do not compel us to override OIL\u2019S policy and require a contribution to the defense costs Travelers advanced to perform its own contractual obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Gross disparity between primary and excess liability limits does not create an equitable duty to contribute to defense costs. In <em>Signal Companies, </em>the primary policy\u2019s liability limit was $25,000, while the excess policy\u2019s limit was $10 million. <em>(Signal Companies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Harbor Ins. Co., supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 362.) Yet the court found no compelling equitable consideration requiring the excess insurer to contribute to the $95,000 defense costs paid by the primary insurer. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 364, 369-370.)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Like Travelers, the primary insurer in <em>Signal Companies </em>paid the defense costs to discharge its own contractual obligations. <em>(Signal Companies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Harbor Ins. Co., supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at pp. 369-370.) That case does not suggest that contribution is compulsory when some portion of the defense costs benefits the excess insurer. Indeed, the court noted that although a claim may exceed the primary policy limits, \u201cthe primary insurer is obligated to provide a defense and may not seek contribution from the excess carrier even though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>its successful settlement or defense relieves the excess insurer from indemnifying the injured party. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 368.)</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">We will not override OIL\u2019S policy terms merely because Shell tried to shield OIL. We do not decide what effect such conduct might have on insurers\u2019 equitable duties under different circumstances and policies. But regardless of Shell\u2019s motives for protecting OIL, we do not find that Shell\u2019s acts should alter the relationship between its primary and excess insurers or the duties they expressly assumed or refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">We also reject Travelers\u2019 alternative ground for appeal and find the trial court did not err in deciding the defense costs contribution issue as a matter of law.The trial court asked the basic question: \u201cWhat are the factual issues for the jury?\u201d Travelers\u2019 counsel told the trial court that whether OIL was potentially liable under its policies as a primary insurer for the Arsenal claims was a question of law. Travelers now claims the jury should have determined whether the facts underlying the Arsenal claims were potentially within the scope of the OIL policies. But Travelers does not identify any disputed facts that are material to the issue of <em>potential </em>coverage. Therefore, whether OIL had to contribute to Shell\u2019s defense costs was a question of law for the trial court. (See <em>California Shoppers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Royal Globe Ins. Co. </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 1, 35, 38 [221 Cal.Rptr. 171].) Furthermore, OIL is an excess insurer that cannot be required to defend Shell unless the underlying insurance is exhausted, which has not happened. Thus, any duty OIL might have to pay defense costs does not now depend on whether the Arsenal claims are potentially within OIL\u2019S coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">10. <em>Analysis of Prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">We must assess the effect of the erroneous \u201cexpect\u201d instructions. Instructional error alone is insufficient to overturn a verdict; the appellant must also show the error was prejudicial and resulted in a miscarriage of justice. <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Toyota Motor Co. </em>(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 364, 371 [243 Cal.Rptr. 611].)</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Assessing the effect of the error in this case is a complex and difficult task. Shell sought coverage from a sophisticated array of insurance policies for events spanning more than 30 years. Shell argued that there were six distinct pollution sources at the Arsenal, each an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policies, which began at different times for different reasons. Shell\u2019s pollution sources were: (1) various unspecified spills, (2) the cooling water lakes, (3) the waste burial trenches, (4) the contaminated waste sewers, (5) the unlined basins, and (6) the lined basin (Basin F). We will separately examine each claimed pollution source to determine if Shell suffered prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>A. <em>Rules for Determining Prejudice From Erroneous Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">An error in instructing the jury requires reversal of the judgment only when the reviewing court, \u201c \u2018after an examination of the entire cause, including the evidence,\u2019 concludes that the error \u2018has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Mitchell </em>v. <em>Gonzales </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1041, 1054 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 913, 819 P.2d 872]; <em>Weiner </em>v. <em>Fleischman </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 476, 490 [286 Cal.Rptr. 40 [816 P.2d 892].) We must determine if it is reasonably probable that the jury would have reached a result more favorable to Shell in the absence of the error. <em>(Mitchell, supra, </em>at p. 1054; <em>Weiner, supra, </em>at p. 490; <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].) \u201cThe test of reversible error has been stated in terms of the likelihood that the improper instruction misled the jury. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Weiner, supra, </em>at p. 490, citing <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Harnischfeger Corp., supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 670.)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">In <em>Henderson, </em>the court stated: \u201cGenerally speaking[,] if it appears that error in giving an improper instruction was likely to mislead the jury and thus to become a factor in its verdict, it is prejudicial and ground for reversal. [Citation.] To put it another way, \u2018[w]here it seems probable that the jury\u2019s verdict may have been based on the erroneous instruction prejudice appears and this court \u201cshould not speculate upon the basis of the verdict.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Robinson </em>v. <em>Cable </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 425, 428 [11 Cal.Rptr. 377, 359 P.2d 929]; see also <em>Luque </em>v. <em>McLean </em>[(1972)] 8 Cal.3d 136, 147 [501 P.2d 1163]; <em>Vistica </em>v. <em>Presbyterian Hospital </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 465, 471 [62 Cal.Rptr. 577, 432 P.2d 193]; <em>Oettinger </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 133, 140 [148 P.2d 19, 156 A.L.R. 1221].) As we observed in <em>Butigan </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co. </em>(1958) 49 Cal.2d 652, 660-661 [320 P.2d 500, 65 A.L.R.2d 1], \u2018The determination whether, in a specific instance, the probable effect of the instruction has been to mislead the jury and whether the error has been prejudicial so as to require reversal depends on all the circumstances of the case, including the evidence and the other instructions given.

The <em>LeMons </em>factors are: \u201c(1) the degree of conflict in the evidence on critical issues [citations]; (2) whether respondent\u2019s argument to the jury may have contributed to the instruction\u2019s misleading effect [citation]; (3) whether the jury requested a rereading of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>erroneous instruction [citation] or of related evidence [citation]; (4) the closeness of the jury\u2019s verdict [citation]; and (5) the effect of other instructions in remedying the error [citations].\u201d <em>(LeMons, supra, </em>at p. 876.)</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">However, if the judgment is the only one proper on the evidence, an erroneous instruction cannot be prejudicial. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 13; 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Appeal, \u00a7 350, at p. 352.) Where there are distinct, independent issues, an error on one might not affect another that the evidence established as a matter of law. (See <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Harnischfeger Corp., supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 674; cf. <em>Oettinger </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 133, 140 [148 P.2d 19, 156 A.L.R. 1221].)</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">B. <em>Applying the LeMons Factors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The insurers\u2019 counsel argued the case to the jury for two days. While they forcefully argued that Shell actually expected damage to result from its conduct, they also stressed the erroneous definition of \u201cexpect,\u201d arguing that Shell should have known it was polluting. Rereading or emphasizing the language of an incorrect instruction enhances the likelihood of prejudice. <em>(Bolen </em>v. <em>Woo </em>(1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 944, 952-953 [158 Cal.Rptr. 454].) Similarly, emphasizing evidence supporting the claim or defense covered by the instruction is likely to mislead the jury. <em>(Mitchell </em>v. <em>Gonzales, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at pp. 1054-1055.) The insurers\u2019 counsel did both in their closing arguments. Thus, the second <em>LeMons </em>factor\u2014whether the insurers\u2019 jury arguments contributed to the instructions\u2019 misleading effect\u2014suggests that the incorrect instructions prejudiced Shell on the affected issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The third <em>LeMons </em>factor\u2014whether the jury requested rereading of the instruction or related evidence\u2014provides no useful guidance in this case. The jury had a copy of the instructions to use during deliberations and did not ask for any rereading. Nor did it ask the court to clarify any instructions. The only evidence the jury asked for was the testimony by Shell\u2019s expert witness, who discussed the means, timing, and range of the Arsenal pollution sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">The fourth <em>LeMons </em>factor\u2014the closeness of the jury\u2019s verdict\u2014cannot help determine the erroneous instructions\u2019 effect. For the first 8 years for which Shell sought coverage, the jury\u2019s verdict was 11 to 1 that there was none; for the remaining years, it was 11 to 0, with 1 juror undecided. The error altered the showing the insurers needed to prove their exclusionary language applied. The nearly unanimous verdict could reflect that, under the objective standard, the jury found only that Shell should have known its waste disposal practices would cause property damage outside of the Arsenal. The verdict alone does not show a near consensus on whether Shell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>actually expected its wastes to damage the property of others. Under the instructions, the jury did not need to decide Shell\u2019s actual expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">The fifth <em>LeMons </em>factor\u2014the effect of other instructions in remedying the error\u2014points here towards prejudice. Not only was the error not corrected by other instructions; it was propagated throughout the instructions. Thirteen jury instructions included the words \u201cexpected\u201d or \u201cunexpected,\u201d or a term that was defined for the jury by using one of those words. Four of the instructions together effectively told the jury that Shell had no coverage if \u201cit should have reasonably been known by Shell that there was a high degree of certainty that damage to the property of another would result from [Shell\u2019s intentionally committed] act\u201d or if Shell \u201cshould have known that there was a substantial probability\u201d that property damage would result from its acts or omissions. Thus, with one exception discussed below, the other instructions did not remedy the error, but instead expanded its scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Two <em>LeMons </em>factors suggest the instructional error was prejudicial, while two provide no indication one way or the other. However, the first <em>LeMons </em>factor\u2014the degree of conflict in the evidence on critical issues\u2014is decisive in this case. The phrase, \u201cconflict in the evidence,\u201d refers to the closeness of the case, including the disparity in the parties\u2019 factual presentations and the inferences to be drawn. <em>(Mock </em>v. <em>Michigan Millers Mutual Ins. Co., supra, </em>4 Cal.App.4th at pp. 335-336.)  In assessing an instruction\u2019s prejudicial impact, we cannot use the view of the evidence and inferences most favorable to the insurers. <em>(Henderson </em>v. <em>Harnischfeger Corp., supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 674; <em>Clement </em>v. <em>State Reclamation Board </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 628, 643-644 [220 P.2d 897]; <em>Mock, supra, </em>at pp. 336-337.) Instead, we must assume the jury might have believed Shell\u2019s evidence and, if properly instructed, might have decided in Shell\u2019s favor. <em>(Henderson, supra, </em>at p. 674; <em>Clement, supra, </em>at pp. 643-644; <em>Mock, supra, </em>at p. 337.) These rules shape our review of the evidence on the six Arsenal pollution sources Shell asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">C. <em>Conflicting Evidence on the Pollution Sources</em></p>\n<p id=\"A0n\">i. <em>Spills</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Shell argues the insurers must, at least, cover the damage caused by spills of hazardous materials. Shell observes that spills usually are sudden and accidental, and that no evidence suggests Shell intended or expected them to occur. No evidence suggests Shell should have known particular spills would occur or would damage others\u2019 property. Shell showed that when a spill occurred inside its plant, it washed the material into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>chemical sewer with water. If the spill occurred outside, Shell contained and neutralized the material and dug up any affected soil, which it put in drums for disposal. Even so, Shell\u2019s expert witness testified that spill site residues were one source of pollution at the Arsenal.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Shell\u2019s evidence afforded slight proof that spills caused or threatened damage to property outside the Arsenal. The only substantive evidence that spills occurred outdoors also included the testimony on Shell\u2019s remedial measures. Shell\u2019s expert witness based his opinion on that testimony and a list of spills that was not in evidence. The only specific spill the expert discussed was not taken from trial testimony and was not stated to be a spill of a Shell chemical. The expert did not offer his basis for saying that spill cleanups left a residue of contaminants. Thus, there was scant evidence that spills of Shell chemicals constituted a property-damaging occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The evidence made it unlikely that the misinterpretation of \u201cexpected\u201d affected the jury\u2019s rejection of coverage for spills. There was no suggestion that Shell intended to spill hazardous materials. The absence of an intended act brought another jury instruction to bear on the spills issue. In defining the insurers\u2019 burden of proof on \u201cexpected or intended,\u201d the trial court told the jury: \u201cIf Shell did not intend to commit the act that caused the damage, then it cannot be said that Shell intended or expected the resulting damage.\u201d This instruction isolated the spills issue from the effect of the erroneous definition of \u201cexpect.\u201d We conclude there is no probability that the mistaken definition of \u201cexpect\u201d misled the jury on Shell\u2019s spills coverage claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">ii. <em>The Cooling Water Lakes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Three freshwater lakes lay just south of Shell\u2019s buildings at the Arsenal. These lakes supplied water Shell used to cool manufacturing equipment. Until 1965, when a closed loop system using a cooling tower was installed, Shell returned used water to the lakes. The death of wildlife around these lakes was a central theme of the insurers\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Soon after Hyman leased the lakes for pesticide manufacturing, ducks on the lakes died. In 1950, Dr. Hyman himself smelled his company\u2019s pesticides in the pipes that returned used water to the lakes. Approximately 1,200 ducks were killed in the spring of 1952. In November 1953, Shell\u2019s laboratory detected its pesticides in lake waters and noted that ducks could be poisoned, although the contamination\u2019s cause supposedly had been corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">In the mid-1950\u2019s, Shell and others found pesticide residues in dead ducks and lake algae. At about the same time, a caustic Shell chemical accidentally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>leaked into a return water pipe, killing the lakes\u2019 fish. Ducks continued to die during the 1950\u2019s and into the 1960\u2019s. Another Shell analysis in 1964 detected pesticides in lake snails and aquatic vegetation. To mitigate the wildlife problems and placate the public and state authorities, in 1964 the Army drained the lakes and scraped a foot of mud from the lake bottoms. The contaminated mud was dumped on the nearby ground and covered with dirt. At the same time, a reconfigured cooling system ended the return of used water to the lakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Shell does not deny that pesticides contaminated the lakes and killed ducks during the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s. However, Shell says it believed that the contamination\u2019s cause had been eliminated. Shell\u2019s prejudice claim turns on whether Shell\u2019s knowledge of the lakes\u2019 poisoning established that it expected to damage others\u2019 property. The evidence conflicted on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Shell believed that groundwater would not transport the Arsenal pesticide products through the soil. Although the products were persistent in the environment, they were highly insoluble in water, and Shell believed they would not migrate appreciably in soil. Moreover, the pesticides were used on fields of growing crops, and in 1965 Shell did not think they endangered soil.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Though the evidence could support a finding that Shell should have known the contaminated lakes were highly likely to cause damage, the record also could support a finding that Shell did not expect damage to result. We conclude, therefore, that the mistaken instructions probably misled the jury on this issue and prejudiced Shell. However, the evidence established that by 1970 Shell expected that pollutants would seep from the lakes and bottom mud buried nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">iii. <em>The Waste Burial Trenches</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Between 1952 and 1967, Shell dumped toxic waste solids and sludge in unlined trenches on a tract of Arsenal land known as Section 36. The Army had no control over what Shell buried in these trenches. The trenches were 10 feet deep, 20 feet wide, and 300 feet long. Heated heavy waste residues were poured like tar into the trenches. Shell also put drums of waste material into the trenches. A Shell labor gang member testified that waste drums, at times rusted or bent, were pushed off trucks into the trenches, where some popped open and released sludge. When a trench was nearly full, the material was covered with fuel oil and burned; the trench was then covered with dirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">In the fall of 1966, the Army told Shell to stop burning material in the open trenches because the dense black smoke caused air pollution complaints. Shell then began to store these wastes in drums on the ground in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>Section 36. By 1968, several thousand drums were stored on the surface; more than a thousand had no tops. The drums held over 200,000 gallons of contaminated wastes. Shell knew by December 1965 that some drums had deteriorated from exposure to the elements and that some were leaking. In 1968, the Army\u2019s Mr. Donnelly believed that Section 36 was so polluted that decontamination was impossible; it had been \u201cputrefied for eternity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Shell argues that this evidence does not show it knew that burying its wastes in trenches would damage others\u2019 property. Shell notes that there was no evidence that the burial trenches contaminated groundwater until Shell\u2019s expert witness\u2019s analysis in 1987. While negotiating with the Army in July 1965, Shell\u2019s representatives claimed that burying solid wastes in trenches did not threaten the groundwater because the wastes were practically insoluble. Although they acknowledged that the detergent in that waste might contaminate the groundwater, they said detergent was \u201calready in every stream in the United States.\u201d In that 1965 meeting, though, the Army told Shell not to bury wastes where groundwater would carry contaminants downstream.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Other evidence established that by the mid-1960\u2019s, Shell was fully aware of the contamination dangers inherent in its burial trench practices at the Arsenal. General Meetze, who had been the Arsenal\u2019s commanding officer in 1953 and was a consultant to Shell from 1964 to 1971, testified that Shell recognized those dangers in the mid-1960\u2019s. General Meetze helped design a chemical waste disposal system for another Shell plant in 1964. He testified that in 1964, discharging untreated chemical wastes onto the ground was not an option because they would be absorbed by the soil. He stated that in 1965, burying toxic material in shallow pits 10 or 15 feet underground was \u201cdefinitely verboten.\u201d He added that burying toxic material was poor practice because of \u201cleakage problems to the surrounding land,\u201d and because someone might later dig up the property, creating health problems for the diggers and others in the area. The general also testified that Shell clearly recognized these detriments.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">In 1966, Shell\u2019s agricultural chemical manufacturing manager also recognized the risk that leaking drums in Section 36 would contaminate groundwater. A 1968 Shell report said the waste drum storage problem had reached critical proportions. Although the report recommended burning the waste in an open pit, it also stated: \u201cThis disposal would be accomplished by utilizing an open earthen pit lined with an impervious lining to prevent contamination of the ground water. . . . The impervious lining should contain any material that is not decontaminated by the incineration, thus, making this proposal attractive to water pollution authorities.\u201d The report further confirms Shell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>knew the high probability of harm from its Section 36 waste disposal practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">There was no significant evidentiary conflict over whether Shell expected, after 1964, that its Section 36 waste disposal practices would contaminate the soil and groundwater. Shell knew it was discharging sludge wastes directly into the ground both before and after the Army ended the trench burnings. General Meetze testified Shell knew the dangers of doing this. By 1965, Shell expected that the wastes it dumped in Section 36 would eventually result in damage to others\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">We conclude that if the jury was given the proper definition of \u201cexpect,\u201d it is not reasonably probable that it would find Shell had coverage after 1964 for the Section 36 contamination from the wastes in the trenches and drums. However, we conclude from conflicting evidence on the earlier period that the jury probably was misled by the incorrect \u201cshould have known\u201d test for whether Shell expected its Section 36 waste disposal practices to cause property damage. After 1964, Shell certainly expected such damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">iv. <em>The Contaminated Waste Sewers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">The chemical sewer system carried aqueous wastes to the evaporation basins. The system was built in the early 1940\u2019s using vitrified clay pipes connected by treated hemp and cement joints. In the mid-1950\u2019s, a new section was installed to carry wastes to Basin F. Joints in the new section were sealed with a material believed better able to withstand chemicals than the older joints.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">In August 1953, Shell knew that the chemical sewers were sealed with concrete and were \u201cprobably put in as a wartime expediency . . . .\u201d At that time, Shell discovered that a product it made for the government had caused some sewer pipe to deteriorate badly. Nevertheless, Mr. Knaus, Shell\u2019s plant manager from 1965 to 1982, believed that the chemical sewer system was perfectly adequate for manufacturing pesticides because it was designed for chemical warfare agents. Mr. Donnelly, the Army\u2019s director of facilities for the Arsenal from the mid-1960\u2019s to the mid-1970\u2019s, said he knew of no systemwide leakage in the chemical sewers and that he first learned of spot leaks in late 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">However, Mr. Knaus also testified that from 1965 to 1981, he saw Shell repair and add to the chemical sewers. He stated that whenever they dug down to repair the sewer, they found the pipe had decomposed and collapsed under the weight of the earth above it. Mr. Knaus also stated that in every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>case, the soil near the broken pipe was darker and obviously contaminated, though within two or three feet of the pipe the soil looked good again.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">This testimony established that Shell knew that decomposing pipes caused recurring failures of the contaminated waste sewers. Because Shell knew the history of problems with deteriorating and decomposing pipes, we conclude that Shell must have expected sewer leaks, although Shell did not expect the leaked material to spread very far.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">This evidence and its divergent reasonable inferences conflict on whether Shell expected the leaking chemical sewers to damage others\u2019 property. We conclude that the mistaken \u201cexpect\u201d instructions probably misled the jury on this issue and prejudiced Shell. However, the evidence conclusively established that by 1970 Shell did expect the chemical sewers to leak, even if it did not expect the leaks to damage others\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">v. <em>The Unlined Basins</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Shell\u2019s liquid wastes went to four unlined basins, named Basins A, C, D, and E, from 1952 to 1957. There is no dispute that the Army and Shell deposited hazardous materials in the basins. Shell knew that liquid in the unlined basins would seep into the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Basin A, the primary unlined basin, was made by scraping topsoil from a natural depression in the ground and building a dike. The basin was not lined with any substance to prevent effluent from seeping into the ground. In 1943, Basin A started overflowing as the waste volume grew. Between 1950 and 1952, Basins C, D, and E were built the same way as Basin A to catch its overflow. Liquids in the unlined basins obviously seeped into the ground, and chemicals in the basins were believed to evaporate or percolate. Basin C was called \u201cstraw bottom\u201d because it would not hold water. A five- to six-foot-deep mixture of soil and clay underlay Basin A; soil under that contained more gravel. Mr. Donnelly testified that he believed any seeping organic chemicals would bind to the clay and gravel.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">The chemical sewers carried Shell\u2019s liquid wastes to Basin A. Between 1952 and 1956, Shell sent one million tons of its wastes into Basin A. Most of Shell\u2019s effluent waste was salt and water. However, Shell handled several hundred organic compounds during its years at the Arsenal.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>In June 1954, Shell was informed that crops on a farm two miles northwest of the Arsenal apparently were harmed by some chemical in underground water. The crop damage resembled that caused by excess salt or by a certain herbicide not made at the Arsenal.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">After the first crop damage reports, the Army had the University of Colorado (University) study the problem to identify its causes. Dr. Theodore Walker, a geology professor, examined a United States Geological Survey report on the Arsenal area\u2019s groundwater geology and asked area farmers about their water problems. The University\u2019s November 1956 monthly report stated: \u201cThe data obtained from these two sources of information make it evident beyond any reasonable doubt, in Dr. Walker\u2019s opinion, that the waste disposal practices at the Arsenal are responsible for at least a great part of the contamination of the ground waters in the area northwest of the Arsenal. Although the element or compound has not been determined that is directly responsible for the type of plant damage that is characteristic of crops which have been irrigated with the water, he believes it to be extremely likely that the damaging material is coming from the Arsenal waste products.\u201d This was a revised conclusion because Dr. Walker was told the Army\u2019s liaison, Mr. Cochran, would not accept the more emphatic original.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Mr. Cochran gave Shell the information in the University\u2019s monthly reports, though Shell did not directly get the reports. Earlier, in February 1955, Shell was informed that salts were the only well contaminants that could be detected, though it was apparent that another unknown material was damaging the crops. By July 1955, Shell had been informed that the recommended corrective measures would include sealing the basin bottoms and changing salt waste handling.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">In January 1956, the Army asked Shell how it planned to stop discharging salts into the basins. Shell\u2019s response ignored the specific request regarding salt elimination. Instead, Shell stated that it had reduced the amount of waste as much as its operations permitted and that it believed the components of its waste water were not becoming a public nuisance. During this time, Shell\u2019s chemical products were not detected in water samples from the affected area.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">To correct the problem, the Army began making a new asphalt-lined basin, Basin F, in 1955. However, Shell continued to send its effluent to the unlined basins until 1957, when they were finally drained into Basin F. After Basin F\u2019s completion, the unlined Basin A was still used as a collection pool for storm water runoff. In 1966, Shell\u2019s chemical manufacturing manager, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>based in New York, knew that storm water ran into the Arsenal basins and carried contaminants into the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">This evidence could easily lead a jury to conclude that Shell should have known that using the unlined basins was highly likely to damage others\u2019 property. However, little indicates that Shell expected using these basins would damage property outside the Arsenal before the June 1954 crop damage report. An inference that Shell expected such damage in 1954 or earlier depends primarily on later developments. The mistaken definition of \u201cexpected\u201d therefore probably misled the jury in evaluating Shell\u2019s knowledge from 1952 through 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">However, the record shows very different circumstances after 1954. By July 15, 1955, Shell\u2019s Arsenal plant manager knew that waste disposal in the unlined basins was contaminating groundwater outside the Arsenal. In a confidential memorandum on that date, the plant manager informed Shell\u2019s head office that the Army\u2019s independent consultant would recommend sealing the unlined basins, reducing the effluent flows to keep the basins from spilling over, and eliminating salt from the waste flow. The memorandum stated that \u201cmost of these recommendations appear to be a reasonable solution to their present problem . . . .\u201d Mr. Knaus testified that in the mid-1950\u2019s he knew from local newspapers that Basin A\u2019s leaking and the crop problems were related. Nevertheless, Shell continued to send its chemical and salt wastes to the unlined basins until 1957. Moreover, no effort was made to remove the residue left in the unlined basins after draining them into Basin F.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">We do not believe it reasonably probable that a properly instructed jury would find that, after 1954, Shell did not expect using the unlined basins would cause damage to others. Thus, we find that the instructional error did not prejudice Shell as to the jury\u2019s decision that Shell had no insurance coverage for property damage caused by use of the unlined basins for waste disposal and storm water runoff collection after 1954. We conclude the misinstruction did prejudice Shell\u2019s coverage claims for 1952 through 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">vi. <em>Basin F</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">The studies and recommendations made after the unlined basins contaminated the groundwater led the Army to construct the lined waste disposal basin, Basin F. Begun in 1955 and completed in 1956, Basin F was to be a holding pond until the wastes could be disposed of by other means. The basin lining was catalytically blown asphalt sprayed over the excavated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>ground to build up a rubbery membrane about three-eighths of an inch thick. A one-foot layer of soil over the liner protected it. Basin F was 10 feet deep and covered an area of 93 acres. Later, an earthen dike was built across one comer of the basin, creating a smaller area known as Little F.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">While Basin A was being drained into Basin F, Basin F\u2019s liner tore at the water line. The tear was fixed and the unlined basins were finally drained into Basin F by September 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The trial record shows a marked conflict over whether Shell knew Basin F was leaking in the mid-1960\u2019s. Shell\u2019s Arsenal plant manager acknowledged in July 1965 that with disposal of wastes in Basin F, \u201cthe chance of contamination of underground waters and of injury to human or animal life exists.\u201d In 1966, Shell\u2019s agricultural chemical manufacturing manager knew the Army wanted to stop using the basin because it was concerned about the liner and that the basin might be leaking. He also knew that even a small rupture in the basin could allow a significant contaminant release into the surrounding environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Robert Silber was with Hyman at the Arsenal from 1947, became Shell\u2019s assistant secretary, and remained a Shell consultant until 1967. Mr. Silber testified that he thought, and Shell staff generally knew, that in the mid-1960\u2019s a fault in Basin F\u2019s liner allowed seepage. Shell Chemical\u2019s former president testified that he understood in 1970 that insoluble organic chemicals and solvents would attack Basin F\u2019s liner, and that Shell sent wastes containing solvents to Basin F. In early 1970, Shell reports to the Army showed a 100-gallon-per-minute effluent flow into Basin F that contained 9 groups of inorganic substances and 12 groups of organic solvents and compounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">A December 1969 Army report said the soil cover and liner were missing from test holes in Basin F and Little F. The report suggested that the liner was dissolved by concentrations of hydrocarbons in the waste. Tests at two other locations found the liner intact, though its thickness varied from one-fourth to one-sixteenth of an inch. The report stated the liner was extremely elastic and showed no indication of deterioration. However, the report concluded that Basin F was a groundwater pollution source, but probably not a major one, with an \u201ceffective area for leakage\u201d of \u201cno more than 2 or 3 acres and perhaps only a fraction of an acre.\u201d A February 1970 Army report said that Basin F\u2019s distinctive odor had been detected in nearby test wells, that the waste in Basin F was incompatible with the liner material, and that \u201ca potential exists for increased pollution in the future.\u201d On May 20, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>1970, the Army\u2019s contract officer hand-delivered to Mr. Knaus a letter which stated, in part: \u201cOur engineers, after studying the results of the monitoring of Lake F, are of the opinion that the protective membrane has deteriorated in a number of places. It is their opinion that this deterioration must be due to the mix of products poured into the lake. It is now their premise that the contamination in Lake F may be oozing into the aquifer. Accordingly, emergency action is now indicated.\u201d The officer wrote down Mr. Knaus\u2019s immediate reaction to the letter and the program it outlined: \u201cWe have felt there would be something coming on this sooner or later, but we were hoping we would be able to hold out longer. We have been concerned about this contamination problem for some time. Only the Government could underwrite such a plan as this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">For its part, Shell relies on evidence that it did not believe that Basin F was leaking. Mr. Donnelly testified that he did not believe the basin ever leaked, although he never checked below the water line, and his inspections did find two places in Little F where the liner had liquefied. More than once, Mr. Donnelly told Mr. Knaus he thought that Basin F was not leaking. Mr. Knaus testified that to avoid harming the liner, Shell never intentionally put concentrated solvents or heavy organic chemicals into Basin F, though some got there. During the time that Shell used Basin F, Mr. Knaus did not believe it was leaking. Mr. Knaus believed that the Army questioned Basin F\u2019s integrity in 1970 to try to end Shell\u2019s favorable waste disposal contract, because the Army continued to use Basin F for over a decade.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Colonel Shear, the Arsenal\u2019s commanding officer from September 1969 to July 1971, did not believe Basin F was leaking, though he knew other Army officers disagreed, because he never had data that affirmatively proved leakage. A 1974-1975 Colorado Department of Health study concluded that although Little F appeared to be leaking, the main body of Basin F appeared to be sound and suitable for disposal of contaminated groundwater. Another 1975 study said it was premature to assume Basin F leaked, as test well analyses were inconclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Dr. William Adcock, a Shell chemical engineer involved in environmental issues at the Arsenal from 1970 to 1982, testified that he thought organic chemicals were the smallest part of Shell\u2019s effluent waste. He did not feel that the effluent\u2019s components would harm Basin F\u2019s liner. However, Shell\u2019s 1970 proposal to the Army for new lined basins included adding a treatment to remove light and heavy insoluble organic chemicals before sending the effluent to a basin. Shell\u2019s proposal stated: \u201cRemoval of organic materials will help insure that pond linings are not damaged by chemical attack. Since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>none of the available lining materials are resistant to all organic chemicals, their removal is essential for successful operation of the evaporative ponds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">During the 1970\u2019s, Dr. Adcock believed that Basin F was not leaking. From 1970 to 1978, he reviewed groundwater monitoring data that indicated the basin was not leaking. But Shell thought Basin F was the Army\u2019s facility, and so Shell did not inspect the liner. Also, Shell contends that the Army did not give its reports to Shell. However, the Army\u2019s director of facilities for the Arsenal, Mr. Donnelly, discussed waste problems with Shell\u2019s Arsenal management from time to time. In 1969, Shell\u2019s agricultural chemical manufacturing manager also knew about the Army\u2019s reports and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The divergent evidence on whether and when Basin F leaked made it reasonably probable that the jury was misled by the misdefinition of \u201cexpect.\u201d The jury had powerful evidence that Shell should have known Basin F leaked. But Shell could plausibly deny actual knowledge, from the mid-1960\u2019s to the mid-1970\u2019s, that Basin F polluted groundwater. We conclude that the misinstruction prejudiced Shell\u2019s claim that pollutants escaping from Basin F in the 1960\u2019s constituted a covered \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">However, we find compelling evidence that Shell expected some contamination would escape from Basin F. Shell knew its effluent waste contained chemicals that attacked the asphalt liner and knew that it was deteriorating. By 1970, Shell denied any existing leaks in Basin F at the same time it knew leaks were inevitable. Shell\u2019s knowledge forecloses any reasonable probability that the jury would have given Shell a more favorable verdict for the years 1970-1982 because of the policies\u2019 pollution exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">D. <em>The Effect of the Pollution Exclusions on Prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">After 1969, Shell\u2019s insurance policies contained several types of pollution exclusions applicable to the Arsenal claims. Most of these clauses excluded coverage for pollution unless the polluting event was \u201csudden.\u201d Travelers\u2019 policy excluded coverage if the \u201cemission, discharge, seepage, release or escape [of the pollutant] is either expected or intended . . . .\u201d The exclusions are not contingent on whether the insured expected or intended any property damage. Instead, the exclusions depend on the nature of the polluting event and the insured\u2019s knowledge or belief that a pollutant would escape. (See <em>U.S. Fidelity and Guar. </em>v. <em>Star Fire Coals, Inc., supra, </em>856 F.2d at p. 34; <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. </em>v. <em>Belleville Ind., supra, </em>555 N.E.2d at p. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>571; <em>Technicon Electronics </em>v. <em>American Home </em>(1989) 74 N.Y.2d 66 [542 N.E.2d 1048, 1050-1051].)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">This record convinces us that when a policy required a covered polluting event to be \u201csudden,\u201d Shell was not prejudiced by the erroneous definition of \u201cexpect.\u201d Except for Shell\u2019s claims concerning spills, none of the claimed pollution sources were \u201csudden\u201d events. Pollutants escaped from the lakes, the waste trenches and drums, the sewers, and the basins through long, continuous, and gradual processes. The history of the Arsenal\u2019s pollution leads us to conclude that it was not \u201csudden.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Moreover, by 1970, Shell expected that each asserted pollution source except the spills would release contaminants into the surrounding soil. Travelers\u2019 exclusion applies if the insured expected a contaminant to be released. The exclusion does not depend on a belief that the pollutant will travel far or that its escape will harm others. The exclusion\u2019s application requires only that a pollutant\u2019s escape from containment be expected. We conclude that by 1970, Shell expected its toxic wastes at the Arsenal would escape from their containment.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Our review of the record shows no reasonable probability that a properly instructed jury would find that Shell had any coverage for the Arsenal claims under policies containing these pollution exclusions. Therefore, we affirm the judgment denying Shell coverage under those policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Conclusion and Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Shell\u2019s insurance claims for over 30 years of Arsenal pollution required the trial court to decide many issues. The trial court adopted an interpretation of \u201cexpected or intended\u201d damage that appeared to have broad support. However, we cannot reconcile an objective, \u201cshould have known,\u201d meaning for \u201cexpected\u201d with the California Supreme Court\u2019s <em>AIU </em>decision. That opinion emphasized that the ordinary and popular sense of the words used controls insurance policy interpretation unless the parties intended special or technical meanings. <em>(AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 822.) The record here will not support deviating from \u201cexpect\u2019s\u201d plain meaning, a meaning that does not include \u201cshould have known.\u201d \u201c[W]hatever the consequences we must accept the plain meaning of plain words.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1907) 206 U.S. 240, 244 [51 L.Ed. 1046, 1046-1047, 27 S.Ct. 620].)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">After reviewing the record, we concluded that the misinterpretation of \u201cexpect\u201d probably misled the jury on certain issues involving the policies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>issued to Shell before 1970. Therefore, the judgment must be reversed in part and remanded. We reverse the judgment on whether the following were property damage sources that constituted \u201coccurrences\u201d covered by policies issued to Shell before 1970: (1) the cooling water lakes; (2) the waste burial trenches and drums on Section 36, but only for those policies in force before 1965; (3) the chemical sewer system; (4) the unlined basins, but only for those policies in force before 1955; and (5) Basin F.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">We concluded that the error in defining \u201cexpect\u201d does not require us to reverse the judgment on the policies issued to Shell after 1969 with pollution exclusions applicable to the Arsenal pollution. There is no reasonable probability that a jury would find that after 1969, Shell did not expect contaminants to escape from the claimed pollution sources or find that any of those sources were \u201csudden\u201d polluting events. Therefore, we affirm the judgment on the policies containing those pollution exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">On Travelers\u2019 appeal, we hold that the trial court properly decided that OIL does not have to contribute to the defense costs Travelers advanced to Shell. On OIL\u2019S cross-appeal, we hold that the trial court properly interpreted ODL\u2019s \u201coccurrence\u201d definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The judgment is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">White, P. J., and Merrill, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Petitions for a rehearing were denied February 22, 1993, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above. The petitions of all appellants for review by the Supreme Court were denied May 13, 1993. Mosk, J., Panelli, J., and Baxter, J., were of the opinion that the petitions should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b497-8\">In addition to the three primary insurers, the defendants and respondents include over 50 insurance companies that issued excess policies to Shell and a group known in this case as Froude and Companies, made up of more than 400 Lloyd\u2019s of London underwriting syndicates and nearly 200 other insurance companies that subscribed to excess policies.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar7\">While this appeal was pending, we received notices of injunctions and stays issued in connection with receivership and liquidation proceedings involving the following defendants and respondents: Dart Insurance Company Ltd.; Kraft Insurance Company Ltd., formerly Dart and Kraft Insurance Company Ltd.; El Paso Insurance Company Ltd.; Lime Street Insurance Company Ltd., formerly Louiseville Insurance Company Ltd.; Mutual Reinsurance Company, Ltd.; Southern American Insurance Company; and Walbrook Insurance Company, Ltd.
