Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (a)). We hold the court erred in instructing the jury by defining a lewd or lascivious act as \u201cany touching\u201d with the required intent, since the law requires a sexual act, but the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">Self molested his seven-year-old niece, Stephanie, in the home of his mother, Carol.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">Carol testified as follows: She had sent Stephanie to wake Self, who was sleeping in a bedroom. Stephanie was wearing a bathing suit and T-shirt. When Carol subsequently looked into the bedroom, Stephanie was lying on her back on top of Self, who was also on his back. Stephanie\u2019s head was \u201csnuggled\u201d on Self\u2019s neck. They were \u201ckind of rocking back and singing,\u201d and Self was hugging her. His hands were on the inside of Stephanie\u2019s thighs.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">Carol testified the situation \u201cjust [didn\u2019t] look right,\u201d although she denied that Self\u2019s hands were where \u201ceverybody is insinuating.\u201d However, Stephanie testified Self touched her between her legs with his finger and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>moved Ms finger in circles, and she could feel Ms \u201cprivate\u201d under the bedsheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">In addition to instructing the jury on commission of a lewd or lascivious act upon a cMld under the age of 14 (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (a)), the court gave lesser included offense instructions on the misdemeanor offenses of annoying or molesting a cMld (Pen. Code, \u00a7 647.6) and battery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 242). The court initially rejected defense counsel\u2019s request for the lesser included offense instructions, ruling that the evidence only indicated a violation of section 288, subdivision (a), but the court ultimately gave the lesser instructions pursuant to agreement of counsel. Self contends the instructions did not adequately distinguish the two sex offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The sex offense instructions were based on CALJIC No. 10.41, fifth edition 1988, and CALJIC No. 16.440, fifth edition 1992 pocket part.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">CALJIC No. 10.41, on violation of Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a), states in pertinent part: \u201cEvery person who willfully and lewdly commits any lewd or lascivious act upon or with the body, or any part or member thereof, of a cMld under the age of 14 years, with the specific intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual desires of such person or of such cMld, is guilty of the crime of committing a lewd or lascivious act upon the body of a cMld in violation of section 288(a) of the Penal Code, [ft] A lewd or lascivious act is defined as <em>any touching </em>of the body of a person under the age of 14 years <em>with the specific intent to arouse, appeal to, or gratify the sexual desires of either party. </em>... [ft] In order to prove the crime, each of the following elements must be proved: [ft] 1. A person committed a lewd or lascivious act upon the body of a cMld, [ft] 2. The cMld was under 14 years of age, and [ft] 3. Such act was committed with the specific intent to arouse, appeal to or gratify the lust, passions or sexual desires of such person or of the cMld.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">CALJIC No. 16.440, on violation of Penal Code section 647.6, states: \u201cEvery person who annoys or molests any cMld under the age of 18 years is guilty of a misdemeanor, [ft] In order to prove such crime, each of the following elements must be proved: [ft] 1. That a person engaged in acts or conduct, directed at a cMld under the age of 18, wMch would unhesitatingly disturb or irritate a normal person, if directed at such person, and [ft] 2. Such acts or conduct were motivated by an <em>unnatural or abnormal sexual interest in the alleged child victim, </em>[ft] It is not necessary that the acts or conduct actually disturb or irritate the cMld, <em>or that the body of the child be actually </em>touched.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">These instructions distinguish the two offenses with regard to both act and state of mind: violation of Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a), reqmres <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>\u201cany touching,\u201d while violation of Penal Code section 647.6 does not require a touching; violation of section 288, subdivision (a), requires \u201cthe specific intent to arouse, appeal to or gratify the sexual desires of either party,\u201d while violation of section 647.6 requires only \u201can unnatural or abnormal sexual interest in the alleged child victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">The problem, Self argues, is that although Penal Code section 647.6 does not <em>require </em>a touching, some touchings may violate that statute without violating Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a), and these instructions did not provide adequate guidance for the jury to determine whether a touching constituted the felony or the misdemeanor. This point is supported by <em>People </em>v. <em>Wallace </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 586 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 67].)</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The court in <em>Wallace </em>concluded that CALJIC is incorrect in defining a lewd or lascivious act as \u201cany touching\u201d with the required intent. This is because the express language of Penal Code section 288 requires the commission of a \u201clewd or lascivious act\u201d separate and apart from the intent of the perpetrator. The <em>touching itself </em>must be lewd or lascivious. (11 Cal.App.4th at pp. 579-580; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 941, 947 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 530] [elements of \u00a7 288, subd. (a), are a \u201clewd touching\u201d with intent of sexual arousal].) Thus, \u201can innocuous or innocent touching even with the required intent will not suffice.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wallace, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at p. 568.) Otherwise, if \u201cany touching\u201d with the required intent were enough, \u201ca defendant could be convicted for his or her thoughts, regardless of his or her deeds.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 579.) <em>Wallace </em>proposes an instruction defining a lewd or lascivious act as a \u201csexual act,\u201d specifically \u201cany touching of the body of a child which to an objectively reasonable person is sexually indecent or tends to arouse sexual desire.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 579, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The reasoning in <em>Wallace </em>is sound. The court\u2019s holding leads to the inescapable conclusion that there was instructional error in the present case. The instruction on Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a), improperly defined a lewd or lascivious act as \u201cany touching\u201d with the required intent, and the two sets of instructions did not provide adequate guidance for determining whether a touching constituted a violation of section 288, subdivision (a), or Penal Code section 647.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">This type of error\u2014removal of an essential element of a crime from the jury\u2019s consideration\u2014constitutes a denial of federal due process and invokes the <em>Chapman </em>\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard for assessing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>prejudice. (11 Cal.App.4th at p. 580; see <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 711, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065].)  In the present case the error was harmless under the <em>Chapman </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Two witnesses\u2014Stephanie and Carol\u2014testified as to Self\u2019s conduct. (Self did not testify.) The conduct described by Stephanie was indisputably a violation of Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a). But even if Stephanie\u2019s testimony is disregarded, the conduct described by Carol in itself constituted a sexual act as required by <em>Wallace. </em>Carol described an intimate scene with an evident sexual aspect. Some elements\u2014such as the bedroom setting, the parties\u2019 positions in bed, the \u201csnuggling\u201d and the hugging\u2014might independently be characterized as innocent, but the placement of Selfs hands on the inside of Stephanie\u2019s thighs introduced a sexual taint and tied the various elements together into a scenario of sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">In <em>Wallace, </em>the instructional error was exacerbated because the prosecutor misled the jury by arguing that \u201c \u2018any\u2019 touching however innocuous such as brushing a child\u2019s hair or touching a child\u2019s arm with the requisite specific intent would satisfy the statute.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wallace, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at p. 580.) The opposite is the case here: although the prosecutor repeated the \u201cany touching\u201d language of the instructions, he also told the jury that a \u201clewd act\u201d was required, and he gave the example where \u201ca total stranger, or a relative, an uncle, okay, comes into the courtroom while you\u2019re sitting here on a break, and puts their hand between your legs, and moves the finger in a circular motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">In short, the testimony of both witnesses pointed to only one offense\u2014 violation of Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a)\u2014and the instructional error was mitigated by the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. Indeed, because the evidence was such that Self, if guilty at all, was guilty of violating only section 288, subdivision (a), the lesser included offense instructions were not even required. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 931, 959 [275 Cal.Rptr. 160, 800 P.2d 516].) The instructional error was thus harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Self also contends his conviction was unfair because purportedly more egregious conduct led to conviction of the lesser offense in <em>People </em>v. <em>Monroe </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 1205 [215 Cal.Rptr. 51] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(1955) 137 Cal.App.2d 197 [290 P.2d 40]. But there is no indication whether the defendants in those cases had been charged with violating Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a), and the question whether conduct constituted a violation of that statute was not considered. Thus, those decisions are not authority for the proposition that any conduct less egregious than in those cases cannot constitute more than a violation of Penal Code section 647.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Peterson, P. J., and Haning, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">A petition for a rehearing was denied February 19, 1993, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied April 21, 1993.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
