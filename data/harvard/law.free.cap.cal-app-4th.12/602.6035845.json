Proc., \u00a7 1094.5) against a decision of the California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Coastal Commission (Commission) approving and certifying a land-use plan (LUP) of real party in interest, the County of Mendocino (County), as consistent with the California Coastal Act of 1976 (Coastal Act or Act) (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 30000 et seq.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commission and County appeal from the court\u2019s issuance of a peremptory writ commanding the Commission to set aside its approval for failure to confer environmentally sensitive habitat area (ESHA) status (\u00a7\u00a7 30107.5, 30240) on pygmy forest areas. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The Coastal Act requires a coastal county to have a local coastal program (LCP), including an LUP, which meets the requirements of, and implements the provisions and policies of, the Coastal Act at the local level. (\u00a7\u00a7 30108.6, 30100.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">A county may ask the Commission to prepare all or part of an LCP (\u00a7 30500, subd. (a)), and that happened here. The County in 1978 asked the Commission to draft a coastal LUP (the coastal element of its general plan), and the Commission, after public hearings and input from staff and citizen advisory committees, produced a consultant-prepared draft in November 1980 (augmented with staff and committee comments in April 1981) for County review.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The draft in part identified \u201cpygmy\u201d and \u201cpygmy-type\u201d vegetation in the coastal zone, noting that its preservation was threatened: \u201cTwo types of pygmy vegetation exist along the Mendocino coast. Both are characterized by stunted trees but have different soil and vegetation types. True pygmy forests are valuable to scientists because they are probably the best example of a living community in balance with its ecosystem. Pygmy forest vegetation covers about 1,050 acres in the coastal zone, including areas in public ownership at Jughandle State Reserve and Van Damme State Park. Pygmy-type forest accounts for about 1,120 acres, mainly between Pt. Arena and Haven\u2019s Neck. Because pygmy vegetation is found in a section of the coast experiencing development pressures and because it yields no revenue from agriculture or timber, its preservation has become an issue. An immediate environmental concern is the ability of pygmy soils to provide satisfactory leaching fields for septic systems. Five acres per dwelling unit appears to be the maximum satisfactory density in pygmy soils, and an even lower density may be necessary in some areas. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>The draft did not mention ESHA status for those areas but included a policy limiting density to one housing unit every five acres and addressing the perceived leach-field problem.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">The County held its own public hearings on the draft, and its planning commission and board of supervisors adopted it with various revisions, none of which conferred ESHA status on the pygmy areas. The draft was referred by resolution to the Commission for certification consideration in late 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The Commission held a public hearing on the adopted LUP on May 8, 1985, and found substantial issue as to Coastal Act consistency. The Commission unanimously denied certification of the LUP as submitted, in part due to concern that ESHA designation was not given to pygmy forests.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The County had requested suggestions for curative modifications should certification be denied (\u00a7 30512, subd. (b)), and the Commission continued the matter for alternatives to be worked out. The County proposed mitigation measures short of ESHA designation (except where endangered species might be found), but a September 12,1985, Commission staff report adhered to the need for ESHA status for pygmy forests plus greater protection of pygmy and pygmy-type vegetation generally, including supporting soils.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The County responded formally, standing by its mitigation measures in lieu of ESHA designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>The Commission reopened consideration of the suggested modifications and took additional testimony at a lengthy hearing on September 26. At its conclusion, a divided Commission voted to approve the LUP as amended to include the County\u2019s mitigating measures rather than the staff proposals for ESHA designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The approved LUP regulated \u201cpygmy vegetation,\u201d limited to \u201cstunted forest\u201d and excluding pygmy-type vegetation or mere pygmy soils.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It denied ESHA status to regulated forests unless they contained rare or endangered plant species. However, development of pygmy vegetation land was limited to \u201clow density (defined as 2 to 5 acres),\u201d consistent with County water-quality and ecosystem regulations, with further study of environmental impacts to follow. Parcels \u201centirely within\u201d pygmy vegetation areas required planned development (PD) with measures designed to mitigate adverse environmental and septic concerns.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>After formal adoption of the modified LUP by the County\u2019s board of supervisors, the Commission on November 20, 1985, certified it and on February 7, 1986, adopted supporting findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">The Sierra Club meanwhile filed this action for writ of mandate in superior court two days after the November 1985 certification. The petition challenged in part the Commission\u2019s failure to require ESHA status for pygmy forest habitat. Due to the County\u2019s party status, venue was transferred by stipulation to Marin County (see \u00a7 30806, subd. (a)), where the court heard the matter in 1991, confined by then to the ESHA issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The court by a written decision concluded that the Commission\u2019s decision to certify the LUP without designating and treating the pygmy forest as an ESHA was not supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5, subd. (c)). The court ordered the issuance of a peremptory writ commanding the Commission to set aside its findings and order regarding pygmy forests, to set aside that part of the County LCP and to reconsider its action on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Our review is governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, which defines prejudicial abuse of discretion as an agency\u2019s decision being unsupported by its findings or its findings being unsupported by the evidence <em>(id., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>subd. (b)). Where support for findings is challenged, abuse of discretion exists if \u201cthe findings are not supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">\u201cThe \u2018in light of the whole record\u2019 language means that the court reviewing the agency\u2019s decision cannot just isolate the evidence supporting the findings and call it a day, thereby disregarding other relevant evidence in the record. [Citation.] Rather, the court must consider all relevant evidence, including evidence detracting from the decision, a task which involves some weighing to fairly estimate the worth of the evidence. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Lucas Valley Homeowners Assn. </em>v. <em>County of Marin </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 130, 141-142 [284 Cal.Rptr. 427]; <em>Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 149, fn. 22 [93 Cal.Rptr. 234, 481 P.2d 242].) That limited weighing is not an independent review where the court substitutes its own findings or inferences for the agency\u2019s. <em>(Strumsky </em>v. <em>San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 28, 32 [112 Cal.Rptr. 805, 520 P.2d 29].) \u201cIt is for the agency to weigh the preponderance of conflicting evidence [citation]. Courts may reverse an agency\u2019s decision only if, <em>based on the evidence before the agency, </em>a reasonable person could not reach the conclusion reached by the agency.\u201d <em>(McMillan </em>v. <em>American Gen. Fin. Corp. </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 175, 186 [131 Cal.Rptr. 462].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The County and Commission urge that the trial court misapplied the standard, improperly reweighing the evidence. However, the record as a whole fails to rebut the presumption that duty was regularly performed in that regard. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 664; <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 899, 913-915 [141 Cal.Rptr. 133, 569 P.2d 727].)</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Moreover, the whole argument is academic in the procedural posture of this case. Our review standard on appeal is identical to the trial court\u2019s. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number><em>(Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno, supra, </em>4 Cal.3d 130, 149 &amp; fn. 22.) Therefore, if substantial evidence supports the Commission\u2019s action, we reverse; if not, we affirm. Possible misapplication of the review standard below has no bearing on the outcome here. (Cf. <em>id., </em>at p. 149, fn. 22 [because the review standard on appeal was the same, any error in the trial court\u2019s use of an \u201c \u2018isolation\u2019 \u201d test for substantial evidence offered no ground for reversal].)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">At issue is whether substantial evidence supports the Commission\u2019s decision to deny ESHA status to pygmy forests. Section 30107.5 provides this two-part test for ESHA status (numbering ours): \u201c \u2018Environmentally sensitive area\u2019 means any area [1] in which plant or animal life or their habitats are either rare or especially valuable because of their special nature or role in an ecosystem and [2] which could be easily disturbed or degraded by human activities and developments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The consequences of ESHA status are delineated in section 30240: \u201c(a) Environmentally sensitive habitat areas shall be protected against any significant disruption of habitat values, and only uses dependent on those resources shall be allowed within those areas. H] (b) Development in areas adjacent to environmentally sensitive habitat areas and parks and recreation areas shall be sited and designed to prevent impacts which would significantly degrade those areas, and shall be compatible with the continuance of those habitat and recreation areas.\u201d Thus development in ESHA areas themselves is limited to uses dependent on those resources, and development in adjacent areas must carefully safeguard their preservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The Commission ultimately decided that pygmy forests do not require ESHA designation. Its findings acknowledge the unique qualities and value of pygmy forests and that adverse impacts can be expected from development. However, the findings also cite the facts that some pygmy forests along the coast are already protected and that the remainder, while not given full ESHA protection, will be partially protected through mitigation measures prescribed in the LUP, particularly the PD process, so as to minimize adverse impacts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Commission thus concluded that controls short of ESHA protection satisfy the Coastal Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>\n<em>Rare or valuable habitat</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Our review of the record shows that the pygmy forest is a rare or valuable habitat qualifying for protection under ESHA\u2019s first prong (\u00a7 30107.5). There is no substantial evidence to the contrary and no dispute about what characterizes the habitat.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Pygmy forest features severely stunted vegetation, with mature tree growth reaching just two to twelve feet. This is caused by a combination of highly acidic and nutrient-starved soils, cramped root growth, and winter flooding. It is an ecosystem dependent on that peculiar confluence of conditions and has evolved over the millennia on a series of rising, step-like marine terraces, each representing about 100,000 years of plant-soil succession. The surface soils, originally formed of beach deposits, allow rains to leach the soil of nutrients, while a layer of dense hardpan lying just beneath the surface traps Water, allowing it to stand. Horizontal layers of bedrock some 10 to 30 feet down aggravate the effect. During winter months of heavy rains, this creates prolonged flood-like conditions, a shallow water table just beneath the surface. On the upper terraces, the hardpan is also impenetrable to roots, creating a natural bonsai-like condition which, together with the poor soil nutrients, stunts growth. Trees like the Mendocino cypress and Bolander pine are among those which have managed to adapt in the hostile habitat.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>The record conclusively shows pygmy forest to be a rare and valuable habitat. The Commission\u2019s own findings call it \u201ca unique ecosystem\u201d (fn. 8, <em>ante) </em>and echo expert testimony that it \u201callow[s] scientists to review \u2018the longest and most complete record of geological plant succession know[n]\u2014 between one-half and one million years.\u2019 \u201d The habitat is the subject of worldwide scientific interest and study, plus lay interest, drawing 45,000 visitors yearly to stands of pygmy forest in the Jughandle State Reserve alone. The habitat is unique in the world and is found almost exclusively within Mendocino County. (The record indicates that some areas of pygmy soils have been identified in Sonoma County, where they are protected against all development.) The County has 1,050 acres of it, some amount of that being not in the coastal zone, but further inland.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Arguing against the rare-or-valuable-habitat prong, the County and Commission point to evidence and findings that significant portions of pygmy forest are already preserved in Jughandle State Reserve, Van Damme State Park and Russian Gulch State Park. However, this hurts more than helps them. The fact that, as the Commission found, the Pygmy Forest Reserve in Jughandle State Reserve \u201cwas designated as a National Registered Natural Landmark\u201d in 1969, hardly justifies the denial of ESHA status to the few pygmy forest habitats existing elsewhere in the county. Nothing in the Coastal Act allows denial of ESHA status to rare or valuable habitats just because they are partially protected outside the aegis of the Act. The Act demands the permanent protection and maintenance of coastal zone resources (\u00a7\u00a7 30001, subds. (a)-(c), 30001.5, subd. (a)), with heightened protections for ESHA\u2019s (\u00a7 30240). To allow the destruction of ESHA areas through development simply because some of the habitat is preserved in parks would undermine the protective goal. It would relegate parts of rare habitat to parks and hasten the same habitat\u2019s loss elsewhere. We reject that view of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">We are also not persuaded that the existence of pygmy forest areas <em>outside the coastal zone </em>allowed the Commission to discount the overall habitat\u2019s special value or rarity. The Commission, noting some uncertainty about existing inventories and mapping of pygmy forest areas, found that there were about 1,050 acres of it situated on sea-cut terraces \u201cin and out\u201d of the coastal zone between Fortt Bragg and the Navarro River, some found in \u201cscattered patches.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Commission did not find <em>how much </em>acreage is outside the coastal zone. However, it is clear from all record descriptions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>the habitat (i.e., that they were formed from beach soils on marine terraces along the coast) that the areas lying outside the coastal zone are near it. The habitat is a coastal phenomenon, but the Act\u2019s exacting definition of \u201ccoastal zone\u201d (\u00a7 30103, subd. (a) [inland 1,000 yards from the mean tide line or, in some areas, the lesser of 5 miles or the distance to the first major ridgeline]) will often arbitrarily divide such a habitat.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The point here is that pygmy forest appears from the record to be a uniquely coastal habitat. The fact that \u201csome\u201d undetermined part of it extends over the coastal zone boundary cannot excuse the Commission\u2019s failure to find it a rare or especially valuable habitat meriting ESHA status. There is no merit to the suggestion in the Commission\u2019s briefing that ESHA status is reserved for \u201ca unique, rare ecosystem found <em>only </em>in the coastal zone\u201d (italics ours). The existence of a habitat throughout a county would obviously affect whether that habitat, as found in the coastal zone, is rare or valuable. However, our record merely shows a coastline habitat which in places extends over the coastal zone line.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The Commission and County cite testimony by landowner Jacques Heifer: \u201c[T]he Pygmy Forest is not one forest. It\u2019s a scattered patch of pieces of Pygmy Forest. The very best corridor with large segments of each of the five terraces is that transect at Jug Handle Creek and that has been preserved. [\u00ae There are in addition significant patches of Pygmy Forest in Russian Gulch State Park and in Van Damme State Park, completely protected. It is not necessary to protect every last patch of Pygmy Forest. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">A recurrent theme in the briefing is that, given the Commission\u2019s supported findings that pygmy forest existed in \u201cscattered patches\u201d and that significant patches were already protected (fn. 9, <em>ante), </em>the Commission was entitled to conclude that not \u201call\u201d patches of pygmy forest had to be given ESHA protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The trouble with the argument, however, is that the Commission refused to give ESHA status to <em>any </em>pygmy forest. The Commission and County are caught up in hyperbole, accusing their opponent of wanting all pygmy forest protected, regardless of how scattered or transitional the patches. The court\u2019s judgment ordered no such thing. The court used the term \u201cpygmy forest,\u201d which has been used in this litigation and most of the administrative proceedings to denote full pygmy forest, not mere pygmy-type vegetation or soils (see fns. 2 and 9, <em>ante). </em>The court did not direct which areas must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>designated pygmy forest or what criteria best defined those areas. The court simply found no substantial evidence for, and therefore reversed, a \u201cdecision to certify the [LUP] without designation and treatment of the pygmy forest as [an ESHA].\u201d It did not pass on the question whether ESHA status had to be conferred on \u201cpygmy-type\u201d areas or what lesser protections for them might be consistent with the Act. Those issues are likewise not before us here. The judgment reversed and remanded for further Commission proceedings, carefully preserving agency discretion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">We agree that there is no substantial evidence to support denying ESHA status to pygmy forest on the rare-or-valuable element of the statutory definition.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\n<em>Degradation by development</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">We also agree that no substantial evidence exists to rebut the showing below that pygmy forest is \u201ceasily disturbed or degraded by human activities and development\u201d (\u00a7 30107.5), the second statutory element.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Abundant expert testimony attests to the habitat\u2019s easy degradation by development. Most obviously, vegetation removal directly destroys it, but there are insidious hidden effects. Botanist Robert E. Sholars, a noted authority on the habitat, summarized the problems: \u201cRoads, ditches, wells, and septic systems further chop up and degrade the habitat. . . . This plant community that has been remarkably stable for hundreds of thousands of years is extremely vulnerable to erosion following vegetation removal, and to the lowering of the water table by wells, diversions, and drainage. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>nutrient-laden discharge from septic systems undoes in years many millennia of natural leaching. . . Sholars had seen pygmy forest destruction \u201cat an alarming rate.\u201d While the forest had once occupied about 4,000 acres at 28 locations, an inventory he helped take of those sites in 1983 revealed that 14 were \u201ceither destroyed or severely degraded. None were entirely undisturbed. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Those views were shared by retired Professor Hans Jenny, who had taught in the plant and soil biology department at the University of California, Berkeley, and had published several papers on the pygmy forest. He testified having \u201cobserved its destruction by the indiscriminate construction of buildings and homes\u201d and possessing \u201cdocumentation that leach lines from septic tanks alter the composition of the Forest by enriching it in nitrogen and phosphorus which eventually will destroy its character.\u201d Retired soils morphologist Rodney Arkley explained that the limited depth of the soils causes polluted water to collect and work its way down stepwise, from terrace to terrace toward the sea.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Slides presented by Dr. Sholars showed disruption from drainage installed to permanently lower the water table for house construction. Mendocino cypresses growing in septic effluent for only five years had grown to triple the height of their sixty-year-old counterparts several hundred feet away. He described a \u201clong term ecosystem that is changing rapidly\u201d due to development pressures. Other speakers and writers mirrored those concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Some arguably contrary views were voiced, but they lack substantiality for the speakers\u2019 apparent lack of training or other qualifications. A County supervisor, for example, revealed no basis for his view that development would not harm \u201cthe soils themselves. Nutrients are rapidly passed through to only that foliage in close proximity . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The County and Commission attack the expert testimony as relating only to degradation by indiscriminate, uncontrolled development. The pertinent question, in their view, is whether pygmy forests would be easily degraded by development <em>as limited in the LUP </em>through the PD process and other controls. They note testimony that development <em>so limited </em>would protect pygmy forest against significant degradation. The Commission made a finding (No. 8) to that effect, anticipating \u201cadverse impacts\u201d but none \u201csubstantial enough\u201d to warrant ESHA protection unless rare or endangered plant species were present (fn. 8, <em>ante).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">We hold that to reformulate the easy-degradation element in that way violates the Coastal Act intent. Habitat which is both (1) \u201crare or especially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>valuable\u201d and (2) \u201ceasily disturbed or degraded by human activities and developments\u201d is an ESHA (\u00a7 30107.5). An ESHA \u201cshall be protected against any significant disruption of habitat values, and only uses dependent on those resources shall be \u00bflowed within those areas\u201d (\u00a7 30240, subd. (a)). Converting the phrase \u201ceasily disturbed or degraded by . . . developments\u201d into \u201ceasily disturbed or degraded by [well-controlled] developments,\u201d as the Commission would have it, distorts the plain language of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Moreover, it halves the Act\u2019s protections. ESHA status demands (1) protection against significant disruption of habitat values and (2) allowance of resource-dependent uses only (\u00a7 30240, subd. (a)). If ESHA status could be avoided by having only \u201cwell-controlled\u201d development\u2014which in essence protects against significant disruption (i.e., protection (1))\u2014the habitat would never be restricted to resource-dependent uses (i.e., protection (2)). That violates the Act, which in demanding protection against \u201csignificant disruption\u201d assumes that this protection is <em>in addition to </em>the use limitation. The LUP in this case, for example, may provide significant habitat protection, but it allows non-resource-dependent (residential) development in violation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Finally, allowing ESHA status to depend on the degree of development protection found in an LUP could result in a habitat enjoying ESHA status in one part of a county coastal zone (e.g., where strict PD controls exist) and not in others. This would be a curious result for a statutory scheme which appears to demand uniform treatment and protections for all ESHA\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\n<em>\u201cTaking\u201d concerns</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The County contends that the Commission was entitled to balance concerns that granting ESHA status might constitute a prohibited taking of private property without just compensation (U.S. Const., 5th &amp; 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 19) and withhold ESHA designation on that basis. Ironically, the Commission itself does not advance this argument. In fact, it urged in the court below that development restrictions were proper concerns but agreed that no taking had yet occurred and that such issues were not ripe, i.e., could not be determined until actual permit applications were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">We agree that there were no actual takings concerns for the Commission to have \u201cbalanced\u201d at the ESHA-designation stage. The County relies on section 30010, which expresses a legislative intent that the Coastal Act <em>not </em>grant the Commission or any county the \u201cpower to grant or deny a permit in a manner which will take or damage private property for public use, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>the payment of just compensation therefor. . . .\u201d However, that does not support the anticipatory sort of takings balancing advocated by the County. The section appears designed to foreclose any claim that the Coastal Act authorizes takings <em>without compensation, </em>a construction which would leave the Act open to a facial challenge. <em>(Southern Pacific </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 922 F.2d 498, 505-507; cf. <em>Williamson Planning Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Hamilton Bank </em>(1985) 473 U.S. 172,194-195 [87 L.Ed.2d 126,143-144, 105 S.Ct. 3108].) It does not ask the Commission to balance takings concerns in ESHA decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Further defeating the County\u2019s construction, section 30010 speaks of permit-stage actions, not LUP or LCP approvals.  This is consonant with the judicial view that takings decisions must await as-applied challenges and are usually not ripe until the permit stage. \u201c[I]f a State provides an adequate procedure for seeking just compensation, the property owner cannot claim a violation of the Just Compensation Clause until it has used the procedure and been denied just compensation.\u201d <em>(Williamson Planning Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Hamilton Bank, supra, </em>473 U.S. 172, 195 [87 L.Ed.2d 126, 144]; see also <em>First Lutheran Church </em>v. <em>Los Angeles County </em>(1987) 482 U.S. 304, 312, fn. 6 [96 L.Ed.2d 250, 261-262, 107 S.Ct. 2378].) Both the over-regulation <em>and </em>just-compensation components of a regulatory taking claim generally require final administrative action as to specific land. <em>(McDonald, Sommer &amp; Frates </em>v. <em>Yolo County </em>(1986) 477 U.S. 340, 348-350 [91 L.Ed.2d 285, 293-295, 106 S.Ct. 2561].) If vague, anticipatory takings concerns guided ESHA determinations at the LUP-approval stage, then sections 30107.5 and 30240 might never have force.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Finally, the takings concerns cited by the County are not manifested in the record. The Commission made no findings on point. It observed that ESHA development would be limited to resource-dependent uses (\u00a7 30240, subd. (a)), but it did not articulate actual concern over takings. Findings to support such concerns are therefore lacking. (See fn. 8, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">There was some discussion at the September 1985 hearing about the feasibility of using transferred development credits (TDC\u2019s) to offset development restrictions, implying a general concern about takings, but the exchange was narrowly focused. When Steven Horn of the State Coastal Conservancy testified that \u201cdensity transfer\u201d programs were a \u201cdifficult and uncertain\u201d approach due to difficulty in finding receiver sites, he was addressing specific density transfers being proposed for other aspects of the LUP. Commission staff analyst Woodruff later clarified that the State Coastal Conservancy had not been invited to consider a program for pygmy forests. A second staff analyst, plus two commissioners, then expressed optimism that a program could be worked out for pygmy areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>The record strongly suggests, moreover, that a program could be of relatively modest scope for pygmy areas. A limited amount of acreage in the coastal zone is involved, and most of it, according to a County supervisor, is held in small parcels, the largest being about 100 acres. Staff analyst Woodruff estimated that there may be fewer than 10 parcels \u201centirely within pygmy soil\u201d as mapped. He also noted that pygmy areas years ago had been deemed \u201cuninhabitable and sold at the lowest prices in small acreages,\u201d at $500 to $1,000 an acre, to people who could not afford to buy elsewhere. Botanist Robert Sholars concurred, calling those areas formerly the \u201cleast desirable residential\u201d ones. He elaborated that \u201cbecause of severe soil problems in\u2014eluding protracted flooding of a soil during the winter it\u2019s an absolutely terrible location for development.\u201d Commissioner Wornum called pygmy \u201cin the past the most least <em>[sic] </em>regarded of land,\u201d noting the irony of current interest in ESHA status. The scant record we have thus does not suggest high investment expectations or real threatened takings claims by pygmy forest landowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Accordingly, we reject \u2018taking\u201d concerns as not relied upon, unripe for decision and undeveloped in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\n<em>Coastal development needs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The County invokes what it asserts is statutory authority to balance coastal development needs against the need for ESHA designation. It relies on statements in the Coastal Act that its goals are to protect and maintain the coastal zone environment \u201cwhere feasible\u201d (\u00a7 30001.5, subd. (a)), to assure \u201cbalanced utilization\u201d of its resources \u201ctaking into account the social and economic needs of the people of the state\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (b)) and to have conflicts between policies resolved \u201cin a manner which <em>on balance </em>is the most protective of significant coastal resources\" (\u00a7 30007.5, italics added).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The trial court reasoned that the specific two-part test of section 30107.5 left no room for \u201cbalancing\u201d economic and environmental interests. However, we need not go so far to uphold the judgment. We can assume arguendo that some such balancing, while usually undertaken at the permit/ project stage (e.g. <em>Gherini </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com. </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 699, 708 [251 Cal.Rptr. 426]; <em>City of Chula Vista </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 472, 496 [183 Cal.Rptr. 909]; <em>City of San Diego </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com. </em>(1981) 119 Cal.App.3d 228, 233-234 [174 Cal.Rptr. 5]; <em>Bel Mar Estates </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com. </em>(1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 936, 942 [171 Cal.Rptr. 773]), might extend to ESHA decisions at the LUP-approval stage. Generally, the Commission must consider the basic goals of section 30001.5 when deciding whether to certify an LUP. (\u00a7 30512.2, subd. (b); <em>City of Chula Vista </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>133 Cal.App.3d at p. 481, fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Still, there is nothing in this record showing a particular need to allow coastal development on pygmy forest acreage. Without such evidence, the County is elevating broad policy criteria into specific justification for a particular ESHA decision. The only economic \u201cevidence\u201d cited, in fact, is what the County cites to support the asserted takings concerns, which we have rejected as insubstantial and unripe for serious consideration. Also, the Commission made no finding that the public welfare demands development of pygmy forest areas in the coastal zone (see fn. 8, <em>ante), </em>and its decision not to grant ESHA status to <em>any </em>such areas would have required a supporting determination that <em>all </em>such areas required development, an idea which even the County does not advance. The Commission\u2019s action is thus unsupported by findings or evidence, even if economic need was in theory a valid consideration in the ESHA decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The judgment is affirmed. Our record shows that the Sierra Club moved concurrently with the judgment for an award of attorney fees (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1021.5) and costs, and the parties advise us that they subsequently entered a stipulated judgment for that purpose on November 15, 1991, with this appeal to determine the prevailing party. Having now confirmed Sierra Club\u2019s prevailing-party status, we direct the superior court to proceed consistently with the stipulation below and to determine and make an additional award for the successful defense of the judgment on this appeal (cf. <em>Citizens Against Rent Control </em>v. <em>City of Berkeley </em>(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 213, 236 [226 Cal.Rptr. 265]).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Kline, P.

Rules of Court, rule 23) consisting of a draft report, Water Quality and Ecosystem Impacts from Development in Areas of Pygmy Vegetation, prepared for the County by Questa Engineering Corporation of Point Richmond, California, with state and federal financial assistance. The draft, dated March 1992, was not before the Commission or court below. Also, it is only a draft, subject to modification, and does not definitively compel a reversal with directions, as it must to warrant consideration. <em>(Tupman </em>v. <em>Haberkern </em>(1929) 208 Cal. 256, 280 [280 P. 970]; <em>Spaulding </em>v. <em>Cameron </em>(1952) 38 Cal.2d 265, 270 [239 P.2d 625]; <em>Estate of Schluttig </em>(1950) 36 Cal.2d 416, 422 [224 P.2d 695]; <em>Monsan Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pogrebneak </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 826, 830-831 [258 Cal.Rptr. 676].) In fact, much of the report supports the judgment.

Although the County\u2019s adopted policy section 3.1-20 states that parcel sizes in pygmy forest areas can be 2 and 5 acres, the impact of this is minimal: the only RR-2 and RR-5 pygmy areas are those already divided into small parcels. Other pygmy areas are designated as low density RR-10, RMR-20, RMR-40 and FL-160.

The County recognizes that pygmy forests which contain a species of rare or endangered plants are to be accorded ESHA status and that the protections of Section 30240(a) would apply to those areas.

The finding that pygmy forest \u201chas already been extensively developed as a residential area\u201d (No. 4) is a reason to <em>grant </em>ESHA status, not deny it. <em>(Coastal Southwest Dev.

The finding that ESHA status would restrict development mainly to scientific study (No. 5) adds nothing; the Act demands that protection as an overriding policy (\u00a7 30240, subd. (a)).
