J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANh\">The People, by petition for a writ of mandate<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, seek to vacate a sentencing order requiring Bryan Scott Peterson to serve 200 days in the custody of a private, noncontract work furlough facility. The People contend under Penal Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> section 1208, only the work furlough administrator has the discretion to place a convicted person in a work furlough facility and any private facility must be under contract to serve as a place of confinement for county prisoners. Peterson argues his placement in work furlough is proper as a reasonable condition of probation under section 1203.1 and authorized by section 2900.5, subdivision (f). We conclude the court lacked jurisdiction to place Peterson in work furlough either directly or as a condition of probation. Additionally we determine a noncontract facility may not be used for custody of county prisoners. Accordingly we grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">El Cajon police officers searched Peterson\u2019s residence pursuant to a warrant on March 12, 1992. They found approximately eight pounds of marijuana, two rifles and nunchaku. Peterson was charged with possessing marijuana for sale while armed with a firearm (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11359; \u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1)), possessing a firearm as a felon (\u00a7 12021, subd. (a)) and possessing nunchaku (\u00a7 12020, subd. (a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Under a negotiated plea, Peterson pled guilty to possessing marijuana for sale and the People dismissed the remaining charges. The People agreed not to oppose local time.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">At sentencing on July 15, the probation officer recommended Peterson be granted probation \u201cwith a substantial period of custody, a fine, and drug conditions to include search, testing, and registration.\u201d The People agreed with a grant of probation but requested Peterson serve 270 days in jail, objecting to private work furlough. Peterson requested probation and presented an \u201cacceptance letter\u201d from E &amp; J &amp; Associates Rehabilitation Center (E &amp; J facility), a private work furlough facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">The court suspended sentence and placed Peterson on five years\u2019 formal probation. It committed him to the custody of the sheriff for a period of 200 days, stating \u201cYou may serve the balance of your custody at E &amp; J.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Peterson was ordered to report on July 30 to the furlough facility. This petition followed. We issued an order to show cause on September 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The People challenge the sentencing order on three grounds; the court lacked jurisdiction to place a convicted person directly in work furlough, either for custody purposes or as a condition of probation, and a noncontract facility may not be used as a place of confinement for county prisoners. Peterson argues extraordinary relief is unwarranted because even if the court erred in placing him directly in work furlough rather than in the custody of the sheriff, it could have ordered work furlough as a condition of probation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n                   We are guided by the principle a sentencing court has a duty to impose the punishment prescribed by law and has no discretion to deviate from that punishment. (\u00a7 12<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lara </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 570, 574 [202 Cal.Rptr. 262].)</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">I. <em>Direct Placement in Work Furlough.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">\n<em>Penal Code section 1208.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">The Legislature created the work furlough alternative to jail confinement in 1957, the \u201cCobey Work Furlough Law,\u201d codified in section 1208.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Stats. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>1957, ch. 1580, p. 2932.) Section 1208 provides the board of supervisors of each county determines whether a work furlough program is feasible in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>county<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>. The board then designates a \u201cwork furlough administrator\u201d and a \u201cfacility for confinement of prisoners classified for the work furlough program . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1208, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">Originally section 1208 allowed the sentencing court to determine a prisoner\u2019s eligibility for work furlough. However, in 1965, the Legislature transferred this power from the court to the work furlough administrator. (See Historical Note to West\u2019s Ann. Pen. Code former \u00a7 1208, Stats. 1965, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>ch. 642, \u00a7 1, p. 1993.) The administrator now determines whether a particular prisoner is a fit subject for work furlough, job training and/or education, \u201cunless the court at the time of sentencing or committing has ordered that the person not be granted work furloughs.\u201d (\u00a7 1208, subd. (b).) Custody of the person is then transferred from the sheriff or Department of Corrections to the work furlough administrator. If the prisoner violates conditions of the furlough program, the administrator may order the remainder of the sentence to be spent in \u201cactual confinement.\u201d (\u00a7 1208, subd. (g).)</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The People contend under section 1208 the court\u2019s power is limited to recommending or precluding a convicted person\u2019s placement in work furlough. They rely by analogy on <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Hubbard) </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 287 [281 Cal.Rptr. 309], involving a similar statutory scheme for electronic home detention under section 1203.016.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">In <em>Hubbard </em>a defendant convicted of driving under the influence was required to serve a minimum of 180 days in county jail as a condition of probation under Vehicle Code section 23176. However, the sentencing court ordered the probation department to arrange for the defendant to be placed in a home monitoring program. The order was invalid because, although the defendant may have been eligible to participate in the program, under section 1203.016 the determination of eligibility was within the discretion of the chief probation officer rather than that of the sentencing judge. (230 Cal.App.3d at p. 298.)</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">We agree with the People the statutory scheme for home detention parallels that of work furlough and the sentencing court\u2019s power is limited as in <em>Hubbard. </em>Both programs must be authorized by the board of supervisors and run by a correctional administrator. Similar to work furlough, a sentencing court may only restrict or deny an inmate\u2019s participation in home detention. (\u00a7 1203.016, subds. (a), (f) &amp; (h)(1).) Moreover, vesting placement authority in correctional officials is consistent with the traditional notion that a sentencing court\u2019s function is confined to a determination whether incarceration is appropriate, not to specify detention in any particular institution. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Graham </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 736, 745 [149 Cal.Rptr. 6].) The manner of execution of sentence, including a determination of the place of incarceration, is vested in correctional officials. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lara, supra, </em>155 Cal.App.3d at p. 576.) We therefore conclude section 1208 does not empower the court to place Peterson in the custody of the sheriff with directions that he serve that custody in work furlough.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">\n<em>Penal Code section 2900.5, subdivision (f).</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">Peterson claims newly enacted section 2900.5, subdivision (f), allows the court to place him in private work furlough. Section 2900.5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>generally relates to credit for time served in custody prior to the commencement of sentence. The text of subdivision (f), as originally proposed, read \u201cIf a <em>court </em>orders a defendant to serve time in a camp, work furlough facility, ... the time spent . . . shall qualify as mandatory time in jail.\u201d (Assem. Amend, to Sen. Bill No. 688 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.) Apr. 9, 1991, italics added.) The reference to \u201ccourt\u201d was deleted through a series of amendments. (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 688, Stats. 1991, ch. 437.) Section 2900.5, subdivision (f) as enacted provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-4\">\u201cIf a defendant serves time in a camp, work furlough facility, halfway house, rehabilitation facility, hospital, juvenile detention facility, similar residential facility, or home detention program in lieu of imprisonment in county jail, and the statute under which the defendant is sentenced requires a mandatory minimum period of time in jail, the time spent in these facilities or programs shall qualify as mandatory time in jail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">We read section 2900.5, subdivision (f) as authorizing time in alternative facilities to be credited against mandatory jail time, not as creating a mechanism to place persons in those facilities. By deleting the word \u201ccourt,\u201d the Legislature implicitly recognized a court order is not necessarily the vehicle for a defendant\u2019s participation in alternative custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Explicit statutory procedures exist to place prisoners in each alternative facility enumerated in section 2900.5, subdivision (f). County prisoners are placed in industrial farms or camps by the sheriff\u2019s classification committee. (\u00a7 4114.) The sheriff may also transfer county prisoners to industrial road camps. (\u00a7 4000.5.) Convicted persons addicted to narcotics are committed to rehabilitation facilities through detailed judicial proceedings. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 3050 et seq.) HI prisoners may be hospitalized by the sheriff for a short time (\u00a74011.5), or by the court for extended care (\u00a74011). As previously noted, prisoners are placed on home detention by the probation officer (\u00a7 1203.016). Because various specific mechanisms for placement in alternative facilities are specified by statute, we do not interpret section 2900.5, subdivision (f), as giving the court general placement authority for work furlough in the face of a detailed mechanism in section 1208. In short, subdivision (f) merely affords credit for time served in certain alternative custody settings. Because Peterson\u2019s sentence did not require mandatory jail time and no placement mechanism is created by section 2900.5, subdivision (f), the subdivision is inapplicable here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>\n<em>Penal Code section 1203.1.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Peterson also suggests section 1203.1<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>, authorizing a sentencing court to \u201cplace the probationer in ... a road camp, farm, or other public work instead of in jail[,]\u201d supports his placement in the E &amp; J facility. However there is no reference in section 1203.1 to either work furlough or privately operated programs. The express provisions for placement in jail and enumerated public work programs implicitly preclude other types of placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">In summary, by the clear language of section 1208, determination of fitness and placement in work furlough is at the sole discretion of the administrator. (See also <em>In re Thomas </em>(1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 721 [206 Cal.Rptr. 719]; 73 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 45 (1990).) Section 2900.5 affords credit for time served in alternative custodial settings but it does not empower a court to place prisoners in those settings. Although section 1203.1 authorizes a court to place prisoners in public work programs, work furlough is not one of the enumerated programs. Thus here the court\u2019s order placing Peterson directly in the E &amp; J facility is invalid because the court lacked statutory authority for the placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">II. <em>Work Furlough as a Condition of Probation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Peterson asserts even if the court lacked power to place him in work furlough directly as a place of confinement, it could place him there as a \u201creasonable condition of probation\u201d under section 1203.1. He concedes the work furlough here is \u201ccustody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Probation is the release of a defendant into the community under the direction of a probation officer or the court. (\u00a7 1203, subd. (a).) The grant of probation is a privilege given and circumscribed by the Legislature. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Main </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 686, 693 [199 Cal.Rptr. 683]; \u00a7 1203.) As conditions of probation, the court may impose and require terms of imprisonment, fines, restitution and \u201cother reasonable conditions, as it may determine are fitting and proper to the end that justice may be done, that amends may be made to society for the breach of the law ... for the reformation and rehabilitation of the probationer, . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1203.1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Section 1203.1 specifically provides imprisonment be in the \u201ccounty jail,\u201d or \u201croad camp, farm or public work instead of jail.\u201d Section 19.2<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> limits a probationer\u2019s confinement in those enumerated custodial facilities to a maximum of one year. We think it illogical to construe confinement in a work furlough facility as a \u201cgeneric\u201d condition of probation when confinement is addressed in detail by the Legislature and the right to place a person in custody is strictly statutory due to the obvious liberty interests involved. (See generally <em>People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1924) 69 Cal.App. 520, 523 [231 P. 590].) Additionally, confinement in work furlough as a \u201cgeneric\u201d condition of probation might not be subject to a maximum term if it were so imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">We interpret the \u201cother reasonable conditions\u201d of probation to be other than imprisonment, fines, and restitution. The reasonable conditions are those restrictions traditionally imposed relating to the crime committed and future criminal conduct <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lent </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 481, 486 [124 Cal.Rptr. 905, 541 P.2d 545]), i.e., a person convicted of drunk driving must refrain from drinking alcohol. Although we are sensitive to the court\u2019s aim in keeping suitable convicted individuals gainfully employed, nevertheless, a court may not \u201cend run\u201d the explicit statutory framework for custody of convicted persons. We conclude confinement in a work furlough program is outside the scope of a reasonable condition of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">III. <em>Private Work Furlough Facilities.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Finally, we address the People\u2019s contention the order placing Peterson in the E &amp; J facility is also unlawful because the E &amp; J facility is a private facility not under contract with the work furlough administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Section 1208 authorizes the work furlough administrator to enter into contracts with public or private agencies to provide work furlough facilities. \u201cAll privately operated work furlough facilities and programs used for the detention of persons sentenced into the custody of the sheriff, the director of a county department of corrections, or the chief probation officer, shall be under the jurisdiction of, and subject to the terms of a contract entered into with, the work furlough administrator.\u201d (\u00a7 1208, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Under the contract, the private program must agree to operate in compliance with all state and local building, zoning, health, safety, and fire statutes, ordinances and regulations. The private program must also select and train personnel and operate in accordance with the Department of Corrections\u2019 standards. The language of section 1208 indicates the Legislature recognized the potential dangers in placing prisoners in private custody and instituted clear standards to be maintained for the prisoners\u2019 well-being. Because the order placing prisoners in a noncontract work furlough facility evades the careful protections established the Legislature, it is unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">We conclude the court\u2019s order nominally placing Peterson in the custody of the sheriff but ordering him to report to a noncontract work furlough facility was in excess of jurisdiction. The court may not place Peterson in work furlough as a condition of probation; only the work furlough administrator has the authority to determine eligibility and placement, and all private facilities must be under contract with the administrator. We therefore issue the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Let a writ of mandate issue directing the superior court to vacate that portion of its sentencing order directing service of custody in the E &amp; J facility. Because we are advised Peterson completed service of the custody condition of probation, remand for resentencing is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">Benke, J., and Nares, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">The petition of real party in interest for review by the Supreme Court was denied March 17, 1993.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b45-11\">An order granting probation is reviewable by petition for writ of mandate or prohibition filed within 60 days of the order.

In light of continuing public interest in work furlough and the real possibility similar cases will recur and evade review because of relatively short sentences, we conclude resolution on this record is appropriate. <em>(Daly </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 132, 141 [137 Cal.Rptr. 14, 560 P.2d 1193].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b46-10\">Section 12 provides: \u201cThe several sections of this Code which declare certain crimes to be punishable as therein mentioned, devolve a duty upon the Court authorized to pass sentence, to determine and impose the punishment prescribed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b46-11\">Because the comprehensive nature of this section is critical to our resolution here, we include the section at length:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5Dt\">\u201c(a) The provisions of this section, insofar as they relate to employment, shall be operative in any county in which the board of supervisors by ordinance finds, on the basis of employment conditions, the state of the county jail facilities, and other pertinent circumstances, that the operation of this section, insofar as it relates to employment, in that county is feasible. ... In any ordinance the board shall prescribe whether the sheriff, the probation officer, the director of the county department of corrections, or the superintendent of a county industrial farm or industrial road camp in the county shall perform the functions of the work furlough administrator. The board may, in that ordinance, provide for the performance of any or all functions of the work furlough administrator by any one or more of those persons, acting separately or jointly as to any of the functions; and may, by a subsequent ordinance, revise the provisions within the authorization of this section.

No agency or private entity entering into a contract may itself employ any person who is in the work furlough program.

The private agency or entity shall select and train its personnel in accordance with selection and training requirements adopted by the Board of Corrections as set forth in Subchapter 1 (commencing with Section 100) of Chapter 1 of Division 1 of Title 15 of the California Code of Regulations. Failure to comply with the appropriate health, safety, and fire laws or minimum jail standards adopted by the board may be cause for termination of the contract.
