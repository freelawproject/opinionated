Code, \u00a7 187; unless otherwise noted, statutory references are to the Penal Code), appellant was convicted by a jury of voluntary manslaughter (\u00a7 192, subd. (a)) while using a firearm (\u00a7 12022.5). He was sentenced to state prison for 10 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Appellant contends the trial court erred: (1) by giving a statute (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1103) ex post facto application, (2) by admitting evidence of appellant\u2019s interest in guns, (3) by admitting \u201cnon-admission\u201d statements of appellant, and (4) by excusing a trial juror without good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">We find no error and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">There being no insufficiency of evidence claim we synopsize the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">David Halsey (appellant), Jeff Logan (the victim), Tim Dilworth, Tom Cannon, and Tommy Canup were members of a band called \u201cKamikaze Saloon.\u201d They all lived in South Carolina. In July 1990, to better the band\u2019s chances, the five band members moved to California, initially living in apartment 4, 19543 Victory Boulevard, Van Nuys. Babette Merck, appellant\u2019s girlfriend, her five-year-old son, and Amy Collins, Tommy Canup\u2019s girlfriend, soon joined them.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">By September 1990, only Tim Dilworth and the victim lived in apartment 4. Tom Cannon lived alone in another apartment, and the others lived in apartment 7, across from apartment 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">On September 11, 1990, about 8 p.m., in apartment 4, the band began practice. Some members were drinking. A non-band-member, Luke, was drunk and spilled beer on instruments and disrupted the practice. The practice ended, band members left but Luke remained, passed out on the couch.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-14\">Some hours later, approximately 2:30 a.m., September 12, the victim went to apartment 7 and spoke to Babette Merck. The victim, who had been angry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>at Luke, had blood on his hands. Ms. Merck went to apartment 4 with the victim and saw blood on the couch and wall. The victim told her he had fought with Luke. Luke was not in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Ms. Merck returned to her apartment and awakened appellant. He put his pants on and went to apartment 4. He and the victim got into a fight. Appellant returned to his apartment, got his five-shot .32-caliber pistol, walked back to apartment 4, and shot the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Appellant, again returning to his apartment, told his girlfriend to call an ambulance. Appellant then tried to help the victim until the ambulance arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The victim died a few hours later from a gunshot wound to his lower back.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">1. <em>Appellant contends the trial court erred by giving ex post facto application to Evidence Code section 1103.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">After the crime, but before trial, Evidence Code section 1103 was amended, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-10\">\u201c(a) In a criminal action, evidence of the character or a trait of character (in the form of an opinion, evidence of reputation, <em>or evidence of specific instances of conduct) </em>of the victim of the crime for which the defendant is being prosecuted is not made inadmissible by Section 1101 if the evidence is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-11\">\u201c(1) Offered by the defendant to prove conduct of the victim in conformity with the character or trait of character.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-12\">\u201c(2) Offered by the prosecution to rebut evidence adduced by the defendant under paragraph (1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-13\">\u201c(b) <em>In a criminal action, evidence of the defendant\u2019s character for violence or trait of character for violence (in the form of an opinion, evidence of reputation, or evidence of specific instances of conduct) is not made inadmissible by Section 1101 if the evidence is offered by the prosecution to prove conduct of the defendant in conformity with the character or trait of character and is offered after evidence that the victim had a character for violence or a trait of character tending to show violence has been adduced by the defendant under paragraph (1) of subdivision (a).\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>Appellant argues the trial court applied this amended statute to admit evidence of his character for violence, a violation of the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution (art. I, \u00a7 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">We do not consider the merits of appellant\u2019s claim<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because his trial counsel not only did not object on this ground (Evid. Code, \u00a7 353) but called the trial court\u2019s attention to the amended statute and urged the trial court to apply it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> His strategic purpose in doing so was apparent. The amended statute permitted the defense to prove \u201cspecific instances\u201d of violence by the <em>victim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>Appellant\u2019s contention is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">2. <em>Appellant contends the trial court erred in admitting evidence of his interest in guns.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">On direct examination, Tommy Canup testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">\u201cQ. [Prosecutor] Now, do you also know people in Basely, South Carolina that knew the defendant, David Halsey?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">\u201cA. Yes. Very few, but the same as I knew Jeff [the victim],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\">\u201cQ. Did he have a reputation in that community for being a violent or nonviolent person?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-9\">\u201cA. Sort of violent because of all the weapons that were always around him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-10\">\u201cQ. Based on everything you know about the defendant, do you personally have an opinion as to whether he is a violent person?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-11\">\u201cA. Personally, yes. But I\u2014just because of all the guns and all the firearms and everything that was constantly present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in admitting this testimony because it was irrelevant to his character for violence. Appellant, having failed to timely object at trial<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Evid. Code, \u00a7 353), may not object on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-13\">Appellant also asserts the trial court erred in permitting certain testimony by Amy Collins. On direct she testified that appellant had a reputation for being \u201cwild\u201d and in her opinion he was violent. No error is claimed concerning this testimony. On cross-examination, defense counsel sought to disprove any basis for her opinion. He elicited she had never seen appellant do anything violent, point a gun at anyone, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-14\">On redirect examination, to explain the basis of her opinion, Ms. Collins testified appellant habitually had guns around, she had seen a photograph of him with \u201can assortment of dangerous weapons,\u201d and she had seen him blow something up.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>The trial court did not err in admitting this unobjected to rehabilitation evidence. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 353.)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">3. <em>Appellant contends the trial court erred by admitting his \u201cnon-admission\u201d statements.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in admitting his irrelevant statements.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">The officer who transported appellant from the homicide scene to the police station, Officer Lint, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">\u201cWell, he told me that he had shot his friend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">\u201cHe said that he shot him one time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-10\">\u201cHe went on to explain that they or that the victim had come into his apartment, started screaming and yelling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-11\">\u201cThey ended up in a fight, the defendant and the victim, out on the balcony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-12\">\u201cThe defendant got away from the victim and went back into his apartment where he got his gun, went back to the victim and shot him one time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-13\">\u201cThe defendant went on to tell me that <em>he was a good shot and probably a better shot than I was and that he shot a lot, </em>and I believe that was basically it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-14\">Appellant asserts the italicized portion of his statement is more prejudicial than probative and should have been excluded under Evidence Code section 352. We disagree. Appellant\u2019s firearm expertise was relevant to his intent, relevance not outweighed by his inappropriate boastfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-15\">Appellant also argues the trial court should not have permitted Tommy Canup to testify to a statement appellant made about a month after the killing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-16\">\u201cI shot the son of a bitch, and if I have <em>[sic] </em>to do it again, I would.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-17\">We find no abuse of the trial court\u2019s Evidence Code section 352 discretion. The epithet, which defense counsel claimed was inflammatory, is\u2014by today\u2019s standards\u2014more quaint than excitatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>4. <em>Appellant contends the trial court erred in excusing a trial juror without good cause.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The morning after the prosecutor made his opening statement, a juror (Mr. Korff) asked to speak to the court. With counsel and appellant present, he said that earlier that morning a fellow juror, Mr. Margolis, made some comments in the hallway about the case. Mr. Margolis said \u201che did not feel the opening statement by the district attorney was very effective\u201d and \u201cthis was an easier case than he thought it would be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The trial court separately questioned Mr. Margolis and the other jurors. Mr. Margolis denied making the particular statements but said he did comment about the attorneys. The trial court found Mr. Margolis \u201cevasive,\u201d determined he had made the statements attributed to him by Mr. Korff, found he had violated the court\u2019s repeated order not to discuss the case, and lacked \u201cability to follow my instructions and to maintain an open mind and remain objective throughout the duration of the proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Pursuant to section 1089,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the trial court excused Mr. Margolis and replaced him with an alternate juror.  Appellant claims error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Although a trial court has discretion to determine good cause, it is a \u201climited discretion\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 687, 696 [131 Cal.Rptr. 782, 552 P.2d 742]) and the inability of the excused juror to perform his duty \u201cmust appear in the record as a demonstrable reality.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Many cases have considered the exercise of this trial court discretion. Few have found abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Good cause to excuse a juror has been found in all the following circumstances: a juror, father of five daughters, said he would be prejudiced against anyone charged with rape <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harrison </em>(1910) 13 Cal.App 555 [110 P. 345] [error for trial court <em>not to </em>find good cause]); juror said \u201cI don\u2019t think I would be fair to the prosecution\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 209 [302 P.2d 307]); juror worked in same office as defendant\u2019s brother, their desks 25 feet apart <em>(People </em>v. <em>Abbott </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 362 [303 P.2d 730]); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>juror worked with defendant\u2019s father for twelve years and lived next door to defendant\u2019s sister <em>(People </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(1961) 189 Cal.App.2d 490 [11 Cal.Rptr. 480]); juror asked to be excused because she was moving out of state <em>(People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 524 [93 Cal.Rptr. 84]); juror upset, can\u2019t follow court\u2019s instructions <em>(People </em>v. <em>Collins, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d 687); juror <em>charged </em>with a felony and two misdemeanors <em>(People </em>v. <em>Farris </em>(1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 376 [136 Cal.Rptr. 45]); for two days a juror tried to barter with other jurors; he\u2019d vote not guilty regarding one defendant if other jurors would vote guilty regarding the other defendant <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guzman </em>(1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 549 [136 Cal.Rptr. 163] [error for trial court <em>not </em>to find good cause]); juror absent because he took his wife to an eye doctor <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 299 [157 Cal.Rptr. 107]); testimony made juror physically and emotionally ill <em>(People </em>v. <em>Van Houten </em>(1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 280 [170 Cal.Rptr. 189]); in knife assault trial juror failed to disclose during voir dire that she had been victim of attempted rape with a knife <em>(People </em>v. <em>Diaz </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 926 [200 Cal.Rptr. 77] [error for trial court <em>not </em>to find good cause]); juror\u2019s mind wanders, can\u2019t concentrate (Mi<em>tchell </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 624 [202 Cal.Rptr. 284] [a \u201clegal necessity\u201d which justified trial court\u2019s declaration of a mistrial]); juror intimidated by other jurors, not sure she could vote her conscience <em>(People </em>v. <em>Warren </em>(1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 324 [221 Cal.Rptr. 768]); juror wanted to be excused to avoid losing wages <em>(People </em>v. <em>Aikens </em>(1988) 207 Cal.App.3d 209 [254 Cal.Rptr. 30]); over the weekend juror observed defendant join her church <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hecker </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1238 [268 Cal.Rptr. 884]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 1477, 1484-1485 [267 Cal.Rptr. 865]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Daniels </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 815, 863-866 [277 Cal.Rptr. 122, 802 P.2d 906].)</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">We conclude the trial court acted within its discretion in excusing Mr. Margolis.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Lillie, P. J., and Johnson, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The claim appears to be without merit. <em>(Collins </em>v. <em>Youngblood </em>(1990) 497 U.S. 37 [111 L.Ed.2d 30, 110 S.Ct. 2715]; <em>Tapia </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 282 [297 Cal.Rptr. 592, 807 P.2d 434].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b617-7\">During a protracted discussion about the admissibility of character evidence for violence, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">\u201cMr. Bruckner [Defense counsel]: Before we\u2014I believe that it\u2019s possible that both the court and the D.A. are not aware of [rz'c] section 1103 has been amended. I\u2019ve something from the legislative alert memo from the California Attorneys for Criminal Justice which indicates that there was an assembly bill 263 which was signed by the Gove[r]nor on March 15th of \u201991 which mentioned the Evidence Code 1103 which indicates that basically what it does in 1103 (A), it address[es] that the defense may put on evidence of specific instances of conduct of the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-9\">\u201cThe Court: Of the victim. We\u2019re talking about specific instances of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-10\">\u201cMr. Bruckner: Right, and with regard to (B), it address[es], it changes I think 1103 (B) which is also amended and reads, \u2018That in a criminal action evidence of the defendant\u2019s character [sic] or trait of character for violence in the form of opinion, evidence of reputation or evidence of specific instance of conduct is not made inadmissible by 1101 if the evidence is offered by the prosecution to prove conduct of the defendant in conformity of the character or trait of character and offered after evidence that the victim had character for violence or trait of character has been offered for violence has been adduced by paragraph 1-A.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-11\">\u201cWhat I am indicating to the court pursuant to assembly bill 263 which was made into law on March 15th, \u201991.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-12\">\u201cThe Court: And effective on that date?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-13\">\u201cMr. Bruckner: Yes. It says my understanding that it became effective upon signing, that it amended 1103 to add specific instance of misconduct or conduct but also says that once the defense puts on such specific instances of conduct, that the prosecution then put on the same type of evidence with regard to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-14\">\u201cThe Court: And based on that your [rzc] not objecting to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-15\">\u201cMr. Bruckner: My understanding, yes. Once I think that certainly it\u2019s been circumstantial evidence of specific instances of misconduct that the defense has illicited [sz'c] in its trial already.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-16\">\u201cThe Court: Isn\u2019t that limited to prosecution for sexual offenses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-17\">\u201cMr. Bruckner: No, Your Honor. If the court would like to see\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-18\">\u201cThe Court: Please. I see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-19\">\u201cMr. Bruckner: Just in good faith, Your Honor, I intend to put on specific instances of conduct to support the proposition that the victim in this case had a violent propensity, and with that in mind it would be hypocritical for me to object to the prosecution doing the same to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-20\">\u201cThe Court: In that case I notice there\u2019s no objection.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b618-15\">Before Mr. Canup testified, the trial court had ruled that \u201cwith respect to the specific acts, I am going to at this point preclude the People from doing that on their direct[.] Depending on what the cross is[,] I may permit it on redirect.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b619-18\">Appellant appears to argue his statements were not relevant, not being relevant they were not \u201cadmissions,\u201d and not being \u201cadmissions\u201d they were not admissible. This analysis is flawed. (Evid.
