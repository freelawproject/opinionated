When he was unable to produce \u201cfor examination\u201d either a driver\u2019s license or \u201cother satisfactory evidence of his identity,\u201d (Veh. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>Code, \u00a7 40302, subd. (a)), the arresting officer took him into custody.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A search of his person turned up rock cocaine, and he was charged with and convicted of possession of cocaine base for sale. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11351.5.) In this appeal, he argues the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress the cocaine. His principal attack is on the officer\u2019s decision to take him into custody. He argues that either the statute required the officer to give him an adequate opportunity to provide \u201cother\u201d evidence of his identity, or that the statute is unconstitutionally vague if read to allow the officer to take him into custody under the circumstances of this case. We disagree. We find the statute implicitly grants an officer discretion to determine what \u201cother\" evidence of identity is sufficient when a traffic citee is unable to produce a driver\u2019s license or other documentary evidence of equivalent reliability. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">We derive the facts from the hearing on the motion to suppress. In our summary, we present the evidence in the light most favorable to the ruling below. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Leyba </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 591, 596-598 [174 Cal.Rptr. 867, 629 P.2d 961].)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">In the early afternoon of December 28, 1990, uniformed Oakland Police Officers Kevin Johnson and Mike Brown were on patrol in an unmarked car which was equipped with red lights and a siren. The officers were on the alert for a homicide suspect who was believed to be in the area. As they passed a blue 1990 Chevrolet on the right, Officer Johnson saw defendant Monroe, who was the passenger in the Chevrolet. Officer Johnson had stopped the homicide suspect before, and had reviewed booking photographs of the suspect before going on shift. Officer Johnson had only seen Monroe in profile, but Monroe\u2019s appearance matched that of the suspect in several respects, and the area the officers were in was one of the suspect\u2019s usual haunts. In an attempt to confirm his suspicion, Officer Johnson pulled up next to the Chevrolet at a red light, but Monroe turned away from him and remained in that position until the light changed. Officers Johnson and Brown continued to follow the Chevrolet while they ran a registration check. The check revealed the car was a rental from Ohio. Because the homicide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>suspect had reportedly recently been in Ohio, Officer Johnson decided at that point to stop the Chevrolet. When the officers turned on the red lights and siren, Officer Brown saw Monroe move as though reaching to the floorboard of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">After the Chevrolet stopped, Officer Johnson walked up on the driver\u2019s side and looked into car. When he saw Monroe\u2019s face, he realized Monroe was not the suspect they were looking for. However, as Officer Johnson approached the car, he had also seen an open and half-empty bottle of beer on the floorboard of the driver\u2019s side of the car, and a cup in front of Monroe on the passenger\u2019s side floorboard. Officer Brown, who had walked up on the passenger\u2019s side of the car, saw a large cup of beer on the floorboards, and smelled beer through the open window. Like Officer Johnson, Officer Brown saw within a few seconds that Monroe was not the homicide suspect they were looking for. However, because Officer Brown suspected alcohol violations, he asked Monroe to get out of the car, and asked him for identification. Officer Brown gave varying accounts of Monroe\u2019s response. He testified several times that Monroe said he had no identification \u201cwith him,\u201d and also that Monroe simply stated he did \u201cnot have any I.D.\u201d Following the exchange between them, Officer Brown decided to take Monroe into custody under the authority of section 40302, subdivision (a). Subsequent searches of Monroe\u2019s person turned up the contraband which was to be the basis of the conviction we review here. While in custody at the scene of the stop, Monroe told the officers he was a parolee, and gave the addresses of his mother and girlfriend. A computer check by the officers confirmed there was a parolee whose name and date of birth matched those given by Monroe.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Monroe filed a written motion to suppress on the general ground that the search was illegal. After the hearing on the motion, Monroe filed papers in which he argued that Officer Brown\u2019s decision to take him into custody was not authorized by section 40302 because Officer Brown had not made any adequate attempt to identify him. In those papers, Monroe noted he had not had the benefit of a transcript of the evidentiary hearing on the motion, and reserved the issues of the propriety of the initial stop and decision to cite Monroe for Vehicle Code alcohol violations. At argument, Monroe added claims that the officers lacked a reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify the traffic stop, and that their decision to cite for the open container violation was a pretext for a search of the car. The motion was denied, Monroe was tried and convicted, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">The principal question raised in this appeal is the proper application and constitutional validity of section 40302, subdivision (a), which makes custodial arrest of a traffic violator mandatory if the violator cannot produce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>either a driver\u2019s license or other satisfactory evidence of his or her identity. Appellant was taken into custody and searched when he told the arresting officer he did not have any identification on his person.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We will conclude the officer\u2019s decision to take appellant into custody was a proper exercise of the discretion necessarily granted by section 40302 in those cases in which a person arrested for a minor Vehicle Code violation is unable to produce a driver\u2019s license or its functional equivalent.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">\n<em>Statutory Scheme</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Simon) </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 186, 199 [101 Cal.Rptr. 837, 496 P.2d 1205] (hereafter <em>Simon), </em>our Supreme Court explained the \u201cprocedure to be followed after a warrantless arrest for a Vehicle Code violation.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 199.) Though there have been amendments and additions to the Vehicle Code in the years since <em>Simon </em>was decided, it remains a concise and accurate summary of the law. \u201cIf [the Vehicle Code] violation is declared to be a felony, the arrestee is to be dealt with according to the general provisions of the Penal Code on felony arrests. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 40301.) For all other cases, however, the Legislature has created a special tripartite scheme which reflects the lesser degree of criminality attached to the act of transgressing against ordinary traffic rules and regulations. [SI] First, the scheme in effect presumes that in the vast majority of cases the violator will not be taken into custody: with the exception of the instances next discussed, the officer must prepare a written notice to appear (i.e., a citation or \u2018ticket\u2019), and must release the violator \u2018forthwith\u2019 when the latter in turn gives his written promise that he will appear as directed (\u00a7\u00a7 40500, 40504). Indeed, such a violator may avoid the necessity for appearing in court: he may choose to deposit the prescribed bail by mail (\u00a7 40510) and, by failing thereafter to appear, forfeit that amount in lieu of fine (\u00a7 40512). [f] Second, in certain cases, section 40303 gives the officer the option either to follow the foregoing procedure or to take the violator \u2018without unnecessary delay\u2019 before the \u2018nearest or most accessible\u2019 magistrate having jurisdiction over the offense. The section lists a number of more serious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>violations as grounds for invoking this option, such as reckless driving, failure to stop after a accident, participating in speed contests, driving with an invalid license, attempt to evade arrest, and refusal to submit to safety inspections. H] Third, section 40302 makes it mandatory for the officer to follow the latter branch of the section 40303 option\u2014i.e., to take the violator before a magistrate without unnecessary delay\u2014in four specific instances: i.e., when the violator (a) fails to present his driver\u2019s license or other satisfactory evidence of his identity, (b) refuses to give his written promise to appear, or (c) demands an immediate appearance before a magistrate, or (d) when the violator is charged with the very serious traffic offenses [defined by former section 23102, driving under the influence of alcohol or other intoxicants].\u201d <em>(Simon, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at pp. 199-200.)</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">In addition to the situations described in <em>Simon, </em>it is worth noting that an officer has the option of bringing a nonfelony traffic violator before a magistrate in several other situations; (1) where the motorist has been involved in a traffic accident or is obstructing traffic, and the officer has reason to believe the motorist was driving under the influence of liquor or drugs (\u00a7 40300.5), (2) where an officer of the California Highway Patrol has arrested a person for violating a vehicular provision of state law not found in the Vehicle Code (\u00a7 40304), or (3) where the officer has arrested a nonresident of this state and that nonresident cannot furnish \u201csatisfactory evidence of identity and an address within this State at which he can be located.\u201d (\u00a7 40305).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">As the foregoing implies, an arrest for a minor Vehicle Code violation is to be distinguished in some respects from arrest under other circumstances,  Ordinarily, the word \u201carrest\u201d implies a sequence of events that begins with physical custody and at least a minimal body search, and concludes with booking and incarceration or release on bail. However, where a minor Vehicle Code violation is involved, the arrest is complete when, after an investigatory stop, \u201cthe officer determines there is probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed and begins the process of citing the violator to appear in court.\u201d <em>(Simon, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 200.) This species of arrest does not inevitably result in physical custody and its concomitant, a search. (Cf. <em>Gustafson </em>v. <em>Florida </em>(1973) 414 U.S. 260, 266 [38 L.Ed.2d 456, 461-462, 94 S.Ct. 488] [search incident to arrest valid where officer takes traffic citee into custody following arrest]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wohlleben </em>(1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 461, 463 [67 Cal.Rptr. 826] [minor traffic violation not a basis for custodial arrest]; see also <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Guzman </em>(10th Cir. 1988) 864 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>1512, 1519 [auto stop a limited seizure akin to investigative detention].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is only after the traffic arrest is made that the provisions which forbid, allow, or mandate the officer to bring the arrestee before a magistrate come into play.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Here, there was probable cause to believe appellant had violated section 23223, which prohibits possession of an open container of any alcoholic beverage while in a car.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If appellant had been able to produce a driver\u2019s license in response to Officer Brown\u2019s request for identification, Officer Brown would have been required to cite appellant for that violation, and to release him on his written promise to appear. (\u00a7 40500; Pen. Code, \u00a7 853.5; <em>Simon, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 199.) However, when appellant told Officer Brown he did not have any identification with him, Officer Brown decided to take appellant into custody under the identification provision of section 40302, subdivision (a).  Appellant claims he should have been given an opportunity to provide Officer Brown with \u201cother satisfactory evidence of his identity\u201d for Officer Brown\u2019s \u201cexamination,\u201d (\u00a7 40302, subd. (a)), and because he was not, the ensuing custody and search were constitutionally unreasonable. We disagree. We find the language of the statute necessarily confers discretion on the officer to determine what \u201csatisfactory evidence\u201d of identity may be under the circumstances, including the discretion to determine that only reliable, written evidence will do, or on the other hand, that the violator\u2019s oral statements of identity and promise to appear are sufficiently reliable to allow citation and release despite the lack of written evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">\n<em>Construction of Section 40302</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Though courts have considered the application of section 40302 in a variety of contexts, there has been no definitive interpretation of the phrase \u201csatisfactory evidence of his identity,\u201d nor any explanation of the procedure to be followed by an officer who seeks to obtain such evidence. In those few cases which have directly considered whether some specific means of identification should have been enough to avoid custodial arrest, the courts have been content to conclude that the means of identification in question was not satisfactory. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Grant </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1451, 1455 [266 Cal.Rptr. 587] [oral statements]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Farley </em>(1971) 20 Cal.App.3d 1032, 1036, fn. 2 [98 Cal.Rptr. 89] [Social Security card not satisfactory]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mercurio </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 426, 430 [88 Cal.Rptr. 750] [no identification]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 125, 128 [71 Cal.Rptr. 827] [oral statement and nearby address].) <em> </em>The parties have cited no authority and we have found none which clearly articulates the standard an officer should apply when a citee<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> has no driver\u2019s license, other than general conclusory statements that the evidence of identity must be reliable and credible. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Mercurio, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.3d at p. 430 [\u201creliable identification\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nagel </em>(1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 492, 494 [95 Cal.Rptr. 129] [\u201cvalid identification\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dukes </em>(1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 913, 916 [82 Cal.Rptr. 218] [defendant presented \u201cunsatisfactory identification\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Salinas </em>(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d Supp. 27, 29 [169 Cal.Rptr. 16] [duty to present \u201csuitable identification\u201d].) By the same token, none of the cases have considered what procedure the officer might use to elicit \u201csatisfactory\u201d evidence of identity, or whether any such procedure is required, nor does the statute itself shed any light on that aspect of the problem. In short, we are left with a question of statutory interpretation, i.e., what procedure the Legislature intended when it provided that an officer must take a citee before a magistrate unless the citee can provide \u201csatisfactory evidence of his identity for examination.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">In the interpretation of statutes, we look first to the words of the statute itself, giving them their usual and ordinary meanings, and according <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>significance to every word and phrase, if possible. (See, e.g., <em>Walnut Creek Manor </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 245, 268 [284 Cal.Rptr. 718, 814 P.2d 704].)  The words should be construed in context, and should be given such \u201cinterpretation as will promote rather than defeat the <em>general purpose and policy </em>of the law.\u201d <em>(Alford </em>v. <em>Pierno </em>(1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 682, 688 [104 Cal.Rptr. 110] [original italics].) Where uncertainty exists, consideration should be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation; the result of the interpretation should be reasonable, and where several constructions are possible, that which leads to the more reasonable result should be adopted. <em>(Ibid.; </em>and see e.g., <em>Regents of University of California </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 529, 536-537 [91 Cal.Rptr. 57, 476 P.2d 457].) With these principles in mind, we turn to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Section 40302 is a part of chapter 2 of division 17 of the Vehicle Code. Chapter 2 provides the procedures to be followed by peace officers making arrests for Vehicle Code violations committed in their presence. (\u00a7 40300; see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Wohlleben, supra, </em>261 Cal.App.2d at p. 463 [procedure for warrantless misdemeanor arrest for Vehicle Code violation is provided in Vehicle Code, not Penal Code].) Section 40302 is one of several sections of chapter 2 which specify the various circumstances under which an officer either has the option to take a citee before a magistrate, or is required to do so. As noted in <em>Simon, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at page 199, \u201cthe scheme in effect presumes that in the vast majority of cases the violator will not be taken into custody.\u201d This is in accord with the general policy of avoiding custodial arrest in most instances involving minor criminal violations, especially traffic violations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (See, e.g., 2 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, stds. 10-2.1, 10-2.2, <em>supra, </em>[policy in favor of citations]; Problems in the Admin, of Justice in Cal., Rep. to Assem. Com. on the Judiciary (1969) Supp. to Appen. to Assem. J. (1969 Reg. Sess.).) It would be inappropriate and harmful to both citizens and the criminal justice system if the presumption were custody, rather than release. For that reason, citation and release has been the standard for most Vehicle Code violations since 1925. (See Stats. 1925, ch. 240, \u00a7 19, p. 415; and see Nida, Cal. Motor Vehicle Legislation; West\u2019s Ann. Cal. Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1-15999 (1971) pp. LXXVI-LXXXI; First National Conference on Street and Highway Safety, Rep. of Com. on Enforcement (Feb. 1, 1926) p. 14 [lesser traffic offenders should be cited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>and released, to \u201crelieve the offender from the humiliation of being classed as a criminal and to prevent congestion in the police courts\u201d].) Thus, the overall purpose of the scheme of which section 40302 is a part is to facilitate the immediate release of most violators, reserving custody<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> only for those who have either committed more serious offenses, or as in the case of persons who cannot produce satisfactory proof of identity, those whom the Legislature has deemed unlikely to fulfill a promise to appear. <em>(Simon, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at pp. 199-200.) .</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Given that the general purpose of the Vehicle Code arrest statutes is to avoid custodial arrest of most violators, reserving custody for serious offenders and those who are unlikely to comply with the citation procedure, it is clear the \u201csatisfactory evidence\u201d of identity standard must be interpreted to give the officer in the field sufficient flexibility to carry out that purpose in a variety of situations. (See 2 ABA Standards, <em>supra, </em>com. foil. std. 10-2.2 at p. 10.28 [\u201csatisfactory evidence\u201d portion of model citation statute purposefully left vague to preserve flexibility].) The variety of circumstances which might face an officer in the field defy classification. For example, there are undoubtedly situations in which an officer might conclude that a verified or verifiable oral statement of identity is reliable, and others in which the same statement would not seem reliable, as where the citee is evasive and there are minor but significant discrepancies in the statement of identity. For example, where two or more passengers in an automobile independently verify each other\u2019s identity, the officer\u2019s determination whether that independent verification is \u201csatisfactory\u201d must turn on that officer\u2019s perception of the credibility of the statements. In turn, that assessment may depend on the evaluation of such intangibles as the manner of the speakers, the place and time, or statements made by the passengers which tend to support or undercut the plausibility of their identifications. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Grant, supra, </em>217 Cal.App.3d 1451, 1456 [officer\u2019s inquiries reasonable where motorists had no written identification and driver told officer car belonged to his aunt].) To accommodate the variety of situations which an officer in the field may encounter, any reasonable interpretation of the statute must at some point necessarily reserve the judgment whether particular evidence of identity is satisfactory to the officer. (See <em>Simon, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 201 [citee \u201cmust be able to convince the officer\u2014either by exhibiting his driver\u2019s license or by \u2018other satisfactory evidence\u2019\u2014that the name he is signing on the written promise to appear corresponds to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1186\">*1186</page-number>true identity\u201d].) Otherwise, in those situations in which the reliability of the evidence turns on factors which neither we nor any other court can predict, the officer will be forced to take into custody persons who should clearly not be inconvenienced. For example, a person who has left his or her wallet at home on a trip to the local market might well find themselves visiting a relatively distant magistrate instead, even though the officer believes they are responsible and will comply with the citation procedure. Such a result would defeat the overall purpose of the Vehicle Code arrest scheme, which is, as we have discussed, to provide a means by which most offenders may be cited and released. In this sense, our conclusions regarding the breadth of the officer\u2019s discretion are intended to preserve the officer\u2019s discretion to cite and release under those circumstances when custody is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Despite the conclusion the officer must retain some discretion to determine what evidence of identity is \u201csatisfactory,\u201d that discretion is not unlimited. Though the officer must retain an area of discretion, there are some proofs of identity which should be accepted by the officer as presumptively satisfactory, absent some extrinsic reason to doubt their authenticity. It would be unreasonable to conclude the Legislature intended that an officer could reject documentary evidence of identity which is the effective equivalent of a driver\u2019s license. We turn to consideration of what forms of identification other than a driver\u2019s license an officer must accept as presumptively satisfactory when they are presented for the officer\u2019s examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">We begin with the driver\u2019s license statute itself, which specifies the kind of proof which an officer must accept. The statute requires the license to contain the driver\u2019s name, age, mailing address and signature as well as a brief description and photograph of the licensee. (\u00a7 12811; and see <em>People </em>v. <em>Farley, supra, </em>20 Cal.App.3d at p. 1036, fn. 2 [noting that draft card, which contained description, address, and signature of holder, was of significantly greater reliability than a social security card].) Read narrowly, section 40302 could be construed to mean that only a driver\u2019s license <em>must </em>be accepted by the officer, and other forms of identification need be accepted only if \u201csatisfactory.\u201d However, we do not believe the Legislature intended such a narrow reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">First, a California identity card issued under section 13000, though facially relegated to the category of \u201cother satisfactory evidence\u201d of identity by section 40302, was clearly contemplated by the Legislature to be the virtual equivalent of a driver\u2019s license for identification purposes. (\u00a7 13005 [card shall resemble driver\u2019s license in appearance so far as possible, and shall contain same information].) Where, as here, a nondriver is cited for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>Vehicle Code violation, it would be unreasonable to conclude that an officer could refuse to accept a valid identity card as \u201csatisfactory\u201d evidence of the citee\u2019s identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">In another context, the Legislature has determined that any current written identification which contains at a minimum \u201ca photograph and description of the person named on it, is signed by the person, [and] bears a serial or other identifying number\u201d is \u201csatisfactory evidence\u201d of the identity of a person acknowledging an instrument before a notary. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1185; see Stats. 1982, ch. 197, \u00a7 1, p. 669; Leg. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 2353, 6 Stats. 1982 (Reg. Sess.), Summary Dig., p. 77 [noting purpose of bill to require notaries to accept certain \u201cpaper identification, such as a driver\u2019s license\u201d as sufficient for purposes of acknowledgement].) We deduce from this relatively recent addition to the notary statute that there are some kinds of written identification which are, in the view of the Legislature, presumptively \u201csatisfactory,\u201d and should be accepted by the officer in the context of a Vehicle Code arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">We conclude that proper interpretation of the phrase \u201csatisfactory evidence of identity\u201d requires an officer to accept as presumptively satisfactory any reliable documentary evidence of identity which bears the minimum amount of data required by the Vehicle Code licensing and citation statutes. The form of identification must bear a photograph and description of the person, their signature and a current mailing address, and must be current and serially or otherwise numbered. (See \u00a7 12811 [content of license]; \u00a7 40500 [form of notice to appear to include name and address of person cited].) Such documentary evidence is the functional equivalent of a driver\u2019s license because it is of equivalent reliablity, and because it bears the information necessary to the citation process. When presented with such proof, an officer must accept it as \u201csatisfactory.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Our conclusion that only documentary evidence of identity should be found to be presumptively satisfactory is reinforced by the language of the statute itself, which requires evidence of identity to be \u201cpresented\u201d for \u201cexamination\u201d by the officer. (\u00a7 40302.) A reasonable reading of the words implies that the evidence is capable of presentation and examination, acts which are ordinarily associated with tangible rather than oral evidence. The use of such language is an additional indication that the Legislature contemplated that documentary evidence would be the primary means by which a citee should establish his or her identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>To sum up, we conclude the only reasonable interpretation of the identity requirements of section 40302 requires an officer to accept either a driver\u2019s license or its functional equivalent, but lacking that, the decision whether any other evidence of identity is satisfactory should be left to the discretion of the officer in the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Our conclusion regarding the proper interpretation of the meaning of \u201csatisfactory evidence\u201d in turn dictates the scope of the officer\u2019s duty to make a sufficient inquiry to elicit evidence of a citee\u2019s identity. We begin with the obvious; an officer must, at a minimum, ask a citee for a driver\u2019s license.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Otherwise, every citee would be subject to mandatory and immediate custodial arrest unless they were able to display a driver\u2019s license before the arrest could occur. Moreover, because the officer must accept as satisfactory documentary evidence of identification which is functionally equivalent to a driver\u2019s license, an officer should make some further inquiry calculated to discover whether the citee has some form of written identification which is its equivalent. As in this case, a general request for identification satisfies the officer\u2019s duty as to all forms of presumptively satisfactory identification. Under the circumstances which ordinarily obtain when an officer issues a citation, a request for \u201cidentification\u201d will alert the vast majority of our citizens that some form of documentary identification is required, the present case being a good illustration of the point. When asked for \u201cI.D.,\u201d Monroe replied he had none \u201cwith him;\u201d as it turned out, he understood the officer\u2019s question perfectly, for he had no written identification. Thus, a general request for \u201cidentification\u201d satisfies the officer\u2019s duty to inquire.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\"> Based on our conclusions regarding the proper interpretation of section 40302 and the officer\u2019s duty of inquiry, we reject appellant\u2019s contention the language of the statute directing the officer to accept \u201cother satisfactory evidence of his identity\u201d requires the officer to accept verifiable oral assertions of identity, and by implication, imposes a duty on the officer to make inquiries calculated to elicit such evidence. As we have discussed, the decision whether to accept some evidence of identity other than a driver\u2019s license or its equivalent is within the discretion of the officer. It follows that once the officer has established that a citee has no presumptively satisfactory evidence of identity, it is within the officer\u2019s discretion to determine that under the circumstances, no other evidence of identity will be satisfactory. When that occurs, the officer may take the citee before a magistrate without further inquiry. We reject the implicit premise of appellant\u2019s arguments that an officer has some duty to make inquiries designed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>elicit whatever evidence of identity a citee may have. Like the problem of defining \u201csatisfactory evidence\u201d for all circumstances, the difficulty of anticipating what inquiries should be made prevents any workable judicial resolution of what is essentially a problem for the officer in the field. Once the officer has made some inquiry which puts the citee on notice that he or she has a duty to produce \u201cevidence of his [or her] identity,\u201d (\u00a7 40302), we believe the officer has done all that is required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">We cannot accept the suggestion of the dissent that an officer <em>must </em>make some unspecified inquiry intended to elicit such oral assurances of identity as a citee may be able to provide, and may only take the citee into custody where there are specific and articulable facts from which the officer can conclude the citee has not accurately identified himself. (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at pp. 1200-1201.) First, such a requirement would invite judicial second-guessing. Unless we are prepared to require some <em>specific </em>inquiry, we leave the police officer to speculate when he has asked enough questions to satisfy some future judicial review, or when a court will agree the evidence of identity he has received was insufficient under the circumstances. (Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ross </em>(1982) 456 U.S. 798, 826 [72 L.Ed.2d 572, 594-595, 102 S.Ct. 2157] (cone. opn. of Powell, J.) [noting importance of specific guidance to police and courts in recurring problem of automobile searches].) Second, nothing in section 40302 requires the inquiry the dissent would impose. Indeed, to the extent the dissent would impose a burden on <em>the officer </em>to establish why a particular attempt at identification was unsatisfactory, the dissent appears to contradict the premise that the burden of producing evidence of identity is on the citee. If the Legislature desired to impose that requirement, it could have done so. However, it has chosen in section 40302 to commit some discretion to the arresting officer, as it has done to an even greater extent in other Vehicle Code arrest statutes. (See \u00a7\u00a7 40303, 40304 [decision to take citee into custody made in officer\u2019s \u201cjudgment\u201d without other criteria].) In short, we believe the dissent\u2019s approach is neither practical nor authorized by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Applying the principles we have discussed to the case at bench, we conclude Officer Brown\u2019s decision to take Monroe into custody pending an appearance before the magistrate was reasonable and permitted by section 40302. After his arrest for violation of the open container statute, Monroe was asked if he had any identification; he responded he did not.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> At that point, Officer Brown had discretion to either continue to question Monroe to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>elicit other evidence of Monroe\u2019s identity, or to determine that Monroe should be taken before a magistrate. Officer Brown\u2019s decision to take the latter course was authorized by section 40302. We therefore reject Monroe\u2019s claim that the ensuing custodial search of his person was illegal because the custody was not permitted by the arrest statute, and turn to his claim the statute is constitutionally invalid if read in the manner we find is correct.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">\n<em>Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Because we conclude the decision to accept evidence of identity other than a driver\u2019s license or its equivalent is a matter for the discretion of the officer in the field, we must reach appellant\u2019s claim the statute is unconstitutionally vague. Appellant\u2019s claim rests principally on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Kolender </em>v. <em>Lawson </em>(1983) 461 U.S. 352 [75 L.Ed.2d 903, 103 S.Ct. 1855]. In <em>Kolender, </em>the Supreme Court invalidated part of a California criminal vagrancy statute as it had been interpreted by the California courts. The statute, Penal Code section 647, subdivision (e),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> had been read to allow arrest and prosecution where the arrested person failed to provide an officer with \u201ccredible and reliable\u201d evidence of their identity when asked to do so. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Solomon </em>(1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 429, 438 [108 Cal.Rptr. 867]; see <em>Kolender </em>v. <em>Lawson, supra, </em>461 U.S. at pp. 355-357 and fn. 4 [75 L.Ed.2d at pp. 907-909] <em>[Solomon </em>expressed law of California on point].) The Supreme Court held the statute as interpreted was fatally vague because it \u201cencourage[d] arbitrary enforcement by failing to describe with sufficient particularity what a suspect must do in order to satisfy the statute,\u201d i.e., to satisfy the officer that he or she had sufficiently identified himself. <em>(Kolender </em>v. <em>Lawson, supra, </em>461 U.S. at p. 361 [75 L.Ed.2d at p. 911].) The court reasoned that \u201cthe full discretion accorded to the police to determine whether the suspect has provided a credible and reliable identification necessarily entrusts] lawmaking to the moment-to-moment judgment of the policeman on his beat. . . . [The California statute] furnishes a convenient tool for harsh and discriminatory enforcement by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>local prosecuting officials, against particular groups deemed to merit their displeasure, and confers on police a virtually unrestrained power to arrest and charge persons with a violation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 360 [75 L.Ed.2d at p. 911] [internal marks and citations omitted]; and see e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Mirmirani </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 375, 382 [178 Cal.Rptr. 792, 636 P.2d 1130]; <em>Bowland </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 479, 492 [134 Cal.Rptr. 630, 556 P.2d 1081].)</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">There is no question that to the extent the \u201csatisfactory evidence\u201d language of section 40302 leaves the determination what is \u201csatisfactory\u201d to the citing officer, it is vague under the principles set out in <em>Kolender </em>v. <em>Lawson, supra, </em>461 U.S. 352 [75 L.Ed.2d 903]. As we interpret it, section 40302 in some cases leaves the determination what is reliable evidence of identity entirely to the officer. If section 40302 defined a criminal offense, there would be little question that it would be invalid after <em>Kolender. </em>However, it is not such a statute, and the same analysis does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Section 40302 and similar <em>procedural </em>statutes do not define criminal behavior. They are specific legislative delegations of executive discretion to police. Their application presupposes the citee has been arrested for the commission of a public offense, albeit of a special variety. (\u00a7 40302 [statute applies when \u201cany person is arrested for any violation of this code\u201d]; see <em>Simon, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 200 [Vehicle Code violator is \u201carrested\u201d when officer has probable cause and begins process of citation].) Once a suspect is legally arrested for violation of a valid criminal statute, there is no constitutional bar to full custody and detention to protect the public and to ensure the arrestee is brought before a magistrate; in short, full custodial arrest is justified. However, the fact that taking the citee into custody under section 40302 is justified because the reliable evidence of identity we have discussed is not presented, does not require the officer to then so act. He retains the executive discretion, but is not required, to obtain other evidence of identity. In sum, the decision whether to implement that power and take the suspect into custody or to cite and release is a discretionary exercise of executive power which here has been expressly delegated to police. Such delegations are permissible, and are not subject to a due process challenge on the ground the delegation of discretion creates a risk of arbitrary enforcement. (See <em>Sundance </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 1101, 1133-1134 [232 Cal.Rptr. 814, 729 P.2d 80].)</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sundance </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d 1101 provides the basis for our rejection of appellant\u2019s vagueness challenge. In <em>Sundance, </em>a taxpayer and four public inebriates brought suit to enjoin (among other things) alleged constitutional abuses committed by Los <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>Angeles County officials in their enforcement of Penal Code section 647, subdivision (f), the public intoxication statute. (42 Cal.3d at p. 1108.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Among the challenges raised by the plaintiffs was an attack on an administrative rule which set guidelines under which police were to determine whether certain arrestees under the statute should be released before charges were filed against them. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1133.) Under the guidelines, police had the option of refusing release if the public inebriate in question was a \u201c \u2018continuing police problem.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>There was no dispute that the provision granted police almost unlimited discretion in the decision whether to release. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Plaintiffs argued the grant of discretion was unconstitutional because the regulation failed to give adequate notice of the prohibited conduct, and risked arbitrary enforcement by impermissibly delegating policy choices to \u201c \u2018policemen, judges, and juries.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1134, fn. 20, quoting <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>City of Rockford </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 104 [33 L.Ed.2d 222, 92 S.Ct. 2294].)</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">The <em>Sundance </em>court<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 claims on the ground that the police regulation in question was not a criminal statute and did not purport to regulate the conduct of the public. <em>(Sundance </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 1133.) The court noted that the basic policy choice, i.e., to make certain conduct illegal, had been made by the Legislature. Because the regulation did not purport to usurp that function, it was not subject to the requirement that it give adequate notice of prohibited conduct. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1134.) For the same reason, the court held that the regulation was a permissible delegation of prosecutorial discretion to police. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">We find the present problem analogous if not identical to that presented in <em>Sundance. A </em>citee subject to custody under section 40302 is already under arrest; the decision whether to cite and release the citee or bring him before a magistrate is a discretionary function akin to the decision to prosecute. It is an administrative matter unrelated to the policy choice made by the Legislature, i.e., that certain conduct should be prohibited. Thus, under the principles stated in <em>Sundance, </em>the discretion granted by section 40302 is not subject to a vagueness challenge. Section 40302 prescribes the procedure for arrest of a Vehicle Code violator; it does not prohibit conduct, nor is it the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>basis for arrest. We conclude Monroe\u2019s vagueness challenge is without foundation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">It is important to note that though we find no basis for a constitutional challenge to the form of police discretion authorized by section 40302 and similar statutes, a citee who believes that discretion has been abused is not without a remedy. Like a challenge to the discretionary decision to prosecute, a challenge to an officer\u2019s decision to take a citee into custody must be based on a showing the decision was made on invalid criteria, such as pretext, race, religion, or other classification unrelated to the purpose of the statute, i.e., to ensure the compliance of a citee with the promise to appear. In those cases in which the officer has used the custody procedure for some other purpose, the officer\u2019s decision is open to challenge. <em>(Sundance </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, 42 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 1133-1136; see, e.g., <em>Wayte </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1985) 470 U.S. 598, 607-608 [84 L.Ed.2d 547, 555-556, 105 S.Ct. 1524] [selective enforcement]; cf. <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1990) 390 Pa.Super. 493 [568 A.2d 1281, 1287] [given probable cause, discretionary decision to arrest not constitutionally significant absent evidence of discriminatory enforcement].)</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Our conclusion that section 40302 is not subject to a vagueness challenge is reinforced by the lack of any authority finding any similar statute vague, despite the fact that statutes granting police discretion to cite and release minor offenders are commonplace. The majority of jurisdictions have expressly provided some sort of discretionary citation mechanism. Under these provisions, which typically involve traffic and other minor offenses, police have discretion under various circumstances to cite and release rather than to take the offender into custody. (See Williams, The Law and Politics of Police Discretion (1985) pp. 80-82 [discussing state citation law]; LaFave, Arrest (1965) pp. 168-173; Kamisar et al., Criminal Procedure (5th ed. 1980) p. 402, fn. a; see, e.g., \u00a7 40303 [where custody not required by law, officer may nonetheless take citee into custody in his \u201cjudgment\u201d for specified violations]; \u00a7 40304 [highway patrol officer may in his \u201cjudgment\u201d either cite or take non-Vehicle Code offender into custody]; Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 853.5, 853.6, subd. (i); Ill. Ann. Stat., ch. 38, \u00a7 107-12 (West 1980) [officer \u201cmay\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number>issue citation]; Fla. Stat. Ann., \u00a7 901.28 (West 1985) [discretion to arrest on failure to supply satisfactory identification]; Alaska Stat. \u00a7 12.25.180, subd. (b)(1) (1991) [same].) These procedural statutes are representative of the delegation of discretion to police to decide when a particular offender should be issued a citation or taken before a magistrate, or in the case of the identity statutes, to determine what evidence of identification is satisfactory when a citee cannot produce a driver\u2019s license or its equivalent. As such, these statutes are a recognition of the practical importance of discretion in the everyday administration of traffic laws, which is the category of penal law which most directly affects the majority of citizens, and is their most likely point of contact with police. There are many circumstances under which arrest and custody for minor violations would be inappropriate and undesirable, even though the offender lacks any official identity document. To allow a vagueness challenge to these procedural statutes would be incorrect, and would cause untold confusion and harm to both the administration of minor traffic matters, and to those unfortunate enough to fall outside the inflexible categorization which would necessarily result from an attempt to shear police of discretion in the decision to cite and release for minor offenses. For that reason as well as those discussed above, we decline to allow Monroe\u2019s vagueness claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">\n<em>Other Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">We briefly dispose of Monroe\u2019s other claims of error.  As we have noted, there is no merit in his claim the officers lacked probable cause to arrest him for violation of the open container statute. (See fn. 4, <em>ante.) </em> For similar reasons, we reject the claim the investigative stop of the car in which Monroe was riding was invalid. (See, e.g., <em>In re Tony C. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 888, 893 [148 Cal.Rptr. 366, 582 P.2d 957].) We remind Monroe that we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the ruling below. So viewed, there were \u201cspecific and articulable facts causing [the officers] to suspect\u201d Monroe was a fugitive from a murder charge. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Monroe matched the description of the suspect in several particulars, was in a neighborhood frequented by the suspect, and was in a rental car connected with the state in which the suspect was reportedly seen. These facts, coupled with Monroe\u2019s seeming attempt to hide his face from the officers when they pulled up next to his car, were enough to warrant the investigative stop.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">We find no merit in the claim the officers were required to terminate their investigation and release Monroe immediately upon learning he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>was not the murder suspect. Viewed in the light most favorable to the ruling, the evidence supported the trial court\u2019s implicit conclusion that the officers discovered the open containers of alcohol either before or at the same time they realized Monroe was not the one they sought. Accordingly, there was probable cause to arrest Monroe, and no basis for immediate release.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">We reject without extended discussion Monroe\u2019s contention the search of his person was prohibited by the rule of <em>Simon, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at page 209 (search of person not permissible in connection with custody under \u00a7 40302.) Pursuant to initiative constitutional amendment, \u201ccourts may not exclude evidence seized in violation of either the state or federal Constitution unless exclusion is compelled by the federal Constitution,\u201d absent some specific statutory mandate. <em>(In re Lance W. </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 888 [210 Cal.Rptr. 631, 694 P.2d 744].) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1973) 414 U.S. 218 [38 L.Ed.2d 427, 94 S.Ct. 467], holds any \u201ccustodial arrest\u201d supports a full search of the person taken into custody, without regard to the nature of the offense for which the arrest was made. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 234-235 [38 L.Ed.2d at pp. 439-440].) Monroe argues <em>Robinson </em>left open the question whether an arrest pursuant to section 40302 would subject the arrestee to full search. We disagree. The only question left open in <em>Robinson </em>was whether such a search would be reasonable where the defendant was subjected to a \u201c \u2018routine traffic stop\u2019 \u201d only, without being taken into custody. (414 U.S. at p. 236, fn. 6 [38 L.Ed.2d at p. 441].) Here, Monroe was taken into custody; <em>Robinson </em>holds a search incident to that event is constitutionally reasonable. (See generally, 2 LaFave, Search and Seizure (2d ed. 1987) \u00a7 5.2, pp. 438-441.) Because the rule of <em>Simon </em>is a judicially created exclusionary rule not required by the federal constitution, it has been abrogated under the principles stated in <em>In re Lance W., supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at page 888. Appellant\u2019s position that <em>Simon </em>requires reversal is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Finally, appellant argues the trial court abused its discretion when it refused to refer him to the California Rehabilitation Center (CRC) as an alternative to a state prison sentence. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 3051.) Welfare and Institutions Code section 3051 provides that, upon conviction for any crime, a court shall suspend execution of sentence and refer the defendant to CRC if it appears the defendant is either addicted to narcotics or is about to become so. However, the statute also provides the court may decline to make the CRC referral if \u201cin the opinion of the judge, the defendant\u2019s record and probation report indicate such a pattern of criminality that he or she does not constitute a fit subject for commitment.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 3051; see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Sanford </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 1181, 1183 [251 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>707].) Here, the court specifically found a pattern of criminality rendering Monroe unfit for rehabilitation. The record supported the trial court\u2019s finding. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Ellers </em>(1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 943, 956 [166 Cal.Rptr. 888] [standard of review].) In the period 1985 through 1989, Monroe had suffered prior convictions of theft, battery, receiving stolen property, and firearms and narcotics offenses. The probation officer noted Monroe\u2019s \u201cextensive criminal history,\u201d his parole violations, and the statement of Monroe\u2019s parole officer that Monroe \u201cexhibited the attitude of a professional criminal.\u201d We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Peterson, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Unless otherwise indicated, all further statutory references are to the Vehicle Code.</p>\n<p id=\"AxU\">Section 40302 provides in part: \u201cWhenever any person is arrested for any violation of this code, not declared to be a felony, the arrested person shall be taken without unnecessary delay before a magistrate within the county in which the offense charged is alleged to have been committed and who has jurisdiction of the offense and is nearest or most accessible with reference to the place where the arrest is made in any of the following cases: [J] (a) When the person arrested fails to present his driver\u2019s license or other satisfactory evidence of his identity for examination.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b730-7\">As noted, Officer Brown gave several versions of his conversation with Monroe. Whether read to include the words \u201cwith me\u201d or not, Monroe\u2019s statement to Officer Brown made it clear he could not produce any written evidence of his identity. Under our reading of section 40302, that inability left Officer Brown with discretion to either continue to question Monroe, or to take him into custody. Because our conclusion would remain the same no matter which version of Officer Brown\u2019s testimony was believed, we need not and do not attempt to resolve the conflicts in his testimony on the point, if any exist.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Because we conclude Officer Brown\u2019s decision to take appellant into custody was proper, we do not reach the question whether a search of his person would have been lawful absent full custody.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b732-6\">We reject appellant\u2019s contention the arrest was unlawful because he had not violated section 23223. Appellant relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Squadere </em>(1978) 88 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1. [151 Cal.Rptr. 616] <em>Squadere </em>held conviction under section 23223 was improper where the only evidence against the defendant was the presence of open containers under the seats of the car, without any evidence establishing the defendant knew the containers were there. (88 Cal.App.3d at pp. Supp. 3-4.) Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Squadere </em>is misplaced. First, the inquiry whether probable cause exists is not the same as that undertaken by an appellate court reviewing a judgment for support by substantial evidence. Second, <em>Squadere </em>is factually distinguishable; in <em>Squadere, </em>the open containers were under the seat, while here, the container was on the floor in front of appellant. Finally, <em>Squadere </em>itself points out that personal possession of the container may be proved by circumstantial evidence. <em>(Id. </em>at p. Supp. 4, fn. 2.) The presence of the container at appellant\u2019s feet was enough to ground a reasonable belief he personally possessed it.

A traffic citee is an arrested public offender who, when unable to produce identification, is by statute made subject to the level of custody required to bring him before a magistrate or equivalent official. The public inebriates in <em>Sundance </em>were arrested offenders who were by statute and rule subject to incarceration. In both cases, police are given discretionary power to determine the extent to which the offenders will be deprived of their liberty, though the degree of deprivation differs. The fact that traffic offenders may not be incarcerated for their crime and inebriates may be is a distinction without a difference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b744-8\">In a portion of his argument of this point, Monroe implies the stop was pretextual.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZ-\">I respectfully dissent. The majority interpret section 40302 of the Vehicle Code (all further undesignated references are to that code) in such a manner that a person cited for a simple traffic infraction may, at the election of the citing officer, be handcuffed and involuntarily transported to a distant booking station solely because he lacks what they call \u201cpresumptively satisfactory\u201d written identification. This result is not only inconsistent with the intent behind the identification statute, but opens the door for arbitrary treatment under the guise of routine police procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">At the outset it is important to clarify what was said in the critical exchange between Officer Brown and Monroe. Brown stated that Monroe was still seated in the car when he asked him his name; Monroe gave the name \u201cErik Monroe.\u201d According to Brown, within \u201cfive to ten seconds\u201d of this initial contact he noticed a Big Gulp cup containing beer on the floorboard and smelled alcohol. Brown then testified: \u201cI asked him if he had identification. [IQ Q. Was Mr. Monroe able to produce any identification to you? [f] A. Well, I also asked him to step from the vehicle. He complied. He stepped from the vehicle, and he said, T don\u2019t have any I.D. <em>with </em>me.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">On the next page of the transcript the officer offhandedly referred to Monroe\u2019s reply as \u201cI don\u2019t have any I.D.\u201d Defense counsel, however, alert to the important distinction, later asked the officer to clarify the discrepancy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>Officer Brown confirmed that the first version he gave was correct: \u201cQ. Officer, when you asked Mr. Monroe for identification, he said that he didn\u2019t have any <em>with him, </em>is that right? A. He said he didn\u2019t have any, yeah, <em>or any with him, yes.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Although credibility is a matter for the trial court and we cannot interfere with its resolution of <em>conflicts in the evidence (People </em>v. <em>Leyba </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 591, 596 [174 Cal.Rptr. 867, 629 P.2d 961]), there is <em>no conflict </em>where an apparent inconsistency is ultimately resolved by the witness himself. Secondly, our duty to view the evidence most favorable to the ruling below carries with it the simultaneous duty to resolve the issue in light of the <em>whole </em>record, not based on \u201c \u2018isolated bits of evidence\u2019 \u201d favorable to the prosecution. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 577 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738, 16 A.L.R.4th 1255], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Bassett </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 122, 138 [70 Cal.Rptr. 193, 443 P.2d 777].) The obvious import of the officer\u2019s testimony and a proper reading of the record compels the conclusion that Monroe\u2019s reply to the officer\u2019s request for identification was: \u201cI don\u2019t have any I.D. <em>with me.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Here, Monroe had already given the officer his name and showed cooperation by immediately complying with the request to step out of the car. Monroe\u2019s response \u201cI don\u2019t have any I.D. with me\u201d was the equivalent of saying \u201cI don\u2019t have any documentary evidence in my possession,\u201d or more colloquially, \u201cI left my wallet at home.\u201d This statement simply informs the officer that the person forgot to bring along written identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">As the majority correctly note, California has a multitiered system in dealing with persons who are stopped and cited by law enforcement officers for minor traffic violations, a scheme which \u201cin effect presumes that in the vast majority of cases the violator will not be taken into custody . . . .\u201d With certain exceptions, the officer will \u201cprepare a written notice to appear (i.e., a citation or \u2018ticket\u2019), and . . . release the violator \u2018forthwith\u2019 when the latter in turn gives his written promise that he will appear as directed . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Simon) </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 186, 199 [101 Cal.Rptr. 837, 496 P.2d 1205] <em>(Simon).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">Section 40302, subdivision (a) (section 40302(a)), sets out one <em>exception </em>to the officer\u2019s normal duty to cite and release a person stopped for a minor traffic violation. Unlike companion statutes which truly grant the officer the option of taking the citee into custody in more serious cases (\u00a7 40303 [person arrested for certain enumerated offenses \u201cshall, <em>in the judgment of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number><em>the arresting </em>officer,\u201d either be given a notice to appear or be taken without unnecessary delay before a magistrate]; \u00a7 40304 [whenever person is arrested by highway patrol officer for misdemeanor not specified in the Vehicle Code, \u201che <em>shall, in the judgment of the arresting </em>officer,\u201d either be issued a citation or be brought before a magistrate]), section 40302(a) is couched strictly in mandatory terms. It declares that when a person is cited for a violation of the Vehicle Code not declared to be a felony, he <em>\u201cshall </em>be taken without unnecessary delay before a magistrate\u201d when he <em>\u201cfails to present his driver\u2019s license or other satisfactory evidence of his identity </em>for examination.\u201d (\u00a7 40302(a), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">As noted in <em>Simon, </em>section 40302 is procedural not penal in nature and cannot itself form the basis for a lawful custodial arrest. Nevertheless a person \u201cwho is actually taken into police custody for transportation before a magistrate pursuant to section 40302 ... is \u2018under arrest\u2019 in the traditional sense of the term. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Simon, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at pp. 200-201.)</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The next issue is what constitutes \u201csatisfactory\u201d evidence of identification. The majority conclude that every citizen of this state must, to ensure that he or she will not be taken into custody for a vehicular infraction, carry what they term \u201cpresumptively satisfactory\u201d documentary identification\u2014either a driver\u2019s license or its functional equivalent. (Maj. opn., <em>ante </em>pp. 1186-1187.) Lacking that, say the majority, a citizen stopped for a minor traffic offense may either be cited and released or hauled down to the police station to be brought before a magistrate, at the option of the citing officer. This remarkable conclusion goes far beyond the statutory purpose behind section 40302.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The citation and release system \u201cis essentially an honor system, requiring the good faith and cooperation of the person cited.\u201d <em>(Simon, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 201.) Clearly, when an officer stops a person for a traffic offense it is important that the citee properly identify himself, since a promise to appear without evidence that the person signing it is who he says he is \u201csignifies little.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mercurio </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 426, 430 [88 Cal.Rptr. 750].) Section 40302 is designed to satisfy that concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">The identification statute requires that the citee present \u201cfor examination\u201d either a driver\u2019s license <em>or </em>other satisfactory evidence of identity. In the words of Justice Mosk, he must be able to convince the officer\u2014\u201ceither by exhibiting his driver\u2019s license or by \u2018other satisfactory evidence\u2019\u2014that the name he is signing on the written promise to appear corresponds to his true identity. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Simon, supra, 1 </em>Cal.3d at p. 201.) Since \u201cother satisfactory evidence\u201d is defined by reference to a driver\u2019s license, it follows that documentary evidence which constitutes the functional equivalent of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>operator\u2019s license should be accepted by the officer, absent some reason to doubt its authenticity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">It does <em>not </em>follow, however, that unless a citizen carries such identification at all times, he risks being transported against his will to answer for a vehicular infraction. There is nothing in section 40302 which implies that such punitive measures might flow from a failure to carry written identification. It is not uncommon for law-abiding individuals to occasionally leave home without taking along a driver\u2019s license or other written evidence of identity. The majority\u2019s interpretation gives the police the power to impose onerous sanctions on forgetfiil persons who have committed trivial violations of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">In today\u2019s computer age the officer in the field has a host of readily available methods of verifying the identity of a person who does not happen to have written identification in his possession. For example, a licensee who forgot his license will still be able to give a full name, address and date of birth and may even be able to recite his driver\u2019s license number from memory. In a matter of minutes, the officer can relay this data into a central computer and discover whether the record on file matches the description of and information given by the person he has stopped. A person who does not have a driver\u2019s license may be tested on certain information he gives regarding his residence, telephone number and/or place of employment. The officer may be able to ask another person at the scene whose identity has been verified to vouch for the citee\u2019s identity. Arrest and parole records are other sources of verifiable information.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">The statute\u2019s use of the term \u201cexamination\u201d does not, as the majority infer, preclude satisfactory proof of identification by oral means. The dictionary defines \u201cexamine,\u201d as \u201cto inquire into carefully,\u201d and \u201cto test by questioning in order to determine . . . fitness, or knowledge.\u201d (Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dict. (1984) p. 431.) By exhibiting identifying documents, by orally presenting the officer with verifiable identifying information, or through a combination of both, a detainee may be able to provide satisfactory evidence of his identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">Oral evidence as an alternative means of identification necessarily forms an integral part of the honor system which the Legislature intended to create in establishing the cite and-release procedure for minor traffic offenses. No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>state interest is served by punishing a person for not having adequate written identification. The \u201csatisfactory evidence\u201d requirement is there for the sole purpose of providing reasonable assurance that the cited person will fulfill his promise to appear to answer for the infraction. It follows that as an alternative to producing a valid driver\u2019s license or its equivalent, the detainee should be allowed to convince the officer by other satisfactory proof that the name he is signing on the promise to appear corresponds to his true identity. Indeed, it appears to be an already common practice among law enforcement officers to exhaust nondocumentary methods of confirming identity before taking a traffic citee into custody. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Grant </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1451, 1455, 1459 [266 Cal.Rptr. 587]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Long </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 77, 88, fn. 4 [234 Cal.Rptr. 271].)</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">I conclude that under section 40302(a), a cited person must be allowed to identify himself to a law enforcement officer through <em>either </em>the presentation of a valid driver\u2019s license <em>or </em>by offering other competent proof. \u201cOther satisfactory evidence\u201d in this context includes written evidence of identity and/or verification by oral means. Accordingly, an officer who cites a person for a minor traffic offense has a duty to question him in a manner which encompasses both of these prongs of section 40302(a) before taking that person into custody for failure to present satisfactory identification. The officer need not recite any magic words, as long as he gives the detainee a reasonable opportunity to identify himself. Once proper inquiry has been made, the burden passes to the citee to convince the officer of his identity through satisfactory means.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, nothing in this analysis <em>requires </em>an officer to accept oral assurances of identity. The individual officer may still weigh the sufficiency of the identification which has been provided. But this \u201cdiscretion,\u201d if one may use that term, is not the complete unbounded discretion of which the majority speak. It is a discretion which can be abused if the officer acts unreasonably or arbitrarily. Since the honor system embodied in section 40302 presumes that most violators will be cited and released, an officer should have some specific articulable reason to doubt that the cited person has accurately identified himself before taking him into custody. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Grant, supra, </em>217 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1455, 1459; <em>People </em>v. <em>Long, supra, </em>189 Cal.App.3d 77, 88, fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">The majority\u2019s concerns that requiring the officer to allow the cited person the opportunity to identify himself orally would saddle the court with the task of \u201crequir[ing] some specific inquiry\u201d or would relieve the citee of his burden of producing identification (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 189, italics omitted) are unfounded. The statute refers to \u201cother satisfactory evidence\u201d of identity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>My conclusion that such evidence may take oral as well as written form and that the citee must be given a chance to produce either or both provides an easily workable standard for the officer and in no way infringes upon the precept that it is still the citee\u2019s burden to identify himself and the officer\u2019s prerogative to determine the adequacy of the identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Here, Officer Brown\u2019s request for identification was met with the response that Monroe had no documentary proof in his possession. Clearly, Monroe had the ability to identify himself orally (thereby providing assurance that his promise to appear would be honored) as shown by the parole number and other information he gave to the officer <em>following </em>his arrest. Instead, without giving Monroe the opportunity to identify himself by alternative means, Officer Brown effectuated an immediate custodial arrest. Only after Monroe was handcuffed and searched did Officer Brown ask identity-related questions which, as it turned out, were answered quite truthfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">The majority harp on an imagined demand by this dissent that the police officer conduct some Miranda-like interrogation before an arrest can take place. That assumption is without justification. The problem here is not that Brown failed to utter any \u201cmagic words\u201d but that he spoke <em>no words </em>at all to indicate to the citee that he could offer \u201cother satisfactory evidence\u201d to prove his identity. In other words, the officer, without tracking the language of section 40302(a) and contrary to the purpose of that section, leapt at the opportunity to arrest Monroe.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Because Monroe was taken into custody solely on the basis of his statement that he possessed no <em>written </em>identification and without having been afforded the chance to offer nondocumentary proof of his identity, the custodial arrest was unlawful. And since the only justification for the search advanced by the People was a search incident to the custodial arrest, it follows that the warrantless search violated Monroe\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">The majority\u2019s conclusion not only misreads the legislative intent behind the statute, it poses constitutional problems. Courts have a duty to construe a statute in a manner which will preserve its constitutionality and avoid challenges for vagueness. <em>(Pryor </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 238, 253-254 [158 Cal.Rptr. 330, 599 P.2d 636]; <em>In re Kay </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 930, 942 [83 Cal.Rptr. 686, 464 P.2d 142].) \u201c[A] statute must provide sufficiently definite guidelines for the police in order to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. \u2018A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>matters to policemen, judges and juries for resolution on an <em>ad hoc </em>and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Caswell) (1988) 46 Cal.3d 381, 390 [250 Cal.Rptr. 515, 758 P.2d 1046], citing <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>City of Rockford </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 104, 108 [33 L.Ed.2d 222, 227-228, 92 S.Ct. 2294].)</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">In <em>Kolender </em>v. <em>Lawson </em>(1983) 461 U.S. 352 [75 L.Ed.2d 903, 103 S.Ct. 1855] (Kolender) the United States Supreme Court held void for vagueness Penal Code former section 647, subdivision (e), which required an individual to provide \u201ccredible and reliable\u201d identification when requested by a police officer who had reasonable suspicion of criminal activity to justify a <em>Terry </em>detention. The court held the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it \u201cvests virtually complete discretion in the hands of the police to determine whether the suspect has satisfied the statute,\u201d <em>(Kolender, supra, </em>461 U.S. at p. 358 [75 L.Ed.2d at p. 909]) and \u201cencourages arbitrary enforcement by failing to describe with sufficient particularity what a suspect must do in order to satisfy the statute.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 361 [75 L.Ed.2d at p. 911].)</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The majority imbue section 40302(a) with the same constitutionally offensive attributes described by the Supreme Court in <em>Kolender. </em>If the cited person does not present a driver\u2019s license or a document of equal value \u201csatisfactory evidence\u201d is, according to the majority, whatever the citing officer decides it is. One person may present the officer with copious, verifiable nondocumentary evidence of identification and be arrested, searched and booked. Another may simply tell the officer that he is John Doe of 123 Roe Street and be released. Allowing the result to turn solely on the personal predilections of the officer \u201cfurnishes a convenient tool for harsh and discriminatory enforcement by local prosecuting officials, against particular groups deemed to merit their displeasure. . . .

Since a person taken into custody for transportation before a magistrate under section 40302 is \u201c \u2018under arrest\u2019 in the traditional sense of the term\u201d he is deprived of his liberty just as surely as one who has been arrested for a jailable offense. <em>(Simon, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d 186, 200.) The majority\u2019s trivialization of the intrusion by pointing out that the arrestee is not technically \u201cincarcerated\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 1185, fn. 8) is of little comfort to those who are not only subjected to search and seizure but deprived of their freedom of movement for reasons which the police need not explain or justify.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>The majority\u2019s use of <em>Sundance </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 1101 [232 Cal.Rptr. 814, 729 P.2d 80], to authorize limitless discretion by the officer is likewise far off the mark. <em>Sundance </em>involved a police regulation governing whether to keep persons arrested for public drunkenness in jail or release them. An inebriate taken into custody by the police has violated the law and is already subject to incarceration. The only remaining decision is whether to book him or let him go, a matter unquestionably within the realm of prosecutorial discretion. By contrast, the traffic citee has not done anything for which he may be taken into custody or jailed\u2014in fact, incarceration for a person guilty of no more than a traffic infraction is statutorily proscribed. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 19.6; see Review of Selected 1968 Code Legislation (Cont.Ed.Bar 1968) pp. 248-251.) Thus, the person stopped for a traffic violation stands in much the same posture as the <em>Terry-stop </em>suspect in <em>Kolender.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">I find it inconceivable that the Legislature intended the anomalous result that a person who cannot be deprived of his liberty for a traffic infraction even were he to be found guilty, may nevertheless be subjected to custodial arrest at the option of the officer writing the ticket merely because he does not happen to have <em>written </em>evidence of identity in his possession.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">By imposing a de facto requirement that one present formal documentary evidence of identity upon being cited for a nonjailable violation of the Vehicle Code and granting the officer unbridled authority to search, seize and transport those who do not possess such documentation, the majority encourage arbitrary treatment of our citizens and convert what is essentially a procedural statute into a penal one, conferring virtually unrestrained power on the police to arrest and take into custody persons who have merely forgotten to carry paper identification with them. (See generally Kriiger, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number><em>Police Demand For Documentary Identification </em>(1992) 13 Crim. Justice. J. 243.)</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Equal treatment should be afforded the motorist who has forgotten his driver\u2019s license on a spur-of-the-moment afternoon trip to the suburban hardware store as well as the one returning from a social event at midnight in the inner city. Both should be granted the same right to prove identity by nondocumentary means before undergoing the degrading process of a custodial arrest. Requiring the officer to permit identification by both written and oral methods before depriving the citee of his liberty promotes such fair and evenhanded treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">I would reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied February 24,1993. Smith, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted. Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied April 29, 1993. Mosk, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-9\">Section 12811 requires every California operator\u2019s license to contain the driver\u2019s name, age, mailing address and signature as well as a brief description and photograph of the driver for purposes of identification. Documentation which contains similar identifying material thus provides reasonable assurance that the person has accurately identified himself to the officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b753-7\">My conclusion is underscored by the legislative history of Penal Code section 853.5 which addresses itself to the citing procedure to be employed in the case of nonvehicular infractions. That section provides: \u201cIn all cases, except as specified in Sections 40302 [and others] of the Vehicle Code, in which a person is arrested for an infraction, a peace officer shall only require the arrestee to present his driver\u2019s license or other satisfactory evidence of his identity for examination and to sign a written promise to appear. <em>Only if the arrestee refuses to present such identification or, refuses to sign such a written promise may the arrestee be taken into custody.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">The italicized language was inserted into the statute by a 1980 amendment, originating as Assembly Bill No. 2296 (AB 2296). (Stats. 1980, ch. 238, \u00a7 1, p. 480). The bill analysis prepared by the Assembly Committee on Criminal Justice states, \u201cAB 2296 is intended to create statewide, uniform treatment of persons cited for infraction violations, permitting custody only under the most specific and necessary of conditions. Proponents indicate that inasmuch as jail would be a prohibited sanction if the person is <em>convicted </em>of an infraction, it makes little sense to incarcerate a person who is merely <em>arrested and charged </em>with the infraction.\u201d (Bill Analysis, Assem. Com. on Criminal Justice, Mar. 17, 1980, p. 1, italics original.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
