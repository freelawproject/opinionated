Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, \u00a7 366.26) with their son, Edward R. The parents contend termination hearings conducted pursuant to this code provision deprive them of equal protection under the law. They assert section 366.26 does not permit evidence of present circumstances to be adduced while consideration of a parent\u2019s present circumstances is a safeguard feature of similar termination proceedings under Civil Code section 232, subdivision (a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">We conclude that parents whose rights are subject to termination under section 366.26 are afforded substantially the same protection available to those whose rights may be terminated under Civil Code section 232, subdivision (a)(7). Hence, we need not employ the traditional equal protection analysis to resolve the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">Statement of Case and Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">On August 9, 1989, the Fresno County Department of Social Services (DSS) filed a dependency petition shortly after Edward R.\u2019s birth. DSS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>alleged the infant came within the provisions of section 300, subdivisions (a) and (b) because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">at birth he tested positively for cocaine, opiates and barbiturates and suffered withdrawal symptoms from these substances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">his mother endangered his well-being by using controlled substances during her pregnancy with him;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">his condition required intensive observation and extra care; and, his parents were unable to provide regular care for him due to their substance abuse. The parents admitted the allegations of the petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">On November 14, 1989, the juvenile court adjudged the minor a dependent child of the court and placed him in the custody of DSS. The court ordered a reunification plan which required of both parents safe and stable housing, completion of parenting classes, counseling, substance abuse treatment and visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">At the first six-month status review hearing originally scheduled for March 12, 1990, and completed August 13, 1990, the court determined it was necessary for the child to remain in his out-of-home placement. The parents had not complied with the reunification plan nor had they made progress toward alleviating the causes which necessitated the out-of-home placement. The father had been arrested on parole violations and returned to prison. The mother had enrolled and participated in local parenting classes and a methadone program, but later moved out of the area; she needed to resume those activities. Nevertheless, the court found there was a substantial probability that the child could be returned to his mother within six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">By the time of the 12-month review hearing on November 30, 1990, circumstances had worsened rather than improved. The court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-11\">\u201cThe case plan was not complied with by the parents during the time available to them for unification. The father has not contacted the Department since his release from prison. The mother has failed to follow through with drug treatment. Neither of the parents have adequately addressed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>problems that led to out-of-home placement and a likely date when the minor could be returned to a parent is highly uncertain.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><em>\u201cThe evidence that the Court has reviewed is clear and convincing that the welfare of the minor requires that his custody remain removed from his parents at the present time and that return to either of his parents would create a substantial risk of detriment to his physical or emotional well-being.[</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>The failure of the parents to complete court ordered treatment programs is prima facie evidence that the return to a parent would be detrimental.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u201cThe minor cannot be returned at this time pursuant to Welfare &amp; Institutions Code Section 366.21. The Court cannot find any substantial probability that return could be affected within the next six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\u201cThe Court does find clear and convincing evidence that the Department of Social Services has provided reasonable services and made reasonable efforts to implement those services to the parents to enable them to alleviate the conditions that led to out-of-home placement and to assume care for the minor. Despite those services and those efforts, the parents have not cooperated. And based on this clear and convincing evidence, the Court will order that unification services be terminated, and set this matter for a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 of the Welfare &amp; Institutions Code on March the 27th, 1991 at 8:30 in this department.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The matter was continued various times from March 27, 1991, to September 18, 1991, when the section 366.26 parental termination hearing was held. At this hearing, the court found the minor was adoptable and it was likely he would be adopted if parental rights were terminated. Further, it determined none of the factors listed in section 366.26, subdivision (c)(1) existed which would make termination of parental rights detrimental to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">The court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-9\">\u201cThe primary factor in this case would be the extent of regular visitation and contact to establish a relationship. The Court finds that such contact has not been maintained and such a relationship does not exist. There is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>detriment to the child based upon that lack of a relationship in terminating parental rights. It is in the best interest of the child that those rights be terminated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">In regard to this finding, the court noted that by the time of the section 366.26 hearing, the mother:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">. . appeared to have gotten her life turned around. She has a newborn who apparently was not born with drugs in his system and she is certainly to be commended for those efforts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">. . But with respect to this particular child, he is entitled to permanency and stability that I don\u2019t believe at this point can be afforded with either of his parents simply because we have run out of time. ... I simply have no more time to build a relationship with this child with either Ms. [P.] or Mr. [R.]. This is not to say that one could not be built. I have no time to do that. Edward has no time to do [sz'c] have that done. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">\u201c. . . It was an unfortunate occurrence, but the bottom line is, there have been seven visits in two years. And, unfortunately, as Ms. Berkler testified and as this Court is persuaded, that is not enough to establish or maintain a relationship with an infant, particularly in light of the fact that while his development at this point appears to be progressing normally, he does remain at risk of significant problems due to his exposure to drugs prenatally. Stability becomes particularly important for a child who has this type of handicap to overcome.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">\u201c. . . And I think the Department Has satisfied it\u2019s [sz'c] burden of producing clear and convincing evidence that adoption is the appropriate plan for the minor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">Accordingly, the juvenile court terminated the parents\u2019 rights as to Edward R.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">Parents, whose children become dependents of the juvenile court under section 300 et seq. and are placed outside of the family home, typically have an opportunity to reunify with their children. (\u00a7 361.5.) The hope is that with reasonable reunification services for a period of 12 or at the most 18 months, the problems which led to the dependency proceedings may be alleviated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>and the children may be returned to their parents\u2019 custody. (See \u00a7\u00a7 361.5, subd. (a), 366.21, subds. (e), (f), 366.22, subd. (a).) When, however, reunification has been unsuccessful and the children may not be returned, a permanent plan for the children\u2019s future becomes necessary. (See \u00a7\u00a7 366.21, subd. (g), 366.22, subd. (a).) As a matter of public policy, the juvenile court gives first priority to adoption as the most desirable permanent plan. (\u00a7\u00a7 366.25, 366.26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">In those cases in which a minor has been adjudged a dependent child since before 1989 and the juvenile court has selected adoption as the permanent plan, the court in turn orders the initiation of separate proceedings in the superior court under Civil Code section 232 to declare the child free from parental control. (\u00a7 366.25.) Civil Code section 232 authorizes termination of parental rights under a variety of scenarios, including when the child:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">. . has been in out-of-home placement under the supervision of the juvenile court, the county welfare department, or other public or private licensed child-placing agency for a one-year period, <em>if the court finds </em>that return of the child to the child\u2019s parent or parents would be detrimental to the child and <em>that the parent or parents have failed during that period, and are likely to fail in the future, to maintain an adequate parental relationship with the child, which includes providing both a home and care and control for the child.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">\u201cIf the minor has been adjudged a dependent child of the juvenile court and placed in out-of-home placement pursuant to Section 361 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, the one-year period shall be calculated from the date of the dispositional hearing at which the child was placed in out-of-home placement pursuant to that section. If the minor is in placement under the supervision of a county welfare department or other public or private licensed child-placing agency, pursuant to a voluntary placement, as described in Section 16507.4 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, the one-year period shall be calculated from the date the minor entered out-of-home placement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">\u201cThe court shall make a determination that reasonable services have been provided or offered to the parents which were designed to aid the parents to overcome the problems which led to the deprivation or continued loss of custody and that despite the availability of these services, return of the child to the parents would be detrimental to the child. The probation officer or social worker currently assigned to the case of the child shall appear at the termination proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">\u201cIf the minor has been adjudged to be a dependent child of the court pursuant to Section 300 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, the court shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>review and consider the contents of the juvenile court file in determining if the services offered were reasonable under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">\u201cTrial placement of the child in the physical custody of the parent or visitation of the child with the parent during the one-year period, when the trial placement or visitation does not result in permanent placement of the child with the parent, shall not serve to interrupt the running of the one-year period.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 232, subd. (a)(7), italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">For those children adjudged dependents on or after January 1, 1989, the procedure is somewhat different. In an effort to expedite the permanent plan, a separate Civil Code section 232 proceeding is no longer necessary. Instead, if after 12 or, in some cases, 18 months of reasonable reunification efforts the juvenile court determines that return of the child to the parents\u2019 custody would create a substantial risk of detriment for the child\u2019s physical or emotional well-being, the court will schedule a hearing at which it will not only choose the permanent plan but also implement that plan. Section 366.26 authorizes the juvenile court to terminate parental rights at the selection and implementation hearing provided certain findings are made. Section 366.26 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">\u201c(c) At the hearing the court shall proceed pursuant to one of the following procedures:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">\u201c(1) <em>It shall terminate parental rights only if it determines by clear and convincing evidence that it is likely that the minor will be adopted. If the court so determines, the findings </em>pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 361.5 that reunification services shall not be offered, or the findings pursuant to subdivision (e) of Section 366.21 that the whereabouts of a parent have been unknown for six months or that the parent has failed to visit or contact the child for six months or that the parent has been convicted of a felony indicating parental unfitness, or <em>pursuant to Section 366.21 or Section 366.22 that a minor cannot or should not be returned to his or her parent or guardian, shall then constitute a sufficient basis for termination of parental rights </em>unless the court finds that termination would be detrimental to the minor due to one of the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">\u201c(A) The parents or guardians have maintained regular visitation and contact with the minor and the minor would benefit from continuing the relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-10\">\u201c(B) A minor 10 years of age or older objects to termination of parental rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>\u201c(C) The child is placed in a residential treatment facility, adoption is unlikely or undesirable, and continuation of parental rights will not prevent finding the child a permanent family placement if the parents cannot resume custody when residential care is no longer needed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\">\u201c(D) The minor is living with a relative or foster parent who is unable or unwilling to adopt the minor because of exceptional circumstances, which do not include an unwillingness to accept legal responsibility for the minor, but who is willing and capable of providing the minor with a stable and permanent environment and the removal of the minor from the physical custody of his or her relative or foster parent would be detrimental to the emotional well-being of the minor.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The parents in this case contend that section 366.26 does not take into consideration, as does Civil Code section 232, subdivision (a)(7), whether parents are likely to fail in the future to maintain an adequate parental relationship with the child. According to them, the likelihood of future failure means the court must evaluate the circumstances of the parent at the time of the actual termination hearing. As the parents read section 366.26, it does not even permit the admission of present circumstances evidence. From this they assert section 366.26 violates their equal protection rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">While the parties devote much effort to issues of \u201csimilarly situated\u201d parents and standard of review, it appears unnecessary to reach these questions. Despite the parents\u2019 argument to the contrary and as discussed below, parents whose rights are subject to termination under Civil Code section 232, subdivision (a)(7) do not receive greater safeguards than those whose rights may be terminated according to the new statutory scheme. Thus, absent the underlying premise of unequal treatment, the issues of similarly situated parents and rational basis versus strict scrutiny analysis become moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">\n<em>Likelihood of Future Failure and Present Circumstances</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">As previously noted, the parents argue the reference in Civil Code section 232, subdivision (a)(7) to a parent\u2019s likely failure in the future to maintain an adequate parental relationship with the child means the court must consider a parent\u2019s present circumstances before terminating his or her rights. They cite in this regard <em>In re Carmaleta B. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 482, 493 [146 Cal.Rptr. 623, 579 P.2d 514], in which our state Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">\u201cIt is well settled that an order to free a child from parental custody and control must rest on present circumstances as well as past acts although such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>prior acts are evidence which may be considered by the court in deciding whether there is sufficient showing to justify the order. <em>(In re Morrow </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 39, 54, 56 [88 Cal.Rptr. 142]; <em>In re Zimmerman </em>(1962) 206 Cal.App.2d 835, 844-845 [24 Cal.Rptr. 329]; <em>In re Cardenas </em>(1961) 194 Cal.App.2d 849, 855 [15 Cal.Rptr. 238]; <em>In re Williams </em>(1955) 133 Cal.App.2d 515 [284 P.2d 510].)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The court in <em>Carmaleta B. </em>determined a parental neglect finding which would support a Civil Code section 232, subdivision (a)(2) petition could not be predicated solely on the acts which initially caused the dependency proceedings. Otherwise, the trial court would be doing nothing more than finalizing an antecedent interlocutory judgment of the juvenile court. <em>(Carmaleta B., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at pp. 493-494.) Accordingly, the court held a parent is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">\u201c \u2018. . . entitled to have the circumstances leading to the [dependency] order[s] reviewed in light of subsequent events, and with consideration of the nature of the order sought in [this proceeding]. ... It [was] reasonable to consider under subdivision (b) [of section 232] whether the conditions which gave rise to the . . . neglect still persisted].\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 494.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Notably, the petition in <em>Carmaleta B. </em>did not include a Civil Code section 232, subdivision (a)(7) allegation. Thus, one could argue that in this case the parents\u2019 reliance on <em>Carmaleta B. </em>is unfounded. However, at least one appellate court has determined it can find no reason why the present circumstances language in <em>Carmaleta B. </em>should not apply equally to situations involving Civil Code section 232, subdivision (a)(7). <em>(In re Jonathan R. </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 1214, 1220 [259 Cal.Rptr. 863].)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">\u201cWithout considering the current situation of the parents, it would be impossible for the court to make the required determination that they are likely to fail in the future to maintain an adequate parental relationship with the child.\u201d (211 Cal.App.3d at p. 1221.)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">We will assume the parents here and the court in <em>Jonathan R. </em>are correct that the language respecting likelihood of a parent\u2019s future failure requires a court to consider a parent\u2019s present circumstances. The present claim of an equal protection violation is nevertheless unmeritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">In analyzing the statutory scheme applicable to post-1988 adjudications of dependency, it appears the Legislature has developed a mechanism so that the juvenile court will properly determine whether the conditions which gave rise to the dependency still persist. At every review hearing before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>section 366.26 selection and implementation hearing, the juvenile court must consider a parent\u2019s efforts or progress, through reunification, to overcome the problems which led to the dependency. (\u00a7\u00a7 366.21, subds. (e), (f), 366.22, subd. (a).) This is consistent with the law\u2019s stated goal of reunifying the family if possible within the mandated time constraints. (See \u00a7 361.5.) In addition, at each status review hearing the court must project a likely date by which the child may be returned to the home or placed for adoption or legal guardianship. (\u00a7 366.) In order to project when the child may be returned or given a permanent placement, the court must attempt to predict the likelihood for reunification which turns, in large measure, on the parent\u2019s ability to maintain an adequate parental relationship with the child. Thus, under the new statutory scheme as well as Civil Code section 232, subdivision (a)(7), we find the court evaluates the likelihood of a parent\u2019s future failure to maintain an adequate parent-child relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Once the juvenile court orders a section 366.26 hearing, however, the attention shifts to assessing whether the minor is adoptable. (\u00a7\u00a7 366.21, subd. (i), 366.22, subd. (b).) At this juncture, the juvenile court has impliedly determined the problems leading to dependency still persist despite reasonable reunification efforts. In fact, the court at this point will terminate reunification services to the parent. (\u00a7\u00a7 366.21, subds. (g), (h), 366.22, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Under the new statutory scheme, the Legislature essentially bifurcates the termination proceedings involving dependent children of the juvenile court. In a case where the juvenile court has ordered reunification services but reunification has been unsuccessful, the basis for termination is established at the 12-or 18-month hearing with the court finding that the minor cannot or should not be returned to his or her parent or guardian. (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (c)(1).) Then at the section 366.26 hearing, the court determines the child\u2019s adoptability. (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (c)(1).) A parent\u2019s present circumstances are irrelevant to the adoptability issue which must be decided at the section 366.26 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Bifurcation of the termination proceedings acknowledges the change in focus from the parents\u2019 chances for reunification at the status review hearings to the child\u2019s chances for adoption at the selection and implementation hearing. We find nothing in the law, <em>Carmaleta B. </em>included, which prohibits the Legislature from so acting. Nor is the juvenile court finalizing an antecedent interlocutory judgment, to use language from <em>Carmaleta B., </em>as the parents argue. The concern in <em>Carmaleta B. </em>was that a court could terminate parental rights based on the neglect which led to the child\u2019s dependency rather than whether such neglect persisted. Certainly, the new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>statutory scheme emphasizes the importance of reunification efforts and a parent\u2019s progress in curing the ills which led to dependency. To adopt the parents\u2019 approach would require the juvenile court to relitigate, for all intents and purposes, the basis for termination by necessarily considering the parents\u2019 circumstances at the time of the section 366.26 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">This is not to say, however, that the juvenile court should refuse to consider the circumstances as they exist by the time of section 366.26 hearing. First, present circumstances are relevant in resolving whether the parent has maintained regular visitation and contact with the minor and the minor would benefit from continuing the relationship. (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (c)(1)(A).) An affirmative finding in this regard would warrant a juvenile court decision not to terminate parental rights. Interestingly, under the pre-1989 law, regular visitation and contact and the benefit to the child were issues to be determined in the juvenile court before it authorized the initiation of a separate termination proceeding; they were not express criteria for the superior court to evaluate in the Civil Code section 232 action. Here, there was present circumstances evidence introduced by the county on the visitation and relationship issue in this case. The parents do not challenge the court\u2019s finding against them on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The mother does claim that the court refused to admit evidence at the section 366.26 hearing which would \u201cprobably\u201d have shown that she had met the reunification requirements. The court had sustained a relevancy objection to the question, \u201cAre you aware that my client attended a parenting class?\u201d Mother\u2019s counsel posed this query to a social worker. Notably, mother\u2019s counsel neither challenged the objection nor the court ruling. Thus, she may be deemed to have waived the issue (Evid. Code, \u00a7 353.) On the merits, however, the court properly ruled the question was irrelevant. The question of attendance related to the matter of reunification which was not at issue by the time of this hearing nor was it germane to whether she had maintained regular visitation and contact with the child. (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (c)(1)(A).)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Finally, a parent may seek to introduce present circumstances evidence to the juvenile court in the form of a modification petition (\u00a7 388; see also, Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1432). The Legislature has left the door open for a parent, citing changed circumstances, to move to modify the juvenile court\u2019s order leading up to the section 366.26 hearing, e.g., the orders continuing out-of-home placement and setting the selection and implementation hearing based on a detriment finding. (\u00a7\u00a7 385, 388.) While a parent bears the burden of proof on a modification, this makes sense considering the court\u2019s previous determination of substantial risk of detriment which the county had the burden of proving. In this case, however, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>mother who had, according to the court\u2019s remarks, made some progress in her lifestyle, did not seek to modify pursuant to section 388 the court\u2019s earlier determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Nevertheless, the juvenile court does appear to have considered the social worker\u2019s report about a change in the mother\u2019s circumstances. The judge noted,</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u201cThis is a case, with respect to Miss [P.], where her efforts have simply been too late to affect reunification (with) this child. And this is not an easy decision for me to make because I know she is providing for other children and, apparently, providing for them very effectively. She has, at this point, appeared to have gotten her life turned around. She has a newborn who apparently was not born with drugs in his system and she is certainly to be commended for those efforts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">\u201cMiss [P.], I don\u2019t mean in anyway to slight those efforts. But with respect to this particular child, he is entitled to permanency and stability that I don\u2019t believe at this point can be afforded with either of his parents simply because we have run out of time. ... I simply have no more time to build a relationship with this child with either (of his parents). This is not to say that one could not be built. I have no time to do that. Edward has no time to . . . have that done. He\u2019s entitled at this point in his life to have his future determined and to have stability provided to him. And under the circumstances, I am persuaded by the evidence, which I find clear and convincing, that termination of parental rights and adoption is in his best interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Thus, it appears the court did weigh the evidence of a change in the mother\u2019s circumstances, i.e., that she possibly had become drug free as of the time of the termination hearing and was able to provide a stable home for Edward as against the evidence that Edward was suitable for and needed an adoptive home for his own stability and future well-being. The court then found by clear and convincing evidence that termination of parental rights and adoption was in Edward\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">Considering the two statutory schemes for terminating the parent-child relationship, we find no merit to the equal protection argument.  As Justice Holmes explained years ago, our Constitution does not guarantee a legislative status quo. \u201c[Tjhe Fourteenth Amendment does not forbid statutes and statutory changes to have a beginning and thus to discriminate between the rights of an earlier and later time.\u201d <em>(Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co. </em>v. <em>Rhodes </em>(1911) 220 U.S. 502, 505 [55 L.Ed. 561, 562, 31 S.Ct. 490]; see also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number><em>Williams </em>v. <em>Walsh </em>(1912) 222 U.S. 415, 421 [56 L.Ed. 253, 255, 32 S.Ct. 137].) While a state legislature obviously may not impinge on fundamental personal rights protected by the Constitution absent a showing of a compelling state interest, the parental termination procedures under section 366.26 do not effect such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Stone (W.

Kennard, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b134-13\">Retired Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeal, Fifth District, sitting under assignment by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b134-14\">All statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b136-10\">The mother had not had any contact with the minor or DSS since August 1990.

However, since the juvenile court wisely made its detriment finding by clear and convincing evidence, the father is in no position to complain.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
