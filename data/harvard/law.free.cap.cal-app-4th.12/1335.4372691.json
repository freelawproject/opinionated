J.</author>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">Santa Ana\u2019s Bristol Street has been described by the city\u2019s mayor as \u201cthe biggest embarrassment\u201d in the county. City council members have termed it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>a \u201cdisaster,\u201d \u201ctroubled,\u201d and in need of \u201chelp.\u201d Residents of the city have described it as \u201cunsightly, congested,\u201d and a \u201cmess.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">The street was developed as a residential area in the 10 years following World War II, but has changed over time to mixed residential and commercial uses. Single-family houses now sit next to small businesses and \u201cstrip\u201d shopping centers. Utility lines tower overhead, there are billboards aplenty, and a cacophony of signs dot the landscape in a haphazard mixture of old and new. We doubt anyone would disagree that the street is not one of the garden spots of Southern California.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">What Bristol is not is a \u201cslum.\u201d It bears no resemblance to Glasgow\u2019s Drumchapel or New York\u2019s South Bronx. There are no tenements; there is little graffiti. During the 1980\u2019s, the dollar volume of the street\u2019s merchants increased by 10 percent (not quite enough to keep up with inflation), and the assessed value of property actually increased at a rate more than twice the city average.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The street itself is also severely congested, and unquestionably in need of widening. No doubt motivated both by this need and a desire to replace a source of civic \u201cembarrassment\u201d with a source of civic pride, the City Council of Santa Ana adopted an ordinance putting the property on and near the street in a redevelopment district. The redevelopment plan envisions the transformation of Bristol from what it is today to a modern thoroughfare, complete with a landscaped median strip, new storm drains and signals and (as urban planners are wont to say) \u201cvisual continuity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">The main drawback is that some people are going to lose their homes and jobs or businesses in the process. Two of those people, an optometrist whose office is on Bristol and a single mother who lives in the redevelopment zone, instituted this lawsuit to block the project. The trial court entered judgment in the city\u2019s favor, and the plaintiffs now appeal, contending there was not enough evidence of \u201cblight\u201d as required by California\u2019s Community Redevelopment Law (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 33000 et seq.) in the record before the city council.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">As explained below, the evidence supporting a finding of blight, while \u201cthin,\u201d manages to pass muster under the substantial evidence test. The project area undeniably suffers from overcrowding, a substantial number of dilapidated buildings, and a crime rate higher than the city wide average.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">However, we cannot affirm the judgment in its entirety. The project area includes nonblighted property unrelated to the widening of Bristol Street, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>and the city has not provided an adequate explanation why that property must be included. Also, Health and Safety Code section 33367, subdivision (d)(8)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requires redevelopment be supported by findings that there <em>are </em>or are <em>being provided </em>equivalent dwellings for those who lose their homes. There is no evidence supporting any such findings in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">II. Facts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">By 1987, the Santa Ana City Council had become concerned about increased traffic congestion on Bristol Street. Certain improvements needed to be made to the road to alleviate peak hour traffic congestion. To that end, city officials decided to widen the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">They were also concerned with what were perceived to be \u201csigns of physical, social and economic deterioration\u201d of the surrounding area, which contained \u201csome of the most troubled portions\u201d of the city. They determined that a redevelopment project should be created along or near a 3.9-mile section of the street. The project would cover an area consisting of about 2,000 separate properties on 783 acres; 1,400 of these properties would not be on Bristol itself. City officials hired an outside redevelopment consulting firm to help implement the project and prepare a redevelopment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">During September and October 1987, the consulting firm conducted a field survey of all buildings and properties in the project area. It is undisputed the survey involved only the exteriors of the buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">The consulting firm rated the buildings on the basis of four categories, from A through D in descending order, the exact definitions of which are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Essentially, a residential building could be rated in category C (major repairs) if it required more than an estimated $5,000 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>repairs to bring it into \u201cfull code compliance;\u201d a commercial structure would fall into the category if the probable repair bill would exceed $10,000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">The consulting firm found that of 865 single-family homes in the area, 415, or 48 percent, fell into category C and another 161, or 18.6 percent, fell into category D (\u201cExtensive Reconstruction/Dilapidated\u201d). Of 179 multifamily residences, 106, or 59.2 percent, were rated in category C, while another 17, or 9.5 percent, were in category D.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">There were 693 commercial structures. Of these, 318, or 45.9 percent, were category C, while 68, or 9.8 percent, were in category D. Overall, of 1,854 structures in the area, 47.1 percent were rated in category C, while 13.7 percent were put in category D.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">The consultants also compared the crime rate in the area with that of the rest of the city. They asserted the project area had a crime rate of 11.49 per I, 000 population for the period January through November 1987, while the rest of the city had a crime rate of 7.22 per 1,000 population. While the II. 49 figure does not appear to hold up under scrutiny, the rate does appear to be somewhat higher than the citywide average.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>The redevelopment plan that emerged from the consultants\u2019 work is supposed to cost $335 million. This includes the cost of new public improvements on Bristol, such as storm drains and street lights, \u201cland assembly,\u201d a structural rehabilitation program, and deposits into a low and moderate income housing fund. About one-third of the cost, $120 million, is to widen Bristol Street. The plan covers a 35-year period, with all takings by eminent domain to be accomplished within 12 years. Tax increment revenues are projected to be $344 million over the 35-year life of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">In late 1987 and throughout 1988 a project area committee (PAC) made up of residents and community organizations in the project area held over 20 public meetings about the redevelopment project. The PAC voted three times on the plan. Each time the vote was against.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">The Santa Ana Redevelopment Agency and city council held hearings on the plan in 1989, and in December of that year the council adopted Ordinance No. NS-2039, approving the plan. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint followed in January 1990, alleging the plan was not really concerned with eliminating blight, but with financing the widening and improving of Bristol Street.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also asserted the plan contained no feasible method for the relocation of families who would lose their homes to eminent domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\"> The case came to trial in December 1990. Trial consisted essentially of oral argument over a documentary record.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court made its decision in March 1991, finding that the plan \u201ccomplies with all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>applicable statutory provisions and is valid in all respects.\u201d The city \u201cdid not abuse its discretion in that its finding of blight is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d A judgment determining Ordinance No. NS-2039 and the plan were lawful and valid without qualification was filed in May. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"ASH\">A. <em>Blight</em></p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">We begin with an elementary rule enunciated by our Supreme Court in <em>Sweetwater Valley Civic Assn. </em>v. <em>City of National City </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 270, 277 [133 Cal.Rptr. 859, 555 P.2d 1099]: \u201cTo allow redevelopment under CRL [Community Redevelopment Law], the proposed area must be blighted.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 primary contention in this appeal is that there is insufficient evidence the project area is \u201cblighted\u201d as defined by the CRL.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">The question is a close one. Neither the exterior condition of the area\u2019s buildings nor the crime rate is enough by itself to show blight.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">First, as to the buildings: Other than the know-it-when-you-see-it category D for dilapidated buildings (about 14 percent), the definitions used by the consulting firm do not tell us much. The demarcation line between buildings requiring \u201cmajor\u201d repairs and those requiring only \u201cminor\u201d ones appears drawn to bring the largest possible number into the \u201cmajor\u201d category: Any residential building requiring more than $5,000 in repairs to bring it \u201cup to code,\u201d and any commercial building requiring more than $10,000 in such repairs falls into category C. Thus we do not know (and cannot figure out) how many of the roughly 48 percent of the buildings in this category really approach something that is, in the words of section 33031, \u201cconducive to ill health, transmission of disease, infant mortality, juvenile delinquency, and crime.\u201d Absent tighter definitions, we are loathe to declare the evidence sufficient based on the number of structures which have (perhaps arbitrarily, perhaps not) been grouped into the \u201cmajor repair\u201d category.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">Second, as explained in footnote 5, the crime rate appears only marginally higher than the citywide average.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is nowhere near as disproportionate to the citywide average as found in other cases where there was substantial evidence of blight. (Cf. <em>In re Redevelopment Plan for Bunker Hill </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 21 [37 Cal.Rptr. 74, 389 P.2d 538] [double city average]; <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Community Redevelopment Agency </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 243 [284 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 745] [double city average]; <em>National City Business Assn. </em>v. <em>City of National City </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 1060 [194 Cal.Rptr. 707] [50 percent higher].)</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">However, in addition to the 14 percent of structures which are dilapidated, and a marginally higher crime rate, there is undeniable evidence of overcrowding. According to the report, the project area has a population density about 22 percent higher than the rest of the City of Santa Ana (3.8 persons per household as distinct from a city average of 3.1). Defining \u201covercrowded\u201d to mean between 1 and 1.5 persons per room, and \u201cseverely overcrowded\u201d to mean more than 1.5 persons per room, the report finds 14 percent of the project area units overcrowded, and 17 percent severely overcrowded. The citywide figures are 8 and 10 percent respectively, and it is common knowledge Santa Ana has an overcrowding problem. (See generally <em>Briseno </em>v. <em>City of Santa Ana </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1378 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 486].) It is undeniable that overcrowding, whatever its other aspects, is \u201cconducive to ill health\u201d and the \u201ctransmission of disease.\u201d (See Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 33031.)</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">The definition of a \u201cblighted area\u201d has been set forth by the Legislature in sections 33030, 33031, and 33032. The first sentence in section 33030 is introductory, telling the reader that certain areas in the state are liabilities that need to be redeveloped.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The second refers the reader to \u201cconditions set forth in\u201d sections 33031 or 33032: \u201cA blighted area is one which is characterized by one or more of those conditions set forth in Sections 33031 or 33032, causing a reduction of, or lack of, proper utilization of the area to such an extent that it constitutes a serious physical, social, or economic burden on the community which cannot reasonably be expected to be reversed or alleviated by private enterprise acting alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Sections 33031 and 33032 detail a variety of \u201cconditions.\u201d Section 33031 centers on \u201cbuildings and structures\u201d which, in effect, are health hazards, or a cause of juvenile delinquency or crime: \u201cA blighted area is characterized by the existence of buildings and structures, used or intended to be used for living, commercial, industrial, or other purposes, or any combination of such uses, which are unfit or unsafe to occupy for such purposes and are conducive to ill health, transmission of disease, infant mortality, juvenile delinquency, and crime because of any one or a combination of the following factors: [f] (a) Defective design and character of physical construction. []Q <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>(b) Faulty interior arrangement and exterior spacing. [*\u00a10 (c) High density of population and overcrowding. H] (d) Inadequate provision for ventilation, light, sanitation, open spaces, and recreation facilities, ffl] (e) Age, obsolescence, deterioration, dilapidation, mixed character, or shifting of uses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Section 33032 centers on some dysfunctional aspects of properties in a given location. It reads in pertinent part: \u201cA blighted area is characterized by properties that suffer from economic dislocation, deterioration, or disuse because of one or more of the following factors that cause a reduction of, or lack of, proper utilization of the area to such an extent that it constitutes a serious physical, social, or economic burden on the community that cannot reasonably be expected to be reversed or alleviated by private enterprise acting alone: [f] (1) The subdividing and sale of lots of irregular form and shape and inadequate size for proper usefulness and development, [f] (2) The laying out of lots in disregard of the contours and other topography or physical characteristics of the ground and surrounding conditions, [ffl (3) The existence of inadequate public improvements, public facilities, open spaces, and utilities which cannot be remedied by private or governmental action without redevelopment. HO (4) A prevalence of depreciated values, impaired investments, and social and economic maladjustment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">In the present case, the clear evidence of overcrowding, combined with 14 percent dilapidation and a marginally higher crime rate, shows the area to be characterized by a \u201ccondition\u201d in section 33031, i.e., the existence of \u201cbuildings . . . which are unfit or unsafe to occupy . . . and are conducive to ill health, transmission of disease, infant mortality, juvenile delinquency, and crime because of. . . [SO (c) High density of population and overcrowding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Our conclusion is also consistent with the cases which have addressed the quantum of evidence necessary to show blight. The two leading cases holding the evidence insufficient, <em>Sweetwater Valley Civic Assn. </em>v. <em>City of National City, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 270, and <em>Emmington </em>v. <em>Solano County Redevelopment Agency </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 491 [237 Cal.Rptr. 636], both involved open land. <em>Sweetwater </em>concerned a functioning golf course (of all things!) while <em>Emmington </em>concerned dry farming land.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">The closest case holding the evidence insufficient is <em>Regus </em>v. <em>City of Baldwin Park </em>(1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 968 [139 Cal.Rptr. 196]. In <em>Regus </em>the project area consisted of two separate noncontiguous sites more than a mile apart along the San Bernardino Freeway. One site was north of the freeway, and consisted of mixed residential and commercial properties. The residences were \u201c \u2018older stock fairly well maintained with isolated examples of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>deteriorating construction.\u2019 \u201d (70 Cal.App.3d at p. 973.) The land parcelization was irregular, and had resulted in \u201cpoorly used parcels of irregular shape and depth with minimal frontage.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Of twelve parcels surveyed at the site, only one was in excellent condition; three were older \u201cbut well maintained,\u201d three were fair, three were old and obsolete, and two were dilapidated. The area was undergoing transition. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">The other site was south of the freeway, and consisted of commercial and industrial development. Half of this site consisted of newly finished construction or construction in progress. Of nine buildings rated, three were older but well maintained, four were fair, and two were old and obsolete. (70 Cal.App.3d at p. 974.) The court held there was no substantial evidence the area was blighted. (70 Cal.App.3d at p. 980.)</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">If, as mentioned above, all we had before us was the exterior structural survey, the record would not support the blight finding. <em>Regus </em>demonstrates that substantial percentages of \u201cfair,\u201d \u201cold and obsolete,\u201d and even \u201cdilapidated\u201d buildings are not enough, <em>by themselves, </em>to support such a finding. But in <em>Regus </em>there was no severe overcrowding. Here there is, plus some increased crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Thus, while the percentage of deteriorated buildings on Bristol Street in Santa Ana may not be as high as in certain areas of downtown Los Angeles in the 1950\u2019s (cf. <em>In re Redevelopment Plan for Bunker Hill, supra, </em>61 Cal.2d at p. 45 [60 percent were dangerous]) or in downtown National City in the 1970\u2019s <em>(National City Business Assn. </em>v. <em>City of National City, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.3d at p. 1067 [60 percent beyond rehabilitation]),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the overcrowding plus the increased crime make up for it (cf. <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Community Redevelopment Agency, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d at pp. 255-256 [host of additional factors besides building deterioration, including homelessness and runaways dominating area, disproportionate crime, and overcrowded buildings]).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">B. <em>Overinclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">It is one thing to determine that a given area is, even if just barely, \u201cblighted\u201d within the meaning of the redevelopment law. It is another to say that the boundaries of that area must necessarily encompass nonblighted property in order to effectively redevelop the area. Section 33321 allows a project area to include parcels \u201cwhich are not detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare, but whose inclusion is found necessary for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>effective redevelopment of the area of which they are apart.\u201d The plaintiffs argue there is insufficient evidence that inclusion of nonblighted property is necessary to its effective redevelopment.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">As to any property on Bristol, or which is reasonably affected by the widening of Bristol, the argument must necessarily fail. Obviously, a redevelopment project focused on a street widening must include the properties on that street to be effective.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">However, as to nonblighted property substantially removed from Bristol Street itself (i.e, not affected by its physical widening), the city has not articulated <em>any </em>concrete reason why that property is \u201cnecessary for the effective redevelopment\u201d of the project area. The city merely cites certain all-purpose conclusory statements from the consultants\u2019 report which might apply to any property anywhere. With the exception of a brief reference to the \u201cproposed street widening,\u201d there is no attempt at any specificity; the reasons appear to have emerged from the consultants\u2019 word processor without any thought as to why any particular parcel of nonblighted property must be taken by the government to effectively redevelop nearby blighted property.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> While the inclusion of nonblighted property within a redevelopment project may be tested on an abuse of discretion standard (see <em>In re Redevelopment Plan for Bunker Hill, supra, </em>61 Cal.2d at p. 50, quoting <em>Berman </em>v. <em>Parker </em>(1954) 348 U.S. 26, 35 [99 L.Ed. 27, 39, 75 S.Ct. 98]), fidelity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>section 33321 requires that there be <em>some </em>specific connection between the inclusion of nonblighted property and the \u201ceffective redevelopment\u201d of an area. We would render the statute a dead letter if we allowed generic, \u201ccanned\u201d reasons having no necessary relationship to any given parcel of nonblighted property to serve that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">Accordingly, as to non-Bristol, nonblighted property, we must agree with plaintiffs\u2019 substantial evidence argument. The plan cannot be approved until the city shows with at least minimal specificity why nonblighted parcels not affected by the Bristol Street widening should be included in the project area.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">C. <em>Relocation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Redevelopment is more than an artful way for cities to raise money for public improvements or clear slums. It often involves, as in the present case, the expropriation of the homes and businesses of poor and moderate income people. This entails some real human costs. Senior citizens are uprooted from the homes they may have planned to live in for the rest of their lives;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> younger persons face the loss of homes for which they may have struggled dearly.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, practically speaking, relocation is the weak link in most redevelopment projects which involve residential areas. (See Molho &amp; Kanner, <em>Urban Renewal: Laissez-Faire for the Poor, Welfare for the Rich </em>(1977) 8 Pacific L.J. 627, 634 [\u201cOne of the most important\u2014but least funded\u2014aspects of the redevelopment process is the relocation of the people who are dispersed from the project area when their homes and businesses turn into rubble.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Accordingly, in a variety of statutes the Legislature has recognized the need to alleviate the human costs associated with redevelopment. For example, the report accompanying the redevelopment plan must contain a \u201cmethod or plan for the relocation\u201d of people who are displaced. This method <em>must </em>guarantee \u201cthat no persons or families of low and moderate income shall be displaced <em>unless </em>and <em>until </em>there is a suitable housing unit available . . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>(\u00a7 33352, subd. (d), italics added.) Homes (i.e., \u201cdwelling units\u201d) lost to redevelopment after September 1989 must be replaced with \u201can equal number of replacement dwelling units,\u201d of which three-quarters must be as affordable to the low and moderate income persons displaced by the redevelopment as their old homes. (\u00a7 33413, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">And, before a city may adopt an ordinance approving a redevelopment plan, it must find and determine a number of things, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-5\">\u2014the redevelopment agency \u201chas a feasible method or plan for the relocation\u201d of persons displaced in the project area (\u00a7 33367, subd. (d)(7)), and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-6\">\u2014\u201c[tjhere <em>are, </em>or <em>are being </em>provided, in the project area\u201d or comparable areas, equivalent dwellings. (\u00a7 33367, subd. (d)(8), italics added.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Moreover, the approving ordinance must contain a statement that the city council is \u201csatisfied that permanent housing facilities will be available within three years from the time occupants of the project area are displaced,\u201d and there <em>\u201cwill be available\u201d </em>adequate temporary housing in the meantime. (\u00a7 33367, subd. (e), italics added.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">It is these protections which plaintiffs claim were not afforded here. They contend the report and plan are full of promise of equivalent housing, but do nothing to identify that housing.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>By using the present tense <em>(are, </em>or <em>being </em>provided) in subdivision (d)(8) of section 33367, the Legislature has signaled that there must be some sort of <em>present </em>identification of equivalent housing. If a mere promise or optimistic finding that housing <em>will be </em>found were sufficient, subdivision (d)(8) would be redundant. It would add nothing not otherwise accomplished by subdivision (d)(7), which merely requires a feasible <em>method </em>for relocation, or subdivision (e), which is written in the future tense. The mere promise that replacement housing <em>will </em>be found when the need arises thus does not comport with the present tense language of subdivision (d)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">In the present case, nothing in the report or redevelopment plan identifies where equivalent housing is or \u201cis being\u201d built. Indeed, the \u201cNeighborhood Impact\u201d section of the consultant\u2019s report is quite frank in admitting that such housing is presently unknown: \u201cThe specific number and type of replacement housing units required pursuant to CRL Section 33413, if any, are not known at this time since the Agency has not determined specific acquisition sites.\u201d Indeed, after noting that up to 133 replacement housing units could be required over the life of the project, the report put the problem off for another day: \u201cThe City Council and the Agency <em>will </em>make findings necessary to provide such housing either inside or outside the Project Area. When the Agency acquires property, enters into a disposition and development agreement, participation agreement or other agreement, or undertakes any other activities requiring or causing the destruction or removal of housing units from the low and moderate income housing market, the Agency <em>will adopt </em>a replacement housing plan and <em>will provide </em>replacement housing required pursuant to Section 33413 of the CRL.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>These are fine promises, but we must uphold the law which requires evidence that such units are either in existence, or \u201care being\u201d brought into existence. The city makes no argument that there is any such evidence.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Rather, on appeal the city argues it is sufficient to provide a \u201cframework\u201d for complying with the law requiring relocation housing, because \u201c35 years of activity . . . cannot be set forth in minute detail.\u201d The city\u2019s only authority for this proposition, <em>County of Santa Cruz </em>v. <em>City of Watsonville </em>(1985) 177 Cal.App.3d 831 [223 Cal.Rptr. 272], does not support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">In <em>Watsonville, </em>a city established a 257-acre redevelopment area which included some land under county jurisdiction. The city needed the county\u2019s permission for redevelopment, and apparently some city employees told the county that the city\u2019s idea was simply to build a road on county land for fire protection purposes. Given the modest scope of what it perceived to be the city\u2019s plan, the county gave its approval. The actual plan, however, made only a single reference to the road extension, and indicated a number of general projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">After approval, the city spent over a million dollars on street construction-\u2014but not the fire access road\u2014and the county brought suit against the city, seeking to limit the scope of the city\u2019s redevelopment plan to just that road. The trial court held the plan was limited to just the fire access road as a matter of law, but the appellate court reversed because a redevelopment plan \u201ccannot always outline in detail each project that a redevelopment agency will undertake . . . .\u201d (177 Cal.App.3d at p. 841.)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\"><em>Watsonville </em>is inapposite here because there is a difference between the level of detail required of redevelopment plans generally and the particular findings of identifiable replacement housing explicitly required by subdivision (d)(8) of section 33367, as well as implicitly required by subdivisions (d)(7) and (e). A plan need not specify every <em>project, </em>but there must be something to identify replacement <em>housing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>Two cases have touched on the relocation requirements of section 33367, <em>Card </em>v. <em>Community Redevelopment Agency </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 570 [131 Cal.Rptr. 153], and <em>Sanguinetti </em>v. <em>City Council </em>(1965) 231 Cal.App.2d 813 [42 Cal.Rptr. 268]. Both are consistent with our analysis. <em>Card </em>involved a challenge to certain amendments to a redevelopment plan covering a hilly, upper-income section of South Pasadena. The amendments extended the boundaries of the plan to a flat, lower-income area adjacent to, but separate from, the hilly section. By amending an existing plan rather than adopting a new plan, the city council and redevelopment agency had omitted various requirements, including those of section 33367. The appellate court held that in failing to make the findings necessary under section 33367, subdivisions (d)(8) and (e), the city council and redevelopment agency had deprived the citizens of the lower-income area of the \u201cspecific assurances of adequate temporary and permanent replacement housing\u201d required by the statute, in effect depriving them of the legal protection they would have had if a new plan had been proposed. (See 61 Cal.App.3d at pp. 580-582.) The court also indicated the residents of the low income area would have had a right to \u201cspecifics on relocation\u201d had a new plan been proposed rather than an old plan amended. (See 61 Cal.App.3d at p. 580.)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">The use of the word \u201cspecifics\u201d suggests something more than a mere promise to find replacement housing when the time comes. The city does not mention <em>Card </em>in its brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\"><em>Sanguinetti </em>involved an urban renewal project for the skid row section of Stockton. While the court upheld the relocation plan against a general challenge of illegality,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the redevelopment agency had specifically identified a large number of dwellings to accommodate the displaced residents. These included 60 hotels (with an average of 777 unoccupied beds), 105 apartments renting for $45 a month or less, 90 apartment units in the $50 to $60 a month range, <em>and </em>two labor camps at the south edge of the city. (231 Cal.App.2d at pp. 819-823, fn. 2.)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, the court could declare that \u201cAttention [had] been <em>specifically paid </em>and provision made for obtaining sites, not only comparable to the dwellings being vacated but within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>financial reach of the displacees and at prices comparable to those they [had] been subject to.\u201d (231 Cal.App.2d at p. 823, italics added.)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">By contrast, here the most the city can point to is a 3.93 percent vacancy rate as of January 1,1987 (which translates into 2809 units), and a \u201cpotential increase of 305 units within the project area.\u201d Yet neither a gross vacancy rate nor the bare \u201cpotentiality\u201d of new units in a project area\u2014unlike the hotels and apartments actually identified in Sanguinetti\u2014can tell anyone anything about the general desirability and cost of <em>specific </em>units. Such information is the essence of the protection afforded by subdivision (d)(8) of section 33367.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">The judgment was correct in determining the project area to be \u201cblighted\u201d within the meaning of the redevelopment law.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> However, much of the balance of the judgment was incorrect insofar as it decreed that the redevelopment plan was \u201clawful and valid and without qualification.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As explained above, the redevelopment plan cannot be decreed to be \u201clawful\u201d insofar as it (a) includes nonblighted property which would not otherwise be affected by the widening of Bristol Street, and (b) does not identify the housing that is or is being provided for those whose homes are taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">For the benefit of the trial court, we must explain what this partial reversal entails. In terms of the judgment already entered, it means that the <em>substance </em>of paragraphs 4 (involving the noncontested issue of the appropriateness of tax dollars for the project), 5 (declaring that the finding of blight is supported by substantial evidence), and 6 (enjoining anyone from challenging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>the plan on any issue which was or could have been adjudicated in this litigation) are affirmed, and the balance of the judgment is reversed. On remand, we direct that a new judgment be entered which incorporates the substance of paragraphs 4, 5 and 6, but also declares: (a) the city and redevelopment agency have not yet shown why nonblighted property which will not be affected by the widening of Bristol Street must be included in the project area; (b) the city and redevelopment agency have not yet identified the dwellings that are or being provided for the displaced residents in accord with section 33367, subdivision (d)(8); and (c) until (a) and (b) are complied with, the plan is not lawful and the ordinance approving the plan is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">Such a judgment, however, need not necessarily end the redevelopment plan, particularly given the relatively narrow reasons for today\u2019s reversal. The city and redevelopment agency are not required to start again from \u201csquare one.\u201d They must, however, show why nonblighted non-Bristol property must be included in the project area and identify the replacement dwellings that are or are being provided the displaced residents before the plan can lawfully go forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">As to the former, the city will need to actually show why specific areas away from Bristol Street are \u201cnecessary\u201d to the redevelopment. Specific properties will need to be identified and some reason provided why these particular properties are necessary to effective redevelopment. As to the latter, we would point out that the key to the sufficiency of any future findings inheres within the statute itself: will the people who are going to lose their homes be able to ascertain whether the new housing which will be made available to them is genuinely not \u201cless desirable\u201d and at rents or prices within their means?</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">The plaintiffs will recover their costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">Moore, J\u201e and Wallin, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">Petitions for a rehearing were denied February 24, 1993, and respondents\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied April 22, 1993.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-9\">Unless otherwise indicated, all statutory references are to the Health and Safety Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b861-10\">Our statement of facts is taken primarily from the report to the city council on the proposed redevelopment plan for the Bristol corridor redevelopment project, prepared by the redevelopment consulting firm for the City of Santa Ana in December 1988.

Given these numbers, it is hard to see how the consultants came up with 11.49 crimes per 1,000 population. If there are 435 crimes (assuming \u201cincidents\u201d to be synonymous with \u201ccrimes\u201d) in an area of 5,000 population for a given period, then the crime rate is 87 per 1,000 population for that period. (This is more than <em>10 times </em>the ostensible city wide rate, and is therefore so disproportionate as to indicate an arithmetical error somewhere.)</p>\n<p id=\"b862-19\">On the other hand, if we assume the 7.22 citywide rate is calculated on a monthly basis the numbers begin to make sense. If we divide the 87 crimes per 1,000 population by the 11 months encompassed from January to November, the area\u2019s crime rate turns out to be 7.90. This figure is both in the same ballpark as 7.22 and is statistically more plausible: it would mean the project area\u2019s crime rate is about 9.4 percent higher than the rate given for the city as a whole. As there is no explanation in the consultants\u2019 report for the 11.49 figure, and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>cannot duplicate it ourselves given the meager information furnished in that report, we must conclude that the record does not support a higher crime rate for the project area than 7.90 per 1,000 population per month.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b863-10\">Challenges to the validity of a redevelopment plan are specifically allowed by section 863 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b863-12\">The trial court excluded from consideration certain proffered exhibits (primarily a draft environmental impact report on the widening of Bristol Street and certain letters of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel objecting to the plan) on the grounds they were not part of the public record before the city council. Plaintiffs attack this exclusion on appeal. We agree with the trial court. In the absence of some showing that city staff improperly excluded the documents from the public record, judicial review of whether there was substantial evidence to support the city\u2019s decision is limited to the record before the city. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5, subd. (e); see also <em>Fosselman\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Alhambra </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 806, 812 [224 Cal.Rptr. 361] [\u201csubstantial evidence review of administrative action is limited to the record made before the administrative agency\u201d].) Here, we do not find any evidence of improper exclusion on the city\u2019s part in not including the exhibits. This conclusion renders moot the city\u2019s argument that plaintiffs did not exhaust their administrative remedies as to the completeness and adequacy of the record. (See also fn. 17, <em>post.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">On the other hand, we agree with plaintiff\u2019s counsel that <em>if </em>the city did knowingly refuse to include the proffered exhibits and then turned around, as it has done on this appeal, and argued that plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies by not raising issues set out in the exhibits, they would be engaging in conduct of \u201cKafkaesque proportions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b864-9\">Footnote 5 explains why we do not assume the crime rate is as disproportionate to the citywide rate as the consultants\u2019 report might otherwise lead one to believe.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b865-7\">The exact language is: \u201cIt is found and declared that there exist in many communities blighted areas which constitute either physical, social, or economic liabilities, requiring redevelopment in the interest of the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of such communities and of the state.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b867-9\">Then again, it may be; the overbreadth of category C makes it impossible to say with certainty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b868-6\">The plaintiffs argue, with some cogency, that the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the redevelopment plan is not the elimination of blight but the widening of Bristol Street. As a factual matter, they are probably correct. The stated objectives of the plan appear to be more concerned with the benefits which will come with the transformation of Bristol Street rather than the elimination of blight for blight\u2019s sake. The problem is, the \u201culterior motive\u201d argument does not gain the plaintiffs anything. While the hope of commercial development cannot <em>by itself </em>justify the use of community redevelopment powers <em>(Regus </em>v. <em>City of Baldwin Park, supra, </em>70 Cal.App.3d at p. 979; but cf. \u00a7 33071 [\u201ca fundamental purpose of redevelopment is to . . . expand employment opportunities . . . and to provide an environment for the social, economic, and psychological growth and well-being of all citizens\u201d]), the elimination of blight can, and plaintiffs are unable to contend that the elimination of blight is not at least <em>one </em>of the city\u2019s objectives.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b868-7\">Here is the statement cited by the city, directly as it appears in the consultants\u2019 report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-8\">\u201cCertain properties within the Project Area are not deteriorated properties.

(See generally <em>Redevelopment Agency </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1487, 1493 [279 Cal.Rptr. 558].) This argument fails because the city acknowledges that plaintiff \u201cGonzales testified at the public hearing\u201d and \u201ccomplained\u201d about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>\u201cdisplacement of residents and businesses.\u201d Common sense dictates that the issue of \u201cdisplacement\u201d encompasses the issue of where the displaced persons will go. Raising the issue of \u201cdisplacement\u201d should therefore be enough to preserve the issue of the adequacy of a housing plan which was drawn up to address the very problem of displaced persons. (See <em>East Peninsula Ed.
