J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsL\">Petitioner Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (Cedars) seeks a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order denying Cedars\u2019s request for a protective order. The trial court\u2019s order permitted real parties in interest Hendel Schwartz, Eric Schwartz, and Daniel Schwartz, by and through his guardian, Hendel Schwartz, (collectively, the Schwartzes) to discover in the course of their medical malpractice action the identities of the medical staff review committee members who had evaluated the obstetrical privileges held by the defendant physicians at Cedars.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">The issue presented is whether Evidence Code section 1157 (section 1157) precludes such discovery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">We grant Cedars\u2019s petition for writ of mandate because we conclude section 1157 embodies the Legislature\u2019s finding the public good is best served where medical staff review committees evaluate staff physicians in confidence. Therefore, the identities of such evaluators may not be discovered even though this may limit the ability of an individual plaintiff to discover relevant and admissible information. Accordingly, the trial court should have granted Cedars\u2019s request for a protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">In a complaint filed December 15, 1989, alleging medical malpractice the Schwartzes sued Cedars and two obstetricians for injuries sustained by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Daniel at birth. In the course of trial preparation, the Schwartzes served upon Cedars interrogatories which sought to discover the identity of \u201ceach member of any organized committee of [Cedars\u2019s] medical staff who has reviewed any aspect of the obstetrical privileges held by\u201d the defendant physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">These interrogatories were intended to lead to discoverable information regarding the Schwartzes\u2019 cause of action against Cedars for damages pursuant to <em>Elam </em>v. <em>College Park Hospital </em>(1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 332, 346 [183 Cal.Rptr. 156]. <em>Elam </em>held a hospital may be liable for the negligent selection, review and retention of a doctor on its medical staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Cedars moved for a protective order relying on section 1157, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The Schwartzes resisted Cedars\u2019s assertion of the discovery privilege contending case law implied the privilege did not extend to the identities of the members of hospital review staff because such members may waive the privilege and voluntarily testify in a medical malpractice action. <em>(West Covina Hospital </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 846 [226 Cal.Rptr. 132, 718 P.2d 119, 60 A.L.R.4th 1257].) The Schwartzes also argued section 1157 protects proceedings and records of review committees, not the <em>identities </em>of evaluating medical staff committee members. They claimed such disclosure would impose no burden on the physicians so identified because they have an absolute right to refuse to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The trial court denied Cedars\u2019s motion. It ruled the privilege of section 1157 extends \u201c \u2018only to records of and proceedings before medical investigative committees.\u2019 <em>Schultz </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>66 [Cal.App.3d 440] at 446 [136 Cal.Rptr. 67], ... [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] There is nothing in the statute that [precludes] discovery of the names of committee members only the proceedings themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">This court summarily denied Cedars\u2019s petition for writ relief. Thereafter, the Supreme Court granted Cedars\u2019s petition for review and transferred the matter to this court with directions to vacate our previous order and to issue an alternative writ of mandate. We complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">The Schwartzes reiterate the contentions they raised before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Cedars and amici curiae, California Medical Association and California Association of Hospitals and Health Systems,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> contend the identities of medical staff review committee members who evaluated the obstetrical privileges held by the defendant doctors constitute proceedings and records of a hospital review committee and therefore are protected from discovery pursuant to section 1157, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">1. <em>The issue presented is one of first impression in California.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Cedars\u2019s writ petition calls upon this court to address yet another in a series of factual situations which delineate the scope of the discovery immunity afforded by section 1157. Since its enactment in 1968, numerous cases have considered the dimensions of section 1157. <em>(West Covina Hospital </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 846; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Memorial Medical Center) </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 363, 372-387 [286 Cal.Rptr. 478]; <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 1446, 1452-1454 [274 Cal.Rptr. 712]; <em>Hinson </em>v. <em>Clairemont Community Hospital </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 1110, 1126-1130 [267 Cal.Rptr. 503]; <em>California Eye Institute </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1477, 1480-1486 [264 Cal.Rptr. 83]; <em>Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 711 [220 Cal.Rptr. 236]; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 489, 496-502 [214 Cal.Rptr. 266]; <em>Mt.

Discovery privileges, on the other hand, prevent the admission of relevant evidence, may obstmct the attainment of justice, and should be construed narrowly. <em>(West Covina Hospital </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 851; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Memorial Medical Center), supra, </em>234 Cal.App.3d at p. 377.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">However, \u201c \u2018 \u201cour first task in constming a statute is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. In determining such intent, a court must look first to the words of the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>themselves, giving to the language its usual, ordinary import .... The words of the statute must be construed in context, keeping in mind the statutory purpose, and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized, both internally and with each other, to the extent possible. [Citations.] Where uncertainty exists consideration should be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation. [Citation.] Both the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment may be considered in ascertaining the legislative intent. . . .

Giving the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meaning, it can be argued the <em>identities </em>of the committee members have nothing to do with the proceedings or records of the committee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">Using the words in their ordinary sense, proceedings would constitute that which <em>transpired </em>at a committee meeting. Because the medical staff of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>hospital is concerned with the quality of in-hospital medical care, the proceedings of a review committee include evaluation of the qualifications of applicants and holders of staff privileges, consideration of recommendations for appointment, reappointment, curtailment and exclusion from staff privileges, and provision for peer group methods of reviewing basic medical, surgical and obstetrical functions. <em>(West Covina Hospital </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at pp. 852-853; <em>Matchett </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>40 Cal.App.3d at p. 628.)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Clearly, the evaluation of the obstetrical privileges held by defendant doctors falls within the proceedings of the medical staff review committee. However, the statute does not address the issue presented here. That is, section 1157 is silent as to whether the identities of the particular committee members who participate in the evaluation of a defendant doctor constitute a protected part of the proceedings and records.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Because the language of the statute is <em>not </em>clear on this point, we turn to \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment\u201d \u2019 \u201d in order to ascertain the intent of the Legislature. <em>(Central Pathology Service Medical Clinic, Inc </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 187.)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">4. <em>Legislative history and purpose of section 1157.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The Legislature enacted section 1157 in 1968 \u201cin response to a threatened harm to the public interest posed by\u201d the ruling in <em>Kenney </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 106 [63 Cal.Rptr. 84], which allowed a medical malpractice plaintiff to discover hospital staff records. (See, <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Memorial Medical Center), supra, </em>234 Cal.App.3d at p. 376, and cases cited there.)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\"><em>Matchett </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>40 Cal.App.3d 623, was the first case to interpret section 1157, and it has been followed extensively since. <em>Matchett </em>concluded the Legislature had enacted section 1157 because it recognized the activities of hospital review committees must be confidential in order to ensure a high quality of medical care. <em>Matchett </em>observed: \u201cWhen medical staff committees bear delegated responsibility for the competence of staff practitioners, the quality of in-hospital medical care depends heavily upon the committee members\u2019 frankness in evaluating their associates\u2019 medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>skills and their objectivity in regulating staff privileges. Although composed of volunteer professionals, these committees are affected with a strong element of public interest.\u201d (40 Cal.App.3d at p. 628.)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\u201cCalifornia law recognizes this public interest by endowing the practitioner-members of hospital staff committees with a measure of immunity from damage claims arising from committee activities. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 43.7; <em>Ascherman </em>v. <em>San Francisco Medical Society </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 623, [662-663] . . . ,)[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] Evidence Code section 1157 expresses a legislative judgment that the public interest in medical staff candor extends beyond damage immunity and requires a degree of confidentiality. . . . <em>Section 1157 was enacted upon the theory that external access to peer investigations conducted by staff committees stifles candor and inhibits objectivity. </em>[Fn. omitted.] It evinces a legislative judgment that the quality of in-hospital medical practice will be elevated by armoring staff inquiries with a measure of confidentiality.\u201d <em>(Matchett </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>40 Cal.App.3d at pp. 628-629, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\u201cThis confidentiality exacts a social cost because it impairs malpractice plaintiffs\u2019 access to evidence. In a damage suit for in-hospital malpractice against doctor or hospital [fn. omitted] or both, unavailability of recorded evidence of incompetence might seriously jeopardize or even prevent the plaintiff s recovery. <em>Section 1157 represents a legislative choice between competing public concerns. It embraces the goal of medical staff candor at the cost of impairing plaintiffs\u2019 access to evidence.\" (Matchett </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>40 Cal.App.3d at p. 629, italics added; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Memorial Medical </em>Center), <em>supra, </em>234 Cal.App.3d at p. 381.)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The thorough analysis and rationale of <em>Matchett </em>is compelling, convincing and, in our view, controlling. This is so although such a conclusion appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>to violate the rules of statutory construction which favor liberal interpretation of discovery restrictions and the strict construction of evidentiary privileges. However, the overriding consideration in construing any statute is the ascertainment of the legislative intent. That intent has been established by the <em>Matchett </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">5. <em>The tension between the competing interests thus has been resolved.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\"><em>Matchett </em>found the privilege conferred by section 1157 constitutes a balance struck by the Legislature between the rights of plaintiffs to discover relevant information on the one hand, and the right of the public to quality health care on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">\u201cThe Legislature presumably balanced this potential burden [to individual plaintiffs] against the public interest in promoting candor and frankness at peer review committee meetings and concluded the latter outweighed the former. <em>(Matchett, supra, </em>40 Cal.App.3d at p. 629.) \u2018[T]here is no justification for courts to strike a different balance.\u2019 <em>(West Covina, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 855, fn. omitted.) It is not our function as a judicial body to reweigh the competing interests considered by the Legislature based on our perception of which consideration may or may not be more important.\u201d <em>(California Eye Institute </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1485-1486.)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Nor has the Legislature shown any interest in abrogating Matchett\u2019s interpretation of its intent in enacting section 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Accordingly, whether we consider the identity of evaluating physicians to be protected as an inherent part of the proceedings and records of the review committee, or merely follow the <em>Matchett </em>rationale of extending protection to the evaluative process, the result is the same. Section 1157 prevents the Schwartzes from discovering the identity of the physicians who participated in the evaluation of the obstetric privileges held by the defendant doctors. It would be an incongruous result if the statute protected the work product of the review committee but exposed the identity of the evaluating committee members whose candor the statute seeks to promote.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Because our Supreme Court also has not seen fit to contradict or compromise <em>Matchett </em>during the 18 years it has been on the books as the leading case on the proper interpretation of section 1157, and in fact has cited it with approval (see, <em>West Covina Hospital </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at pp. 852-854), we follow its rationale and conclude the identities of evaluating committee members too are privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">6. <em>West Covina does not compel a contrary result.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">The Schwartzes argue entitlement to discovery of the identities of review committee members who evaluated the staff privileges held by defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>doctors based on <em>West Covina. </em>There, in a four-to-three opinion, the majority held <em>voluntary </em>testimony of committee members is <em>permissible </em>under section 1157, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">The majority so concluded because the section provides only that no person in attendance at a hospital review committee meeting \u201cshall be required to testify as to what transpired at that meeting.\u201d (See, fn. 1, <em>ante.) </em>The high court found the prohibition of voluntary testimony \u201cis not essential to the promotion of the legislative purposes.\u201d <em>(West Covina Hospital </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 854.) The scope of this exception apparently includes any and all matters discussed at such meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The Schwartzes argue <em>West Covina, </em>at least <em>by implication, </em>recognizes the right to discover the identities of committee members.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Although the dissent in <em>West Covina </em>recognized voluntary testimony of a committee member has the potential to frustrate the privilege otherwise provided by section 1157, <em>(West Covina Hospital </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 858), the majority held the <em>exclusion of compelled testimony </em>is sufficient to serve the purpose of the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">We observe that while denial of discovery makes more difficult the task of locating a committee member who participated in the evaluation of a defendant doctor and is willing to testify, it does not prevent it. Accordingly, we reject the Schwartzes\u2019 claim <em>West Covina </em>implies a right of discovery here and find this case controlled by the Legislature\u2019s determination that the public good requires confidentiality in medical staff evaluation proceedings. This public benefit outweighs the Schwartzes\u2019s right to discover the identities sought here.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\"><em>Matchett </em>held the Legislature intended section 1157 to provide the proceedings and records of hospital review committees with discovery immunity. In line with <em>Matchetf </em>s rationale, the immunity so provided protects the identity of evaluating committee members from discovery by a medical malpractice plaintiff. The Legislature\u2019s intent that the work of such committees be marked by confidentiality, frankness and candor would be frustrated in large measure if the physicians who performed these necessary tasks were subjected to inquiry from plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers regarding the evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">However, as have other courts before us (see, e.g., <em>West Covina Hospital </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 860 (dis. opn. of Panelli, J.); <em>People </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>v. <em>Superior Court (Memorial Medical Center), supra, </em>234 Cal.App.3d at p. 390 (cone. opn. of Woods (Fred), J.)), we invite the Legislature to resolve any confusion caused by this holding with a simple clarifying amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The alternative writ heretofore issued is discharged.
