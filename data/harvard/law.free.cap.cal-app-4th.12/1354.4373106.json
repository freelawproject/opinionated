J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWC\">This case involves plaintiff Tri-Continent International Corporation\u2019s (Tri-Continent) attempt to buy unimproved land from defendant Paris Savings and Loan Association (Paris), later declared insolvent. Tri-Continent appeals the summary judgment in favor of defendants American Federal Bank, F.S.B. (American Federal) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver for Paris. Central to Tri-Continent\u2019s appellate arguments is its challenge to the power of the FDIC, as receiver for Paris, to repudiate the real estate contract at issue. As will be seen from our opinion we conclude it is unnecessary to decide this contention. Although various independent grounds exist for affirming the summary judgment, we have selectively determined Tri-Continent voluntarily withdrew its claim for specific performance, thereby rendering moot the propriety of the repudiation of the contract. As to Tri-Continent\u2019s claim for damages, we further determine Tri-Continent is precluded from obtaining any monetary recovery against either the FDIC or American Federal based on a conclusive finding the claims of Paris\u2019s general creditors are worthless.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">In January 1988, Tri-Continent entered into an agreement with Paris to purchase undeveloped real property in Rancho Santa Fe for $1,350,000. Under the terms of the agreement, Tri-Continent was to deposit $50,000 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>the total purchase price in the form of a certified check into escrow by March 4, 1988. When Tri-Continent failed to deposit these funds into escrow, Paris requested that Tri-Continent execute an addendum to the escrow instructions. Tri-Continent refused to accept the changes and Paris terminated the agreement by letter dated March 24, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">In May 1988, Tri-Continent sued Paris for specific performance, declaratory relief, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and damages. In August 1988, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (Bank Board) determined that Paris was insolvent and placed it into receivership with the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) as receiver. The FSLIC as receiver was substituted into Tri-Continent\u2019s lawsuit in place of Paris.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">Based on the administrative record before it, the Bank Board determined the liquidation of Paris\u2019s assets would be insufficient to satisfy the prior claims of secured creditors and depositors and therefore the claims of general creditors were worthless.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In a liquidation of Paris\u2019s assets in August 1988, the FSLIC entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with American Federal. Under this agreement, American Federal assumed Paris\u2019s liabilities to depositors and secured creditors to the extent of their security.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In exchange, American Federal acquired substantially all of Paris\u2019s assets, including the property at issue in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The agreement also provided that American Federal was entitled to any assets acquired by the receiver after the date of the agreement. In October 1988, Tri-Continent amended its complaint to include American Federal as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">In May 1989, the FSLIC as receiver for Paris notified Tri-Continent of its determination that performance of the contract, if it was still in force and effect, would be burdensome and therefore, under its statutory authority, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>was repudiating the contract. (See 12 U.S.C. former \u00a7 1729; 12 C.F.R. former \u00a7 569a.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">American Federal moved for summary judgment on three separate grounds: (1) the FSLIC had disaffirmed the contract; (2) Tri-Continent had failed to perform all conditions and covenants required of it under the contract; and (3) American Federal did not assume any liabilities associated with the property at issue under the purchase and assumption agreement. In its motion for summary judgment, the FDIC argued: (1) even as a general creditor, Tri-Continent could recover in damages only the amount it would have received in a liquidation of Paris, and due to the lack of assets in the receivership, Tri-Continent would receive nothing; and (2) Tri-Continent was not entitled to specific performance because the contract was unenforceable following the FDIC\u2019s repudiation and in any event, the FDIC no longer had any interest in the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\"><em>At oral argument on the summary judgment motions, counsel for TriContinent advised the court it was no longer asserting a claim for specific performance of the contract. </em>The court granted both the FDIC\u2019s and American Federal\u2019s motions for summary judgment and ordered the lis pendens expunged.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In its written order, approved as to content and form by TriContinent, the court dismissed Tri-Continent\u2019s claim for specific performance against the FDIC based on the fact Tri-Continent\u2019s counsel had withdrawn that claim. The court entered judgment in favor of the FDIC and American Federal as to all causes of action and dismissed Tri-Continent\u2019s action with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">Tri-Continent\u2019s principal arguments are twofold: (1) the FDIC as receiver improperly \u201cadjudicated\u201d Tri-Continent\u2019s suit against Paris when it attempted to repudiate the contract for sale of the property; and (2) the provisions of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) do not apply retroactively to allow the FDIC as receiver to repudiate the contract between Tri-Continent and Paris. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number> Both arguments attack the propriety of the FDIC\u2019s repudiation power and thus are relevant only to Tri-Continent\u2019s claim for specific performance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Resolution of the issues raised by Tri-Continent becomes unnecessary when viewed in light of the procedural posture of this case. At the hearing on the motions for summary judgment, counsel for Tri-Continent acknowledged that because the FDIC no longer had an interest in the property at issue, Tri-Continent was not seeking specific performance of the contract, but only damages. The withdrawal of the specific performance claim against the FDIC is incorporated in the court\u2019s order dismissing that claim with prejudice. Having voluntarily eliminated its claim for specific performance, Tri-Continent cannot now argue its entitlement to specific performance based on the impropriety of the FDIC\u2019s repudiation.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">American Federal was not a party to the contract between Tri-Continent and Paris, nor was it a successor entity. American Federal was simply a third party purchaser of the property. Tri-Continent cannot assert a claim for breach of contract against one who is not a party to the contract. Because American Federal was not a party to the contract and cannot be compelled to perform under its terms, Tri-Continent\u2019s voluntary dismissal of its specific performance claim against the FDIC effectively terminated its claim for specific performance against American Federal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, summary judgment in favor of the FDIC and American Federal as to Tri-Continent\u2019s specific performance claim was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">Once Tri-Continent withdrew its claim for specific performance, its only remaining claim against the FDIC was for damages. The maximum liability of the FDIC is the amount the claimant would have received if the FDIC had liquidated the assets and liabilities of the failed institution. (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(i).)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">Here, the Bank Board conclusively determined the claims of Paris\u2019s general creditors were \u201cworthless.\u201d If Paris\u2019s assets were liquidated and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>proceeds distributed to creditors in the order required, the assets would be exhausted long before the liabilities to secured creditors and depositors were satisfied. Even if Tri-Continent obtained a money judgment in its breach of contract action and thus became a general unsecured creditor of Paris, it would be entitled to receive nothing on its claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (See <em>AmWest Sav. Ass\u2019n. </em>v. <em>Farmers Market of Odessa </em>(W.D.Tex. 1990) 753 F.Supp. 1339, 1346 [where lack of receivership assets to pay unsecured creditors will never change, court may not award damages in any amount]; see also <em>First Indiana Federal Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>F.D.I.C. </em>(5th Cir. 1992) 964 F.2d 503, 507.)</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">The Bank Board\u2019s findings and conclusions constituted final agency action subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act. (See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 702-706; <em>AmWest Sav. Ass\u2019n. </em>v. <em>Farmers Market of Odessa, Inc., supra, </em>753 F.Supp. at p. 1346; <em>Village South Joint Venture </em>v. <em>FDIC </em>(N.D.Tex. 1990) 733 F.Supp. 50, 51-52.) Tri-Continent has never challenged the Bank Board\u2019s findings and conclusions and may not do so now. <em>(Triland Inv. Group </em>v. <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., supra, </em>735 F.Supp. at p. 700; <em>AmWest Sav. Ass\u2019n. </em>v. <em>Farmers Market of Odessa, supra, </em>753 F.Supp. at p. 1346.) Because we are bound by the Bank Board\u2019s \u201cworthlessness\u201d determination, Tri-Continent is precluded from obtaining any monetary recovery from the FDIC in this action.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court properly granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Benke, J., and Nares, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b879-9\">According to a monthly report of financial condition dated August 12, 1988, filed by Paris under FSLIC regulations, Paris\u2019s liabilities to its depositors and secured creditors exceeded its assets by more than $146 million.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b879-10\">In distributing the assets of the receivership, the FSLIC was required to pay in full the valid claims of all creditors in a particular priority class before any claims of creditors in the next lower priority class could be paid. (See 12 C.F.R. former \u00a7 569c.ll(d).) Thus, under federal priority regulations and the Texas \u201cdepositor preference\u201d statute, if assets of the failed institution were insufficient to allow the receiver to pay depositors and secured creditors in full, general unsecured creditors were not entitled to anything.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b879-11\">At the time the property was transferred by the FSLIC to American Federal, it was subject to a lis pendens recorded by Tri-Continent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b880-9\">On August 9, 1989, Congress enacted the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) (Pub.L. No. 101-73, 103 Stat. 183.) FIRREA abolished the FSLIC and transferred the receivership functions performed by the FSLIC for receiver-ships established before January 1, 1989, to the FSLIC Resolution Fund, which is managed exclusively by the FDIC. As manager of the FSLIC Resolution Fund, the FDIC was substituted in place of the FSLIC as receiver for Paris in this litigation by operation of law. (See 12 U.S.C. former \u00a7 1437.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b880-10\">Tri-Continent petitioned this court for a writ of mandate and writ of supersedeas which were denied on March 12, 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b881-11\">If a receiver repudiates a contract of the debtor, specific performance is not available as a remedy for breach of contract.

Nevertheless, the plaintiff retains the remedy of damages.
