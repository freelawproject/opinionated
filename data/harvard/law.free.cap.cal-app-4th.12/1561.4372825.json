Johnson for the purpose of hiring him to process a claim for attorney malpractice. He sought reimbursement on the basis that Mr. Johnson had neither pursued the claim nor refunded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1564\">*1564</page-number>the money. The Client Security Fund Commission instituted its investigation and subsequently issued a tentative decision proposing reimbursement to Mr. Howard of the sum of $901 as the unearned balance on the $1,000 payment made to Mr. Johnson. Mr. Johnson filed his objections to the tentative decision. Thus, on June 6, 1991, the Client Security Fund Commission conducted its hearing at which both Mr. Howard and Mr. Johnson testified. On June 6, 1991, the commission issued its final decision, making findings of fact and concluding that the failure of Mr. Johnson to return $901 to Mr. Howard after payment of only one expense of $99 constituted dishonest conduct within the meaning of rule 6(a) of the Client Security Fund Rules of Procedure of the State Bar.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The commission directed the reimbursement of $901 to Mr. Howard.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">Mr. Johnson petitioned for a writ of mandate in the superior court, which petition was denied after a hearing. The court issued its statement of decision, which provided that: the proper standard of review of the commission\u2019s decision was the substantial evidence test and not the independent judgment test; the decision of the commission was proper and is proper under either standard; Mr. Johnson had disbursed only the sum of $99 as the filing fee in a malpractice case; and Mr. Johnson was not entitled to retain the balance for any services he allegedly had rendered in a workers\u2019 compensation case for the reason that he had no prior approval from a workers\u2019 compensation judge for such a fee. The court rendered its judgment denying the petition for a writ of mandamus, and that judgment was entered January 10, 1992. Mr. Johnson\u2019s appeal is from the denial of that petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">Charles Johnson is a former attorney who resigned voluntarily from the State Bar on March 20, 1990, with disciplinary charges pending. In September 1985, Mr. Howard hired Mr. Johnson to represent him in a claim for malpractice against his former attorneys, who, he felt, had negligently failed to assert the issue of discrimination in his workers\u2019 compensation case. One thousand dollars was paid by Mr. Howard to Mr. Johnson, but no written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1565\">*1565</page-number>retainer agreement was signed. On August 20, 1986, Mr. Johnson filed a complaint for legal malpractice in the Los Angeles Superior Court. He filed no further documents and made no appearances, as a result of which the action was dismissed by the court sua sponte on January 4, 1989, for lack of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">Mr. Johnson\u2019s position is that he earned the $1,000 payment as a fee for consultation. He claims that he did not proceed with Mr. Howard\u2019s malpractice action inasmuch as he concluded that it was meritless. Nonetheless, he claims, he continued over a three-year span of time to advise Mr. Howard with regard to his workers\u2019 compensation case.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">Mr. Johnson first argues that rule 6(a) of the Rules of Procedure of the State Bar is unconstitutional because it deprives him of due process in that the phrase \u201cin the nature of theft,\u201d used to describe wrongful acts that constitute dishonest conduct, is ambiguous and open to subjective and arbitrary interpretation. We find this contention unpersuasive for the reason that the rule also describes as dishonest conduct \u201cthe wrongful taking or conversion of money.\u201d We need not, in this case, concern ourselves with the problem of ambiguity resulting in deprivation of due process, because Mr. Johnson\u2019s acts clearly fall within the concept of \u201cthe wrongful taking\u201d of Mr. Howard\u2019s money. It is undisputed that the $1,000 payment from Mr. Howard to Mr. Johnson was for his services regarding an alleged malpractice by Mr. Howard\u2019s previous attorneys. It is uncontroverted that only $99 was utilized in that cause. No work was done in the case because, as Mr. Johnson said: \u201cIt would have been stupid to proceed with it. I couldn\u2019t prove . . . the underlying case . . . .\u201d Mr. Johnson\u2019s explanation that he earned the fee by advising Mr. Howard on his workers\u2019 compensation case, which he did not in any way process, is not a valid basis, even if true, upon which to charge such a fee. California Labor Code section 4906, subdivisions (b) and (c),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which were in effect, prohibit an attorney\u2019s request or acceptance of a fee without prior approval of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board. (See also <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 353, 355, fn. 1 [178 Cal.Rptr. 815, 636 P.2d 1153].) Moreover, Mr. Johnson\u2019s substantial interference with Mr. Howard\u2019s right to possession of the sum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1566\">*1566</page-number>advanced, being a specific, identifiable sum, may be said to be a conversion within the meaning of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">Mr. Johnson\u2019s further argument that conversion and the wrongful taking of money require specific intent which was not alleged or proved at the hearing may be disposed of with the brief comment that no wrongful intent of any degree is required for a conversion to occur. Mr. Howard was found to have suffered a reimbursable loss caused by the dishonest act of Mr. Johnson.  Dishonest conduct within the meaning of the predecessor Rules of Procedure of the State Bar includes conduct \u201c \u2018in the manner of defalcation ... of money\u2019 \u201d <em>(Saleeby </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 547, 556-557 [216 Cal.Rptr. 367, 702 P.2d 525]), which is misuse of funds entrusted to one\u2019s care. Clearly, failure to utilize a client\u2019s funds for the purpose for which they were tendered and failure to return the funds constitute misuse of those funds. Mr. Johnson\u2019s acts were dishonest in the sense that he committed two acts of professional misconduct in his handling of Mr. Howard\u2019s payment of $1,000. He accepted an unauthorized fee and he applied funds given for one purpose to a different purpose without the knowledge, direction or consent of Mr. Howard.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Mr. Johnson\u2019s contention, without elaboration, that the statute (establishing the Client Security Fund) was not intended to cover retainer fee disputes between an attorney and his client is specious and is rejected inasmuch as no facts from which one could conclude that there was a fee dispute were presented to the reviewing board by Mr. Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">Finally, Mr. Johnson asserts that the superior court, in its evaluation of the administrative record, had the duty to employ the independent judgment test because \u201ca vested right is taken from the lawyer seeks [szc] reinstatement.\u201d He relies upon <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 301 [196 P.2d 20], a case in which a physician sought mandamus in order to have set aside an order of suspension from the practice of medicine. The issues in that case have no relevance to this one. The only analogy is that, at the time of the Client Security Fund hearing, Mr. Johnson was no longer a member of the bar, having resigned. That hearing, however, was not for the purpose of determining any issue relating to his possible future reinstatement to the bar. It was, instead, for the sole purpose of determining whether Mr. Johnson\u2019s conduct was such that reimbursement of money was appropriate within the fund\u2019s rules. Mr. Johnson has no property right in the fund, the fund is a discretionary fund, and the Client Security Fund has no jurisdiction with respect to his possible reinstatement to the bar, that power being vested solely in the California Supreme Court. Therefore, Mr. Johnson has no vested right or fundamental vested interest which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1567\">*1567</page-number>affected by any Client Security Fund Commission decision of reimbursement. When an administrative decision does not substantially or tangentially involve any important or fundamental right, an independent judgment review of the record in a limited trial de novo is not appropriate. <em>(Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 143, 147 [93 Cal.Rptr. 234, 481 P.2d 242].) Accordingly, we concur with the judgment of the superior court that, under either method of analysis, the decision which was rendered was entirely proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Our review of the record discloses ample evidence to support the decision of the Client Security Fund Commission and the judgment rendered by the trial court. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">Spencer, P.
