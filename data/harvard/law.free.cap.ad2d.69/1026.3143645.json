[Rep.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AYT\">Motion by defendant Schmierer for summary reversal of an order of the Supreme Court, Kings County, dated October 4, 1977, on the ground that in the case of <em>De Felice v English </em>(63 AD2d 976) this court disapproved of the holding by Special Term resulting in the order now on appeal. In <em>De Felice, supra, </em>this court stated: \"We disapprove the holding in <em>Pigno v Bunim </em>(NYLJ, Sept. 8, 1977, p 12, col 2) insofar as it is contrary to the reasoning of Special Term herein.\u201d In the <em>De Felice </em>case, the third-party defendant St. John\u2019s Episcopal Hospital moved for summary judgment dismissing the third-party complaint of a Dr. Howard A, English upon the ground that another action by the plaintiff De Felice against the hospital itself had resulted in a defendant\u2019s verdict and that this determination should collaterally estop English from seeking indemnity or contribution from it for the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. Special Term held that since English was not a party to the suit between the main plaintiff and the third-party defendant hospital, he was not bound by the result therein. In the instant case Special Term granted a motion to dismiss a cross claim asserted by a third-party defendant, the estate of a Dr. Samuel Pennell (Pennell), against the third-party defendants Bunim and Maimonides Hospital. The dismissal of Pennell\u2019s cross claim was premised upon the fact that in a prior trial and appeals in this case it had been determined that the defendant hospital and the defendant Bunim were not liable to the plaintiff Pigno <em>(Pigno v Bunim, </em>43 AD2d 718, affd 35 NY2d 841). Since Bunim and the hospital had been found not liable to the main plaintiff, Special Term held, <em>inter alia, </em>that Pennell\u2019s cross claim for indemnity against those parties could not stand. This was despite the fact that Pennell was not a party to this action at the time of the earlier trial and appeals. In <em>De Felice, supra, </em>we disapproved the decision in this case only insofar as it held that Pennell was bound by the result of a prior trial held before he was made a party to the action (see <em>Schwartz v Public Administrator of County of Bronx, </em>24 NY2d 65). This motion for summary reversal must be denied because the movant, Schmierer, was a party at the time of the prior trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>and, therefore, our holding in <em>De Felice </em>does not apply to him.
