Motion denied, without costs, on the ground that the board decision has determined all of the substantive issues in the case and is therefore final for the purposes of appeal. Contrary to respondent\u2019s assertions, the pendency of such an appeal should not delay the making of an award or the payment thereof (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, \u00a723). Mahoney, P. J\u201e Greenblott, Main, Mikoll and Herlihy, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
