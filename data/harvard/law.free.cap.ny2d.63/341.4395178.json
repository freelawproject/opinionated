II. The trial court erred in allowing witnesses to take the ultimate question of guilt from the jury, denying defendant-appellant due process of law. <em>(Doughtery v Milliken, </em>163 NY 527; De <em>Long v County of Erie, </em>60 NY2d 296; <em>Kulak v Nationwide Mut.

III. The trial court erred in failing to suppress the alleged confession and admissions of defendant-appellant as being involuntarily obtained. <em>(Clewis v Texas, </em>386 US 707; <em>Rogers v Richmond, </em>365 US 534; <em>Blackburn v Alabama, </em>361 US 199; <em>People v Durante, </em>48 AD2d 962; <em>People v Tarsia, </em>50 NY2d 1; <em>People v Bevilacqua, </em>45 NY2d 508; <em>People v Coker, </em>103 Misc 2d 703; <em>People v Sunset Bay, </em>76 AD2d 592.)

II. The admission into evidence of the expert testimony of the medical examiner concerning suicide and evidence concerning firearms discharge residue was proper; moreover, a detective\u2019s statement concerning his experience as a homicide detective was, in context <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>and under nonobjected to cautionary instructions, proper. <em>(People v Pavao, </em>59 NY2d 282; <em>People v Whalen, </em>59 NY2d 273; <em>Matter of Gonzalez v State Liq.

V. The trial court\u2019s denial of youthful offender treatment in its discretion is not reviewable in this court and was, i\u00f1 any event, wholly proper. <em>(People v Drayton, </em>47 AD2d 952, 39 NY2d 580; <em>People v Bruce, </em>57 AD2d 1024; <em>People v Santiago, </em>51 AD2d 1, revd on other grounds <em>sub nom.

The evidence was insufficient to prove that appellant caused the death of Orlando Miranda, and thus his manslaughter conviction violated his right to due process. <em>(Jackson v Virginia, </em>443 US 307; <em>Matter of Eichner [Fox], </em>73 AD2d 431, mod <em>sub nom.

II. The court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on the definition of death, a material legal principle of the case, violated CPL 300.10 and deprived appellant of due process of law. <em>(Kal</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number><em>isch-Jarcho, Inc. v City of New York, </em>58 NY2d 377; <em>Williams v United States, </em>131 F2d 21.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b397-5\"><em>Elizabeth Holtzman, District Attorney (.Rebecca J. Clement </em>and <em>Barbara D. Underwood </em>of counsel), for respondent in the second above-entitled case.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AF7\">I. The People proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant caused Miranda\u2019s death, and that the nephrectomy was not the sole cause of death. <em>(People v Stewart, </em>40 NY2d 692; <em>People v Kibbe, </em>35 NY2d 407; <em>People v Brengard, </em>265 NY 100; <em>Cox v People, </em>80 NY 500.) II. Defendant has not preserved his claim that the court should have charged a cardiorespiratory definition of death. In any event, the charge concerning death was correct. Moreover, if there was error, it was harmless. <em>(People v De Renzzio, </em>19 NY2d 45; <em>People v Patterson, </em>39 NY2d 288, affd <em>sub nom.

Brain death has been recognized and accepted by lower courts in New York. <em>(Matter of New York City Health &amp; Hosps.

The decision of the court below contains language which is unsupported by the record in this case, is inconsistent with precedent cases in the State of New York and its sister States, and which has an undesirable effect on citizens of this State in need of certain usual, customary and accepted medical treatment. <em>(Matter of Eichner </em>[Fox], 73 AD2d 431.) IV. This court should act to recognize and accept brain death as a standard for determination of death. <em>(Matter of New York City Health &amp; Hosps.

Therefore, a defendant will not necessarily be relieved of criminal liability for homicide by the removal of the victim\u2019s vital organs after the victim has been declared dead according to brain-based criteria, notwithstanding that, at that time, the victim\u2019s heartbeat and breathing were being continued by artificial means.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\n<em>People v Eulo</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">On the evening of July 19, 1981, defendant and his girlfriend attended a volunteer firemen\u2019s fair in Kings Park, Suffolk County. Not long after they arrived, the two began to argue, reportedly because defendant was jealous over one of her former suitors, whom they had seen at the fair. The argument continued through the evening; it became particularly heated as the two sat in defendant\u2019s pick-up truck, parked in front of the home of the girlfriend\u2019s parents. Around midnight, defendant shot her in the head with his unregistered handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">The victim was rushed by ambulance to the emergency room of St. John\u2019s Hospital. A gunshot wound to the left temple causing extreme hemorrhaging was apparent. A tube was placed in her windpipe to enable artificial respiration and intravenous medication was applied to stabilize her blood pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">Shortly before 2:00 a.m., the victim was examined by a neurosurgeon, who undertook various tests to evaluate damage done to the brain. Painful stimuli were applied and yielded no reaction. Various reflexes were tested and, again, there was no response. A further test determined that the victim was incapable of spontaneously maintaining respiration. An electroencephalogram (EEC) resulted in \u201cflat,\u201d or \u201cisoelectric\u201d, readings indicating no activity in the part of the brain tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">Over the next two days, the victim\u2019s breathing was maintained solely by a mechanical respirator. Her heartbeat was sustained and regulated through medication. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Faced with what was believed to be an imminent cessation of these two bodily functions notwithstanding the artificial maintenance, the victim\u2019s parents consented to the use of certain of her organs for transplantation.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">On the afternoon of July 23, a second neurosurgeon was called in to evaluate whether the victim\u2019s brain continued to function in any manner. A repetition of all of the previously conducted tests led to the same diagnosis: the victim\u2019s entire brain had irreversibly ceased to function. This diagnosis was reviewed and confirmed by the Deputy Medical Examiner for Suffolk County and another physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The victim was pronounced dead at 2:20 p.m. on July 23, although at that time she was still attached to a respirator and her heart was still beating. Her body was taken to a surgical room where her kidneys, spleen, and lymph nodes were removed. The mechanical respirator was then disconnected, and her breathing immediately stopped, followed shortly by a cessation of the heartbeat.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Defendant was indicted for second degree murder. After a jury trial, he was convicted of manslaughter. The Appellate Division unanimously affirmed the conviction, without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">\n<em>People v Bonilla</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">At approximately 10:30 p.m. on February 6,1979, a New York City police officer found a man lying faceup in a Brooklyn street with a bullet wound to the head. The officer transported the victim in his patrol car to the Brookdale Hospital, where he was placed in an intensive care unit. Shortly after arriving at the hospital, the victim became comatose and was unable to breathe spontaneously. He was placed on a respirator and medication was administered to maintain his blood pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">The next morning, the victim was examined by a neurologist. Due to the nature of the wound, routine tests were applied to determine the level, if any, of the victim\u2019s brain functions. The doctor found no reflex reactions and no response to painful stimuli. The mechanical respirator was disconnected to test for spontaneous breathing. There was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>none, and the respirator was reapplied. An EEG indicated an absence of activity in the part of the brain tested. In the physician\u2019s opinion, the bullet wound had caused the victim\u2019s entire brain to cease functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The following day, the tests were repeated and the same diagnosis was reached. The victim\u2019s mother had been informed of her son\u2019s condition and had consented to a transfer of his kidneys and spleen. Death was pronounced following the second battery of tests and, commencing at 9:25 p.m., the victim\u2019s kidneys and spleen were removed for transplantation. The respirator was then disconnected, and the victim\u2019s breathing and heartbeat stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">An investigation led to defendant\u2019s arrest. While in police custody, defendant admitted to the shooting. He was indicted for second degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon. A jury convicted him of the weapons count and of first degree manslaughter. The conviction was affirmed by a divided Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Defendants\u2019 principal point in each of these appeals is that the respective Trial Judges failed to adequately instruct the juries as to what constitutes a person\u2019s death, the time at which criminal liability for a homicide would attach. It is claimed that in New York, the time of death has always been set by reference to the functioning of the heart and the lungs; that death does not occur until there has been an irreversible cessation of breathing and heartbeat.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">There having been extensive testimony at both trials concerning each victim\u2019s diagnosis as \u201cbrain dead,\u201d defendants argue that, in the absence of clear instruction, the juries may have erroneously concluded that defendants would be guilty of homicide if their conduct was the legal cause of the victims\u2019 \u201cbrain death\u201d rather than the victims\u2019 ultimate state of cardiorespiratory failure. In evaluating defendants\u2019 contentions, it is first necessary to review: how death has traditionally been determined by the law; how the principle of \u201cbrain death\u201d is now sought to be infused into our jurisprudence; and, whether, if at all, this court may recognize a principle of \u201cbrain death\u201d without infringing upon a legislative power or prerogative.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">A person\u2019s passing from life has long been an event marked with a variety of legal consequences. A determination of death starts in motion the legal machinery governing the disposition of the deceased\u2019s property (see, generally, EPTL arts 3,4, 5 and 6). It serves to terminate certain legal relationships, including marriage (see NY Jur, Domestic Relations, \u00a7 1), and business partnerships (see Partnership Law, \u00a7 62, subd 4). The period for initiation of legal actions brought against, by, or on behalf of the deceased is extended (see CPLR 210). And, in recent times, death marks the point at which certain of the deceased\u2019s organs, intended to be donated upon death, may be transferred (see Public Health Law, \u00a7 4301, subd 1). In the immediate context, pertinent here, determination of a person\u2019s \u201cdeath\u201d is relevant because our Penal Law defines homicide in terms of \u201cconduct which causes the <em>death </em>of a person\u201d (Penal Law, \u00a7 125.00 [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Death has been conceptualized by the law as, simply, the absence of life: \u201cDeath is the opposite of life; it is the termination of life\u201d <em>(Evans v People, </em>49 NY 86, 90). But, while erecting death as a critical milepost in a person\u2019s legal life, the law has had little occasion to consider the precise point at which a person ceases to live.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">When the question arises as to when death occurs, it has been deemed one of fact (see <em>Matter of Di Bella, </em>279 App Div 689), in which the fact finder may be called upon to evaluate expert medical testimony (see <em>id.; Matter of Bucci, </em>57 Misc 2d 1001; <em>Matter of Rose, </em>201 Misc 470). This has usually been in the context of an attempt by parties to prove the relative survivorship of two or more people killed in a common disaster, when the order of death affected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>distribution of the decedents\u2019 estates.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And, while many of the efforts by parties attempting to prove survivorship are based on circumstantial evidence as to the relative times of death (see <em>Matter of Di Bella, supra </em>[evidence that wife suffered from asthma and would suffocate in shorter time]; <em>Matter ofBucci, supra </em>[presence of carbon monoxide in the lungs of only one of the decedents]; <em>Matter of Hayward, </em>143 Misc 401 [greater presence of carbon monoxide in lungs and comparatively greater physical warmth of one corpse]; see, also, <em>People v Lipsky, </em>57 NY2d 560), it is clear that the criteria used for determining death have been the medical standards (see <em>Matter of Bausch, </em>100 Misc 2d 817, 818) of irreversible cessation of cardiac and respiratory functions (cf. <em>Matter of Rose, </em>201 Misc 470, 472, <em>supra; </em>see, also, <em>People v Dlugash, </em>41 NY2d 725, 730-731; <em>Smith v Smith, </em>229 Ark 579, 586-587; <em>Thomas v Anderson, </em>96 Cal App 2d 371, 375).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Within the past two decades, machines that artificially maintain cardiorespiratory functions have come into widespread use. This technical accomplishment has called into question the universal applicability of the traditional legal and medical criteria for determining when a person has died.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">These criteria were cast into flux as the medical community gained a better understanding of human physiology.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>It is widely understood that the human brain may be anatomically divided, generally, into three parts: the cerebrum, the cerebellum, and the brain stem. The cerebrum, known also as the \u201chigher brain,\u201d is deemed largely to control cognitive functions such as thought, memory, and consciousness. The cerebellum primarily controls motor coordination.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The brain stem, or \u201clower brain,\u201d which itself has three parts known as the midbrain, pons, and medulla, controls reflexive or spontaneous functions such as breathing, swallowing, and \u201csleep-wake\u201d cycles.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">In addition to injuries that directly and immediately destroy brain tissue, certain physical traumas may indirectly result in a complete and irreversible cessation of the brain\u2019s functions. For example, a direct trauma to the head can cause great swelling of the brain tissue, which, in turn, will stem the flow of blood to the brain. A respiratory arrest will similarly cut off the supply of oxygen to the blood and, hence, the brain.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Within a relatively short period after being deprived of oxygen, the brain will irreversibly stop functioning.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> With the suffocation of the higher brain all cognitive powers are lost and a cessation of lower brain functions will ultimately end all spontaneous bodily functions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Notwithstanding a total irreversible loss of the entire brain\u2019s functioning, contemporary medical techniques can maintain, for a limited period, the operation of the heart and the lungs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Respirators or ventilators can substitute for the lower brain\u2019s failure to maintain breathing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This artificial respiration, when combined with a chemical regimen, can support the continued operation of the heart.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This is so because, unlike respiration, the physical con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>tracting or \u201cbeating\u201d of the heart occurs independently of impulses from the brain: so long as blood containing oxygen circulates to the heart, it may continue to beat and medication can take over the lower brain\u2019s limited role in regulating the rate and force of the heartbeat.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">It became clear in medical practice that the traditional \u201cvital signs\u201d \u2014 breathing and heartbeat \u2014 are not independent indicia of life, but are, instead, part of an integration of functions in which the brain is dominant.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As a result, the medical community began to consider the cessation of brain activity as a measure of death.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The movement in law towards recognizing cessation of brain functions as criteria for death followed this medical trend. The immediate motive for adopting this position was to ease and make more efficient the transfer of donated organs.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Organ transfers, to be successful, require a \u201cviable, intact organ.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Once all of a person\u2019s vital functions have ceased, transferable organs swiftly deteriorate and lose their transplant value.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The technical ability to artificially maintain respiration and heartbeat after the entire brain has ceased to function was sought to be applied in cases of organ transplant to preserve the viability of donated organs.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Thus, the first legal recognition of cessation of brain functions as a criterion for determining death came in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>form of a Kansas statute enacted in 1970.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Denominated \u201c[a]n Act relating to and defining death,\u201d the statute states, in part, that death will be deemed to have occurred when a physician applying ordinary medical standards determines that there is an \u201cabsence of spontaneous respiratory and cardiac functions and * * * attempts at resuscitation are considered hopeless * * * or * * * there is the absence of spontaneous brain function.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A4N\">In the years following enactment of this statute, a growing number of sister States enacted statutes of their own.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Some opted for the Kansas approach.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Others defined death solely in terms of brain-based criteria as determined by accepted methods of medical practice.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> And still others retain the cardiorespiratory yardstick, but provide that when artificial means of sustaining respiration and heartbeat preclude application of the traditional criteria, death may be determined according to brain-based criteria, namely the irreversible cessation of brain functions.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In the absence of any statute defining death, some jurisdictions have judicially adopted brain-based criteria for determining death.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Professional and quasi-governmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>groups (including the American Bar Association, the American Medical Association, the President\u2019s Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research, and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws) have jointly indorsed a single standard that includes both cardiorespiratory and brain-based criteria.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">In New York, the term \u201cdeath\u201d, although used in many statutes, has not been expressly defined by the Legislature. This raises the question of how this court may construe these expressions of the term \u201cdeath\u201d in the absence of clarification by the Legislature. When the Legislature has failed to assign definition to a statutory term, the courts will generally construe that term according to \u201cits ordinary and accepted meaning as it was understood at the time\u201d <em>(People ex rel. Lichtenstein v Langan, </em>196 NY 260, 264). If the term at issue has been judicially defined prior to its use in a statute, however, that definition will be assigned to the term, absent contrary indications <em>(People v Richards, </em>108 NY 137; see <em>People v Most, </em>128 NY 108, 113; cf. <em>Orinoco Realty Co. v Bandler, </em>233 NY 24). In every case, of course, the term must be read in accordance with the apparent purpose of the statute in which it is found (see <em>People v Ryan, </em>274 NY 149; <em>People v Kaye, </em>212 NY 407).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Bearing these principles in mind, it must be added that statutory construction is not \u201ca ritual to be observed by unimaginative adherence to well-worn professional phrases\u201d (Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Col L Rev 527, 529). For, as this court has observed, \u201c[f]ew words are so plain that the context or the occasion is without capacity to enlarge or narrow their extension\u201d <em>(Surace v Danna, </em>248 NY 18, 21). This is particularly true when a \u201cword * * * must be applied under changed conditions\u201d <em>(Dixon v Robbins, </em>246 NY 169, 173; see, also, <em>People v Hines, </em>284 NY 93,101-103). The guiding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>principle is that there must always be fidelity to the fair import of the term (see <em>Dixon v Robbins, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">It has been called to this court\u2019s attention that the Legislature has, on a number of occasions, had bills before it that would expressly recognize brain-based criteria for determining death and has taken no affirmative action <em>(see People v Bonilla, </em>95 AD2d 396,402, n 5 [opn per Rubin, J.]). This legislative void in no way impedes this court from fulfilling its obligation to construe laws of the State. Indeed, advances made in medical science have caused a focus on the issues of when a jury may find criminal responsibility for homicide, of when physicians may transfer donated organs, and of when a person\u2019s body may be accorded the dignity of final repose. It is incumbent upon this court to instill certainty and uniformity in these important areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">We hold that a recognition of brain-based criteria for determining death is not unfaithful to prior judicial definitions of \u201cdeath\u201d, as presumptively adopted in the many statutes using that term. Close examination of the common-law conception of death and the traditional criteria used to determine when death has occurred leads inexorably to this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Courts have not engaged in a metaphysical analysis of when life should be deemed to have passed from a person\u2019s body, leaving him or her dead. Rather, they have conceptualized death as the absence of life, unqualified and undefined (see <em>Evans v People, </em>49 NY 86, 90, <em>supra). </em>On a practical level, this broad conception of death as \u201cthe opposite of life\u201d was substantially narrowed through recognition of the cardiorespiratory criteria for determining when death occurs. Under these criteria, the loci of life are the heart and the lungs: where there is no breath or heartbeat, there is no life. Cessation manifests death.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Considering death to have occurred when there is an irreversible and complete cessation of the functioning of the entire brain, including the brain stem, is consistent with the common-law conception of death (see <em>Commonwealth v Golston, </em>373 Mass 249, 254). Ordinarily, death will be determined according to the traditional criteria of irreversible cardiorespiratory repose. When, however, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>respiratory and circulatory functions are maintained by mechanical means, their significance, as signs of life, is at best ambiguous. Under such circumstances, death may nevertheless be deemed to occur when, according to accepted medical practice, it is determined that the entire brain\u2019s function has irreversibly ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Death remains the single phenomenon identified at common law; the supplemental criteria are merely adapted to account for the \u201cchanged conditions\u201d that a dead body may be attached to a machine so as to exhibit demonstrably false indicia of life. It reflects an improved understanding that in the complete and irreversible absence of a functioning brain, the traditional loci of life \u2014 the heart and the lungs \u2014 function only as a result of stimuli originating from outside of the body and will never again function as part of an integrated organism.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">This court searches in vain for evidence that, apart from the concept of death, the Legislature intended to render immutable the criteria used to determine death. By extension, to hold to the contrary would be to say that the law could not recognize diagnostic equipment such as the stethoscope or more sensitive equipment even when it became clear that these instruments more accurately measured the presence of signs of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Moreover, the Legislature has consistently declared, from the time it adopted the Field Commission\u2019s draft of a Penal Code in 1881 through several recodifications, that our Penal Law should be construed \u201caccording to the fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>import of [its] terms to promote justice and effect the objects of the law\u201d (Penal Law, \u00a7 5.00). It is the first object of our Penal Law \u201c[t]o proscribe conduct which unjustifiably and inexcusably causes or threatens substantial harm to individual or public interests\u201d (Penal Law, \u00a7 1.05, subd 1). Therefore, in the instant matters, to construe our homicide statute to provide for criminal responsibility for homicide when a defendant\u2019s conduct causes injury leading to the victim\u2019s total loss of brain functions, is entirely consistent with the Legislature\u2019s concept of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">(d)</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">One must be careful to distinguish the effect of this decision \u2014 determining when a person has died \u2014 from issues raised in related but qualitatively distinct cases \u2014 determining when a person may be allowed to die. In <em>Matter of Storar </em>(52 NY2d 363), this court reviewed two separate applications brought on behalf of two terminally ill patients. One sought permission to terminate extraordinary medical care. The other sought permission, over the patient\u2019s mother\u2019s objection, to administer medically necessary blood transfusions that would have prolonged the patient\u2019s short-lived life. A personal right to decline medical care, founded at common law, was applied in the first case as there existed clear and convincing evidence that this was the patient\u2019s personal desire. But, in the second case, the court held that, in the absence of such evidence of personal intent (there, due to the patient\u2019s incompetence), a third party has no recognized right to decide that the patient\u2019s quality of life has declined to a point where treatment should be withheld and the patient should be allowed to die (compare <em>Matter of Storar, </em>52 NY2d, at pp 370, n 2, 382, with <em>id., </em>at pp 389-391 [Jones, J., dissenting in part]).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Today\u2019s decision is no retreat from that holding. Under existing law, third parties are without authority to determine on behalf of the terminally ill that they should be permitted to die. This court will make no judgment as to what is for another an unacceptable quality of life. But, when a determination has been made according to accepted medical standards<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> that a person has suffered an irreversi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>ble cessation of heartbeat and respiration, or, when these functions are maintained solely by extraordinary mechanical means, an irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem, no life traditionally recognized by the law is present in that body.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Each defendant correctly notes that the respective Trial Judges did not expressly instruct the juries concerning the criteria to be applied in determining when death occurred. Whether medically accepted brain-based criteria are legally cognizable became ah issue in these cases when the respective juries heard testimony concerning the victims being pronounced medically dead while their hearts were beating and before artificial maintenance of the cardiorespiratory systems was discontinued. To properly evaluate whether these diagnoses of death were legally and medically premature and, therefore, whether the subsequent activities were possibly superseding causes of the deaths, the juries had to have been instructed as to the appropriate criteria for determining death: irreversible cessation of breathing and heartbeat or irreversible cessation of the entire brain\u2019s functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">The courts here adequately conveyed to the juries their obligation to determine the fact and causation of death. The courts defined the criteria of death in relation to the chain of causation. By specifically charging the juries that they might consider the surgical procedures as superseding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>causes of death, the courts made clear by ready implication that death should be deemed to have occurred after <em>all </em>medical procedures had ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The trial courts could have given express instructions that death may be deemed to have occurred when the victims\u2019 entire brain, including the brain stem, had irreversibly ceased to function. On the facts of these cases, that would have been the better practice. But, as mentioned, the brain-based criteria are supplemental to the traditional criteria, each describing the same phenomenon of death. In the context of a criminal case for homicide, there is no theoretical or practical impediment to the People\u2019s proceeding under a theory that the defendant \u201ccause[d] the death\u201d of a person, with death determined by either criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Even though each of these cases was presented to a jury which had been charged that death should be deemed to have occurred after the medical intervention had ended, testimony concerning the attending physicians\u2019 diagnoses of the victims as dead, according to brain-based criteria, was nonetheless highly relevant. It was these medical pronouncements that caused the victims to be removed from the medical systems that maintained their breathing and heartbeat. If the victims were properly diagnosed as dead, of course, no subsequent medical procedure such as the organ removals would be deemed a cause of death. If victims\u2019 deaths were prematurely pronounced due to a doctor\u2019s negligence, the subsequent procedures may have been a cause of death, but that negligence would not constitute a superseding cause of death relieving defendants of liability (see <em>People v Stewart, </em>40 NY2d 692, 697-698; <em>People v Kane, </em>213 NY 260, 270). If, however, the pronouncements of death were premature due to the gross negligence or the intentional wrongdoing of doctors, as determined by a grave deviation from accepted medical practices or disregard for legally cognizable criteria for determining death, the intervening medical procedure would interrupt the chain of causation and become the legal cause of death (see <em>People v Kane, supra, </em>at pp 270-271; see, also, <em>State v Scates, </em>50 NC 420). Thus, the propriety of the medical procedures is integral to the question of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>A review of the records, viewed in a light most favorable to the People, indicates that there was sufficient evidence for a rational juror to have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that each defendant\u2019s conduct caused the victim\u2019s death and that the medical procedures were not superseding causes of death (see <em>People v Contes, </em>60 NY2d 620, 621). There was ample testimony at both trials to the effect that determining death by brain-based criteria had long been an accepted medical practice. Nor were the physicians acting without some legal authority in grounding their determinations on brain-based criteria. In 1975, a lower court construed the term \u201cdeath,\u201d as used in New York\u2019s enactment of the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (see Public Health Law, art 43), as embracing brain-based criteria (see <em>Matter of New York City Health &amp; Hosps. Corp. v Sulsona, </em>81 Misc 2d 1002). When the instant cases arose several years later, there existed no contrary statement of the law by either the Legislature or any appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">An expert medical witness for defendant Bonilla cast some aspersions on the particular diagnostic tests performed by the doctors in that case. In the face of that testimony, however, there was substantial testimony by other experts indicating that the diagnostic tests comported with accepted medical practice. Defendant Eulo offered no rebuttal to the testimony that the pronouncement of death was made in accordance with accepted medical practices. Thus, there was sufficient evidence for both juries to have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the medical decisions did not break the causal chain linking defendants\u2019 conduct and the victims\u2019 deaths.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Defendant Eulo\u2019s other arguments have been considered and found to be either unpreserved or without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Accordingly, in each case, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Judges Jasen, Jones, Wachtler, Meyer, Simons and Kaye concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">In each case: Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-8\">. Ordinarily, the precise time of death has no legal significance. Even when relevant, legal fictions or presumptions as to the time of death are often employed, such as when a person has been continuously absent for a period of more than five years (see EPTL 2-1.7, subd [a]; <em>Matter of Katz, 135 </em>Misc 861). Although the statute providing for an action for wrongful death provides a limitation of two years from the time of \u201cdeath\u201d (see EPTL 5-4.1), we find no cases in which the time of an action\u2019s accrual was at issue. In the same vein are criminal cases applying the common-law rule that conduct, to constitute murder, must cause death within one year and one day (see <em>Burns &amp; Cary v People, </em>1 Parker Cr Rep 182,185). This rule has long been abrogated in New York (see <em>People v Brengard, </em>265 NY 100, 105-108; <em>People v Legeri, </em>239 App Div 47), thereby removing one possible need to measure when death has occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b402-8\">. In many circumstances, the order in which two people die, for example a husband and wife, may profoundly affect how their respective estates are distributed. At common law, when two or more people were killed in a common disaster, there was no \u201cpresumption either of survivorship or simultaneous death\u201d <em>(McGowin v Menken, </em>223 NY 509, 511; <em>see Newell v Nichols, </em>75 NY 78, 89). This rule has been altered by statute to provide for equity in the devolution or disposition of property when \u201cthere is no sufficient evidence that persons have died otherwise than simultaneously\u201d (EPTL 2-1.6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b402-9\">.

The initial problem for doctors was to devise a technical means of verifying when the entire brain ceases to function. Unlike tests for determining the cessation of breathing and heartbeat, more sophisticated means were necessary to measure the less obvious functioning of the brain. A seminal study was issued in 1968, under the auspices of Harvard Medical School (see Harvard Report, <em>supra, </em>n 7), setting forth a multistep test designed to identify the existence of physical indicia of brain activity. Under it, responsiveness to painful stimuli is to be tested. The subject is also to be observed for any spontaneous movement or respiration and any operation of various bodily reflexes. The absence of brain activity, when demonstrated under these tests, is then sought to be confirmed by reapplication of the tests at least 24 hours later and through the reading of an BEG, which when \u201cflat\u201d has confirmatory value. This test has served as the foundation for currently applied tests for determining when the brain has ceased to function.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b404-11\">.

Following the second part of the disjunctive definition, as originally enacted, is the statement: \u201cDeath is to be pronounced before artificial means of supporting respiratory and circulatory function are terminated and before any vital organ is removed for purposes of transplantation.\u201d This final sentence, which intimates that the brain-based criteria are to be utilized only in transplant cases, precipitated some criticism of the statute. Two commentators noted that \u201c[t]he primary fault with this legislation is that it appears to be based on, or at least gives voice to, the misconception that there are two separate phenomena of death. This dichotomy is particularly unfortunate because it seems to have been inspired by a desire to establish a special definition for organ transplantation\u201d (Capron &amp; Kass, <em>supra, </em>n 3, at p 109).

The recommended standard provides: \u201cAn individual who has sustained either (1) irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions, or (2) irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem, is dead. A determination of death must be made in accordance with accepted medical standards\u201d (see Comm Report, <em>supra, </em>n 3, at p 2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b408-8\">. In reaching this conclusion, this court is aware of the criticism from some quarters that the perceived motivation for the development and recognition of brain-based criteria for death renders these criteria \u201ctheoretically impure.\u201d This is asserted on the ground that the prospect of more easily accessible transplants serves to \u201cadulterate the purity of [the] scientific case by baiting it with the prospect of this <em>extraneous </em>\u2014 though extremely appealing \u2014 gain\u201d (Jonas, <em>supra, </em>n 16, at p 52 [emphasis in original]). Although, practically speaking, adoption of these supplemental criteria will indeed facilitate organ transplants, it has been found that \u201cthe need for viable organs to transplant does not account fully for the interest in diagnosing irreversible loss of brain functions\u201d (Comm Report, <em>supra, </em>n 3, at p 23). The Presidential Commission, charged with evaluating how death should be determined, cited studies reporting \u201cthat organs are procured in only a small percentage of cases in which brain-based criteria might be applied\u201d <em>(id.). </em>The Commission itself found that the \u201cmedical concern over the determination of death rests much less with any wish to facilitate organ transplantation than with the need both to render appropriate care to patients and to replace artificial support with more fitting and respectful behavior when a patient has become a dead body\u201d <em>(id., </em>at pp 23-24).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b409-8\">. This court has rejected judicial attempts to formulate detailed legal standards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>governing procedures leading to medical diagnoses (see <em>Matter of Storar, </em>52 NY2d 363, modfg 73 AD2d 431). Today we decline to set forth what particular medical diagnostic tests should be performed before a person\u2019s brain functions may be found to have irreversibly ceased. Any attempt to establish a specific procedure might inhibit the development and application of more sophisticated diagnostic methods. Therefore, it is sufficient that a particular determination be made according to accepted medical standards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b410-9\">. When any function of the brain persists, of course, death may not be deemed to have occurred. For example, a person may have suffered an irreversible loss of higher brain functions and, yet, the brain-stem functions subsist. This condition is \u201cusually called a \u2018persistent vegitative state\u2019 or \u2018persistent noncognitive state.\u2019 Such persons [suffering this condition] may exhibit spontaneous, involuntary movements such as yawns or facial grimaces, their eyes may be open and they may be capable of breathing without assistance. *** The case of Karen Anne Quinlin has made this condition familiar to the general public [see <em>Matter of Quinlan, </em>137 NJ Super 227, mod 70 NJ 10, cert den <em>sub nom. Garger v New Jersey, </em>429 US 922]. With necessary medical and nursing care * * * such patients can survive months or years, often without a respirator.\u201d (Comm Report, <em>supra, </em>n 3, at p 18 [nn omitted].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
