The preliminary injunction should not have been issued as the voter registration project does not violate the concept of bipartisan administration or the registration and election process. <em>(Picotte Realty v Gallery of Homes, </em>66 AD2d 978; <em>Matter of Armitage v Carey, </em>49 AD2d 496; <em>Matter of Adams u Flanagan, </em>201 App Div 735, 234 NY 540.)

Executive Order No. 43 does not violate the bipartisan registration requirements of section 8 of article II of the New York Constitution. <em>(Matter of Celler v Larkin, </em>71 Misc 2d 17; <em>Matter of Adams v Flanagan, </em>201 App Div 735, 234 NY 540.) II. Executive Order No. 43 does not contravene the voter registration plan enacted by the New York Legislature; indeed, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>executive order furthers both State and Federal legislative policy. <em>(Matter of Siwek v Mahoney, </em>39 NY2d 159; <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v FCC, </em>395 US 367; <em>United States v Mine Workers, </em>330 US 258; <em>Fogarty v United States, </em>340 US 8.)

In expedited proceedings, Special Term issued a preliminary injunction enjoining defendants from implementing the program; on appeal the Appellate Division reversed and denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for such relief. That court thereupon granted plaintiff permission to appeal to our court on the certified question, \u201cDid this court err as a matter of law in rev\u00e9rsing the order of Special Term and denying plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">As noted by the Appellate Division, one of the prerequisites for the issuance of a preliminary injunction is a showing of irreparable injury to the applicant if that relief is not granted. Even if we assume that any injury to plaintiff would be irreparable in the time-frame and circumstances of this case, on the record before us there is a failure of proof to show any such injury. Of course, the implementation of an informational and promotional program by the agencies of government which would lead to the voluntary registration of additional voters would not of itself result in injury to plaintiff. Legally cognizable injury might occur, however, if the implementation of the program were to be affected by discrimination, for example, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>to geography, demographics or directly as to party enrollment, but there is before us no tender of proof as to any such discrimination nor does plaintiff assert any such claim. Although employment of duress or other improper method would also constitute such injury, again, no proof is tendered to support any such claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Nor, in support of his claim of irreparable injury, has plaintiff demonstrated on the present submission in support of his application for a preliminary injunction that the \u201cProgram for Voter Registraton\u201d at issue here is more than a program to encourage registration or that it comes within the ambit of section 8 of article II of the Constitution or of section 5-210 (subd 6, par [a]) of the Election Law. Plaintiff cannot, therefore, advance theories of injury stemming from alleged denial of bipartisan participation under either of these provisions (see paragraphs 30 to 37 of his verified complaint) to sustain his entitlement to a preliminary injunction against this program.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, without costs, and the certified question answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Jasen, Jones, Wachtler, Meyer, Simons and Kaye concur in <em>Per Curiam </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Order affirmed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
