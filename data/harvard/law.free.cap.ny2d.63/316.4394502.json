The evidence was so unsatisfactory as to be insufficient to support the verdict of murder in the second degree as a matter of law, as a matter of fact and in the interest of justice. <em>(People v Leyra, </em>302 NY 353; <em>People v Castillo, </em>47 NY2d 270; <em>People v Quinones, </em>61 AD2d 765; <em>People v Ledwon, </em>153 NY 10.) II. Appellant\u2019s constitutional rights secured by the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments were violated by the use of a statement allegedly made by him to law enforcement officers. (L<em>eyra v Denno, </em>347 US 556; <em>Haynes v Washington, </em>373 US 503; <em>Michigan v Mosley, </em>423 US 96; <em>People v Wander, </em>47 NY2d 724; <em>People v Pugh, </em>70 AD2d 664; <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; <em>Rhode Island v Innis, </em>446 US 291; <em>United States v Barnes, </em>432 F2d 89; <em>People v Bodner, </em>75 AD2d 440; <em>People v Lange, </em>77 AD2d 632.) III. Appellant was deprived of his constitutional right to a fair trial by degrading trial counsel. <em>(People v Burnside, </em>52 AD2d 626; <em>People v Tatum, </em>54 AD2d 950; <em>People v Powell, </em>64 AD2d 676; <em>People v Moulton, </em>43 NY2d 944.) IV. Adverse comment on appellant\u2019s exercise of his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination deprived him of a fair trial. <em>(People v Von Werne, </em>41 NY2d 584; <em>Jenkins v Anderson, </em>447 US 231; <em>People v Conyers, </em>49 NY2d 174, 52 NY2d 454.) V. The failure of the District Attorney to disclose what prior bad acts he would confront appellant with deprived appellant of his right to safely testify. <em>(People v Molineux, </em>168 NY 264; <em>People v Sandoval, </em>34 NY2d 371; <em>People v Santarelli, </em>49 NY2d 241.) VI. Appellant was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation when the District Attorney was permitted to make reference to the out-of-court confession of codefendant. <em>(Bruton v United States, </em>391 US 123.) VII. Appellant was further deprived of his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation and Fourteenth Amendment right to a fair trial by the argument of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>the District Attorney on summation that there was additional evidence that was not presented at the trial. VIII. Personal vouching by the District Attorney for prosecution witnesses deprived appellant of a fair trial. <em>(People v Manson, </em>63 AD2d 686.) IX. The court improperly instructed the jury in a manner that unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof to the defense. <em>(Sandstrom v Montana, </em>442 US 510; <em>People v Egan, </em>72 AD2d 239.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b371-5\"><em>John J.

The order of the Appellate Division should, therefore, be reversed, defendant\u2019s motion to suppress those statements granted, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">On December 5,1975, Lillian Sher was murdered in her home during the course of a robbery in which some furs were stolen. A week later, defendant Ferro was arrested for the murder and taken to the precinct station. After the reading of his <em>Miranda </em>rights to him, Ferro declined to answer any questions. Thereafter, while being held in a detention cell, he asked Detective Hudson whether he could speak to a District Attorney. Told by Hudson that, \u201cYou have to tell me what you want to talk to him about so I can relate that to him. Otherwise, he won\u2019t come\u201d, defendant said nothing further. Hudson then left the precinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">When he returned, Hudson and his partner brought with them the stolen furs, which they had obtained from the apartment of a codefendant, Thomas Lewis. Without any verbal communication with defendant, the furs \u201cwere placed right in front of the cell a foot away from [Ferro].\u201d Ferro then \u201cgrabbed ahold of the wire mesh with both hands and * * * said * * * \u2018Hey, I got to talk to you.\u2019 \u201d He again told Hudson he wanted to speak to a District Attorney, stating \u201cI will tell you guys what you want to know if the D.A. can do something for me\u201d. Hudson responded that neither he nor the District Attorney could do anything for Ferro. Hudson testified that there was one continuous conversation, which began as soon as the furs were placed on the floor in front of the cell. Its culmination was Ferro\u2019s request to speak to an Italian detective.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Detective Walter Cassi was then asked to speak to defendant, and, approaching the detention cage, said \u201cI am Italian. Do you want to say something.\u201d Receiving a positive response, Cassi took defendant into the commanding officer\u2019s room, where defendant said \u201cI can\u2019t afford to do a lot of time. What can I tell you?\u201d Told by Cassi that he could promise nothing, but would pass on whatever was said to the District Attorney \u201cand whatever they do that\u2019s their business,\u201d Ferro recounted that he had been told by a woman who was decedent\u2019s next-door neighbor that decedent was giving her a great deal of trouble for which she wanted decedent robbed as a means of revenge, that he had told the neighbor he was not interested, and in response to her question whether he could get somebody to do so, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>responded only that he would think about it. Neither before the furs were placed in front of the detention cell nor before Cassi began his conversation with defendant in the commanding officer\u2019s office were <em>Miranda </em>warnings repeated anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\"> The hearing Judge denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and after a jury trial defendant was found guilty of felony murder. On appeal to the Appellate Division, defendant raised nine points, only one of which \u2014 the admissibility of the statements made to Cassi \u2014 was deemed by that court to merit discussion. The judgment was affirmed, two Justices dissenting, the majority characterizing the statements \u201cas the self-serving efforts of an aging criminal to spare himself the remainder of his life in captivity, and not the result of psychological coercion or police behavior reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d (92 AD2d, at p 303.) The case is before us by leave of one of the dissenting Justices. The People, citing <em>People v Bryant </em>(59 NY2d 786), argue that, the Appellate Division having affirmed, the suppression ruling may not be overturned by us. They argue, alternatively, that the Appellate Division majority was correct on the law. We disagree on both points and, therefore, reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">As hereafter developed, the test is not whether the detectives in fact intended to interrogate defendant but whether an objective observer would conclude that the conduct of the detectives was reasonably likely to elicit a response from defendant. There being no dispute as to the facts and there being no other inference that could be drawn from the undisputed facts than that the police should have known that defendant was reasonably likely to respond to the placing of the furs before him by making a statement, the issue, unlike that in <em>Bryant (supra), </em>is not beyond our reach.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\"><em>Miranda v Arizona </em>(384 US 436) requires not only that before interrogation can begin a suspect must be advised concerning his right to remain silent and of his right to counsel, but also that, \u201cIf the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease\u201d <em>(id., </em>at pp 473-474). Moreover, the rule being designed to counteract the coercive pressure of the custodial setting, a suspect\u2019s right to remain silent, once invoked, must be \u201cscrupulously honored\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p 479; <em>Michigan v Mosley, </em>423 US 96, 103-104; <em>People v Wander, </em>47 NY2d 724, 725; see <em>People v Grant, </em>45 NY2d 366, 373, 376). He may not within a short period thereafter and without a fresh set of warnings be importuned to speak about the same suspected crime <em>(People v Gary, </em>31 NY2d 68, 70; <em>Michigan v Mosley, </em>423 US 96, 106, <em>supra; </em>see <em>People v Buxton, </em>44 NY2d 33, 37), but a statement volunteered<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or spontaneously made will not be suppressible unless it is about the same crime and results from express questioning or its functional equivalent under circumstances which do not include fresh warnings and do not scrupulously honor the suspect\u2019s right to cut off questioning <em>(Rhode Island v Innis, </em>446 US 291, 300-301; <em>Michigan v Mosley, supra; People v Bryant, </em>59 NY2d 786, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">As the <em>Innis </em>case makes clear, \u201cthe term \u2018interrogation\u2019 under <em>Miranda </em>refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response\u201d (446 US, at p 301). But, because \u201c[t]he latter portion of this definition focuses primarily upon the perceptions of the suspect, rather than the intent of the police\u201d <em>(id.), </em>the question is not what was the subjective intent of the police but rather what words or actions, in light of their knowledge concerning the suspect, they <em>\u201cshould have known </em>were reasonably likely to elicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>an incriminating response\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p 302 [italics in original]; White, Interrogation Without Questions: <em>Rhode Island v Innis </em>and <em>United States u Henry, </em>78 Mich L Rev 1209, 1231-1236; Kamisar, <em>Brewer v Williams, Massiah </em>and <em>Miranda: </em>What Is \u201cInterrogation\u201d? When Does It Matter?, 67 Geo LJ 1, 19, n 115 [reprinted in Kamisar, Police Interrogations and Confessions: Essays in Law and Policy, pp 156-158, n 21]; McCormick, Evidence [2d ed], p 330).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In the context of the foregoing rule, defendant\u2019s statements to Cassi must be suppressed. After the original <em>Miranda </em>warnings, defendant declined to answer questions. Although he thereafter asked to speak to a District Attorney, he abandoned that attempt when told that he first had to reveal to Hudson what he wanted to talk about. With the knowledge from defendant\u2019s request to speak to a District Attorney that defendant had something on his mind that he wanted to talk about but would not reveal to him, Hudson, instead of acceding to defendant\u2019s request that a District Attorney be called in, left and within a relatively short time returned with decedent\u2019s furs, which were placed directly in front of defendant without any words being spoken. The immediate result was defendant\u2019s further request to speak with a District Attorney, followed, in one continuous conversation, by his request for an Italian detective and his conversation with Cassi. Neither before the placing of the furs nor before Cassi\u2019s conversation with defendant were fresh <em>Miranda </em>warnings given, although here, unlike the situation in <em>People v Bryant {supra), </em>there was both time enough to do so and clear reason, in light of the prior refusal to speak, for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">On those undisputed facts, objectively considered, no other conclusion is possible than that, in causing the decedent\u2019s furs to be placed where defendant could not help but see them, Hudson should have known, in light of defendant\u2019s prior request to speak to a District Attorney, that doing so was reasonably likely to elicit from defendant an incriminating response. Where, as here, and as in <em>Combs v Wingo </em>(465 F2d 96,99) and <em>United States v Barnes </em>(432 F2d 89, 91), the only possible object of the police action in revealing evidence to a defendant is to elicit a statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>from him, it does no violence to logic to conclude that the police should have known that it would do so (see McCormick, Evidence [2d ed], <em>op. cit.). </em>Bearing in mind the placing of the furs before Ferro, the absence of further warnings to him and the relatively short time elapsed between his refusal to answer questions and the placing of the furs, we conclude that Ferro\u2019s right to cut off questioning was not scrupulously honored.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">We have considered defendant\u2019s other arguments for reversal and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his statements made subsequent to his viewing of the furs granted and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-9\">. Not involved in the present case and, therefore, not reached by us, is whether the same test applies when the police conduct is in furtherance of routine administrative duties (see <em>People v Prator, </em>93 Misc 2d 303; <em>State v Grisby, </em>97 Wn 2d 493; cf. <em>People v Bryant, </em>59 NY2d 786).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b373-9\">. <em>Bryant </em>involved a question addressed by one officer to another, overheard by defendant and to which he responded. Upon that scenario \u201creasonable minds may differ as to the inference to be drawn from the established facts\u201d <em>(People v McRay, </em>51 NY2d 594, 601; accord <em>People v Harrison, </em>57 NY2d 470, 477). Here, as is more fully discussed below, no other inference can be drawn from the undisputed facts than that defendant was likely to respond by making a statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b374-7\">. Voluntariness \u2014 waiver in traditional terms \u2014 is to be distinguished <em>(People v Grant, </em>45 NY2d 366, 374). A statement may in fact be wholly voluntary and yet inadmissible because the police action after the suspect cut off questioning did not comply with required procedures <em>(id,.; Michigan v Mosley, </em>423 US 96, 100; <em>Michigan v Tucker, </em>417 US 433, 443).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b376-10\">. The string of adjectives in the last paragraph of the dissent and of synonyms in the second paragraph on its page 325 overlooks the meaning of \u201cscrupulous\u201d, which is \u201ccorrect to the smallest detail; punctiliously exact; painstaking, precise\u201d (Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, p 2043). As Kamisar puts it, \u201cIf the police conduct is designed and likely to pressure or persuade * * * a suspect to incriminate himself * * * then that conduct is \u2018compulsion\u2019 as <em>Miranda </em>defines the self-incrimination clause\u201d (67 Geo LJ 1, at p 23). The dissent\u2019s interpretation <em>o\u00ed Innis </em>implies that the Supreme Court did not mean what it held in that case. We should not indulge in such speculation, particularly since <em>Innis </em>was decided but a few years ago.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b376-7\">Jasen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Axux\">(dissenting). The majority, in holding that the \u201cplacing in front of the cell in which defendant was being detained furs stolen from the murder victim\u2019s residence constituted interrogation\u201d, interprets the \u201clikely to elicit\u201d test (see <em>Rhode Island v Innis, </em>446 US 291, 303) too literally and mechanically, untempered by the purposes to be served thereby. Moreover, the majority fails to distinguish between the differing policies involved and the ramifications resulting where the suspect has sought the assistance of counsel \u2014 which defendant did not do here \u2014 as opposed to merely choosing initially to remain silent. (Cf. <em>Brewer v Williams, </em>430 US 387, 397.) The proscriptions to be applied in each instance are not the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Because I strongly believe that the mere placing of evidence in front of defendant cannot be deemed an unconstitutional interrogation in violation of the right to remain silent, invoked upon the reading of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">After <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given and defendant chose not to answer questions, the police refrained from further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>discussion with him. Defendant was not subjected to any questioning. He was not subjected to any browbeating, violence, threats or intimidation; no taunting, importuning, harassment or cajoling; no promises, inducement, deceit or trickery; no discomfort, humiliation, exhaustion or moral or religious suasion; nor, indeed, to any other form of compulsion or coercion. (See <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436,448-458; cf. <em>Oregon v Bradshaw, </em>462 US 1039,_, 77 L ed 2d 405, 413; <em>Rhode Island v Innis, supra, </em>at p 299.) Rather, upon viewing the stolen goods obtained from his accomplice and simply placed before him by the police, defendant insisted that he be permitted to speak in exchange for prosecutorial leniency. When informed that nothing could be promised, but that his explanation would be relayed to the District Attorney, defendant volunteered his alibi which was the subject of the suppression motion here in issue. Under these circumstances, I would hold that this police conduct did not constitute an impermissible interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The constitutional privilege against compulsory self-incrimination does not bar mere self:incrimination. It prohibits only that which is genuinely compelled \u2014 i.e., the result of coercion or overbearing of the will of the accused. <em>(New York v Quarles, </em>467 US_,104 S Ct 2626, 2630-2632; <em>United States u Washington, </em>431 US 181, 187-188; <em>Michigan v Tucker, </em>417 US 433, 448.) Statements voluntarily made, regardless of how damning, are not proscribed. <em>(United States v Washington, supra, </em>at p 187; see, also, <em>Miranda v Arizona, supra, </em>at p 478.) Defendant does not claim, nor is there any indication in the record, that he was actually compelled by police conduct which in any way overcame his will to resist.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Moreover, the \u201clikely to elicit\u201d test invoked by the majority is not an explicit constitutional prescription mandating blind application in every case, regardless of the resulting absurdity under particular facts. (Cf. <em>North Carolina v Butler, </em>441 US 369, 374-379; <em>Michigan v Mosley, </em>423 US 96, 102-103.) Rather, it is an interpretive guideline to assist in determining whether certain police activity is the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of an interrogation. <em>(Rhode Island v Innis, supra, </em>at p 302; see, also, <em>Brewer v Williams, </em>430 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>US, at p 399.) In turn, this latter formulation is itself a practical tool for applying the safeguards of <em>Miranda, </em>which themselves are not mandated by the Constitution either. <em>(Michigan v Tucker, </em>417 US, at p 444; <em>Miranda v Arizona, supra, </em>at p 467.) Rather, even they are \u201cprophylactic\u201d (N<em>ew York v Quarles, </em>467 US_, 104 S Ct, at pp 2630-2632) \u2014 i.e., \u201csuggested\u201d \u201cmeasures to insure that the right against compulsory self-incrimination was protected.\u201d (Mic<em>higan v Tucker, supra, </em>at p 444; see <em>New York v Quarles, supra, </em>at p_, 104 S Ct, at pp 2630-2632.)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Ultimately, then, it is this right against compulsory self-incrimination, and not simply some felicitous tests uninformed by their policy purposes, which underlies <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny. It is that right which is at issue here and which should guide this court\u2019s decision. In considering the facts in this case, \u201c[c]ertainly no one could contend that the interrogation faced by [defendant \u2014 if it could reasonably be labeled as such \u2014 ] bore any resemblance to the historical practices at which the right against compulsory self-incrimination was aimed.\u201d <em>(Michigan v Tucker, supra, </em>at p 444.)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">While noninterrogatory statements of police officers and even their nonverbal actions may in some instances amount to unlawful interrogation of a suspect within the meaning of <em>Miranda </em>(see <em>Rhode Island v Innis, supra, </em>at p 299), nevertheless, not all \u201cprompting\u201d of any kind is constitutionally proscribed. <em>(Id.; Edwards v Arizona, </em>451 US 477, 488 [Burger, Ch. J., concurring].) Thus, while the skillful employment of religious compulsion <em>(Brewer v Williams, </em>supra) and deceitful confidences <em>(United States v Henry, </em>447 US 264) have been held to be impermissible \u201cdeliberate elicitations\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p 270), the discussion of child-safety concerns in a suspect\u2019s presence <em>(Rhode Island v Innis, </em>supra) and the advisement of the accused of additional charges being brought against him <em>(Michigan v Mosley, supra) </em>have been upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Indeed, there is no rigid rule constituting \u201ca blanket prohibition against the taking of <em>voluntary </em>statements or a permanent immunity from further interrogation, regardless of the circumstances, [for that] would transform the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards into wholly irrational obstacles to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>legitimate police investigative activity, and deprive suspects of an opportunity to make <em>informed and intelligent </em>assessments of their interests.\u201d <em>(Michigan v Mosley, </em>423 US, at p 102 [emphasis added].) Where, for example, as here, there is a mere disclosure of information to a suspect bearing on his prior decision to remain silent \u2014 i.e., the government\u2019s retrieving of the stolen goods \u2014 there is nothing in the Federal or State Constitution or case law barring that suspect from making an informed and voluntary reassessment of his decision and, thereafter, choosing to make a statement. <em>(Id., </em>at p 102; see, also, <em>id., </em>at pp 109-111 [White, J., concurring].)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">To construe the mere placing of evidence before defendant \u2014 little more than a simple disclosure of information which might, in fact, contribute to an intelligent exercise of his judgment \u2014 as an impermissible interrogation is to attribute to that police conduct the qualities of coercion and overbearing of defendant\u2019s will which it certainly was not. Such a construction, in my view, gives a tortured and unintended interpretation to the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards and the underlying privilege against compulsory self-incrimination. Indeed, in numerous cases involving analogous police conduct under circumstances similar to those presented here, Federal appellate courts have refused to regard the police actions as interrogations in violation of asserted <em>Miranda </em>rights. (See, for example, the following, all of which were decided <em>subsequent </em>to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s definition of \u201cinterrogation\u201d in <em>Innis: United States v Guido, </em>704 F2d 675 [CA 2d] [suggestion that defendant cooperate initiated by government agents, not impermissible interrogation]; <em>United States u Criswell, </em>696 F2d 636 [CA 8th] [placing defendant in an office where persuasive photographs were displayed, not impermissible interrogation]; <em>United States v Thierman, </em>678 F2d 1331 [CA 9th] [conversation in defendant\u2019s presence about the likelihood that the investigation would involve his family and girlfriend, not impermissible interrogation]; <em>United States v Hackley, </em>636 F2d 493 [CA-DC] [explanation of the incriminating evidence against defendant, not impermissible interrogation]; see, also, the following which, although decided prior to <em>Innis, </em>have since been cited with approval <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>in the afore-cited cases: <em>United States v Hart, </em>619 F2d 325 [CA 4th] [informing defendant that his cooperation would be relayed to the United States Attorney, not impermissible interrogation]; <em>United States v Wilson, </em>571 F2d 455 [CA 9th] [informing defendant of the extensive evidence against him, not impermissible interrogation]; <em>United States v Davis, </em>527 F2d 1110 [CA 9th], cert den 425 US 953 [showing defendant a photograph of himself participating in a bank robbery, not impermissible interrogation]; <em>United States v Boston, </em>508 F2d 1171 [CA 2d], cert den 421 US 1001 [confronting defendant with the incriminating results of the search of his apartment, not impermissible interrogation]; <em>United States v Hodge, </em>487 F2d 945 [CA 5th] [explanation of the incriminating evidence against defendant, not impermissible interrogation].) In accord with these decisions, and mindful of the purposes to be served and evils to be prevented by the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards and the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, I believe that the police conduct in this case cannot fairly be deemed a proscribed interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Finally, the majority\u2019s rigid application of the \u201clikely to elicit\u201d test ignores the significant distinctions between the right to remain silent and the right to assistance of counsel \u2014 only the former of which did defendant choose to exercise. Although he was advised fully in accordance with <em>Miranda, </em>defendant did not ask for counsel, invoke the right thereto, nor in any form indicate that he was awaiting counsel\u2019s arrival or assistance. In fact, he repeatedly requested to speak with the District Attorney despite the absence of an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Defendant simply exercised his right to remain silent upon receiving the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, thereby foreclosing any further questioning until such time as he should voluntarily and freely decide otherwise. Whereas \u201cadditional safeguards are necessary when the accused asks for counsel\u201d and, therefore, \u201cinterrogation [must] cease until an attorney [is] present\u201d <em>(Edwards v Arizona, </em>451 US, at pp 484, 485), that is true <em>\u201conly if the individual [has] stated that he wanted </em>counsel\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p 485 [emphasis added]). (See, also, <em>People v Cunningham, </em>49 NY2d 203; <em>People v Grant, </em>45 NY2d 366.) Otherwise, \u201cthe accused may <em>himself </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>validly waive his rights and respond to interrogation\u201d. <em>(Edwards v Arizona, supra, </em>at p 484 [emphasis added].)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">The \u201cpolicies underlying the two constitutional protections [right to assistance of counsel and privilege against compulsory self-incrimination] are quite distinct\u201d <em>(Rhode Island v Innis, </em>446 US, at p 300, n 4) and, consequently, so too are the appropriate procedural safeguards. With regard to the right to counsel, \u201c[i]f the individual states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation must cease <em>until an attorney is present.\u201d (Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US, at p 474 [emphasis added].) However, where an individual simply indicates his desire to remain silent, the situation is different. There is no \u201cper se proscription of indefinite duration upon any further questioning\u201d. <em>(Michigan v Mosley, </em>423 US, at p 102; see, also, <em>People v Grant, supra, </em>at p 375; <em>People v Cunningham, supra, </em>at p 207.) Rather, as long as the individual\u2019s \u201cright to <em>cut off </em>questioning\u201d is \u201cscrupulously honored\u201d <em>(Miranda v Arizona, supra, </em>at pp 474, 479 [emphasis added]), he may at any time make an \u201cinformed and intelligent\u201d reassessment of his interests and permit questioning to resume. <em>(Michigan v Mosley, supra, </em>at pp 102, 104.)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">In deciding that the entirely innocuous, nonverbal and noncoercive police conduct in this case amounted to unconstitutional interrogation by mechanically applying the \u201clikely to elicit\u201d test, the majority fails utterly to distinguish \u201cbetween the procedural safeguards triggered by a request to remain silent and a request for an attorney\u201d. <em>(Michigan v Mosley, supra, </em>at p 104, n 10, explaining <em>Miranda v Arizona, supra, </em>at p 474.) That distinction was made clear in <em>Miranda </em>and has been repeatedly recognized in its progeny. (See, e.g., <em>Oregon v Bradshaw, </em>462 US 1039 [Rehnquist, J.], 1047 [Powell, J., concurring], 1051 [Marshall, J., dissenting]; <em>Edwards v Arizona, </em>451 US, at pp 484-485 [White, J.], 491, n 1 [Powell, J., concurring]; <em>United States v Henry, </em>447 US 264, 272-273 [Burger, Ch. J.], 282, n 6 [Blackmun, J., dissenting], 295-296 [Rehnquist, J., dissenting]; <em>Rhode Island v Innis, </em>446 US, at p 300, n 4 [Stewart, J.]; <em>Brewer u Williams, </em>430 US, at pp 397-398 [Stewart, J.], 424-426 [Burger, Ch. J., dissenting], 436-437, n 6 [White, J., dissenting]; <em>Michigan v Mosley, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>423 US, at pp 101-104, and nn 7, 10 [Stewart, J.], 109-110 [White, J., concurring].) Likewise, this court has acknowledged the same distinction. (See <em>People v Grant, </em>45 NY2d, at p 375; <em>People v Cunningham, </em>49 NY2d, at p 207.)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Here, the defendant expressed no view nor gave the slightest indication that he was incompetent to decide whether to permit a resumption of questioning without legal advice. (Cf. <em>Michigan v Mosley, supra, </em>at p 110, n 2 [White, J., concurring].) Rather, he simply asserted his desire not to speak with the police at the outset, and subsequently decided, without any coercion of any sort, to change his mind in light of the incriminating evidence placed before him. In my view, the prophylactic safeguards of <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny do not preclude an individual from thus making an informed and voluntary reassessment of his interests, and do not proscribe, as an impermissible interrogation, the kind of nonverbal, noncoercive, nonthreatening, \u00e1nd even nonbothersome police conduct at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Accordingly, I would affirm the refusal of both courts below to suppress the statements volunteered by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Jones, Simons and Kaye concur with Judge Meyer; Judge Jasen dissents and votes to affirm in a separate opinion; Judge Wachtler taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
