Where the deceased showed no signs of heart failure for eight days after the incident and then suddenly and unexpectedly suffered a fatal heart attack, and the testimony of the prosecution\u2019s expert witnesses could not establish a causal connection between appellant\u2019s conduct and the heart attack, the evidence was legally insufficient to establish appellant\u2019s guilt of manslaughter in the second degree. <em>(People v Stewart, </em>40 NY2d 692; <em>People v Kibbe, </em>35 NY2d 407; <em>People v Caprio, </em>47 AD2d 1; <em>People v Parody, </em>248 App Div 269; <em>People v Roberts, </em>73 AD2d 954; <em>People v Lozano, </em>107 Misc 2d 345; <em>People v Aponte, </em>82 Misc 2d 283; <em>Matter of Burris v Lewis, </em>2 NY2d 323; <em>Matter of Riehl v Town of Amherst, </em>308 NY 212; <em>Matter of Miller v National Cabinet Co., </em>8 NY2d 277.)

A rational trier of fact, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the People, could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendants\u2019 actions during the robbery and burglary caused Mr. Weiner\u2019s fatal heart attack. <em>(People v Contes, </em>60 NY2d 620; <em>People v Stewart, </em>40 NY2d 692; <em>People v Cicchetti, </em>44 NY2d 803; <em>People v Bonifacio, </em>190 NY 150.)

The court below correctly decided there was insufficient evidence to establish that the 89-year-old decedent\u2019s heart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>attack was caused by the robbery, two and a half days earlier, where the deceased suffered from arteriosclerosis, obesity and prior infarcts, and where the medical experts provided equivocal testimony. <em>(Jackson v Virginia, </em>443 US 307; <em>People v Kibbe, </em>35 NY2d 407; <em>People v Stewart, </em>40 NY2d 692; <em>People v Brengard, </em>265 NY 100; <em>Matter of Burris v Lewis, 2 </em>NY2d 323; <em>Matter of Riehl v Town of Amherst, </em>308 NY 212; <em>People v Harding, </em>59 AD2d 897; <em>People v Kane, </em>213 NY 260; <em>People v Roberts, </em>73 AD2d 954.)

III. The evidence was legally insufficient to convict respondent, as an accessory, of robbery, burglary, and felony murder where she entered the premises during the middle of the robbery, was herself threatened, sat passively throughout the duration of the incident, and twice called the police immediately after the intruder left. <em>(Jackson v Virginia, </em>443 US 307; <em>People v Bennett, </em>49 NY 137; <em>People v Borrero, </em>26 NY2d 430; <em>People v Forestieri, </em>87 AD2d 523; <em>People v Fitzgerald, </em>156 NY 253; <em>United States v Stanchich, </em>550 F2d 1294.) IV. The court erred in permitting improper prosecution rebuttal evidence to stand while concurrently denying the defense the opportunity to present rebuttal evidence and thus irreparably prejudiced appellant and denied her a fair trial. <em>(People v Harris, </em>57 NY2d 335; <em>Marshall v Davies, </em>78 NY 414; <em>People v Bonier, </em>189 NY 108; <em>People v McCann, </em>90 AD2d 554; <em>Yeomans v Warren, </em>87 AD2d 713; <em>People v Richardson, </em>25 AD2d 221; <em>Jenkins v McKeithen, </em>395 US 411; <em>People v Gilliam, </em>45 AD2d 744, 37 NY2d 722.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b327-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b327-6\">Kaye, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b327-7\"> In the two appeals before us, elderly victims of crime \u2014 an attempted purse-snatching, and a robbery and burglary \u2014 some days after these incidents, succumbed to heart attacks, having shown no immediate signs of heart trouble. The central issue is whether there was sufficient proof to support the fact-finders\u2019 determinations that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>stress of the incidents was a cause of the fatalities. Concluding that there was sufficient evidence of causal connection, we affirm the adjudication of Anthony M. for juvenile delinquency based on manslaughter, and we reverse the Appellate Division order and reinstate the conviction and sentence of defendant Frank Cable for felony murder, manslaughter and robbery. While our conclusion as to causal connection applies with equal force to Cable\u2019s codefendant, Denise Godbee, she is entitled to a new trial with respect to the homicide charges because in her case the court erroneously refused to charge the affirmative defense to felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">MATTER OF ANTHONY M.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Anthony M., a 12 year old, in the early evening of April 17, 1982, was seen loitering near a subway entrance in midtown Manhattan half an hour before the incident and again observed there, for about five minutes, when two elderly women passed, one of them the 83-year-old victim, Lee Gibson. In a matter of seconds, Anthony crouched behind her, grabbed her handbag and, when Mrs. Gibson would not release the bag, he pulled the strap with such force that she was whirled around, thrown to the sidewalk on her left side, and dragged a short distance, whereupon Anthony let go and disappeared into the subway station. Mrs. Gibson was taken to the hospital, where a fractured left hip and other bruises were diagnosed. She was also that day examined by her cardiologist, Dr. Jerome Zacks, who recommended transfer to another hospital for surgery involving the implantation of a pin in order that she might walk again. In the initial days following the incident, she exhibited no symptoms of heart trouble, despite a medical history that included hypertension, long-standing angina (both believed to be under control), an enlarged heart, arteriosclerosis of the coronary artery and vascular disease. After hip surgery was performed, on April 19, in the second hospital, her condition progressed normally.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">On April 25, Mrs. Gibson developed congestive heart failure, and two days later died of a myocardial infarction.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">At a fact-finding hearing on charges against Anthony involving manslaughter, attempted robbery and assault, three medical experts testified regarding the cause of Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Gibson\u2019s death. The testimony of Dr. Manuel Navarro, Associate Medical Examiner, who had performed the autopsy on April 28,1982, established that the direct cause of Mrs. Gibson\u2019s death was a myocardial infarction, three to five days old. However, he could not with any medical certainty pinpoint the April 17 incident as a cause of the heart attack, nor could the medical witness called by the defense, Dr. Tina Dobsevage, an expert in internal medicine. Both felt;, in substance, that given her general physical condition Mrs. Gibson could well have died at any time even without the stress of the attempted purse-snatching. Dr. Zacks, the cardiologist, while acknowledging that he would not have recommended the hospital transfer and surgery if he perceived an undue risk, and that Mrs. Gibson was doing well postoperatively, expressed the opinion with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the indirect cause of her death was the \u201cstress of a mugging and subsequent fracture of a hip, surgery for that hip fracture, thereafter, pain and anxiety and fear of never being able to walk again while she was in the hospital prior to her sudden \u2014 cardiac arrest * * * [T]he stress precipitated the myocardial infarction with subsequent cardiac arrest and ultimate death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Finding that Anthony had created a substantial and unjustifiable risk when he selected Mrs. Gibson as his victim, that he was heedless of the peril created by his violence, and that his criminal act set in motion the sequence of events that led inexorably to her death, the trial court found that Anthony had committed acts that if done by an adult would constitute the crimes of attempted robbery in the first degree, assault in the first degree, and manslaughter in the second degree, and placed him with the Division for Youth, Title III, for 18 months. The Appellate Division affirmed, without opinion. Only the finding regarding manslaughter is challenged on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">CABLE AND GODBEE</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Arnold Weiner, an 89-year-old retired diamond merchant, and his wife, Anna, on July 23,1980 were robbed in their Manhattan apartment, threatened with a knife, bound, and left lying facedown on their living room floor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Mr. Weiner was also struck in the face. Two days later, he died of a myocardial infarction.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">A man identified as defendant Cable was seen entering the Weiners\u2019 apartment building early in the morning of July 23. His girlfriend, defendant Godbee, who had recently begun work as a maid for the Weiners, followed moments later. Defendants rode up together in the elevator which stopped at the tenth floor, where the Weiners lived. Godbee was admitted to the Weiners\u2019 apartment, but went right out to deliver a newspaper to a neighbor, leaving the apartment door unlocked, as she had done on a prior occasion. When she returned, she discovered that a male intruder (found by the jury to be Cable) had tied up Weiner, and was in the process of tying up Mrs. Weiner. Godbee, according to her statement to the police, started to call for help, but was threatened by the intruder, who proceeded to take several items of jewelry. Mrs. Weiner later awakened to find herself and her husband, both bound, on the living room floor, her husband bleeding from the mouth. She asked Godbee, who was seated in a chair, to call the superintendent, but Godbee said that she had already called the police. Some 20 minutes after he had entered, Cable was seen leaving the building, attempting to hide his face. Several of the items of jewelry were, later that day and the next, sold by Cable.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Weiner that afternoon was taken to Roosevelt Hospital by a neighbor, treated for the cuts and bruises, and returned home. The next day, July 24, he visited his personal physician, Dr. Walter Liebling, complaining of pains in his left lateral lower chest, just above the waistline; no EKG was taken. On July 25 he again complained of not feeling well and spent the day in bed. Late that day, some 56 or 57 hours after the theft, Weiner suffered heart failure and died.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">At the trial of defendants for felony murder, depraved indifference murder, robbery and burglary, Dr. Liebling testified that, despite excess weight and arteriosclerosis, Weiner prior to July 23 was in \u201cgood general health.\u201d During the four years of their relationship, Dr. Liebling had never detected any sign of heart disease in Weiner, and he had no serious illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>While the experts agreed that the direct cause of Weiner\u2019s death was the myocardial infarction, they differed on when the infarction occurred. For the People, Dr. Elliott Gross, Chief Medical Examiner for New York City, who performed the autopsy, testified as a pathology expert that from the color of the infarct and lack of scar tissue, it most likely occurred 44 to 54 hours before death. In his opinion, it was possible for a 90-year-old man who had been burglarized to suffer a mild cardio-infarction that would not show up for two days, but the infarction also could have occurred without any excitement or trauma. Testifying in Godbee\u2019s behalf, Dr. Steven Factor, a specialist in cardiovascular pathology, dated the infarct at 72 to 96 hours before Mr. Weiner\u2019s death \u2014 which would have placed it before the theft \u2014 basing his opinion on the number of white cells and the presence of fibroblasts, or \u201cscavenger\u201d cells, at the periphery of the infarct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Like Dr. Gross, he testified that it was \u201cpossible\u201d that the stress of the robbery led directly to the infarct, but he could not be certain of this, and he further opined that no one could be. Dr. Millard Hyland, Deputy Chief Medical Examiner for Manhattan and Staten Island, testifying on rebuttal as an expert in forensic pathology, from the white cells and absence of fibroblasts, as well as the red blood cells of the clot and the absence of scar tissue, placed the infarct between 36 and 72 hours before death. Moreover, while acknowledging the possibility of other causes, he expressed the opinion with a reasonable degree of medical certainty, as well as commonsense certainty, that the emotional and physical trauma of the burglary caused Weiner\u2019s heart attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Defendants were convicted of felony murder, manslaughter in the second degree, robbery in the first and second degrees, and burglary in the second degree. The Appellate Division, two Justices dissenting, reversed the convictions for felony murder, manslaughter and robbery in the first degree, and dismissed the charges underlying them.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">In both appeals, defendants urge \u2014 as the Appellate Division majority concluded in <em>Cable </em>and <em>Godbee </em>\u2014 that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>the necessary causal connection between offense and myocardial infarction was insufficiently established. Measured by a standard of \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d <em>(Jackson v Virginia, </em>443 US 307, 319; see, also, <em>People u Contes, </em>60 NY2d 620, 621), we believe that there was sufficient evidence to support the finding of causation made at the trial level.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">For criminal liability to attach, a defendant\u2019s actions must have been an actual contributory cause of death, in the sense that they \u201cforged a link in the chain of causes which actually brought about the death\u201d <em>(People v Stewart, </em>40 NY2d 692, 697). \u201cAn obscure or a merely probable connection between an assault and death will, as in every case of alleged crime, require acquittal of the charge of any degree of homicide\u201d <em>(People v Brengard, </em>265 NY 100, 108). A defendant\u2019s acts need not be the sole cause of death; where the necessary causative link is established, other causes, such as a victim\u2019s preexisting condition, will not relieve the defendant of responsibility for homicide (see <em>People v Kane, </em>213 NY 260, 273). By the same token, death need.not follow on the heels of injury. Even an intervening, independent agency will not exonerate defendant unless \u201cthe,death is solely attributable to the secondary agency, and not at all induced by the primary one\u201d <em>(People v Kane, </em>213 NY 260, 270, <em>supra). </em>An injury may trigger immediate measurable deterioration and a gradual process of dying for which defendant is responsible <em>(People v Brengard, </em>265 NY 100, 104-105, <em>supra; </em>see, also, <em>People v Roberts, </em>73 AD2d 954), but that is not to say that a victim who evidences no immediate decline cannot just as surely have been set by defendant\u2019s acts on a certain course to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Though sometimes perceptible to lay witnesses (see <em>People v Brengard, </em>265 NY 100, 105, <em>supra), </em>the progression from injury to death, often unseen and not readily comprehended, will generally be a subject for expert medical opinion. To establish a causal connection, conclusions which are only \u201ccontingent, speculative, or merely possible\u201d (M<em>atter of Burris v Lewis, 2 </em>NY2d 323, 327) will not suffice, but neither is absolute certainty and the exclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>of every other possibility required. While in both cases other possible causes of the heart attacks suffered by the elderly victims were not eliminated, the medical evidence, viewed from the perspective enunciated in <em>Jackson, </em>supported the fact-finders\u2019 determinations that defendants\u2019 acts were at least a contributing cause of both fatalities. In <em>Anthony M., </em>the medical evidence connected the stress of the fall and fractured hip to the consequent stresses and fears of immobility, pain and surgery to correct the condition caused by the fall, leading to cardiac arrest and ultimate death. Similarly, in <em>Cable </em>and <em>Godbee, </em>there was proof in the medical evidence to support the jury determination that the stress arising from defendants\u2019 acts was a cause of the infarction that manifested itself two days later. In neither instance was the testimony of the medical expert that there was a causal link so baseless or riddled with contradiction that it was unworthy of belief as a matter of law (see <em>People v Stewart, </em>40 NY2d 692, 699, <em>supra; People v Ledwon, </em>153 NY 10) and, despite contrary medical opinion, the jury was entitled to accept this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Godbee and Anthony M. raise several additional issues with respect to sufficiency of the evidence and fairness of the trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Anthony M. argues that, regardless of causation, there was insufficient proof that he possessed the necessary mental state for manslaughter. We disagree. Viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, there was sufficient proof in the circumstances of the incident for the fact-finder to conclude that Anthony was aware of and consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that death would result from his actions. (See <em>People v Heinsohn, </em>61 NY2d 855; Penal Law, \u00a7 125.15, subd 1.) The evidence shows that Anthony made a careful, conscious choice when, after a period of watching and waiting in front of the subway station, he marked as his intended victim a greyhaired, five-foot, two-inch, elderly woman, obviously selected from the passing crowd because of her condition, as the easiest prey. We must agree with the courts below that having sought out such a victim, Anthony is to be held responsible for the unusual peril he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>created to her when he tugged at her purse strap with such force that she was whirled around and thrown to the ground, and then briefly dragged by him along the pavement.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">As to Godbee\u2019s contention that the evidence at most showed her \u201cguilty knowledge and negative acquiescence,\u201d and thus was legally insufficient to convict her, as an accessory, of robbery, burglary and felony murder, we agree with the Appellate Division that the evidence was sufficient to justify the jury\u2019s conclusion that she was an accessory. Viewed in the light most favorable to the People <em>(People v Malizia, </em>62 NY2d 755, 757; <em>People v Kennedy, </em>47 NY2d 196, 203; <em>People v Benzinger, </em>36 NY2d 29, 32), the evidence demonstrated that she intentionally aided Cable in the conduct constituting the offense (Penal Law, \u00a7 20.00): Godbee and Cable, her boyfriend, arrived in the building at approximately the same early morning hour and rode up in the elevator, which stopped at the Weiners\u2019 floor; she left the Weiners\u2019 door unlatched, and on finding an intruder in the apartment failed to alert the superintendent or doorman, who might have stopped an intruder leaving the building, but instead called the police, thus affording Cable an opportunity to escape; she gave the police a misleading description of Cable, and thereafter moved without leaving a forwarding address. That each act could, viewed separately, perhaps be subject to an innocent explanation does not at this juncture entitle Godbee to upset the jury\u2019s finding that she intentionally aided Cable in the commission of robbery, burglary and felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Although the evidence against Godbee was sufficient, we agree, for the reasons stated by the Appellate Division, that the trial court erred in refusing to charge the affirmative defense to felony murder. We cannot disregard this error. The jury convicted Godbee of reckless manslaughter (as a lesser included offense of depraved indifference murder), thereby demonstrating its acceptance of the People\u2019s contention that Godbee caused the victim\u2019s death by soliciting, requesting, commanding, importuning or intentionally aiding Cable to engage in such conduct (Penal Law, \u00a7 20.00). This verdict would have been unreconcilable with acquittal of felony murder based on the affirmative defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>because, to establish the affirmative defense, Godbee had to prove that she did not solicit, request, command, importune, cause or aid the commission. of the homicide act (Penal Law, \u00a7 125.25, subd 3, par [a]). Nevertheless, as a practical matter, by erroneously refusing to give the charge the court divested Godbee\u2019s counsel of any reason to argue that, while she may have aided in the robbery, Godbee did not participate in the acts causing the victim\u2019s death. Success on this issue, absent submission of the affirmative defense to which Godbee was entitled, would have been an empty victory since she would still have been convicted of felony murder. Consequently, an acquittal on depraved indifference murder or its lesser included offenses could not have benefited Godbee in terms of the sentence imposed. Had counsel been given the opportunity to argue the affirmative defense, as he should have been, we cannot say the jury would have reached the conclusion it did regarding Godbee\u2019s complicity in the acts causing the victim\u2019s death. Although this error would on the law entitle Godbee to a new trial on the felony murder count, since the Appellate Division has not yet passed on the facts the order for a new trial must await that court\u2019s review of the facts. Furthermore, since the jury\u2019s acceptance of the affirmative defense to felony murder would have required an acquittal of reckless manslaughter, the erroneous failure to give the instruction would on the law require a new trial on that charge as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Finally, Godbee contends that it was reversible error for the trial court to have denied her request for an adjournment, made both during and at the conclusion of Dr. Hyland\u2019s testimony, so that she could \u201cbe in a position to secure\u201d another expert witness in surrebuttal. The court rejected the request, on the basis that it came at \u201cthe nth hour\u201d after \u201cample opportunity\u201d and that such testimony would be purely cumulative, each side having already produced two medical expert witnesses on the issue of causation. The granting of an adjournment for any purpose is a matter resting within the sound discretion of the trial court <em>(People v Singleton, </em>41 NY2d 402, 405; <em>People v Oskroba, </em>305 NY 113, 117). Here, no surrebuttal witness was identified, the Trial Judge\u2019s expressed concern that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>the proposed medical testimony would be only cumulative was not addressed, and no showing was made that the proof would be material and favorable to the defense (see <em>People v Singleton, </em>41 NY2d 402, 406, <em>supra; </em>and <em>People v Foy, </em>32 NY2d 473, 478). On this record, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion as a matter of law by denying the adjournment, or by denying Godbee\u2019s request to present another expert witness in surrebuttal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Accordingly, in <em>Matter of Anthony M., </em>the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed. In <em>People v Cable </em>and <em>Godbee, </em>the orders of the Appellate Division, insofar as appealed from, should be reversed, the convictions and sentences for felony murder, second degree manslaughter and first degree robbery reinstated, and the case remitted to the Appellate Division, First Department, for consideration of the facts (CPL 470.25, subd 2, par [d]; 470.40, subd 2, par [b]). As to defendant Godbee, in view of the charge error described above, unless the Appellate Division on consideration of the facts dismisses the felony murder charge against her, that court is directed to reverse God-bee\u2019s felony murder conviction and order a new trial on that count. As to Godbee\u2019s manslaughter conviction, since manslaughter was submitted as a lesser included offense of depraved indifference murder, on which the jury acquitted, unless the Appellate Division dismisses her manslaughter conviction on its review of the facts, the court should vacate her second degree manslaughter conviction, without prejudice to an application by the People for leave to resubmit to a Grand Jury the facts upon which that conviction was based (see <em>People v Mayo, </em>48 NY2d 245, 253).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-7\">. It was stipulated that Dr. Geeben Natarajan, Deputy Medical Examiner of New Jersey, would have given the same testimony as Dr. Factor, for defendant Cable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b336-7\">. [4] Godbee\u2019s contention in this court is not so much that the evidence was improper rebuttal, particularly since (a) it responded to the scientific observations given by the defense expert; (b) permitting testimony, even if not technically rebuttal, was not shown to have been an abuse of discretion (CPL 260.30, subd 7; see, also, <em>People v Harris, </em>57 NY2d 335, 345-346, cert den 460.US 1047); and (c) no objection was asserted on the basis of improper rebuttal until the\" witness had completed direct, cross and redirect examination, when a motion to strike was made (see Richardson, Evidence [Prince, 10th ed], \u00a7 537, p 529). Godbee\u2019s contention \u2014 which we reject \u2014 is that since the prosecution was allowed rebuttal, the defense had an absolute right under CPL 260.30 (subd 7) to present surrebuttal testimony in the person of another medical witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Meyer, J.</p>\n<p id=\"ANf\">(dissenting in part). Respectfully I dissent from so much of the majority opinion as holds that denial of the request by defendants Godbee and Cable that they be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>granted a continuance to call a surrebuttal witness was not error. I would, therefore, grant a new trial in their case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">At the conclusion of Dr. Hyland\u2019s direct testimony, defendant Godbee\u2019s attorney asked for a 10-minute recess, stating \u201cThis witness came in and testified what other doctors consistently denied.\u201d When the recess was over and before the jury returned, the Trial Judge asked whether the attorney had an application. Told that there would be \u201cno application at this time,\u201d the Judge responded, \u201cYou propose to have an application for a continuance to allow you to bring in another expert witness, isn\u2019t that it?\u201d, and, receiving a positive response, rejoined, \u201cWell I will tell you now that I deny it * * * I consider it cumulative. You have had ample opportunity. We are at the nth hour, that\u2019s it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Upon completion of the cross-examination the jury was sent to lunch. At that point defendant Godbee\u2019s attorney asked for \u201ca continuance until tomorrow morning so that we can be in a position to secure other testimony.\u201d Again the request was denied as \u201cfruitless and cumulative in essence\u201d. Counsel then moved for a mistrial, noting that the information about which the rebuttal witness might testify had not been disclosed to him prior to the witness being called and that the rebuttal testimony \u201cwas substantially different from that of all the other three experts\u201d. He asked that \u201cunder the circumstances, we should be given an opportunity to\u201d, only to be cut off in midsentence by the Judge\u2019s interjection, \u201cYou propose to protract this indefinitely?\u201d On return from luncheon recess counsel moved to strike Dr. Hyland\u2019s testimony, pointing out that because he was \u201cthe first doctor, indeed, to testify as to ascertaining medically reasonably certain connection between the alleged incident, the cause of death, that his testimony was more properly elicited on direct examination.\u201d That motion too was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The original objection made clear that Dr. Hyland had testified to what the other doctors had consistently denied and thus went beyond the scope of proper rebuttal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>same point was made in relation to the motion for a mistrial and the motion to strike. It was, of course, within the Trial Judge\u2019s discretion, under the last sentence of CPL 260.30 (subd 7), to permit the People \u201cto offer evidence upon rebuttal which is not technically of a rebuttal nature but more properly a part of [their] original case.\u201d But under the first sentence of that subdivision when the People offer evidence in rebuttal of the defense evidence, \u201cthe defendant may then offer evidence in rebuttal of the people\u2019s rebuttal\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">True, as noted in the majority\u2019s footnote 2, Godbee\u2019s attorney\u2019s request was for a continuance until the next morning \u201cso that we can be in a position to secure other testimony\u201d, but Dr. Hyland\u2019s evidence being before the jury, counsel was not obligated to move to strike as improper rebuttal rather than se\u00e9k a continuance in order to produce counter testimony. And it being clear that defense counsel had not been advised prior to Dr. Hyland\u2019s appearance what he would testify about, they cannot be faulted for not having a witness immediately available and, therefore, requesting an overnight continuance instead of \u201cthe opportunity to present a particular witness in surrebuttal\u201d (as the majority\u2019s n 2 suggests) if, indeed, that was not what would have been said had counsel been permitted to complete his request that \u201cunder the circumstances, we should be given an opportunity to\u201d (cf. <em>People v De Jesus, </em>42 NY2d 519, 526).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">In sum, even if the right given a defendant by the first sentence of CPL 260.30 (subd 7) to present surrebuttal testimony after prosecution rebuttal which goes beyond the proper scope of rebuttal be considered as a matter within the Trial Judge\u2019s discretion, \u201cif there is a flagrant abuse of this discretion, the wrong may be redressed upon appeal\u201d (Richardson, Evidence [Prince, 10th ed], \u00a7 459, p 450). And since \u201cFew rights are more fundamental than that Of an accused to present witnesses in his own defense\u201d <em>(Chambers v Mississippi, </em>410 US 284, 302) and \u201cmere inconvenience is not sufficient ground for denying an adjournment when to do so would abridge a basic right\u201d <em>(People v Foy, </em>32 NY2d 473, 477), I have no hesitancy in concluding, particularly in light of the close and difficult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>medical question presented to the jury and the prior equivocal medical testimony, that denial to defense counsel under the circumstances of this case of an overnight adjournment (a loss of about three hours court time) was, though not \u201cactuated by any improper motive\u201d, an \u201cabuse of discretion, in a legal sense * * * [and] a plain error of law\u201d <em>(Meyer v Cullen, </em>54 NY 392, 397).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">In <em>Matter of Anthony M.: </em>Order affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Jasen, Jones, Wachtler, Meyer and Simons concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\"><em>In People v Cable </em>and <em>Godbee: </em>Orders insofar as appealed from reversed, convictions and sentences for felony murder, second degree manslaughter and first degree robbery reinstated and case remitted to the Appellate Division, First Department, for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Jasen, Jones, Wachtler and Simons concur with Judge Kaye; Judge Meyer dissents in part and votes to reverse and order a new trial as to both defendants in a separate opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-8\">. Although before us only Godbee has briefed the point, defendant Cable\u2019s attorney joined in the requests for continuance, for a mistrial, and to strike Dr. Hyland\u2019s testimony. A new trial should, therefore, be had as to both defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b337-9\">. The People\u2019s reply brief concedes that \u201cportions of Dr. Hyland\u2019s testimony were more properly part of the People\u2019s direct case\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
