West (West) appeals from the Twentieth Judicial District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence. We affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\u00b62 West was charged with Criminal Sale of Dangerous Drugs, Criminal Possession with Intent to Sell, Criminal Possession of Dangerous Drugs (two counts), and Use or Possession of Property Subject to Criminal Forfeiture. These charges arose out of an incident in which West was arrested in conjunction with the execution of a search warrant on his property near Hot Springs, Sanders County, Montana. Sanders County Attorney Robert Slomski had prepared an initial application for a search warrant. However, due to computer difficulties, he was unable to retrieve the document from his computer disc. Accordingly, Slomski requested assistance from Lake Deputy County Attorney, Mitchell Young. Judge C. B. McNeil, who presides over both Lake and Sanders Counties, resides in Poison and was more accessible to Young. Judge McNeil, based upon application from Young, issued the warrant authorizing a search of West\u2019s residence in Sanders County.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">\u00b63 West moved to suppress all evidence seized as a result of the warrant contending that Lake Deputy County Attorney Young, who prepared and filed the application for the warrant, had no authority to apply for a warrant to be executed in Sanders County. The District Court, the Honorable Michael C. Prezeau presiding, denied the motion holding that, even if there were a violation of statutory authority, the alleged violation did not affect West\u2019s substantial rights. West entered a plea of guilty pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 46-20-104 and 46-12-204(3), MCA, reserving his right to appeal from the order denying his motion to suppress. We agree with the District Court\u2019s analysis in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">\u00b64  We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law regarding a motion to suppress to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>State v. Pipkin, </em>1998 MT 143, \u00b6 10, [289 Mont. 240], 961 P.2d 733, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">\u00b65  West argues that only certain individuals are authorized by law to make application for search warrants. He references \u00a7 46-5-220, MCA, which provides: \u201cA peace officer, <em>the </em>city or county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>attorney, or the attorney general may apply for a search warrant.\u201d Section 46-5-220, MCA (emphasis added). West contends that when the statute states <em>\u201cthe </em>county attorney,\u201d it means the county attorney in <em>the </em>county where the warrant is to be executed. Thus, he argues that Deputy Lake County Attorney Young had no authority to apply for a search warrant to be executed in Sanders County. He suggests that Deputy Lake County Attorney Young is nothing more than a \u201cprivate person\u201d outside of Lake County. We need not address the question of whether a deputy county attorney from one county has authority to apply for a search warrant to be executed in another county. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that there is merit to this argument, the error does not affect the substantial rights of the person whose property is searched. A search and seizure, whether with or without a warrant, may not be held illegal if any irregularity in the proceeding has no effect on the substantial rights of the accused. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-5-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u00b66 In denying West\u2019s motion to suppress, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aek\">When law enforcement officers go through the considerable effort to secure a search warrant, only to be told later that the search was invalid for some nonsubstantive reason having nothing to do with the existence or nonexistence of probable cause, there is an unfortunate and natural tendency for them to next time search for an exception to the warrant requirement that would allow them to proceed without submitting the proposed search for advance judicial scrutiny and subsequent legal hair splitting over what is contained within the four corners of the application and warrant. The law has a strong preference for search warrants, and that preference is subverted by niggling scrutiny of every word and phrase.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFJ\">\u00b67 The Montana Constitution is very specific as to the requirements for a valid search. \u201cNo warrant to search any place, or seize any person or thing shall issue without describing the place to be searched or the person or thing to be seized, or without probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation reduced to writing.\u201d Art. II, Sec. 11, Mont. Const. West does not allege that the warrant was deficient in any of these particulars. He does not contend that the warrant lacked a description of the place to be searched; nor does he contend that there was a lack of probable cause or that the application was not made under oath. As the District Court noted, West does not suggest that Judge McNeil would not have issued the search warrant had the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>act same application been signed by Sanders County Attorney Slomski instead of Deputy Lake County Attorney Young.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">\u00b68 We recently addressed the question of whether the exclusionary rule should be automatically applied where there is a technical violation of a statutory requirement in <em>Pipkin. </em>In <em>Pipkin, </em>the officer\u2019s name was inadvertently omitted from the caption line of the search warrant in violation of \u00a7 46-5-223, MCA. Pipkin also claimed that the search warrant had not been served by the police officer named in the search warrant, as required by \u00a7 46-5-226, MCA. <em>Pipkin, </em>\u00b6 7. There were no other statutory or constitutional infirmities alleged. <em>Pipkin, </em>\u00b6 1. The district court adopted a <em>per se </em>application of the exclusionary rule for procedural violations. In reversing, we noted that we have refused to automatically invoke the exclusionary rule. Rather, we engage in a case-by-case analysis to determine whether the alleged error affects the accused\u2019s substantial rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">[T]he public policy of this state is to encourage law enforcement officers to seek prior judicial approval before conducting searches, and conduct those searches pursuant to search warrants. Therefore, technical attacks on warrants must be dealt with in a realistic manner. The correct approach is to analyze the facts and circumstances of each case to determine whether the irregularity in procedure has had an affect on the substantial rights of the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A38\"><em>Pipkin, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">\u00b69 In <em>Pipkin, </em>we concluded that the alleged violations did not affect Pipkin\u2019s substantial rights. Likewise, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>we hold that the fact that the application for the warrant was signed by a deputy Lake County Attorney rather than by the Sanders County Attorney did not affect West\u2019s substantial rights under Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution, which guarantees that warrants not issue unless they describe the place to be searched or the person or thing to be seized, are based on probable cause, and are supported by oath or affirmation reduced to writing. The decision of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b458-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE , JUSTICES HUNT, REGNIER and GRAY concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
