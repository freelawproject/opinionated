Bett filed a petition for dissolution of marriage in the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County. On June 28, 1996, Ian\u2019s wife, Patricia M. Carr, filed a divorce complaint in a Wyoming district court. On October 30,1996, the Wyoming court issued a decree of divorce and judgment to Patricia by default. On January 21,1997, Patricia filed the Wyoming judgment with the Gallatin County District Court. She then moved for summary judgment in Ian\u2019s Montana dissolution proceeding. Subsequently, Ian moved to set aside the Wyoming judgment filed by Patricia in the Gallatin County District Court. On April 11,1997, the District Court issued two orders, one granting Patricia\u2019s motion for summary judgment in the dissolution proceeding, and another denying Ian\u2019s motion to set aside the Wyoming judgment. Ian now appeals from both the order granting Patricia summary judgment in the dissolution proceeding and the order denying his motion to set aside the Wyoming judgment in the case where the Wyoming judgment was transcribed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">\u00b63 1. Did Ian Bett file his notices of appeal in a timely manner?</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">\u00b64 2. Did Ian Bett file the proper motion under the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure to set aside the foreign judgment filed in the District Court?</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err when it denied Ian Bett\u2019s motion to set aside the Wyoming judgment filed in the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County?</p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">\u00b66 Patricia M. Carr and Ian M. Bett were married in Driggs, Idaho, on November 18,1991. They lived a rather bohemian lifestyle, traveling throughout the West in a camper while Ian worked as a sales representative for a company. They also lived apart at times. Sometime in 1993, they separated but maintained contact. In August, 1993, Patricia moved to Jackson, Wyoming and Ian moved to Bozeman, Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>\u00b67 On March 17,1995, Ian filed a petition for dissolution of marriage in the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County (Cause No. 95-120, Gallatin). More then a year later, on July 9,1996, Patricia was served in Jackson, Wyoming, with a summons and petition of Ian\u2019s cause of action filed in Montana. She filed an answer to this petition on August 2,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u00b68 On June 28, 1996, before being served with process of Ian\u2019s Montana action, Patricia filed a complaint seeking a decree of divorce in the District Court of Teton County, Ninth Judicial District, in Jackson, Wyoming. Ian was served in Bozeman, Montana, with a copy of the summons and complaint of the Wyoming action on August 21, 1996. Ian did not respond to the summons and complaint, and on October 30,1996, a decree of divorce and judgment against Ian and in favor of Patricia was entered in the Wyoming action. The Wyoming divorce decree dissolved Ian and Patricia\u2019s marriage in Wyoming and awarded Patricia $95,000 as her share of the marital assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u00b69 On January 21,1997, Patricia filed an authenticated copy of the Wyoming decree and judgment with the Gallatin County Clerk of Court pursuant to the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act, \u00a7\u00a7 25-9-501 through -508, MCA, (Cause No. 97-22, Gallatin). On January 22, 1997, Patricia filed a motion for summary judgment seeking to dismiss Ian\u2019s petition for dissolution of marriage. On February 10,1997, Ian filed a motion to set aside the Wyoming judgment. This motion, however, was not filed in the case where the Wyoming judgment was transcribed (Cause No. 97-22, Gallatin), but in the case where he filed his petition for dissolution (Cause No. 95-120, Gallatin).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\u00b610 The District Court heard oral argument on Patricia\u2019s motion for summary judgment on February 27,1997. During the oral argument, Patricia questioned whether Ian properly filed his motion to set aside the Wyoming decree and judgment in the same cause of action as his petition for dissolution of marriage. Thereafter, on February 28,1997, Ian filed a motion to set aside the Wyoming decree and judgment in the cause of action wherein it had been transcribed in Montana by Patricia (Cause No. 97-22, Gallatin).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">\u00b611 On April 11,1997, the District Court ruled in favor of Patricia\u2019s motion for summary judgment in Ian\u2019s Montana action, resulting in its dismissal. On the same day, the court entered an order denying Ian\u2019s motion to have the Wyoming judgment set aside. In both cases, notice of entry of judgment was filed on April 15, 1997. On April 29, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>1997, Ian filed motions to alter or amend judgment pursuant to Rule 59(g), M.R.Civ.P., in each case. Both motions were denied by the District Court on May 19, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">\u00b612 On May 30,1997, Ian filed notices of appeal. In Case No. 97-311 (Cause No. 95-120, Gallatin), Ian appeals the order of the District Court granting Patricia\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissing Ian\u2019s petition for dissolution of marriage. In Case No. 97-310 (Cause No. 97-22, Gallatin), Ian appeals the order of the District Court denying his motion to set aside the Wyoming decree and judgment. \u00b613 On June 11,1997, Patricia filed motions with this Court to dismiss both appeals, Case Nos. 97-310 and 97-311. On June 25, 1997, Ian filed a motion to consolidate Case Nos. 97-310 and 97-311. On July 2, 1997, we issued two separate orders. First, we granted Ian\u2019s motion to consolidate, and Case No. 97-310 was consolidated with Case No. 97-311 for purposes of this appeal. In the second July 2, 1997, order, we reserved ruling on Patricia\u2019s motions to dismiss and took her motions under advisement. We ordered both parties to include arguments and authority on their respective positions regarding Patricia\u2019s motions to dismiss the appeals in their briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\u00b614 On November 6,1997, after initial briefing of the appeal by the parties, this Court raised the issue of whether \u00a7 25-9-503, MCA, was constitutional in light of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, Article IV, Section 1, of the United States Constitution. We ordered supplemental briefing by both parties on this issue and stated that an oral argument would be scheduled at a later date. Also, because a decision in this case may implicate the constitutionality of \u00a7 25-9-503, MCA, we named the Montana Attorney General a party to this proceeding and invited the State to file a brief and present a separate oral argument. \u00b615 On December 4,1997, Ian moved this Court for a suspension of proceedings. In the Wyoming District Court, Ian had filed a motion to set aside the Wyoming judgment. On December 9,1997, we granted the motion on the grounds that further proceedings regarding this case were being held in Wyoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\u00b616 On December 30, 1997, the District Court of Teton County, Ninth Judicial District, in Jackson, Wyoming, denied Ian\u2019s request to set aside the default judgment obtained by Patricia on October 30, 1996. Ian did not appeal this decision of the Wyoming court and the default judgment is now final.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">\u00b617 Did Ian Bett file his notices of appeal in a timely manner?</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>\u00b618 At the time Ian filed his motions to alter or amend and his subsequent notices of appeal, Rule 5(a), M.R.App.R, provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\">(1) In civil cases the notice of appeal required by Rule 4 shall be filed with the clerk of the district court within 30 days from the date of the entry of the judgment or order appealed from, except that in cases where service of notice of entry of judgment is required by Rule 77(d) of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure the time shall be 30 days from the service of notice of entry of judgment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">(4) If a timely motion under the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure is filed in the district court by any party: (i) for judgment under Rule 50(b); (ii) under Rule 52(b) to amend or make additional findings of fact, whether or not an alteration of the judgment would be required if the motion is granted; (iii) under Rule 59 to alter or amend the judgment; or (iv) under Rule 59 for a new trial, the time for appeal for all parties shall run from the entry of the order denying a new trial or granting or denying any other such motion....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aj6\">\u00b619  In her motions to dismiss Ian\u2019s appeals, Patricia makes two different arguments. First, Patricia contends that both of Ian\u2019s motions to alter and amend judgment were, in substance, motions for reconsideration. If, as Patricia claims, Ian\u2019s motions are, in fact, motions for reconsideration, the motions would not toll the time for filing of an appeal under Rule 5(a)(4), M.R.App.P. Therefore, Patricia argues that Ian\u2019s notices of appeals were not timely filed since they were filed more than thirty days after the notice of entry of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">\u00b620 Patricia relies on <em>Miller v. Herbert </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 132, 900 P.2d 273, to argue that Ian\u2019s motions to alter or amend judgment should be considered motions for reconsideration that do not extend the time allowed for filing an appeal. First, she contends that Ian offers no new facts, and no new evidence or new law in support of his motions. The arguments that Ian presents, Patricia claims, are the same arguments previously submitted to the District Court. Second, Patricia argues that Ian\u2019s motions are not Rule 59(g) motions because they ask the District Court to completely reverse its earlier orders rather than request the court to alter or amend its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">\u00b621 Ian counters that both his motions were legitimate Rule 59(g) motions to alter or amend judgment. Ian states that in both his motions and briefs, he pointed out to the District Court that it had com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>pletely ignored one of his main arguments. Ian claims that rather than asking the court to reconsider its decision, he was requesting that the court consider the merits of his argument regarding the propriety of the default judgment issued by the Wyoming court. Ian argues that his Rule 59(g) motions are not motions for reconsideration as defined in <em>Miller. </em>Finally, Ian states that in the context of altering or amending the District Court\u2019s decision, the only possible option available to the court was a complete reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\u00b622 In <em>Miller, </em>this Court was faced with whether a motion that was entitled \u201cmotion for reconsideration\u201d was, in fact, a Rule 59(g) motion to alter or amend judgment that tolled the time for the filing of a notice of appeal. We stated that \u201c[w]e shall look to the substance of a motion, not just its title, to identify what motion has been presented.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>272 Mont. at 136, 900 P.2d at 275. We held that a motion for reconsideration may be equated to a motion to alter or amend a judgment in limited circumstances where the motion \u201ccontain[s] statements or allegations demonstrating that such motion is the equivalent to a motion to amend or a motion to alter a judgment.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>272 Mont, at 136, 900 P.2d at 275. This Court further elaborated on when a motion for reconsideration would be construed substantively as a motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59(g) in <em>Nelson v. Driscoll </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 355, 948 P.2d 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\u00b623 Patricia\u2019s reliance on <em>Miller </em>to argue that this Court should look at the substance of Ian\u2019s motions to determine whether they properly are Rule 59(g) motions is misplaced. Neither <em>Miller </em>nor <em>Nelson </em>held that when a Rule 59(g) motion is titled \u201cmotion to alter or amend judgment,\u201d a court may look beyond the title of the motion to determine whether it is in substance a motion to alter or amend. In both <em>Miller </em>and <em>Nelson, </em>the pleadings had been incorrectly labeled motions for reconsideration and we held that they would be construed as motions to alter or amend judgment in order to save this Court\u2019s jurisdiction over the appeals. We have never denied jurisdiction in any case based on a post-trial motion that had been properly labeled but did not include substantive language in support of its label.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">\u00b624 [2] We reject Patricia\u2019s argument that this Court should look beyond the title of a Rule 59(g) motion and analyze the substance of the motion in order to determine whether the motion is, in fact, a proper Rule 59(g) motion. To do so would mean that a party who has filed a Rule 59(g) motion with a district court would never be confident that it fell within the framework of Rule 59. There would always be a loom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>ing possibility that the subsequent appeal could be dismissed by this Court when asked to examine the substance of the motion under our judicial microscope. We, therefore, hold that when a party has identified and titled a motion as one to alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59(g), this Court is not going to analyze the substance of the motion to see if it comes under the definition of a motion to alter or amend.</p>\n<p id=\"A7O\">\u00b625  As stated above, on April 11, 1997, the District Court entered one order granting Patricia\u2019s motion for summary judgment and another order denying Ian\u2019s motion to set aside the foreign judgment. In both cases, a notice of entry of judgment was filed on April 15,1997. On April 29,1997, Ian filed a Rule 59(g) motion in each case. Both were labeled \u201cmotion to alter or amend judgment.\u201d On May 19 1997, the District Court denied both motions to alter or amend judgment. On May 30,1997, Ian filed his notices of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\u00b626 Under Rule 59(g), Ian was required to file his motions to alter or amend judgment within ten days after service of the notice of the entry of the judgment. We determine that Ian\u2019s motions to alter or amend judgment were timely filed. Under Rule 5(a)(4), M.R.App.P., Ian had thirty days after the denial of his motions to alter or amend judgment to file his notices of appeal. In this case, the court denied both motions on May 19,1997, and Ian filed his notices of appeal on May 30, 1997. Thus, we conclude that Ian\u2019s notices of appeal were timely filed in both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">\u00b627  Furthermore, we conclude that Ian\u2019s Rule 59(g) motions were appropriate in seeking a complete reversal of the District Court\u2019s decisions. In this case, Ian asked the court to alter or amend the judgment by setting aside the Wyoming judgment. If the District Court granted Ian\u2019s request, the judgment would have been set aside and summary judgment would not have been granted in the dissolution proceeding. There were no other options available to the District Court to partially alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(g) and the relief requested. Therefore, we determine that Ian\u2019s Rule 59(g) motions were appropriate in seeking a reversal of the court\u2019s earlier decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">\u00b628 Did Ian Bett file the proper motion under the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure to set aside the foreign judgment filed in the District Court?</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">\u00b629 Whereas above we addressed Patricia\u2019s argument about the substance of Ian\u2019s Rule 59(g) motions, we now discuss Patricia\u2019s argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>ment regarding the timing of Ian\u2019s Rule 59(g) motion filed in Cause 97-22 (Case 97-310), the Wyoming judgment transcribed in Montana. Patricia again argues that Ian\u2019s motion to alter or amend judgment was not timely and, therefore, the time for filing a notice of appeal was not extended. Patricia states that in order for Ian\u2019s Rule 59(g) motion to be considered timely filed, it must have been filed within ten days of any judgment, or notice of entry of judgment. However, it is unclear whether Patricia is arguing that the ten day period for filing a Rule 59(g) motion begins to run on October 30, 1996, the day judgment was entered by the Wyoming District Court, or on January 21, 1997, when the Wyoming judgment was transcribed in the Montana District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">\u00b630 In either case, Patricia asserts that Ian\u2019s Rule 59(g) motion is untimely because it is not related to the District Court\u2019s April 11, 1997, order denying his Rule 60(b) motion to set aside the Wyoming judgment. Rather, Patricia states that Ian\u2019s Rule 59(g) motion refers directly to the Wyoming judgment itself. Thus, Patricia argues that Ian\u2019s Rule 59(g) motion was untimely because it was not filed within ten days after the judgment was entered by the Wyoming District Court or when the Wyoming judgment was transcribed in the Montana District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">\u00b631  We determine that Patricia\u2019s argument does not clearly represent Ian\u2019s Rule 59(g) motion in Cause 97-22/Case 97-310 or the proceedings below in the District Court. Ian\u2019s motion to alter or amend judgment filed on April 29,1997, clearly states that he seeks to alter or amend the order and memorandum issued by the District Court on April 11,1997. He goes on to state that his reasons for his motion are the court failed to consider all the issues presented by the parties, and the court\u2019s memorandum and order are erroneous as a matter of law. Ian\u2019s motion was supported by a brief filed on May 6,1997. Although, in essence, Ian is seeking to alter or amend the Wyoming judgment, we conclude that Ian\u2019s Rule 59(g) motion is related to the District Court\u2019s April 11,1997, order and thus was timely made. Furthermore, Patricia\u2019s argument ignores the fact that a Rule 60(b) motion is the appropriate motion to file to seek review of a foreign judgment filed in a Montana district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\u00b632 Moreover, we conclude that a Rule 59(g) motion would not be the appropriate motion to make in challenging a foreign judgment filed in Montana. In Montana, Rule 59(g) motions are commonly made after the entry of a judgment by a Montana district court by either one or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>both of the parties that appeared before the court. On the other hand, Rule 60(b) sets forth numerous circumstances in which a district court may relieve a party from a final judgment, order, or proceeding. We agree with Ian and the practice in other states that a Rule 60(b) motion is the appropriate motion to file in order to seek review of or relief from a foreign judgment. <em>See, e.g., Marworth, Inc. v. McGuire </em>(Colo. 1991), 810 P.2d 653; <em>Data Management Systems, Inc. v. EDP Corp. </em>(Utah 1985), 709 P.2d 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u00b633  Therefore, we hold that Ian\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion and his Rule 59(g) motion, as they relate to the proceeding involving the Wyoming judgment filed in Montana, were both appropriate and timely filed. Under Rule 60(b)(1), M.R.Civ.P., a party that asserts excusable neglect as a reason for relief from a final judgment has sixty days after the judgment was entered to file a Rule 60(b) motion. As discussed above, Ian filed a Rule 60(b) motion to set aside the foreign judgment filed in Montana within sixty days after Patricia recorded the Wyoming judgment. After briefing by both parties and a hearing, the District Court ruled against him on April 11, 1997. Notice of entry of judgment was filed on April 15,1997. Ian then filed a motion to alter or amend that judgment within the ten-day period prescribed by Rule 59(g). We conclude that this motion was related to the District Court\u2019s April 15, 1997, order. After the District Court denied the motion on May 19, 1997, Ian filed bis notice of appeal on May 30, 1997, well within the thirty-day time period prescribed by Rule 5, M.R.App.P. Thus, we conclude that Ian\u2019s Rule 59(g) motion was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">\u00b634 Did the District Court err when it denied Ian\u2019s motion to set aside the Wyoming judgment filed in the Eighteenth Judicial District Court?</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">\u00b635  At first, we note that the District Court entered summary judgment against Ian as a matter of law. The District Court\u2019s decision was based on its conclusion that the Wyoming court had personal jurisdiction over Ian and on the court\u2019s related April 11,1997, order denying Ian\u2019s motion to set aside the Wyoming judgment in Montana. On appeal, Ian challenges the District Court\u2019s failure to set aside the Wyoming judgment filed in Montana. Our standard of review relating to conclusions of law is whether the trial judge\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Carbon County v. Union Reserve Coal Co. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 459, 469, 898 P.2d 680, 686; <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474-75, 803 P.2d 601, 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>\u00b636 Ian contends that Montana\u2019s version of the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (UEFJA), \u00a7\u00a7 25-9-501 through -508, MCA, and Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.R, permit a district court to set aside the default judgment obtained against him in Wyoming because of his inadvertence, mistake, or neglect there. Specifically, Ian argues that under \u00a7 25-9-503, MCA, anytime a foreign judgment is filed in a Montana district court, it is to be treated, in all respects, as a judgment of this state. Accordingly, he contends that once a foreign judgment is filed in Montana, it is subject to the same defenses or procedures, such as relief from a judgment under Rule 60(b), as any other Montana judgment. Therefore, because the Wyoming judgment against him was obtained by default and Montana law generally holds default in disfavor, Ian argues that the judgment should be set aside as invalid under Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u00b637 Patricia counters that a Montana district court may not set aside a valid judgment of a sister state. Patricia contends that the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution does not permit a district court to set aside a valid foreign judgment under \u00a7 25-9-503, MCA, and Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P. Therefore, Patricia argues that the District Court did not err when it denied Ian\u2019s motion to set aside the Wyoming judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b638 The United States Constitution\u2019s Full Faith and Credit Clause provides, \u201cFull Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records, and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.\u201d U.S. Const, art. IV, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u00b639  The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the full faith and credit obligation owed to final judgments is exacting. A final judgment rendered by a state court is entitled to full faith and credit in the courts of its sister states. <em>Underwriters National Assur. Co. v. North Carolina Life and Accident and Health Insurance Guaranty Ass\u2019n </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 691, 102 S. Ct. 1357, 71 L. Ed. 2d 558. The U.S. Supreme Court has stated that full faith and credit \u201cgenerally requires every State to give to a judgment at least the <em>res judicata </em>effect which the judgment would be accorded in the State which rendered it.\u201d <em>Durfee v. Duke </em>(1963), 375 U.S. 106, 109, 84 S. Ct. 242, 244, 11 L. Ed. 2d 186-90. Moreover, \u201cthe judgment of a state court should have the same credit, validity, and effect, in every other court of the United States, which it had in the state where it was pronounced.\u201d <em>Under</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number><em>writers National Assur.

Ed. 2d at 570 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b640 Ian claims that Montana\u2019s UEFJA allows Montana district courts to reopen, vacate, or set aside foreign judgments under Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.R Section 25-9-503, MCA, Montana\u2019s version of the UEFJA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">Filing and status of foreign judgments. A copy of any foreign judgment authenticated in accordance with an act of congress or the statutes of this state may be filed in the office of the clerk of any district court of this state. The clerk shall treat the foreign judgment in the same manner as a judgment of a district court of this <em>state. A judgment so filed has the same effect and is subject to the same procedures, defenses, and proceedings for reopening, vacating, or staying as a judgment of a district court of this state and may be enforced or satisfied in like manner.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">(Emphasis added.) Ian argues that the statute\u2019s language allows Montana district courts to provide Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.R, relief to foreign judgments, and a plain reading of the statute indicates that the procedures, defenses, and proceedings for reopening or vacating a domestic judgment also apply to a registered foreign judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\u00b641 Ian\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 25-9-503, MCA, is contrary to the purpose and intent of the UEFJA. The UEFJA was enacted to implement the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution. The UEFJA provides the procedural framework for enforcing foreign judgments in the states that have enacted it. The UEFJA\u2019s purpose is to \u201cfacilitate interstate enforcements of judgments by providing a summary procedure by which a judgment creditor may enforce the judgment in an expeditious manner in any jurisdiction in which the judgment debtor is found.\u201d <em>Matson v. Matson </em>(Minn. 1983), 333 N.W.2d 862, 867. The UEFJAis to be \u201cinterpreted and construed as to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law of those states which enact it.\u201d Section 25-9-508, MCA. Considering these guideposts, this Court is required to construe the UEFJA in order to obtain uniformity with the rulings of sister state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">\u00b642  We disagree with Ian\u2019s interpretation that, under \u00a7 25-9-503, MCA, a foreign judgment duly filed in Montana can be subjected to the same defenses and proceedings for reopening or vacating as a domestic judgment, and remain consistent with full faith and credit. Rather, we hold that the only defenses that may be raised to destroy the full faith and credit obligation owed to a final judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>are those defenses directed at the validity of the foreign judgment. <em>See Durfee, </em>375 U.S. at 110, 84 S. Ct. at 244, 11 L. Ed. 2d at 190 <em>(\u201ca </em>judgment of a court in one State is conclusive upon the merits in a court in another State only if the court in the first State had power to pass on the merits \u2014 had jurisdiction, that is to render the judgment.\u201d) Therefore, we determine that under \u00a7 25-9-503, MCA, certain defenses such as lack of personal or subject matter jurisdiction of the rendering court, fraud in the procurement of the judgment, lack of due process, satisfaction, or other grounds that make the judgment invalid or unenforceable may be raised by a party seeking to reopen or vacate a foreign judgment filed in Montana. These defenses have been recognized by other states that have held that the language similar to that found in \u00a7 25-9-503, MCA, does not allow the merits of a foreign judgment to be reopened or reexamined by the state where it is recorded. <em>Marworth, </em>810 P.2d 653; <em>Matson, </em>333 N.W.2d 862; <em>Rosenstein v. Steele </em>(Nev. 1987), 747 P.2d 230; <em>Morris Lapidus Associates v. Airportels, Inc., </em>(Penn. 1976), 361 A.2d 660; <em>Wooster v. Wooster </em>(S.D. 1987), 399 N.W.2d 330; <em>Data Management Systems, </em>709 P.2d 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u00b643 Foreign judgments are properly accorded this deference to avoid offending the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution. In fact, Montana\u2019s version of the UEF JA recognizes this deference by defining a foreign judgment as \u201ca judgment, decree, or order of a court of the United States or any other court which is entitled to full faith and credit in this state.\u201d Section 25-9-502, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AO9\">\u00b644  Ian does not challenge the validity of the foreign judgment based upon lack of personal or subject matter jurisdiction of the Wyoming court, fraud in the procurement of the judgment, lack of due process, satisfaction or any other grounds that would make the Wyoming judgment invalid or unenforceable. Instead, Ian argues that the Wyoming judgment, obtained by default, should be set aside based on his excusable neglect in tending to the judicial proceedings there. He contends that his failure to file an answer to Patricia\u2019s complaint in Wyoming was excusable because he was engaged in negotiations to resolve the case and had filed a dissolution proceeding in the Montana District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u00b645 However, Ian\u2019s argument is based on the premise that a foreign judgment obtained by default and duly filed in Montana should be set aside because Montana law disfavors judgments obtained by default. <em>See, e.g., Waldher v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. </em>(1997), 282 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>59, 62, 935 P.2d 1101, 1103 (In setting aside a default judgment obtained in a Montana district court, we stated \u201c[t]he policy of law is to favor a trial on the merits.\u201d); \u00a7 25-9-101, MCA. Although excusable neglect might entitle a party to have a Montana default judgment set aside under Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P., it has no application here, since the judgment was rendered in Wyoming. During oral argument, Ian\u2019s counsel argued that there is a difference in public policy between the states of Montana and Wyoming regarding the status and deference accorded to default judgments. As the United States Supreme Court has recently held, there is no public policy exception to the full faith and credit accorded to final judgments. <em>Baker by Thomas v. General Motors Corp. </em>(1998), 522 U.S. 222, 118 S. Ct. 657, 1390 L. Ed. 2d 580. Under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, we are obligated to give effect to the Wyoming judgment, even assuming the law underlying the judgment contravenes the public policy of Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">\u00b646 In this case, the default judgment was obtained in Wyoming. Tan, believing that his neglect and inadvertence were grounds to set aside the Wyoming judgment, must make his argument before the rendering court in Wyoming. <em>See Blair v. Blair </em>(1962), 140 Mont. 278, 287-88, 370 P.2d 873, 878 (\u201c[T]his case is a collateral attack upon a foreign decree. Therefore jurisdiction for such attack is with the court wherein the judgment was rendered.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u00b647 In fact, during the appeal proceedings before this Court, Ian went back to the rendering court in Wyoming and attempted to set aside the default judgment based, in part, upon excusable neglect. The Wyoming court denied Ian\u2019s request, finding that he had failed to make the necessary showing to set aside the default judgment. Having lost before the Wyoming court, Ian cannot continue to litigate the same issues in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\u00b648 We conclude that the District Court did not err in denying Ian\u2019s motion to set aside the foreign judgment filed in Montana. The foreign judgment is entitled to full faith and credit in Montana. This Court recognizes that the foreign judgment is a final judgment, granting Patricia a valid divorce from Ian and an enforceable property division. Accordingly, we also conclude that the District Court did not err in granting Patricia\u2019s motion for summary judgment in Ian\u2019s dissolution proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">\u00b649 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICE GRAY concur.

I disagree with this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\u00b652 In <em>Miller v. Herbert </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 132, 135-36, 900 P.2d 273, 275, we held that it is the substance of a document that controls, not its caption. Specifically, we stated: \u201cWe shall look to the substance of a motion, not just its title, to identify what motion has been presented.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>272 Mont. at 136, 900 P.2d at 275. Our decision in <em>Miller </em>was in line with Association <em>of Unit Owners v. Big Sky </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 142, 148, 729 P.2d 469, 472, wherein we stated that \u201c[w]e disregard that terminology in the title of the summons.\u201d More recently, in discussing <em>Association of Unit Owners, </em>we noted that \u201cin <em>[.Association of Unit </em>Owners] the content of the summons was more important than its title.\u201d <em>Yarborough v. Glacier County </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 494, 498, 948 P.2d 1181, 1183.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">\u00b653 Notwithstanding this precedent, in <em>Moody v. Northland Royalty </em>Co. (1997), 286 Mont. 89, 951 P.2d 18, 22, we carved out an exception to the substance-controls-title rule for \u201cdocuments which have procedural significance beyond the merits of their content.\u201d In those cases the title controls the substance of the document. The theory underlying this exception is that busy attorneys accord different amounts of \u201curgency\u201d to documents depending upon how the document is labeled, <em>Moody, </em>951 P.2d at 22, with the presumed consequence that mislabeled documents will not be timely read or responded to. My disagreement with this decision will not be reiterated here. See <em>Moody, </em>951 P.2d at 23 (Nelson, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">\u00b654 In the case at bar, we carve out yet another exception to the substance-controls-title rule. This exception might be denominated as the \u201cRule 59\u201d exception. Under this exception, no matter what the practitioner puts in the motion, as long as it is properly labeled, we are not going to further analyze it as to content. The rationale for this latest exception is to assure movants that their motion will, if it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>properly labeled, fall within the framework of Rule 59 \u2014 apparently even when the motion actually does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u00b655 Thus, the substance-controls-title rule now seems to be: The substance of a document controls over its title unless the document has a procedural significance beyond the merits of its content or unless the document happens to be labeled as a Rule 59 motion in which case we don\u2019t care what the substance is. Hopefully this result-oriented approach will inspire the sort of confidence and certainty in the practice of law that its proponents suggest. Frankly, I doubt that it will. No amount of finessing the rules is going to save lawyers who habitually fail to read their mail; who fail to calendar mandatory response dates; who fail to timely answer discovery requests or obtain extensions; who conduct their practice in the eleventh hour; who ignore the requirements of the rules of civil and appellate procedure; and who take on more work and clients than they can responsibly and competently handle.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u00b656 Rather, I respectfully suggest that in attempting to judicially craft these various exceptions, we are, to quote Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., \u201cspending] a great deal of ... time shoveling smoke.\u201d Black-letter Montana law, \u00a7 1-3-219, MCA, requires that we respect form less than substance. Our decisions \u2014 majority and dissenting opinions and special concurrences alike \u2014 favorably espousing this principle are legion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>1 submit that our precedent and Montana practitioners would be better served if we simply followed this law instead of re-creating the wheel to obtain the perceived preferred result in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u00b657 Using this approach, i.e., analyzing the substance of Ian\u2019s motion to alter or amend, I conclude that it was, in fact, what he labeled it. As the Court\u2019s opinion points out, in <em>Nelson v. Driscoll </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 355,948 P.2d 256, we adopted established criteria under which a motion for reconsideration would be construed substantively as a motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59(g), M.R.Civ.R In so doing we cited to various authorities which have defined, substantively, what a motion to alter or amend is and is not. It is anomalous that we look to those criteria in determining the substance of a motion to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>consider, yet purposely ignore those same criteria where the issue is whether a motion labeled motion to alter or amend actually is what it purports to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">\u00b658 In any event, contrary to the Court\u2019s head-in-the-sand approach, I conclude that Ian\u2019s motion was, in fact, a motion to alter or amend under the <em>Nelson </em>criteria. Specifically, his motion sought to correct what he believed was a manifest error of law, occasioned by the trial court failing to address and determine one of his three independent legal arguments for setting aside the Wyoming judgment. See <em>Nelson, </em>285 Mont, at 360, 948 P.2d at 259 (a motion to alter or amend is properly filed to, among other things, \u201ccorrect manifest errors of law or fact upon which the judgment was based\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u00b659 Accordingly, I agree with the result which the Court reaches in its discussion of Issue 1, but on the basis that Ian\u2019s Rule 59 motion was, in substance, a motion to alter or amend.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\">. A lengthy string-cite to the cases would serve no particular purpose except to take up space.

I do not, however, agree with the Court\u2019s rationale in reaching that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">\u00b661 Montana\u2019s version of the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (UEFJA), \u00a7 25-9-503, MCA, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK3\">Filing and status of foreign judgments. A copy of any foreign judgment authenticated in accordance with an act of congress or the statutes of this state may be filed in the office of the clerk of any district court of this state. The clerk shall treat the foreign judgment in the same manner as a judgment of a district court of this state. A judgment so filed has the same effect and is subject to the same procedures, defenses, and proceedings for reopening, vacating, or staying as a judgment of a district court of this state and may be enforced or satisfied in like manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">\u00b662 The language of the Act very clearly provides that a foreign judgment is subject to <em>reopening or vacating </em>on the same grounds as a judgment of the State of Montana. This language directly conflicts with the dictates of the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution which, as the Court recognizes, requires that \u201cthe judgment of a state court should have the same credit, validity, and effect, in every other court of the United States, which it had in the state where it was pronounced.\u201d <em>Underwriters Assur. Co., </em>455 U.S. at 704, 102 S.Ct. at 1365 (citations omitted). It goes without saying that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>cannot give the judgment in question the same credit and validity that it would have in Wyoming (its state of origin) and, at the same time, subj ect that judgment to reopening and vacating under the laws of Montana, including Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">\u00b663 The Court purports to resolve this conundrum by interpreting \u00a7 25-9-503, MCA, in such a manner that the only defenses allowed under the UEFJA are those directed at the validity of the foreign judgment (e.g., lack of personal or subject mater jurisdiction, fraud in the procurement, lack of due process, satisfaction or other grounds that make the judgment invalid or unenforceable). In the interests of interpreting our UEFJA consistently with its purpose and with rulings from sister states, the Court holds that the language of \u00a7 25-9-503, MCA, \u201cdoes not allow the merits of a foreign judgment to be reopened or reexamined by the state where it is recorded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\u00b664 The consistency that has been achieved by the Court\u2019s interpretation is nothing short of legerdemain. No matter how harmonious our sister states may be in saying that the UEFJA does not allow vacating or reopening a foreign judgment, they cannot change the fact that the UEFJA provides that a foreign judgment shall be treated in the \u201csame manner as a judgment of a district court of this state [Montana].\u201d In the event more clarity is called for, the Act goes on to elaborate: \u201cA judgment so filed has the same effect and is subject to the same procedures, defenses, and proceedings <em>for reopening, vacating, </em>or staying as a judgment of a district court of this state ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) With all due respect to the majority and the Uniform Code Commissioners, this language is only subject to one interpretation: that is, that a judgment from Wyoming, filed in Montana, is subject to <em>reopening or vacating </em>under the laws of Montana, including the excusable neglect provisions of Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P. In the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson: \u201cA foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines.\u201d In creating a consistency where none exists, we have fallen prey to the hobgoblin and have joined the ranks of the little statesmen, philosophers and divines.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\u00b665 I would hold that \u00a7 25-9-503, MCA, is unconstitutional to the extent that it is inconsistent with the Full Faith and Credit Clause. That is, to the extent that it allows a foreign judgment to be reopened or vacated under the laws of another state.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b364-7\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"AUv\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>\u00b666 I concur with the maj ority\u2019s conclusions that the appellant\u2019s notices of appeal were filed in a timely manner, that the appellant filed the correct motions in the District Court to invoke relief from the Wyoming judgment, and that those motions were timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">\u00b667 I concur with the majority\u2019s decision to affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motion to set aside the Wyoming judgment; however, I would affirm the District Court for reasons other than those offered in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">\u00b668 I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion, based on extraneous means of interpretation, that \u00a7 25-9-503, MCA, does not allow the appellant to attack a foreign judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P., on the same basis that he could attack a domestic judgment. The language of \u00a7 25-9-503, MCA, is plain on its face and provides, in relevant part, that a foreign judgment filed in this state, \u201chas the same effect and is subject to the same procedures, defenses, and proceedings for reopening, vacating, or staying as a judgment of a district court of this state and may be enforced or satisfied in like manner.\u201d When a statute is plain on its face, our obligation is to apply it as it has been written, and not to resort to extraneous sources for purposes of construing what was intended by the authors of the statute. <em>State ex rel. Cobbs v. Montana Dep\u2019t of Social and Rehab. Servs. </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 157, 162, 906 P.2d 204, 207. Section 25-9-503, MCA, clearly provides that foreign judgments filed in this state can be attacked by the same procedures and for the same reasons as domestic judgments. The majority\u2019s reliance on what it concludes was the drafter\u2019s intent, to hold otherwise is contrary to our normal rules of statutory construction and application.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\u00b669 Having said that, however, I do not believe that the appellant has the right to challenge the Wyoming judgment repeatedly, and where he has already filed and lost the equivalent of a Rule 60(b) motion directly in the court where the judgment was entered, I would conclude that he is precluded by principles of <em>res judicata </em>from repeating that same challenge in a Montana court. The appellant did not appeal from denial of his post-judgment motion in Wyoming and, therefore, that judgment is as final as if it had been unsuccessfully challenged in Montana pursuant to \u00a7 25-9-503, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">\u00b670 Because, as the majority recognizes, the appellant has already been unsuccessful in having his default judgment set aside in the Wyoming court based upon excusable neglect, I do not believe it was nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>essary for this Court to interpret \u00a7 25-9-503, MCA, as it has in order to affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\u00b671 Furthermore, even though the plain language of \u00a7 25-9-503, MCA, authorizes the appellant\u2019s action in the Montana District Court to set aside the Wyoming judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.R, I would conclude that the authority to authorize such a challenge is preempted by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738 which requires that foreign judgments be given the same effect they would be given in the state from which they originated. In other words, the federal standard for attacking a foreign judgment requires that its validity be considered based on the law of the state where it originated. Montana law provides that foreign judgments are subject to attack for the same reasons that domestic judgments would be subject to attack. The two standards are inconsistent and the. federal law has preemptive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\u00b672 The supremacy clause of the United States Constitution provides that \u201c[t]his constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof... shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d U.S. Const, art. VI, cl. 2. Interpretation of the supremacy clause has created the doctrine of federal preemption, pursuant to which state laws that conflict with federal law are preempted and \u201cwithout effect.\u201d <em>See Maryland v. Louisiana </em>(1981), 451 U.S. 725, 746, 101 S. Ct. 2114, 2128-29, 68 L.

I believe that the fiill faith and credit clause simply requires that Montana give the same effect to foreign judgments that it would give to domestic judgments and that is what the plain language of \u00a7 25-9-503, MCA, does. <em>See, e.g., Phares v. Nutter </em>(Ariz. 1980), 609 P.2d 561. However, the full faith and credit clause also authorizes Congress to expand on the effect to be given to foreign judgments and that is what it did when it enacted 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">\u00b674 For these reasons, I concur with the result arrived at by the majority, althoughl do not agree with all that is said in the majority opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b366-8\">JUSTICE HUNT joins in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
