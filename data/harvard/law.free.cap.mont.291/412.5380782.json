Hunsaker (Maurice) and was therefore not an heir to his estate. Shorland Hunsaker (Shorland), one of Maurice\u2019s brothers, cross-appeals the District Court\u2019s determination that Maurice died intestate. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-18\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b433-19\">\u00b62 Sometime in 1985, Maurice and Anne met at a restaurant where Anne worked as a waitress. At that time, Anne was married to Ray<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>mond Price; Maurice had never married. Maurice and Anne became close friends initially, but they did not share an intimate relationship until sometime later. Anne separated from her husband in December 1986 and was divorced on February 30, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">\u00b63 After Anne separated from her husband, she moved into a mobile home that Maurice bought for her. Maurice and Arme moved her personal effects into the mobile home the week prior to Christmas 1986. Anne testified that Maurice gave her a gift on every day of that week and that, on Christmas Day, Maurice gave her an engagement ring along with a matching wedding band and asked her to marry him. Anne wore the engagement ring at times, but she did not wear the wedding band. Anne stated that she never wore the wedding band because she did not believe that she had the right to wear it since she and Maurice did not have a formal wedding ceremony.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\u00b64 Maurice stayed nights with Anne at the mobile home until October 1987, when they moved into Maurice\u2019s house near Toston. The title and mortgage on the house were in Maurice\u2019s name alone. Maurice and Anne lived together in the house until Maurice\u2019s death on September 27,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\u00b65 During their relationship, Maurice farmed and ranched at his family\u2019s ranch near Toston. Anne worked as an insurance clerk and receptionist at the Family Medical Clinic in Townsend.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">\u00b66 Leonard Lambott (Lambott), a Toston area farmer and grain-elevator operator who knew Maurice and Anne for many years, testified at the bench trial on this matter that a sign in front of the house read, \u201cHunsakers, Home of the Classics\u201d (referring to Maurice\u2019s and Anne\u2019s classic car collection). Lambott further testified that the message on the telephone answering machine, recorded by Anne, stated, \u201cthis is the Hunsaker residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">\u00b67 Anne testified that she and Maurice purchased a large grandfather clock together and displayed the clock in the living room of the house. Maurice had the pendulum of the clock engraved with an \u201cH\u201d for Hunsaker in the center of the pendulum and an \u201cM\u201d for Maurice intertwined with the left side of the \u201cH\u201d and an \u201cA\u201d for Anne intertwined with the right side of the \u201cH.\u201d Anne stated that she and Maurice were proud of the clock and showed it to people who came to the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">\u00b68 Anne further testified that she and Maurice shopped, traveled and vacationed together, and went out to eat together every Friday night. In addition, Anne stated that they operated a classic car busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>ness together, took care of the yard together, and decorated the house for the Christmas season together. Anne testified that they often cooked dinner for each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">\u00b69 Even though they lived together and did many activities together, Anne and Maurice kept separate bank accounts. Because Maurice had poor credit, Anne purchased many personal items for Maurice and he bought many items with Anne\u2019s credit. Anne testified that Maurice generally reimbursed her for these purchases.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\u00b610 Maurice and Anne owned shares of stock in two companies as joint tenants. They also owned a time-share condominium at Island Park, Idaho as joint tenants. Maurice listed Anne as the secondary beneficiary to his sister on his Department of Veterans Affairs life insurance policy. Anne was listed as Maurice\u2019s spouse on the Designation of Beneficiary forms for that policy. Although most of one form was filled in by Maurice, Anne testified that she filled in the word \u201cspouse\u201d on that form. Maurice had another life insurance policy that listed Shorland as the sole beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\u00b611 Maurice and Anne filed separate income tax returns each year listing themselves as single instead of married. Anne testified that they filed as single persons because Maurice told her that he was in trouble with the IRS and that he did not want to get her involved with his financial problems. Anne testified that she did not know that she could have filed as married filing jointly. Gary Spitzer (Spitzer), the accountant who prepared Maurice\u2019s income tax returns until 1993, testified that Maurice did not indicate to him that Maurice was married.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">\u00b612 Steven Shapiro (Shapiro), a Montana City attorney who represented Maurice in several matters starting in the fall of 1993, testified that he once introduced Anne to a mediator as \u201cAnnie Hunsaker, Morrie\u2019s wife.\u201d Shapiro stated that neither Maurice nor Anne corrected his introduction. Shapiro sent Christmas cards to Maurice and Anne and addressed the cards to \u201cMaurice and Anne Hunsaker.\u201d Shapiro testified that he thought that Anne and Maurice were married and was surprised to read in Maurice\u2019s obituary that Anne\u2019s last name was not Hunsaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">\u00b6 13 Lambott also testified that Anne and Maurice presented themselves as husband and wife and that he therefore perceived them as a married couple. Lambott further testified that Maurice referred to Anne as \u201cmy wife.\u201d Tom Stonecipher (Stonecipher), a Bozeman attorney who had represented Maurice in the past, however, testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Lambott once stated that Maurice and Anne were not married but just \u201clong-term boy and girlfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">\u00b614 Anne testified that she felt that she was married to Maurice during their relationship. She also testified that she thought that Maurice felt married to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">\u00b615 Evidence introduced at trial showed that Anne was named as Maurice\u2019s spouse on his Department of Veterans Affairs life insurance policy, on his death certificate, and in a magazine article written about Maurice. Anne was also listed as \u201cAnne Hunsaker\u201d on a membership card to a classic car club and on a receipt from a store in Townsend. Additionally, Anne introduced into evidence two wedding invitations that Shorland\u2019s daughters sent to the house. Both invitations were addressed to \u201cMr. and Mrs. Maurice Hunsaker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">\u00b6 16 Lee Stokes, a Bozeman attorney, represented a client that was purchasing land from Maurice and two of his brothers and their spouses. He testified that, in trying to make sure that the title to the land was clear, he asked Maurice if he had any premarital agreements with Anne and that Maurice responded that Anne was not his wife and that he did not involve her in business.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">\u00b617 Shorland testified that Maurice called Anne his \u201csweetheart,\u201d but not his wife. Shorland also testified that he was close enough to Maurice that if Maurice had been married, he would have told Shorland. Thomas Hunsaker, one of Maurice\u2019s brothers, testified that he did not know if he considered Maurice and Anne to be married. \u00b618 Maurice was listed as Anne\u2019s \u201csignificant other\u201d on two hospital consent forms that Anne signed. One of the consent forms initially listed Maurice as Anne\u2019s \u201chusband.\u201d However, the word \u201chusband\u201d was crossed out and replaced with \u201csignificant other.\u201d Betsie Rasmussen, the nurse who filled out the consent forms, testified that she filled them out with information that Anne gave her.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">\u00b6 19 Shortly before his death, Maurice and Lambott had a conversation about wills. Maurice told Lambott that he wanted to leave his entire estate to Anne. Lambott advised Maurice to talk with an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">\u00b620 On September 25,1997, Maurice contacted Stonecipher about preparing a will. Stonecipher testified that Maurice told him that Anne was his \u201ccommon-law wife\u201d and that he wanted to leave everything to her. Stonecipher further testified that Maurice said that he did not have a will and that his family would \u201ceat [Anne] alive\u201d if he died without a will leaving his estate to her. Because Stonecipher usu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>ally does not prepare wills, he and Maurice decided to speak again the following week to make arrangements for the preparation of a will. However, two days after their initial conversation and before a will could be drafted, Maurice died. He was 63 years old. At the time of his death, Maurice had five surviving brothers and one surviving sister. One brother, Harper Hunsaker, died shortly after Maurice.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">\u00b621 On October 8,1996, the District Court appointed Anne special administrator of Maurice\u2019s estate. Anne petitioned the court on October 25, 1996, to appoint her personal representative of the estate. Anne claimed in her petition that she was Maurice\u2019s surviving spouse. On December 3, 1996, Richard Hunsaker, one of Maurice\u2019s brothers, petitioned the court to appoint an unrelated third party as personal representative of Maurice\u2019s estate or, in the alternative, to appoint \u201cAnne Barnett, the surviving spouse of the Decedent,\u201d as personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">\u00b622 On February 5,1997, Shorland filed a reply to Anne\u2019s petition to be named personal representative. Shorland asserted that Anne was not Maurice\u2019s surviving spouse and that Maurice was not married at the time of his death. Shorland also asserted that a document that he filed with the District Court on October 18,1996, was Maurice\u2019s valid, unrevoked will. Shorland requested that the District Court appoint Shorland and his siblings as co-personal representatives of Maurice\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">\u00b623 Both parties agreed in the Pre-Trial Order filed on February 11, 1997, that if it was determined that Anne and Maurice had a common-law marriage then Anne would receive the entire probate estate and that there would be no need to determine the validity of the purported will that Shorland filed with the District Court. Trial was held on February 14,1997, March 7,1997, and April 25,1997, to determine if Anne was Maurice\u2019s common-law wife. At the March 7, 1997 session, the District Court appointed Anne and Spitzer to serve as co-personal representatives pending its determination of whether Anne was Maurice\u2019s common-law wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">\u00b624 On July 17,1997, the District Court issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order wherein the court concluded that Anne was not Maurice\u2019s common-law wife. The court therefore ruled that Anne was not an heir to Maurice\u2019s estate and it denied Anne\u2019s petition to be named personal representative of that estate. The District Court also ruled that Maurice died intestate. From this order, Anne appeals the court\u2019s ruling that she was not Maurice\u2019s common-law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>wife and Shorland cross-appeals the court\u2019s ruling that Maurice died intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Standard, of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u00b625 The standard of review of a district court\u2019s findings of fact is whether the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Daines v. Knight </em>(1995), 269 Mont. 320, 324, 888 P.2d 904, 906 (citing <em>Columbia Grain International v. Cereck </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 414, 417, 852 P.2d 676, 678). <em>See also </em>Rule 52(a), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\u00b626 This Court adopted a three-part test in <em>Interstate Production Credit v. DeSaye </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 320, 820 P.2d 1285, to determine whether a district court\u2019s finding of fact is clearly erroneous. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous under the <em>DeSaye </em>test if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if, after reviewing the record, this Court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>DeSaye, </em>250 Mont. at 323, 820 P.2d at 1287. <em>See also Daines, </em>269 Mont. at 325, 888 P.2d at 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\u00b627 The standard of review of a district court\u2019s conclusion of law is whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Carbon County v. Union Reserve Coal Co., Inc. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 459, 469, 898 P.2d 680, 686 (citing <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474-75, 803 P.2d 601, 603-4). <em>See also Kreger v. Francis </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 444, 447, 898 P.2d 672, 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">\u00b628 We have reviewed the record and conclude that, although substantial evidence exists to support the District Court\u2019s findings of fact, the District Court misapprehended the effect of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">\u00b629 Because our decision regarding the issue raised in Anne\u2019s appeal is dispositive, we address only that issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">\u00b630 Did the District Court err in concluding that Anne was not Maurice\u2019s common-law wife?</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">\u00b631 Montana recognizes common-law marriages. Section 40-1-403, MCA. There is a disputable presumption that \u201c[a] man and a woman deporting themselves as husband and wife have entered into a lawful contract of marriage.\u201d Section 26-1-602(30), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-13\">\u00b632  We have long held that the party asserting that a common-law marriage exists has the burden of proving: (1) that the parties were competent to enter into a marriage; (2) that the parties assumed a marital relationship by mutual consent and agreement; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>(3) that the parties confirmed their marriage by cohabitation and public repute. <em>Matter of Estate of Alcorn </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 353, 356, 868 P.2d 629, <em>630 (quoting In re Marriage of Geertz </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 141, 145, 755 P.2d 34, 37). The party asserting the existence of a common-law marriage must prove all three elements. <em>Matter of Estate of Vandenhook </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 201, 204, 855 P.2d 518, 520. Public policy generally favors the finding of a valid marriage. <em>Geertz, </em>232 Mont. at 145, 755 P.2d at 37 (citing \u00a7 26-1-602(30), MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">\u00b633 In the case at bar, we first consider whether Maurice and Anne were competent to enter into a marriage. Under \u00a7 40-l-401(l)(a), MCA, a party may not enter into a marriage prior to the dissolution of an earlier marriage. Thus, Arme was not competent to enter into a marriage with Maurice, as a matter of law, until her dissolution of marriage from Price was finalized on February 30,1987. <em>See Alcorn, </em>263 Mont, at 357,868 P.2d at 631. After Anne\u2019s divorce was finalized, the record shows that both she and Maurice were competent to enter into marriage. Thus, Anne has carried her burden as to this element.</p>\n<p id=\"AST\">\u00b634  Second, we consider whether Maurice and Anne assumed a marital relationship by mutual consent and agreement. The mutual consent of the parties does not need to be expressed in any particular form. In <em>re Estate of Slavens </em>(1973), 162 Mont. 123, 126, 509 P.2d 293, 295 (quoting <em>Welch v. All Persons </em>(1929), 85 Mont. 114, 133, 278 P. 110, 115). Mutual consent can be implied from the conduct of the parties. <em>Miller v. Townsend Lumber Co. </em>(1968), 152 Mont. 210, 216, 448 P.2d 148, 151. <em>See also State v. Newman </em>(1923), 66 Mont. 180, 188, 213 P. 805, 807. This Court has stated that the mutual consent \u201cmust always be given with such an intent on the part of each of the parties that marriage cannot be said to steal upon them unawares.\u201d <em>Newman, </em>66 Mont, at 188, 213 P. at 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\u00b635 In <em>Alcorn, </em>Kathee, who asserted that she was common-law married to Fred, proved that she and Fred mutually consented and agreed to marriage. Fred gave Kathee a wedding ring that he designed. The ring contained two interlocking horseshoes made with Yogo sapphires, which reflected the couple\u2019s shared interest in horses. Kathee testified that Fred designed the ring and gave her a matching bracelet. The couple also used the interlocking horseshoe design at their home by cementing horseshoes into the walkway leading to their house and etching their names below the horseshoes. Kathee also testified that she and Fred agreed that they were husband and wife. The combination of these factors led to our holding in that case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>that they mutually consented and agreed to a marriage. <em>Alcorn, </em>263 Mont. at 357, 868 P.2d at 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">\u00b636  Similar evidence found in the record in the case at bar shows that Maurice and Anne agreed to a marital relationship. Anne wore an engagement ring that Maurice gave her. While we recognize that Anne did not wear the accompanying wedding band, she explained that she did not wear the wedding band only because they did not have a \u201cformal\u201d wedding ceremony.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\u00b637 Likewise, the grandfather clock engraved with Maurice\u2019s and Anne\u2019s initials that they prominently displayed in their home has the same effect as the horseshoe design in the walkway in <em>Alcorn. </em>Both of these displays are evidence that the parties living together in the home mutually consented and agreed to a marital relationship. Finally, Anne testified that she felt married to Maurice. Anne also testified that she believed that Maurice felt married to her. The engraving on the pendulum of the grandfather clock is evidence of this in that Maurice considered Anne a Hunsaker. Thus, the effect of the evidence in the record is that Anne carried her burden of proving that she and Maurice mutually consented and agreed to a marital relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\u00b638  Finally, we consider whether Anne proved that she and Maurice confirmed their marriage by cohabitation and public repute. There is no dispute that Maurice and Anne lived together for almost nine years. As to public repute, we consider how the public views the couple. <em>Miller, </em>152 Mont. at 219, 448 P.2d at 152. Relevant to this inquiry is whether the couple held themselves out to the community as husband and wife. <em>See Alcorn, </em>263 Mont. at 358-59, 868 P.2d at 632. A common-law marriage does not exist if the parties have kept their marital relationship secret. <em>Vandenhook, </em>259 Mont. at 205, 855 P.2d at 520 (citing <em>Miller v. Sutherland </em>(1957), 131 Mont. 175, 184-85, 309 P.2d 322, 327-28).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">\u00b639 In <em>Alcorn, </em>the record was clear that Fred and Kathee lived together for nine years. That, in turn, led us to focus in that case on whether Fred and Kathee established a common-law marriage by public repute. We noted that Kathee never changed her last name to Fred\u2019s last name; that she did not list Fred as a beneficiary on her life insurance, health insurance, or retirement forms; that she filed her tax returns as a single person during the term of her relationship with Fred; that Fred stated in his will, which left Kathee one-half of the net value of his ranch and all of his household furniture and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>goods, that he was single; that two of Fred\u2019s friends testified that Fred told them that he was not married to Kathee, and that Fred indicated to an attorney who drafted three wills for him, that he was single.</p>\n<p id=\"AGV\">\u00b640 Nevertheless, we held in <em>Alcorn </em>that Fred and Kathee held themselves out to be husband and <em>wife. Alcorn, </em>263 Mont. at 358, 868 P.2d at 632. In support of this holding, we set out that they spent all of their free time together, that Kathee wore the wedding ring that Fred gave her, that they regularly hosted people at the house, that Kathee spent time with Fred and cared for him during an extensive illness, that Kathee\u2019s family referred to Fred as \u201cUncle Fritz,\u201d that several witnesses testified that they considered Fred and Kathee to be married, and that Fred and Kathee held themselves out as a married couple to those witnesses. <em>Alcorn, </em>263 Mont. at 358-59, 868 P.2d at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap1\">\u00b641  In the case at bar, the record shows that Anne and Maurice held themselves out as a married couple and, therefore, had a reputation as such. The sign in the front of their home and the pendulum of the grandfather clock are evidence that Maurice and Anne held themselves out as husband and wife to those who visited their home. The answering machine message is evidence that Maurice and Anne held themselves out as husband and wife to those who called their home. Maurice\u2019s brother Richard stated in a petition filed with the District Court that Anne was Maurice\u2019s \u201csurviving spouse.\u201d One witness testified that Maurice called Anne \u201cmy wife.\u201d An attorney who represented Maurice thought that Maurice and Anne were married. This attorney also testified that he was surprised to find out in Maurice\u2019s obituary that Anne\u2019s last name was not Hunsaker. Another attorney who had represented Maurice testified that Maurice called Anne his \u201ccommon-law wife\u201d shortly before his death. Several documents admitted into evidence referred to Anne as \u201cAnne Hunsaker\u201d or indicated that she was Maurice\u2019s wife. The cumulative effect of this evidence is that Maurice and Anne held themselves out to the community as husband and wife and, consequently, had a reputation as a married couple.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\u00b642  Shorland argues that the fact that Maurice and Anne allowed people to assume that they were married is insufficient to establish a common-law marriage. Although we agree that allowing people to assume a marital relationship is not, by itself, enough to create a common-law marriage, it is evidence that the parties held themselves out to the community as married.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>\u00b643 In addition, Shorland argues that the mutual consent and agreement necessary for a common-law marriage must take place at a set time. However, in <em>Alcorn, </em>this Court responded to a similar contention made by one of the parties by stating that this concept is not determinative. We noted that cohabitation and public repute \u201care continuing factors that extend through the life of the marriage.\u201d <em>Alcorn, </em>263 Mont. at 356, 868 P.2d at 630 <em>(quoting Estate of Murnion </em>(1984), 212 Mont. 107, 118, 686 P.2d 893, 899). While mutual consent and agreement to enter into a marriage must take place at a set time, the party asserting that a common-law marriage exists does not need to prove the exact date that this occurred. The party asserting the existence of a common-law marriage must, however, prove that the three elements of common-law marriage all existed at one time. The record in the instant case reflects that although Anne could not prove an exact date when all three elements were satisfied, there was a period of time, prior to Maurice\u2019s death, when all three elements of common-law marriage existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">\u00b644 In sum, although there was substantial evidence to support the District Court\u2019s findings of fact, our review of the record leads us to the conclusion that the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\u00b645  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court erred in ruling that the evidence presented did not establish that Anne was the common-law wife of Maurice.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">\u00b646 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b442-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES REGNIER, HUNT and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b442-9\">JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"A_R\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">\u00b647 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s opinion. It is my view that the Court has merely substituted its judgment for that of the District Court in weighing conflicting evidence and determining the credibility of the witnesses. This is not our proper role.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">\u00b648 It is clear from the Court\u2019s recitation of the factual background of this case that the evidence before the District Court conflicted on the primary questions of whether Anne and Maurice assumed a marital relationship by mutual consent and agreement and whether they had a public reputation of being husband and wife. With regard to the consent and agreement issue, the District Court found that the parties had not mutually consented and agreed to a marital relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>and, indeed, this Court agrees that substantial evidence supports that finding. At that point, our inquiry should end, because we do not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court even where there is evidence of record to support contrary findings. <em>See Alcorn, </em>263 Mont. at 360, 868 P.2d at 633 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">\u00b649 Nor does <em>Alcorn </em>support the Court\u2019s determination that Anne and Maurice had assumed a marital relationship by mutual consent and agreement. In <em>Alcorn, </em>the party seeking to establish the common-law marriage testified affirmatively that she and the decedent agreed that they were married and that they were husband and wife. <em>Alcorn, </em>263 Mont. at 353, 868 P.2d at 631. On that basis, together with other supporting evidence, the district court found \u2014 and we upheld the finding \u2014 that the parties mutually consented and agreed to a common-law marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\u00b650 No such clear statement of mutual consent and agreement to a marital relationship appears in the record now before us. Anne\u2019s testimony that she \u201cfelt\u201d married to Maurice, and that she \u201cbelieved\u201d he \u201cfelt\u201d married to her, reflects how she and Maurice felt; it does not rise to mutual consent and agreement to a marital relationship. I daresay that many people who live together in an emotionally and physically monogamous relationship \u201cfeel\u201d married. That is a far cry, however, from parties actually mutually consenting and agreeing to enter into a marital relationship. Thus, contrary to the Court\u2019s statement, there is no evidence of record in this case similar to that in <em>Alcorn </em>which \u201cshows that Maurice and Anne agreed to a marital relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ahf\">\u00b651 With regard to the question of public repute as husband and wife, the Court is correct that there is evidence to support a finding that Anne and Maurice held themselves out as husband and wife. There also is evidence that they did not hold themselves out as husband and wife, however, and that evidence supports the District Court\u2019s finding. The Court merely picks and chooses from the evidence of record that which supports its own determination \u2014 which is contrary to that made by the District Court \u2014 that Maurice and Anne held themselves out to the community as husband and wife and had a reputation as a married couple. In doing so, the Court ignores our oft-stated and fundamental rule that \u201c[w]e will not substitute our judgment for that of the District Court even where there is evidence in the record to support contrary findings.\u201d <em>See Alcorn, </em>263 Mont. at 360, 868 P.2d at 633 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>\u00b652 What the Court\u2019s opinion does here is to force feed the similarities between this case and <em>Alcorn </em>into identical results in the two cases. The problem is that the two cases were decided by the respective trial courts on conflicting evidence; it was the trial court\u2019s job in both cases to weigh the evidence before it, determine the credibility of the witnesses and make findings. In <em>Alcorn, </em>the district court found that the parties had mutually agreed and consented to a common-law marriage based on substantially stronger evidence than is of record in this case. We upheld that finding and the court\u2019s ultimate determination that a valid common-law marriage existed. Here, the District Court found \u2014 after weighing conflicting evidence and determining the credibility of the witnesses \u2014 that Anne and Maurice had not mutually consented and agreed to a common-law marriage and ultimately determined that a valid common-law marriage had not been proven. It is my view that, on this record, we must conclude that the District Court\u2019s finding is not clearly erroneous and hold that the court did not err in determining that Anne did not establish a common-law marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\u00b653 Finally, I note the Court\u2019s conclusion that, notwithstanding the substantial evidence supporting the District Court\u2019s findings of fact, \u201cth[at] court misapprehended the effect of the evidence.\u201d The Court does not explain what it means by this conclusion or how the District Court\u2019s weighing of conflicting evidence constitutes a \u201cmisapprehension of the evidence\u201d which allows this Court to substitute its judgment for that of the trial court on matters of fact. What is clear is that the Court is sympathetic to Anne\u2019s plight; I am as well. It also is relatively clear that the members of this Court would have weighed the evidence differently in making findings had they been the trial court presiding over this case; I might have done so, too. It is not our role, however, to decide cases on the basis of which party pulls at our heartstrings. Nor is it our role to override a trial judge\u2019s considered weighing of conflicting evidence in order to produce a result more to our liking from a human standpoint. If this is the road the Court intends to follow in applying the \u201cmisapprehends the effect of the evidence\u201d prong of our clearly erroneous test for findings of fact, I cannot agree. Such an approach will produce result-oriented decisions which destabilize the state of the law, denigrate the role of Montana\u2019s dedicated trial judges, and cheat litigants who prevailed at the trial court level. I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>\u00b654 I would affirm the District Court\u2019s findings and conclusions relating to the nonexistence of a common-law marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">\u00b655 With regard to the issue raised on cross-appeal and not separately addressed by the Court because of its erroneous reversal of the District Court on the common-law marriage issue, I would reverse and remand to the District Court for further proceedings. As discussed above, it is my view that the District Court\u2019s finding that Anne was not Maurice\u2019s common- law spouse is not clearly erroneous and is entitled to be affirmed. As a result, the cross-appeal question of whether Maurice died intestate, as contended by Anne, or died leaving a valid will, as asserted by Shorland, becomes critical.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u00b656 The District Court found that no will had been located and ultimately ordered that the estate was an intestate estate. The record reflects, however, that a purported will signed by Maurice and dated March 30,1970, was attached to Shorland\u2019s reply to Anne\u2019s petition for adjudication of intestacy. Thus, the District Court\u2019s finding is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\u00b657 Moreover, while it is true that the parties and the trial court agreed that the validity of the purported will would not be determined until after the determination of Anne\u2019s spousal status, it is entirely unclear why the District Court \u2014 having correctly determined that Anne was not a surviving spouse \u2014 went on to make a finding and order of intestacy which did not take into account the purported will which was of record and of which the court clearly was aware.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">\u00b658 For these reasons, I would reverse and remand for further proceedings on the cross-appeal issue involving whether or not Maurice died intestate.</p>\n<judges id=\"b445-8\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER joins in the foregoing dissent of JUSTICE GRAY.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
