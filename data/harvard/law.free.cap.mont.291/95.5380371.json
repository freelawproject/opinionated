He was convicted of the crime charged following a two-day jury trial. He appeals his conviction. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-13\">\u00b62 Houle raises three issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-14\">\u00b63 1.

Did the District Court err when it instructed the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b116-16\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err when it permitted the State to challenge the credibility of the defendant\u2019s witness during its closing argument?</p>\n<p id=\"b116-17\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b116-18\">\u00b66 Kelly and Jennifer LaRocque stopped at a convenience store to make a purchase on September 26,1995. Jennifer waited in the car with their daughter while Kelly went into the store. While she waited, another car with approximately five men in it pulled alongside her. A passenger in the car, Shane Taylor, began to curse at and threaten her. In response, Jennifer exited her vehicle and sought Kelly\u2019s protection.</p>\n<p id=\"A_81\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>\u00b67 Kelly came out of the store and confronted Taylor about his comments to Jennifer. Taylor, who testified that he was intoxicated at the time, challenged Kelly to a fight, but Kelly refused. While these events transpired, Donald Houle, a friend of Taylor\u2019s who had arrived in the same car, had been in the restroom of the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">\u00b68 After leaving the restroom, Houle contends that he saw Taylor and Kelly push each other, and in an effort to diffuse the situation, escorted Taylor back to the car and told him that he would \u201ctake care of it.\u201d He asserts that Kelly followed him and Taylor and continued to yell at them. Houle testified that he then told Kelly \u201cto quit being a tough guy,\u201d and that Kelly then hit him in the chest. Houle contends that in self-defense he then punched Kelly in the face.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\u00b69 Other testimony at trial, including Kelly\u2019s and that of a clerk from the store, indicated that Houle pushed Kelly and told him not to be a tough guy, and that Kelly then did the same to Houle. Kelly testified that as he turned away, Houle punched him in the face. All witnesses agree that no further blows were exchanged, although the clerk testified that it appeared to him that Houle wanted to continue the fight. The clerk then told everyone to leave and told them that he had called the police. Later that night, Kelly underwent surgery for a broken jaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\u00b610 On November 13,1995, Houle was charged by information in the District Court for the Eighth Judicial District in Cascade County with felony aggravated assault. He pled not guilty and raised as defenses his good character and justifiable use of force. After a two-day jury trial, he was convicted and sentenced to a ten-year prison term, seven years of which was suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">\u00b6 11 Was there sufficient evidence to support a conviction for aggravated assault?</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">\u00b612  We review the sufficiency of the evidence to support a jury verdict in a criminal case to determine whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See State v. Medrano </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 69, 73, 945 P.2d 937, 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">,\u00b613 Houle was charged with aggravated assault pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-202(1), MCA, which states: \u201cA person commits the offense of aggravated assault if the person purposely or knowingly causes seri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>ous bodily injury to another.\u201d Serious bodily injury is defined separately as bodily injury that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-4\">(i) creates a substantial risk of death;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">(ii) causes serious permanent disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function or process of any bodily member or organ; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">(iii) at the time of injury, can reasonably be expected to result in serious permanent disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function or process of any bodily member or organ.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Section 45-2-101(64)(a), MCA. Houle does not contest whether Kelly sustained serious bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">\u00b6 14 Houle contends that the State failed to prove that he intended to seriously injure Kelly. He bases his position on the apparent assumption that a person could not intend to seriously injure someone with \u201cjust\u201d an ordinary punch. He has failed, however, to provide any support for that assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">\u00b615 First, we recognize that Houle\u2019s defense of justifiable use of force concedes in part that he did, in fact, purposely and knowingly strike the victim in this case. Furthermore, a review of the record shows substantial testimony that Houle was the aggressor, from which a jury could easily and rationally have found that his conduct was purposeful.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">\u00b616  Even if we were to accept Houle\u2019s assertion that he did not intend serious injury, it was easily within the province of the jury, based on the testimony before it and the District Court\u2019s instructions, to find that Houle was aware that any punch to Kelly\u2019s face would seriously harm. Section 45-2-101(34), MCA, provides that \u201c[a] person acts knowingly with respect to the result of conduct described by a statute defining an offense when the person is aware that it is highly probable that the results will be caused by the person\u2019s conduct.\u201d Modern entertainment notwithstanding, common experience would tell most people that a direct blow to the face of an unsuspecting victim can cause serious bodily injury, as defined by statute. Accordingly, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence from which a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime with which Houle was charged beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b118-13\">\u00b617 Did the District Court err when it instructed the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b119-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>\u00b618  We review an alleged error in a district court\u2019s instructions to a jury to determine whether, as a whole, they fully and fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case. <em>See State v. Patton </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 278, 286, 930 P.2d <em>635, 639; State v. Brandon </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 231, 237, 870 P.2d 734, 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\u00b6 19 Houle contends that he was denied a fair trial when the District Court instructed the jury regarding the method by which his state of mind could be proven. According to Houle, the effect of the instruction was to permit the jury to believe that there was no legal difference between an intent to cause serious bodily injury and an intent to cause bodily injury. In essence, however, Houle bases his allegation of error on the same unsupported assumption that he made above, i.e., that one could not expect that serious bodily injury would result from an \u201cordinary\u201d punch.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u00b620  The instruction at issue represents a verbatim recitation of \u00a7 45-2-201(2), MCA, which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-8\">If purposely or knowingly causing a result is an element of an offense and the result is not within the contemplation or purpose of the offender, either element can nevertheless be established if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">(a) the result differs from that contemplated only in the respect that a different person or different property is affected or that the injury or harm caused is less than contemplated; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-10\">(b) the result involves the same kind of harm or injury as contemplated but the precise harm or injury was different or occurred in a different way, unless the actual result is too remote or accidental to have a bearing on the offender\u2019s liability or on the gravity of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">The statute provides a method of proving the elements of purposely or knowingly when \u201cthe result is not within the contemplation or purpose of the offender.\u201d The charges against Houle involved the elements of purposely or knowingly and, as such, we conclude that the instruction served to inform the jury regarding the law applicable to the case. We conclude that the District Court did not err when it instructed the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b119-13\">\u00b621 Did the District Court err when it permitted the State to challenge the credibility of the defendant\u2019s witness during its closing argument?</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>\u00b622  In its closing argument, the State referred to one of the defense witnesses, Paul Palmerton, who was driving the vehicle in which Taylor and Houle were passengers and who witnessed the confrontation, as Houle\u2019s \u201cstar witness.\u201d Also in its closing argument, counsel for the State said: \u201cWe know a little bit about Mr. Palmerton. What kind of person is he? Well, when Jennifer was being called [names] he did nothing.\u201d Houle objected to the State\u2019s second statement. The District Court overruled the objection and also refused Houle\u2019s request to offer a correctional instruction regarding the nonexistence of a duty to rescue. Houle now contends that those statements by the State in its closing argument constituted misconduct and denied him his right to a fair trial. He contends that by these statements the prosecutor inferred that his most significant witness was a liar and to do so constitutes prosecutorial misconduct. We disagree. If it was the prosecutor\u2019s purpose to call Palmerton a liar (a practice we have repeatedly condemned, <em>see State v. Stringer </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 367, 380-81, 897 P.2d 1063, 1070-71), he chose a poor method of doing so. Most reasonable people, and presumably most jurors, are capable of recognizing the difference between a lack of chivalry and dishonesty. At most, the prosecutor\u2019s comment reflected a lack of chivalry.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u00b623 We therefore conclude that the State\u2019s efforts to challenge Palmerton\u2019s credibility by referring to his conduct at the scene of the event in question did not constitute prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\u00b624 Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b120-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, REGNIER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
