Jarussi (Arneen) cross-appeals from the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order entered by the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, granting Arneen\u2019s motion to increase Gene\u2019s monthly child support obligation. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-17\">\u00b62 Although the parties raise several issues on appeal and cross-appeal, the dispositive issue is whether the District Court abused its discretion in modifying Gene\u2019s child support obligation pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-18\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b392-19\">\u00b63 On August 29,1989, the District Court entered a Final Decree of Dissolution (Decree) dissolving Gene and Arneen\u2019s marriage. The De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>cree incorporated the parties\u2019 Separation Agreement (Agreement) by reference and, pursuant thereto, awarded Gene and Arneen joint custody of their two minor children, Erica and Kevin. The Decree and Agreement also provided that Arneen would be the children\u2019s primary residential custodian, with reasonable visitation privileges in Gene. Gene was obligated to pay $1,100 per month for child support and the parties agreed to \u201creview the child support award as provided by the Montana Supreme Court Guidelines for Child Support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\u00b64 On April 30,1996, Arneen moved the District Court to modify the Decree by, in part, increasing Gene\u2019s child support obligation. In response, Gene contended that Arneen had not established any changed circumstances which made the current child support obligation unconscionable. After a hearing, the District Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order increasing Gene\u2019s child support obligation to $1,903 per month. Gene appeals and Arneen cross-appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u00b65  Did the District Court abuse its discretion in modifying Gene\u2019s child support obligation pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(b), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"Ava\">\u00b66 Section 40-4-208, MCA, governs modification of child support provisions in a dissolution decree. In pertinent part, that statute provides that modification may be made only when there is \u201ca showing of changed circumstances so substantial and continuing as to make the terms [of the decree] unconscionable\u201d or with the parties\u2019 written consent. Sections 40-4-208(2)(b)(i) and (ii), MCA. Gene asserts that the District Court lacked the authority to modify his child support obligation under \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(b), MCA, because it did not make express findings that substantial and continuing changed circumstances existed which made the original child support amount unconscionable and, furthermore, that he did not consent in writing to modify the child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">\u00b67  Where a modification of child support is made pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(b)(i), MCA, a district court\u2019s determinations regarding substantial and continuing changed circumstances and unconscionability are discretionary. As a result, we review those determinations for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Pearson, </em>1998 MT 236, \u00b6 30, [291 Mont. 101], 965 P.2d 268, \u00b6 30 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Brown </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 269, 272-73, 940 P.2d 122, 124). Furthermore, under \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(b)(i), MCA, changed circumstances and unconscionability are distinct factors which must be independ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>ently addressed. <em>In re Marriage of Clyatt </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 119, 123, 882 P.2d 503, 506; <em>see also, Marriage of Pearson, </em>\u00b6 41. Thus, after finding that the circumstances surrounding the child support obligation have substantially and continuously changed, a district court must make a determination regarding unconscionability. <em>Marriage of Clyatt, </em>267 Mont. at 123-24, 882 P.2d at 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\u00b68 Here, the District Court found \u201cthe circumstances to be sufficiently changed to allow modification\u201d and set forth the following reasons in support of its finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">a. At time of hearing and submission of this matter, approximately eight years had passed since the original child support determination;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">b. The children are necessarily older and in later years of school;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">c. The child support guidelines have been significantly modified;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">d. Gene\u2019s income has increased substantially from the approximate $90,000 per year he was making in 1989;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">e. The parties\u2019 current stipulation related to custody of Erica allows each of the parties approximately equal time where the previous order allowed Erica to primarily be with Arneen; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">f. The parties\u2019 agreement anticipated that they would review the child support award as provided by the guidelines and a provision for review without allowing the Court to make a modification after such review is meaningless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">The court made no other findings or conclusions regarding the \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(b)(i), MCA, requirements. Specifically, the court made no express findings that the referenced changed circumstances were so substantial and continuing as to render the original child support amount to be unconscionable. Thus, Gene appears to be correct in asserting that the District Court failed to make the unconscionability finding required by \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(b)(i), MCA, and <em>Marriage of Clyatt </em>before a child support obligation may be modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">\u00b69 Arneen argues, however, that the District Court did not need to make a finding which expressly used the word \u201cunconscionable\u201d and that such a requirement would be an exaltation of form over substance. She relies on <em>Baer v. Baer </em>(1982), 199 Mont. 21, 647 P.2d 835, for the proposition that a district court\u2019s findings of fact regarding the propriety of modifying child support do not need to reflect the exact wording of \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(b), MCA, and asserts that the District Court\u2019s specific finding that \u201cthe circumstances [were] sufficiently changed to allow modification\u201d equated to a finding that there were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>substantial and continuing changed circumstances and that the current child support obligation was unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b610  In <em>Baer, </em>we concluded that the exact wording of \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(b), MCA, need not appear in a district court\u2019s findings as long as we could determine (1) whether, in light of the evidence of record, the district court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous; and (2) whether, in light of the evidence and the findings based thereon, the court adhered to the standards outlined in the statute in making its judgment. <em>Baer, </em>199 Mont. at 26, 647 P.2d at 838. Under this test, there clearly must be some findings by the district court upon which we may base our analysis of whether the court adhered to the standards of \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\u00b611 In the present case, the District Court made findings, as set forth above, that there were changed circumstances. Having done so, it was then required to make findings regarding whether those changed circumstances were so substantial and continuing as to render the original child support amount unconscionable. <em>Marriage of Clyatt, </em>267 Mont. at 123-24, 882 P.2d at 506. The court did not do so and, specifically, made no findings relating to whether the changed circumstances had any effect on the adequacy of the original child support amount. While it need not couch its findings in the express \u201cunconscionable\u201d language of the statute, it must make findings by which we may determine it addressed the \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(b)(i), MCA, unconscionability requirement. We conclude that it failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"AKfs\">\u00b612  We observe that both parties appear to request us to examine the evidence in the record and determine, as a matter of law, whether the original child support amount is unconscionable. We decline to do so. As stated above, our review of a district court\u2019s decision to modify child support entails a determination of whether, in light of the evidence of record <em>and the findings based thereon, </em>the court adhered to the requirements of \u00a7 40-4- 208(2)(b)(i), MCA. <em>Baer, </em>199 Mont, at 26,647 P.2d at 838. In the absence of the necessary findings, we must conclude that the District Court did not adhere to the statutory requirements underlying a modification of child support. We further conclude that the District Court\u2019s failure to make findings that the changed circumstances were so substantial and continuing as to make the original child support amount unconscionable rendered it powerless to modify Gene\u2019s child support obligation pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(b)(i), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>\u00b6 13  Nor does the record before us support modification of child support via the parties\u2019 written consent pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(b)(ii), MCA. While Arneen contends that the provision in the Agreement whereby the parties agreed to review the child support award is Gene\u2019s written consent to modify child support, we recently clarified that a written agreement to review a child support award does not equate to written consent to modify that award. <em>See In re Marriage of Syverson </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 1, 11, 931 P.2d 691, 697. Here, Gene and Arneen agreed only to a periodic review of the child support obligation; there is no written agreement to modify that obligation as contemplated by \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(b)(ii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u00b614 We conclude that, because the threshold requirements contained in \u00a7\u00a7 40-4-208 (2)(b)(i) and (ii), MCA, were not met in this case, the District Court was without authority to modify Gene\u2019s original child support obligation. As a result, we hold that the District Court abused its discretion in granting Arneen\u2019s motion to modify Gene\u2019s child support obligation pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u00b615 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b396-7\">JUSTICES NELSON, HUNT, REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
