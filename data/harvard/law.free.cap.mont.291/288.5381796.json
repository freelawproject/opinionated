Raymond P. Tipp (Tipp), Thomas W. Frizzell, and Richard R. Buley (TFB) appeal the District Court\u2019s order awarding Douglas G. Skjelset (Skjelset) interest on a money judgment against TFB. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-14\">\u00b62 We restate the two issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b309-15\">\u00b63 (1.) Did the District Court err in awarding Skjelset postjudgment interest on his money judgment against TFB?</p>\n<p id=\"b309-16\">\u00b64 (2.) Should Skjelset be granted damages for a frivolous appeal by TFB?</p>\n<p id=\"b309-17\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b309-18\">\u00b65 Tipp and Skjelset were formerly partners in a law firm. This case originated with a complaint filed by TFB in 1989 alleging that Skjelset had breached an agreement between the parties concerning the distribution of partnership assets upon its dissolution. The primary asset in dispute was a piece of real estate located in Missoula, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>which was jointly owned by Tipp and Skjelset. The case went to a mandatory settlement conference, from which a settlement agreement was derived in April of 1994. This agreement provided that Skjelset\u2019s ownership interest in the real estate was to be purchased by the remaining partners (i.e., by TFB).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\u00b66 Thereafter, a dispute arose as to the interpretation of the settlement agreement. Alleging that Skjelset had breached the agreement, TFB requested that the District Court enforce the parties\u2019 rights under the settlement agreement. On March 3,1997, the court awarded Skjelset a 50% interest and Tipp the remaining 50% interest based on the deeds, practices and understandings in effect between the parties. Skjelset\u2019s 50% ownership interest in the real estate was valued by the District Court at $158,300.03, which, after deducting $30,000 for the costs of settlement and the payment of outstanding taxes, amounted to a net judgment of $ 128,300.03. This net amount represented the value of Skjelset\u2019s ownership interest in the real estate that TFB had promised to purchase from Skjelset upon dissolution of the partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u00b67 Further, the District Court concluded that because \u201cTipp ha[d] attempted to transfer [his interest in] the real estate outside of and contrary to the settlement agreement in an effort to limit the jurisdiction of the Court in effectuating the settlement agreement which he initially requested,\u201d it was \u201cappropriate... to closely control and manage the refinancing of the real estate\u201d under the settlement agreement. Accordingly, the court directed that the parties investigate refinancing opportunities within the 45 days following the judgment and report back to the court on or before May 1,1997, for purposes of setting forth a specific time-line to allow Skjelset to be paid his interest in the real estate, while still allowing Tipp clear title to facilitate refinancing the amount of the payment to Skjelset. TFB appealed the District Court\u2019s distribution of the partnership assets under the settlement agreement. This Court affirmed the District Court judgment in <em>Tipp v. Skjelset </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 274, 947 P.2d 480 <em>(Tipp I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u00b68 After the affirmance, Skjelset\u2019s counsel wrote TFB\u2019s counsel requesting a certified check for $137,922.56, the principal amount of the judgment plus interest through December 3, 1997. Skjelset waited approximately two weeks without payment from TFB before filing a motion for enforcement of judgment with the District Court. Fifteen days after the filing of this motion, TFB deposited the principal amount of the judgment into trust with the District Court; Skj elset then delivered a quitclaim deed into trust with the court nine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>days later. In his motion, Skjelset requested that the court award him interest on the judgment amount from the date of entry of the District Court\u2019s findings and conclusions to the date that the amount was paid into trust with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\u00b69 On February 23,1998, the District Court entered its order, granting Skjelset \u201cpost- judgment interest\u201d at the statutory rate of 10% from the date of the original findings and conclusions through the date the amount was paid into trust. This amounted to an award of $10,691.70 in postjudgment interest. The court further directed the clerk of court to disburse the $128,300.03 to Skjelset, but ordered that the quitclaim deed would not be released to TFB until it filed a satisfaction of judgment respecting the postjudgment interest with the court. TFB appeals from the District Court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\u00b610 The first issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in granting postjudgment interest to Skjelset on the monetary judgment against TFB.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\u00b611 TFB contends that the District Court erred in awarding interest to Skjelset under \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA. Statutory construction is a question of law. We review a district court\u2019s conclusion of law to determine if the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470,474-75,803 P.2d 601,603.</p>\n<p id=\"A3\">\u00b612  Section 27-1-211, MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">Right to Interest. Every person who is entitled to recover damages certain or capable of being made certain by calculation and the right to recover which is vested in him upon a particular day is entitled also to recover interest thereon from that day except during such time as the debtor is prevented by law or by the act of the creditor from paying the debt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Section 27-1-211, MCA. According to TFB, \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, cannot support the District Court\u2019s grant of interest because the money judgment owed Skjelset by TFB is not an award of \u201cdamages\u201d within the meaning of the statute. We agree that \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, cannot support an award of <em>postjudgment interest, </em>but we disagree with TFB\u2019s conclusion that the District Court\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, necessarily voids an otherwise valid award of postjudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"ARs\">\u00b613 As Skjelset makes clear, this Court has construed \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, as mandating an award of <em>\u201cprejudgment interest\u201d </em>where three criteria are satisfied: \u201c(1) [there exists] an underlying monetary obligation; (2) the amount of recovery is certain or capable of being made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>certain by calculation; and (3) the right to recover the obligation vests on a particular day.\u201d <em>Byrne v. Terry </em>(1987), 228 Mont. 387, 390, 741 P.2d 1341, 1343 (emphasis added). Thus, \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, is applicable only to an award of \u201cprejudgment interest.\u201d <em>See also Martel Const., Inc. v. State </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 507, 512, 817 P.2d 677, 680 (referring to \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, as \u201cthe general prejudgment interest statute\u201d of Montana); <em>Price Bldg. Service, Inc. v. Holms </em>(1985), 214 Mont. 456, 468, 693 P.2d 553, 559 (discussing the legislative intent underlying \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, \u201c[t]he prejudgment interest statute\u201d). \u00b614 This case is factually analogous to our decision in <em>In re Marriage of Mannix </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 137, 788 P.2d 1363. That case involved the appeal of an award of interest by the trial court on a debt created by the parties\u2019 property settlement agreement. The language of the property settlement agreement, like here, required one party to purchase the other party\u2019s interest in jointly owned real estate. We noted that even though the payment was to be made in the future (i.e., upon the sale of the real estate), the right to the money vested on the day the trial court entered its final decree. We thus held that postjudgment interest was properly awarded at the rate of 10% per annum from the date of the court\u2019s entry of judgment to the day that the party owing the money tendered payment. <em>Marriage ofMannix, </em>242 Mont, at 140, 788 P.2d at 1365.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\u00b6 15 In <em>Marriage of Mannix, </em>we rejected the petitioner\u2019s arguments based upon \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA. Specifically, we stated that the petitioner\u2019s \u201creliance on Sec. 27-1-211, MCA, is inappropriate in this case, since the issue here concerns \u2018post judgment\u2019 interest, rather than prejudgment interest under Sec. 27-1-211, MCA.\u201d <em>Marriage of Mannix, </em>242 Mont. at 140, 788 P.2d at 1366. In rejecting the arguments based on \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, we affirmed the District Court\u2019s award of postjudgment interest at a rate of 10% per annum as a proper result pursuant to \u00a7 25-9-205, MCA. <em>Marriage of Mannix, </em>242 Mont. at 140, 788 P.2d at 1365. Similarly, TFB\u2019s reliance on case law interpreting \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, is inappropriate here because postjudgment interest, not prejudgment interest, is at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b616  Skjelset recognizes that \u201c[t]he award of interest here was really an award <em>ofpost- </em>judgment interest-not pre-judgment interest.\u201d Despite the District Court\u2019s reliance on the wrong statute, he contends that the award of postjudgment interest was appropriate. We agree. In this case, the District Court reached the right result by awarding Skjelset postjudgment interest, but incorrectly based its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>conclusion on \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA. We conclude that the court\u2019s judgment \u201ccan be sustained under the wrong-reason, right-result appellate rule.\u201d <em>Knutson v. State </em>(1984), 211 Mont. 126, 129, 683 P.2d 488, 490 (citing <em>Fergus County v. Osweiler </em>(1938), 107 Mont. 466, 86 P.2d 410). A harmless error does not mandate that we reverse a district court judgment; an \u201cerror must cause substantial prejudice\u201d to warrant reversal. <em>Erickson v. State ex rel. Bd. of Med. Exam. </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 367, 375, 938 P.2d 625, 630. The District Court\u2019s error regarding the application of \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">\u00b617 The statutory bases for an award of postjudgment interest in Montana are \u00a7\u00a7 25-9-204 and 25-9-205, MCA. The District Court should have applied \u00a7 25-9-205, MCA, to support its award of postjudgment interest. <em>See Marriage of Mannix, </em>242 Mont. at 140, 788 P.2d at 1365. Section 25-9-205, MCA, provides that, in cases where a postjudgment interest rate is not specified by contract, \u201cinterest is payable on judgments recovered in the courts of this state at the rate of 10% per annum and no greater rate.\u201d Section 25-9-205(1), MCA. Indeed, the Montana Legislature has shown an intent to impose postjudgment interest on all valid judgments rendered in the courts of this state: Section 25-9-204, MCA, mandates that \u201c[t]he clerk [of court] must include in the judgment entered up by him [or her] any interest on the verdict or decision of the court, from the time it was rendered or made.\u201d Section 25-9-204, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u00b618 We hold that the District Court reached the right result in assessing 10% per annum postjudgment interest against TFB from the date of judgment to the date that the amount due was paid into trust, but erred in basing its conclusion upon \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, which only supports an award of prejudgment interest. In this case, since TFB and Skjelset disputed the amount of payment owed Skjelset under the settlement agreement, it was not until the District Court order fixed the money amount owed Skjelset by TFB that there was a clearly ascertainable amount due. The District Court decision affirmed in <em>Ti.pp I </em>was therefore a \u201cjudgment\u201d because it was \u201ca final determination of the rights of the parties\u201d under the settlement agreement. Rule 54(a), M.R.Civ.P</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\u00b6 19 \u201c[0]nce a person is liable for a money judgment, and payment is not made, the person entitled to the judgment is further entitled to a fair rate of interest.\u201d <em>Knudson v. Knudson </em>(1981), 191 Mont. 204, 208, 622 P.2d 1025, 1027. Thus, interest from the date of judgment at the legal rate of 10% per annum should have been assessed against TFB <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>under \u00a7 25-9-204, MCA, or \u00a7 25-9-205, MCA. We hold that the District Court reached the right result in this case, but should have applied \u00a7 25-9-205, MCA, to support its award of postjudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\u00b620 TFB also argues that interest was improperly awarded because Skjelset\u2019s right to payment did not vest on a \u201cparticular day.\u201d This argument, however, is premised upon the specific wording of \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA. Since we have concluded that \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, is not the applicable statute for an award of postjudgment interest, we need not address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b621  Lastly, Skjelset asks this Court to award interest on the $10,691.70 in postjudgment interest that the District Court awarded. However, \u00a7 25-9-205, MCA, states that \u201cinterest must not be compounded in any maimer or form.\u201d Section 25-9-205(1), MCA. To grant Skjelset\u2019s request would be in effect to grant him a compound interest rate on his judgment, contrary to \u00a7 25-9-205, MCA. Therefore, we decline to award Skjelset interest on interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u00b622 The second issue on appeal is whether Skjelset should be granted damages for a frivolous appeal by TFB.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\u00b623  Skjelset contends that he is entitled to an award of damages against TFB for the costs and fees of defending this appeal, which he insists is frivolous. Rule 32, M.R.App.P, vests this Court with the authority to assess damages for an appeal in a civil case if we are satisfied from the record that the appeal \u201cwas taken without substantial or reasonable grounds.\u201d Rule 32, M.R.App.P. Where a reasonable ground for appeal exists, we will decline to award sanctions under Rule 32, M.R.App.P. <em>Tope v. Taylor </em>(1988), 235 Mont. 124, 132, 768 P.2d 845, 850. In <em>Tipp I, </em>we considered whether to award Skjelset his costs and attorney fees for a meritless appeal. There, while stating that we did not condone the actions that Skjelset complained of, we declined to award sanctions against TFB for a frivolous appeal. <em>Tipp I, </em>285 Mont, at-279, 947 P.2d at 483. This time around, however, we will not so hastily dismiss Skjelset\u2019s request for sanctions under Rule 32, M.R.App.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">\u00b624 Throughout the course of this lengthy and often petty dispute, TFB has displayed significant disdain for the integrity of the judicial process. As previously noted, Tipp attempted to transfer his ownership interest in the real estate out of his name in order to defeat the jurisdiction of the District Court, forcing the court to closely monitor the refinancing of the property. In this appeal, a close reading of the legal authorities cited by TFB in support of its position should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>prompted the conclusion that \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, could neither support nor defeat an award of postjudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">\u00b625 Furthermore, TFB\u2019s contention that it should not have to pay interest because \u201cSkjelset had not performed its part [under the District Court order by] ... preparing and depositing with the Court a deed,\u201d is a mischaracterization of the court\u2019s order. Nowhere did the court specifically order Skjelset to deposit the deed into trust as a condition precedent to payment. Indeed, the court\u2019s monitoring of the refinancing of the real estate was prompted by TFB\u2019s abuses in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u00b626 After TFB\u2019s defeat in its first appeal, Skjelset had to bring a motion with the District Court to compel enforcement of its judgment because of TFB\u2019s refusal to tender payment. Only upon filing of this motion did TFB finally tender payment to the court \u2014 a full ten months after judgment. Due to Skjelset\u2019s filing of the motion, he was properly awarded postjudgment interest by the District Court. With this appeal, it appears that TFB attempts to again avoid its obligations or at least suspend performance of them for as long as possible. We will not tolerate such dilatory tactics.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u00b627  We assess sanctions when a litigant takes conflicting positions throughout a case, makes baseless claims on appeal, and uses inaccurate citations in its appellate brief. <em>Federated Mut. Ins. Co. v. Anderson </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 134, 145, 920 P.2d 97, 104. We also assess sanctions when an appeal is entirely unfounded and is brought for the purpose of causing delay. <em>Reilly v. Farm Credit Bank of Spokane </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 532, 535, <em>863 P.2d 420, 422 (citing Hock v. Lienco Cedar Products </em>(1981), 194 Mont. 131, 140, 634 P.2d 1174, 1179). Lastly, we assess sanctions where a litigant\u2019s actions constitute an abuse of the judicial system. <em>Bickler v. Racquet Club Heights Assoc. </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 19, 25, 850 P.2d 967, 971; <em>see also Thomas v. Hale </em>(1990), 246 Mont. 64, 69, 802 P.2d 1255, 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">\u00b628 \u201c \u2018It is important for the sake of the litigants and for the judicial system that litigation will at some time be finally ended.\u2019 \u201d <em>South Gallatin Land Corp. v. Yetter </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 320, 326, 801 P.2d 575, 578, <em>quoting Lussy v. Dye </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 91, 93, 695 P.2d 465, 466. This case is replete with a history of dilatory tactics by TFB, including this appeal. We conclude that this appeal was taken without substantial or reasonable grounds, and we therefore award damages to Skjelset for a frivolous appeal by TFB. On remand, the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>shall award Skjelset\u2019s reasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees for defending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u00b629 In sum, we hold that the District Court erred in awarding postjudgment interest on the basis of \u00a727-1-211, MCA, which only applies to an award of prejudgment interest. However, we conclude that the error was harmless as the District Court reached the right result for the wrong reason. Therefore, we affirm the award of postjudgment interest against TFB under the proper standard of \u00a7 25-9-205, MCA. Lastly, we impose sanctions on TFB for a frivolous appeal pursuant to Rule 32, M.R.App.P, and remand to the District Court for a determination of Skjelset\u2019s reasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<judges id=\"b316-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, TRIEWEILER and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
