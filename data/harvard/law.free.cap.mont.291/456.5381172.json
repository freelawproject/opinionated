Sandman (Sandman) appeals from the February 12, 1998 Order and Rationale of the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, denying her various alternative post-trial motions. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">\u00b62 Sandman sued her insurer, Farmers Insurance Exchange (Farmers), claiming breach of contract, unfair claims settlement practices, fraud, and negligent infliction of emotional distress in connection with the settlement of her uninsured motorist claims. Following the commencement of litigation, Farmers paid $100,000 policy limits to Sandman who was injured in the underlying automobile accident and, separately, $100,000 policy limits on behalf of her infant son who died as a result of the accident. With Sandman\u2019s breach of contract claims settled as a result of Farmers payments to her, she amended her complaint to name Farmers\u2019 adjuster, Keith Booth (Booth), as an additional defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">\u00b63 The case was tried on Sandman\u2019s remaining claims and was submitted to the jury with a special verdict form. Question 5 on this verdict form asked: \u201cDo you find by clear and convincing evidence that Defendants acted either fraudulently and or with malice?\u201d This question was taken nearly verbatim from the special verdict form proposed by Sandman who posed Question 5 as follows: \u201cDo you find by clear and convincing evidence that Defendants engaged in either fraud and/or malice.\u201d In retyping Sandman\u2019s Question 5, the 7\u201d be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>tween the words \u201cand\u201d and \u201cor\u201d was deleted in the form of the question submitted by the court to the jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Post-trial, Sandman characterized this as a typographical error and argued that it created confusion in the minds of the jurors. The record, however, contains no objection by her to the form of Question 5 \u2014 i.e., without the \u201c/\u201d \u2014 at or prior to the time that the verdict form was submitted to the jury by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">\u00b64 During deliberations, the jury foreman submitted a question to the court concerning Question 5. The jury\u2019s inquiry stated: \u201cDo we have to differencateate [sic] Between [sic] fraud and malice in # 5.\u201d Again, the record is void of any discussion between the court and counsel at the time this question was submitted as to if or how this question should be answered. While Sandman argued post-trial that there was discussion that this question should have been answered differently, this discussion is not of record. Rather, what is clear from the record is that, not only did the court respond \u201cNo\u201d to the jury question, but also that neither Sandman nor the Defendants registered any contemporaneous objection to this answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">\u00b65 The jury returned the special verdict form finding that Booth or Farmers engaged in unfair claims settlement practices; that Booth or Farmers engaged in fraudulent conduct; and that Booth or Farmers did not negligently cause Sandman to suffer emotional distress. The jury awarded total damages of $15,000 as a result of the Defendants\u2019 conduct. Finally, to Question 5 \u2014 \u201cDo you find by clear and convincing evidence that Defendants acted either fraudulently and or with malice?\u201d \u2014 the jury answered \u201cNo.\u201d When polled by the bailiff, each juror, without comment, equivocation or explanation, stated that he or she had voted \u201cNo\u201d on Question 5. The jury was thereafter discharged without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">\u00b66 Subsequently, Sandman filed alternative post-trial motions requesting the court to order that the answer to Question 5 is \u201cYes\u201d; to set aside the jury verdict on Question 5; and either to enter judgment against Farmers and Booth on the issue of punitive damages as a matter of law or to grant her a new trial on the issue of punitive damages. Sandman based her motion on the affidavits of eight jurors. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Each of these identical affidavits stated that, based upon the court\u2019s \u201cNo\u201d answer to the jury question concerning Question 5, the juror determined that in order to answer \u2018Yes\u201d to Question 5, he or she had to find at least one of the Defendants acted both fraudulently and with malice. Each juror then concluded that because he or she did not find at least one of the Defendants acted both fraudulently and with malice, that the answer to Question 5 was \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\">\u00b67 In opposing Sandman\u2019s motion, Farmers and Booth submitted their own juror affidavits. Defendants obtained affidavits from five of the eight jurors from whom Sandman obtained affidavits. These affidavits, together with four more, stated, among other things, that the juror would not have awarded punitive damages in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">\u00b68 Following oral argument and briefing, the court denied Sandman\u2019s post-trial motions, ruling that the affidavits were not proper as the jury had not been subject to external influences, nor did it resort to chance. Moreover, the court rejected Sandman\u2019s substantive arguments on their merits; determined that there was conflicting evidence on the matters that would have supported a discretionary award of punitive damages; and noted that both parties had participated in the formulation of the verdict form and that neither party objected to the court\u2019s answer to the jury\u2019s question. Sandman timely appealed and the Defendants cross-appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\u00b69 Sandman raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">\u00b610 1. Whether the District Court erred in refusing to correct the jury\u2019s verdict under Rules 60(a) or (b), M.R.Civ.R</p>\n<p id=\"At3\">\u00b611 2. Whether the District Court erred in refusing to correct the jury\u2019s verdict under Rule 50(b), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">\u00b612 3. Whether the District Court erred in refusing to vacate the jury\u2019s verdict and order a new trial on either the issue of liability for or the amount of punitive damages pursuant to \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA, and Rule 59, M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">\u00b613 By way of cross-appeal, the Defendants raise two issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">\u00b614 1. Whether the District Court erred in allowing Sandman to allege new claims on the eve of trial after the close of discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">\u00b6 15 2. Whether the District Court erred in failing to provide for separate findings against the Defendants on the verdict form.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-15\">\u00b616 We affirm issues 1 and 2 on the basis of the threshold issues of waiver and the propriety of the juror affidavits. Accordingly, we decline to address the merits of those issues. Furthermore, we do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>find reversible error as to Sandman\u2019s issue 3 and, therefore, affirm as to that issue. Finally, having affirmed the decision of the trial court, we conclude that Defendants\u2019 cross-appeal issues are moot, and thus, we do not address those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">\u00b617 <em>Whether the District Court erred in refusing to correct the jury\u2019s verdict under Rules 60(a), 60(b), or 50(b), M.R.Civ.P.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">\u00b618 Sandman advances a number of arguments which she contends require the trial court to correct, mold, amend or reform the jury verdict based upon what she perceives to be the jury\u2019s mistake in not awarding punitive damages arising out of its alleged confusion over the form of Question 5, the court\u2019s \u201cNo\u201d answer to the jury\u2019s question, and a lack of evidence supporting the jury\u2019s refusal to award punitive damages. She cites to the case law of other jurisdictions in arguing that the trial court has plenary authority to correct, mold, amend and reform a jury verdict to reflect the jury\u2019s true intent or true decision \u2014 which, in this case, she gleans from the eight juror affidavits. Sandman grounds her arguments in the provisions of Rules 60(a), 60(b)(6), and 50(b), M.R.Civ.R Rule 60(a) allows the court to correct \u201cclerical mistakes\u201d; Rule 60(b)(6) allows the court to relieve a party from final judgment \u201cfor any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment\u201d; and Rule 50(b) allows the court to reopen a judgment and enter judgment as a matter of law or grant a new trial. We decline to address the merits of these arguments, however, as two threshold issues \u2014 waiver and propriety of the juror affidavits \u2014 preclude our further analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">\n<em>Waiver</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">\u00b619  As previously noted, Sandman did not contemporaneously object to the special verdict form as submitted to the jury nor is there any record that she contemporaneously objected to the trial court\u2019s answer to the jury\u2019s question posed during its deliberations. Under these circumstances it would be entirely appropriate that we simply decline further analysis of Sandman\u2019s issues 1 and 2 on the basis that she waived her claims of error underlying the issues she now <em>raises on </em>appeal. <em>See, for example, Wisher v. Higgs </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 132, 143, 849 P.2d 152, 158, <em>overruled on other grounds by Blackburn v. Blue Mountain Women\u2019s Clinic </em>(1997), 286 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Mont. 60, 951 P.2d 1 (citation omitted) (holding that where no objection is raised to the special verdict form before its submission to the jury, this Court will not review the sufficiency of the form for the first time on appeal). <em>Accord Greytak v. RegO Co. </em>(1993), 257 Mont 147, 152, 848 P.2d 483, 486. <em>See also State v. White Clay, </em>1998 MT 244, \u00b624, [291 Mont. 147], 967 P.2d 370, \u00b6 24 (holding that defendant\u2019s claim of error was waived even though raised in a post-trial motion where there was no objection to the court\u2019s actions in responding to the statement of the jury foreperson on behalf of another juror and where counsel affirmatively agreed to the court\u2019s recommendations regarding how to respond and actively acquiesced in the procedure); <em>Seder v. Peter Kiewit Sons\u2019 Co. </em>(1971), 156 Mont. 322, 327-28, 332-33, 479 P.2d 448, 450-51, 453 (where, during deliberations and in violation of applicable statutes the court orally answered the jury\u2019s written question and orally instructed the jury, the claimed error was waived and, therefore, did not constitute grounds for new trial or appeal because counsel was present, failed to object, and actively participated in the proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\">\n<em>Propriety of juror affidavits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">\u00b620  Notwithstanding that Sandman waived her claims of error based upon the special verdict form and upon the court\u2019s answer to the jury question, the trial court\u2019s decision and the parties\u2019 briefs on appeal devote little discussion or analysis to the matter of waiver. Rather, the parties focus primarily on the evidence and on the matter of the juror affidavits and the court\u2019s consideration of those. Furthermore, a discussion of and decision on the propriety of the juror affidavits is necessary to our resolution of Sandman\u2019s issue 3. Accordingly, we will address this additional threshold issue along with the matter of the court\u2019s failure to include the 7\u201d between the words \u201cand\u201d and \u201cor\u201d on the verdict form. We discuss this latter matter first as it is intertwined with the issue of the court\u2019s answer to the jury question and the juror affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\u00b621 As previously stated, Sandman\u2019s proposed Question 5 included a 7\u201d between the words \u201cand\u201d and \u201cor,\u201d whereas the court\u2019s form of Question 5 did not include the <em>\u201c/\u201d. </em>Aside from observing that the use of this much-maligned and overused conjunctive-disjunctive reflects poor draftsmanship and generally should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>be avoided,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we are, nonetheless, unpersuaded that the use of \u201cand\u201d and \u201cor\u201d with the slash is any more correct or any less confusing than without the slash. According to the legal commentators, when used together with \u201cand,\u201d the word \u201cor\u201d usually includes \u201cand\u201d and the \u201cand/or\u201d phrase means \u201ceither or both of.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Inclusion of the 7\u201d would not have corrected any error, ambiguity or confusion already inherent in the use of the \u201cand\u201d \u201cor\u201d conjunctive-disjunctive.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">\u00b622 The more important point for purposes of our discussion here, however, is that, regardless of it being used correctly or incorrectly in the context of Question 5 and the law applicable to this case, this conjunctive-disjunctive was not only proposed by Sandman herself in her special verdict form but also was not objected to by her in the verdict form used by the court and submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\u00b623  The \u201cinvited error\u201d rule is well established. \u201cA district court will not be put in error for a ruling or procedure in which the appellant acquiesced or participated, or to which the appellant made no objection.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Ins. Fund v. Berg </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 161, 174, 927 P.2d 975, 983 (citation omitted). Accordingly, on the procedural posture of this case and the record before us, we decline to find reversible error in the fact that the special verdict form did not contain a 7\u201d between the words \u201cand\u201d and \u201cor\u201d in Question 5. That said, however, our decision on this point should not be read as indicating, implicitly or otherwise, that we approve of the use of the conjunctive-disjunctive \u201cand/or\u201d or \u201cand or\u201d in verdict forms or in jury instructions absent there being some statutory language or other good reason necessitating such use.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">\u00b624  We now turn to the matter of the juror affidavits. For the most part, Sandman\u2019s appeal is premised upon consideration of the juror affidavits which she obtained from eight jurors and which she submitted in support of her alternative post-trial motions. As pointed out above, in response to Question 5 \u2014 \u201cDo you find by clear and convincing evidence that Defendants acted either fraudulently and or with malice?\u201d \u2014 the jury unanimously answered \u201cNo.\u201d A finding of actual fraud or actual malice is a prerequisite to an award of punitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>damages by the fact finder. Section 27-1-221(1), MCA. Accordingly, since the jury answered Question 5 in the negative, Sandman was not entitled to punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-3\">\u00b625 It is for this reason that Sandman argues that the jury was confused by the court\u2019s \u201cNo\u201d answer to the jury\u2019s question \u2014 \u201cDo we have to differencateate [sic] Between [sic] fraud and malice in # 5\u201d \u2014 and urges that, had this question been answered \u201cYes,\u201d the jury, in turn, would have answered \u2018Yes\u201d to Question 5 and would have awarded punitive damages. As noted, she premises this argument on the juror affidavits which she obtained.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">\u00b626 However, the trial court determined that consideration of the affidavits was not proper as the jury had not been subject to external influences, nor did it resort to chance. Accordingly, if, as the District Court concluded, there was no legal basis on which to consider these affidavits, then the jury\u2019s negative response to Question 5 must stand and with that response the consequence that Sandman is not entitled to punitive damages under \u00a7 27-1-221, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\u00b627 In Montana, Rule 606(b), M.R.Evid., bars testimony and affidavits of jurors for the purpose of impeaching their verdict. Specifically, jurors may not testify or present affidavits</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury\u2019s deliberations or to the effect of anything upon that or any other juror\u2019s mind or emotions as influencing the juror to assent or dissent from the verdict or indictment or concerning the juror\u2019s mental processes in connection therewith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">\u00b628 This rule, however, recognizes three exceptions. Jurors may testify and offer affidavits concerning only the following questions, whether occurring during the course of the jury\u2019s deliberations or not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKl\">(1) whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury\u2019s attention; or (2) whether any outside influence was brought to bear upon any juror; or (3) whether any juror has been induced to assent to any general or special verdict, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>finding on any question submitted to them by the court, by a resort to the determination of chance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\u00b629  The rationale underlying this rule is clear. As we stated in <em>Boyd v. State Medical Oxygen &amp; Supply, Inc. </em>(1990), 246 Mont. 247, 252, 805 P.2d 1282, 1285-86:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">The rule is founded on public policy, and is for the purpose of preventing litigants or the public from <em>invading the privacy of the jury room, either during the deliberations of the jury or afterward. It is to prevent overzealous litigants and a curious public from prying into deliberations </em>which are intended to be, and should be, private, frank, and free discussions of the questions under consideration. <em>Further, if after being discharged and mingling with the public, jurors are permitted to impeach verdicts which they have rendered, it would open the door for tampering with jurors and would place it in the power of a dissatisfied or corrupt juror to destroy a verdict to which he had deliberately given his assent under sanction of an oath. ...</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">Testimony of the jurors to impeach their own verdict is excluded not because it is irrelevant to the matter in issue, but because <em>experience has shown that it is more likely to prevent than to promote the discovery of the truth. Hence, the affidavit of a juror cannot be admitted to show anything relating to what passed in the jury room </em>during the investigation of the cause, or the effect of a colloquy between the court and a juror, or the arguments made to a juror by a fellow juryman.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Indeed, with this rationale in mind, we have long held that the exceptions stated in Rule 606(b) \u201care exclusive, and are narrowly construed.\u201d <em>White Clay, </em>\u00b6 21 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">\u00b630 In the case at bar, exceptions (1), extraneous prejudicial information, and (3), resort to chance, are not at issue. Sandman, nevertheless, maintains that the District Court\u2019s answer to the jury\u2019s question \u2014 an answer she now claims was incorrect \u2014 constituted an external or outside influence on the jury\u2019s deliberations causing confusion and mistake. The trial court ruled otherwise. We agree with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"AmX\">\u00b631  Whether a jury has been subject to internal or external influences is a question of law and we review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Berg, </em>279 Mont. at 168, 927 P.2d at 979 (citations omitted). We have stated that where external influence is exerted on the jury or where prejudicial information is brought to the jury\u2019s attention, juror affidavits can be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>basis for overturning the judgment if either party was deprived of a fair trial. On the other hand, juror affidavits may not be used to impeach the verdict based upon internal influences on the jury, such as a mistake of evidence or misapprehension of the law. <em>McGillen v. Plum Creek Timber Co., </em>1998 MT 193, \u00b6 21, [290 Mont.264], 964 P.2d 18, \u00b6 21 (quoting Harry <em>v. Elderkin </em>(1981), 196 Mont. 1, 7-8, 637 P.2d 809, 813).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-3\">\u00b632 Examples of \u201cexternal influences\u201d on the jury include a juror\u2019s telephone call obtaining information with regard to previous litigation by the plaintiff, visiting the scene of an accident, or bringing newspaper articles about the trial into the jury room for the jurors to see. <em>State v. Brogan </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 156, 161, 900 P.2d 284, 287 (citation omitted). On the other hand, we have held that the use of juror affidavits submitted to demonstrate jury confusion arising from questions on the verdict form does not fit within the three exceptions enumerated in Rule 606(b), M.R.Evid. Moreover, in the context of \u00a7 25-11-102(1), MCA, the statute specifying the grounds for new trial, we have held that the sort of \u201cirregularity in the proceedings\u201d contemplated by this statute \u201cmust exist independent of juror affidavits.\u201d <em>Boyd, </em>246 Mont, at 253, 805 P.2d at 1286 (citing <em>Harry, </em>196 Mont. at 6, 637 P.2d at 812). Similarly, we have held that juror affidavits do not fall within the external influence exception to the Rule where the jurors state that, because they misunderstood the jury instructions, the verdict had an \u201cunintended effect.\u201d <em>Greytak, </em>257 Mont at 153, 848 P.2d at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">\u00b633  Notwithstanding, Sandman argues that the District Court\u2019s answer to the jury\u2019s question was an external influence that caused the jury to answer Question 5 \u201cNo.\u201d We decline to adopt this argument for two reasons. First, Sandman cites no competent authority for the proposition that the trial judge\u2019s answer to a jury question may constitute an improper external influence on the jury within the meaning of exception (2) to Rule 606(b), M.R.Evid. As to this point, we have made it clear on numerous occasions that we will not address an argument for which no supporting authority is cited. <em>See, for example, Rieman v. Anderson </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 139, 147, 935 P.2d 1122, 1126-27; Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P. Second, we recently rejected a similar argument in <em>White Clay, </em>wherein we observed that \u201c[n]o language in the Rule provides for \u2014 or would support \u2014 a \u2018judge as external influence\u2019 exception to the general prohibition contained in Rule 606(b), M.R.Evid.\u201d <em>White Clay, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>\u00b634 Accordingly, since Sandman\u2019s affidavits do not show that an external or, in the words of the Rule, an \u201coutside\u201d influence was brought to bear upon the jurors, we hold that the jurors\u2019 affidavits could not be used to impeach their verdict in the case at bar. The jury\u2019s answer to Question 5 must stand. The trial court properly refused Sandman\u2019s motion to order that the answer to Question 5 is \u201cYes\u201d or to otherwise \u201ccorrect,\u201d \u201cmold,\u201d or set aside the verdict on the basis of her perception that the jury actually intended to award punitive damages, but did not do so because it was confused and mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\u00b635 <em>Whether the District Court erred in refusing to vacate the jury\u2019s verdict and order a new trial on either the issue of liability for or the amount of punitive damages pursuant to \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA, and Rule 59, M.R.Civ.R</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\u00b636 Sandman also maintains that, pursuant to \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA, and Rule 59, M.R.Civ.R, she was entitled to a new trial solely on the amount of punitive damages or, alternatively, on the liability for and amount of punitive damages. She cites the statutory grounds for new trial at \u00a7 25-11-102(1), MCA, irregularity in the proceedings, and at \u00a7 25-11-102(6), MCA, insufficiency of evidence, for this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"Ams\">\u00b637  With regard to subsection (1), Sandman argues that the above-discussed exclusion of the 7\u201d in Question 5 combined with the court\u2019s answer to the jury question caused a prejudicial irregularity in the proceedings. We disagree and, having already thoroughly addressed both of these claimed errors, we decline to discuss this argument further. For the reasons aforestated, we find no reversible error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to vacate the jury\u2019s verdict and order a new trial on the basis of \u00a7 25-11-102(1), MCA, irregularity in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">\u00b638  As to subsection (6) of the statute \u2014 sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury\u2019s negative answer to Question 5 \u2014 we conclude that Sandman\u2019s argument must fail. At the outset, we note that all elements of a claim for punitive damages must be proved by clear and convincing evidence \u2014 i.e., evidence in which there is no serious or substantial doubt about the correctness of the conclusions drawn from the evidence and of which there is more than a preponderance but less than a reasonable doubt. Section 27-1-221(5), MCA. <em>See also Cartwright v. Equitable Life Assur. </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 1, 27-28, 914 P.2d 976, 992-93. In this case, according to Question 5 on the special verdict form, the jury did not \u201cfind by clear and convincing evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>that Defendants acted either fraudulently and or with malice.\u201d As stated above, there is no procedural reason on the record of this case that this finding should be vacated or disregarded. Accordingly, without more, the jury having failed to make the prerequisite finding of actual fraud or actual malice required by \u00a7 27-1-221(1), MCA, Sandman\u2019s claim for punitive damages must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\">\u00b639  Sandman contends, however, that there is no substantial evidence supporting this finding. In this regard, and notwithstanding that a plaintiff\u2019s burden of proof for punitive damages is \u201cclear and convincing,\u201d we review a jury\u2019s verdict to award punitive damages to determine whether there was substantial evidence supporting the verdict. <em>Cartwright, </em>276 Mont. at 28, 914 P.2d at 993. It follows, therefore, that we will review a jury\u2019s verdict not to award punitive damages under the same substantial evidence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\u00b640 We described in greater detail our standard of review of jury verdicts <em>in Kneeland v. Luzenac America, Inc., </em>1998 MT 136, \u00b6 45, [289 Mont. 201], 961 P.2d 725, \u00b6 45 (citations omitted). There we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhY\">Our scope of review of jury verdicts is necessarily very limited. This Court will not reverse a jury verdict which is supported by substantial credible evidence. This Court has defined substantial credible evidence as evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. The evidence may be inherently weak and conflicting, yet it may still be considered substantial. It is well established that if the evidence is conflicting, it is within the province of the jury to determine the weight and credibility to be afforded the evidence. Finally, upon reviewing a jury verdict to determine if substantial credible evidence exists to support the verdict, this Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\u00b641 Moreover, in our review of jury verdicts in civil cases, we have stated that the prevailing party is entitled to any reasonable inference that can be drawn from the facts which are proven, <em>Cartwright, </em>276 Mont at 33, 914 P.2d at 996 (citations omitted); that we do not decide whether the verdict was correct or whether the jury made the right decision, <em>Wise v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 336, 343, 943 P.2d 1310, 1314; that we will not lightly overturn the verdict of a finder of fact, especially a jury, <em>Palmer by Diacon v. Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 515, 519-20, 761 P.2d 401, 404; that we will not disturb the jury\u2019s findings unless they are inherently impossible to believe, <em>Wise, </em>284 Mont. at 339, 943 P.2d at 1312; that the test of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>substantial credible evidence allows for reversal only if there is an absence of probative facts to support the verdict, <em>Kleinsasser v. Superior Derrick Service, Inc. </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 371, 374, 708 P.2d 568, 570; that substantial evidence \u201cconsists of more than a mere scintilla of evidence but may be somewhat less than a preponderance,\u201d <em>Barrett v. Asarco Inc. </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 196, 200, 799 P.2d 1078, 1080; and, that in order to rise to the level of substantial evidence, the evidence must be greater than trifling or frivolous, <em>C. Haydon Ltd. v. MT Min. Properties, Inc. </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 138, 151, 951 P.2d 46, 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">\u00b642  With these legal principles and standards of review in mind, our examination of the record leads us to the same conclusion as that of the District Court. We determine that there was ample conflicting evidence as to whether the Defendants made false representations, concealed material facts, intended to injure Sandman, or acted with actual fraud or actual malice as those terms are defined by \u00a7 27-1-221(2) and (3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\u00b643 Sandman testified that in her February 16,1996 conversation with Booth, he told her that he had been authorized to offer her the policy limits of $100,000 on her claim, but that he did not have policy limits authority on her son\u2019s claim. She further testified that Booth told her he could pay up to $50,000 on her son\u2019s claim, but that he could arrange for a structured settlement whereby she would be paid $100,000 over time. Sandman contended that this was evidence of misrepresentation and fraud on Booth\u2019s part because he did in fact have policy limits authority on both claims at the time of that conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">\u00b644 Booth\u2019s testimony at trial directly contradicted Sandman\u2019s testimony. He denied telling Sandman that he did not have policy limits authority on her son\u2019s claim or that Farmers would only offer $50,000 on that claim. Booth testified that he did tell Sandman that he had the authority to settle her claim for $100,000 and that he had the authority to settle her son\u2019s claim, however, he testified that he did not mention a specific dollar amount on the son\u2019s claim.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">Q. [by Defendants\u2019 counsel] And what did you tell her and what did she ask regarding the values of the claims?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">A. [Booth] She asked me very\u2014 She asked me what authority I had to settle the claims and I\u2014 I was very careful because I wanted to make sure that she understood that I had the authority to settle the claims and that is why it was important for me to meet with her directly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Q. She wanted to know what your dollar amount was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-3\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\">Q. And what did you tell her when she asked you that question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">A. Well, I told her that I had the authority\u2014 I never disclose my authority to settle claims. It is my job to negotiate a settlement, and I just don\u2019t disclose it if it is going to be negotiated. At that time she asked me several times what my authority was, and I told her I had the authority to settle her claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">Q. Did you ever at any time in that conversation or any other conversation tell her that you did not have policy limits authority on Ross Sandman\u2019s claim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">A. Absolutely not. Absolutely not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">Q. Are you sure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-9\">A. I am very, very sure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">\u00b645 It is uniquely the jury\u2019s task to weigh and resolve conflicts in the evidence, to judge the credibility of the witnesses, and to find the facts. <em>Durden v. Hydro Flame Corp., </em>1998 MT 47, \u00b6 36, [288 Mont. 1], 955 P.2d 160, \u00b6 36. The jury performed this task in the case <em>subjudice </em>and its decision must be upheld. We hold that the jury\u2019s verdict to not award punitive damages is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">\u00b646  Finally, we address Sandman\u2019s argument that the uncontradicted evidence entitled her either to an award of punitive damages as a matter of law or, at least, a new trial on this issue. We disagree for three reasons. First, as we have pointed out above, the evidence that would have supported an award of punitive damages was contradicted and the jury\u2019s decision to not award punitive damages is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-13\">[T]he trial court properly grants a motion for judgment as a matter of law only where there is a <em>complete absence </em>of any credible evidence in support of the verdict. If there is <em>any evidence </em>in support of the verdict and if the party opposing the motion can recover on <em>any </em>view of the evidence and legitimate inferences, then the court must exercise self-restraint, credit the constitutionally mandated process of jury decision, and deny the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-14\"><em>Durden, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-15\">\u00b647 [15] Second, it is undisputed that the jury found, necessarily by a preponderance of the evidence, that \u201cBooth or Farmers ... engage[d] in unfair claims settlement practices\u201d (special verdict form Question 1) and that \u201cBooth or Farmers ... engage[d] in fraudulent conduct\u201d (special verdict form Question 2). On these findings the jury awarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>compensatory damages for Sandman\u2019s unfair claims settlement practices and fraud claims. It is equally clear, however, that the jury, to a person, declined to find \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that Defendants acted either fraudulently and or with malice\u201d (special verdict form Question 5) \u2014 the prerequisite finding for an award of punitive damages. Sandman\u2019s contention that a finding of fraud automatically supports an award of punitive damages as a matter of law ignores the fact that two different burdens of proof are involved. A preponderance of the evidence is necessary to establish the nine elements of fraud, <em>Pare v. Morrison </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 218, 221, 786 P.2d 655, 657, while clear and convincing evidence is required to prove all elements for a claim of punitive damages, \u00a7 27-1-221(5), MCA, and <em>Cartwright, </em>276 Mont. at 28, 914 P.2d at 993. It is within the province of the jury to find, as it did here, that there is sufficient evidence of proof of fraud, but yet not the quantum of evidence necessary to support an award of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">\u00b648  Third, we have made it clear that the district court\u2019s role with regard to punitive damages in a case tried to a jury is limited. We stated in <em>DeBruycker v. Guaranty Nat. Ins. Co. </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 294, 300, 880 P.2d 819, 822:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">[T]he District Court [is] bound by the jury\u2019s determination of facts on all issues which had been presented to the jury. Section 27-l-221(7)(c), MCA, only empowers the court to evaluate the amount of the award of punitive damages in light of the factors enumerated under subsection (7)(b), and to make findings of fact and conclusions of law as to its reasons for increasing, decreasing, or letting stand the amount of the punitive damages award. <em>It does not open the door for reversal of jury findings on underlying issues of liability. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">In this regard, \u00a7 27-1-221(6), MCA, squarely commits the decision to award or not to award punitive damages to the fact finder. Indeed, in <em>Moulding v. Hardman </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 18, 26-27, 847 P.2d 292, <em>298 (citing Davis v. Sheriff </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 126, 133, 762 P.2d 221, 226), we stated that \u201c[n]o plaintiff is ever entitled to exemplary damages as a matter of right, regardless of the situation or the sufficiency of the facts.\u201d <em>See also Cartwright, </em>276 Mont. at 44, 914 P.2d at 1002 (\u201cit is the jury which must first determine whether punitive damages are recoverable ... To hold that the district court has complete and unbridled discretion to ignore the jury\u2019s award would mean that the function assigned to the jury in this process is meaningless\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>\u00b649  Thus, in the face of the record here and above-cited statutory and case authority, Sandman\u2019s conclusion that the District Court could and should have granted her motion to vacate the jury\u2019s finding of no liability for punitive damages and that the court could and should have ordered a judgment for punitive damages as a matter of law, is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\u00b650 Finally, the general rule is that a decision to grant a new trial is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed absent a showing of manifest abuse of that discretion. <em>Jim\u2019s Excavating Service v. HKM Assoc. </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 494, 512, 878 P.2d 248, 259. For the reasons already discussed, we find no manifest abuse of the court\u2019s discretion in its refusal to order a new trial as to punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\u00b651 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b493-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES LEAPHART, HUNT and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-7\">. Other changes in the court\u2019s special verdict form from that proposed by Sandman are not at issue. It should be noted, however, that the questions asked and their arrangement on the court\u2019s verdict form were virtually the same as those on the verdict form proposed by Sandman.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b484-10\"> <em>.See </em>Bryan A. Garner, <em>The Elements of Legal Style </em>31,102-03 (1991); Bryan A.

Farmers and Booth obtained countervailing affidavits which demonstrated that the jurors would not have awarded punitive damages. We do not base our decision on this issue on the Defendants\u2019juror affidavits, however. For the reasons set forth in our opinion, it is no more permissible that the trial court or this Court allow rehabilitation of the jury verdict on the basis of affidavits violating Rule 606(b), M.R.Evid., than it is to allow the verdict to be impeached by use of such affidavits in the first place.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
