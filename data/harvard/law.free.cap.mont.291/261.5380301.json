Vincelette, commenced this action in the District Court for the Thirteenth Judicial District in Yellowstone County to recover damages for personal injuries sustained while a guest of the defendant, Billings Sheraton Hotel. Following a jury trial, a verdict was returned for the hotel. Darlene appeals from the judgment entered pursuant to that verdict and from the denial of her motion for a new trial. We reverse the judgment of the District Court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">\u00b62 The issues presented on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it allowed a witness to testify about out-of-court statements made by an unidentified declarant?</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it refused to admit photographs offered as demonstrative evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b283-14\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err when it denied plaintiff\u2019s motion to compel discovery?</p>\n<p id=\"b283-16\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b283-17\">\u00b66 Around midnight on March 19 or 20, 1989, Darlene Vincelette fell while entering the Billings Sheraton Hotel. She and her companion had passed through the outer doors leading to the hotel lobby and were crossing over a carpeted entryway. Darlene took a step backward to allow her companion to open one of the inner doors. As she did so, she fell and injured her back.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>\u00b67 Darlene asserts that the cause of the fall was either a defect in the carpeting or negligent maintenance of the carpeting. The hotel denied any defect or negligence. It alleged that Darlene was intoxicated and that her condition was the cause of her fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">\u00b68 Darlene moved the District Court prior to trial for an order excluding testimony from hotel employees that they had been told Darlene was drunk. The District Court did not rule on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"AWy\">\u00b69 At trial, one of the hotel\u2019s maintenance engineers was allowed to testify that he had received a radio call from another hotel employee, who stated that Darlene was drunk. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel moved to strike the testimony as hearsay, but the motion was denied. The declarant was never identified nor produced as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\u00b610 The District Court also refused to allow Darlene to admit photographs of the entryway, taken seven years after the accident, which were offered to illustrate the testimony of several witnesses regarding the condition of the carpet.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">\u00b611 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it allowed a witness to testify about out-of-court statements made by an unidentified declarant?</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">\u00b612  We review evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. The district court has broad discretion to determine whether or not evidence is relevant and admissible pursuant to the Montana Rules of Evidence. Absent a showing of an abuse of discretion, the trial court\u2019s determination will not be overturned. <em>See State v. Passama </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 338, 341, 863 P.2d 378, 380 (citing <em>State v. Crist </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 442, 445, 833 P.2d 1052, 1054).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">\u00b613 Darlene alleged that the cause of her fall was the condition of the hotel carpeting, caused by improper maintenance. As a defense, the hotel asserted that there was nothing wrong with the carpeting, but that Darlene\u2019s intoxication was the cause of her fall. Prior to trial, Darlene filed a motion in limine to exclude testimony from hotel employees that they were told the plaintiff was drunk. The District Court did not rule on the motion, but stated that it would make a decision at trial, once a foundation for the testimony existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">\u00b6 14 At trial, Darlene called Larry Vandenbosch, a maintenance engineer on duty at the hotel the night of her accident, as an adverse witness. On direct examination, Mr. Vandenbosch testified that he received a report by radio that a woman had fallen in the entryway. He then went to investigate, but the entryway and lobby were empty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>when he arrived. He further testified that upon his arrival he examined the entryway carpeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b615 On cross-examination, counsel for the hotel asked Vandenbosch what \u201cinformation\u201d the radio caller gave him. Vandenbosch then testified that he was told a woman had fallen in the entry way and that she was drunk. He could not remember who placed the radio call, and the unidentified caller did not testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u00b616 Darlene moved to strike the statement that she was drunk on the basis that it was hearsay. The District Court allowed the statement on the basis that it was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but \u201cmerely to reflect what was said to him and therefore it\u2019s not hearsay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\u00b617 Following the ruling, the hotel again elicited testimony from Vandenbosch that he had been told Darlene was drunk. Then, in closing argument, counsel for the hotel referred to the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\u00b6 18 On appeal, Darlene contends the out-of-court statement was offered to show that her fall resulted from intoxication rather than a defect in the carpeting. The hotel contends that the testimony was not hearsay because it was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but to show its effect on the witness\u2019s state of mind and to show why he went to the entryway to investigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">\u00b619  Hearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. <em>See </em>Rule 801(c), M.R.Evid. Hearsay is not admissible except as provided by the rules of evidence. <em>See </em>Rule 802, M.R.Evid. A statement does not fit within the definition of hearsay when it is not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but to show the resulting effect on the witness\u2019s state of mind. <em>See Mannix v. Butte Water Co. </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 79, 86, 854 P.2d 834, 838; <em>Moats Trucking Co. v. Gallatin Dairies </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 474, 479, 753 P.2d 883, 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">\u00b620 In <em>Moats, </em>the plaintiff trucking firm brought an action for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing when the defendant dairy company terminated a hauling contract with forty-eight days\u2019 notice. The district court allowed one of the defendant\u2019s employees to explain why notice was not given immediately when the decision was made to terminate the contract by relating an out-of-court conversation with another employee, who expressed concern that the plaintiff would terminate services immediately upon being advised that its contract was being terminated. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>district court held that the out-of-court conversation was not admitted to prove that the plaintiff would actually have terminated services immediately, but to show the effect that it had on the state of mind of the defendant\u2019s employee. Prior to allowing the testimony, the district court cautioned the jury that the party\u2019s testimony was admitted only for the purpose of showing that the statements were made, not for proving that they were true. We affirmed the ruling of the district court on that basis. <em>See Moats, </em>231 Mont. at 479, 753 P.2d at 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b621 Here, there is no similar purpose for admitting an out-of-court statement about Darlene\u2019s intoxication. The testimony that a woman had fallen, offered on direct examination, served to show why Vandenbosch went to the entryway and examined the carpeting. The specific statement that the woman was drunk had no bearing on his decision to investigate. The statement served no other purpose than to prove that Darlene fell because she was drunk, and is more analogous to the hearsay testimony offered in <em>Mannix.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\u00b622 In <em>Mannix, </em>the plaintiff brought an action for wrongful termination of employment after he was discharged for his initial refusal to follow, and later criticism of, a company directive. He sought to introduce testimony from other employees of the same company regarding the transaction which led to his discharge. He argued that the out-of-court statements were offered to prove his state of mind and, therefore, were not hearsay pursuant to our decision in <em>Moats. </em>The district court disagreed, and we affirmed on the basis that the statements were, in fact, offered to prove his employer\u2019s conduct and, therefore, for the truth of what was asserted. <em>See Mannix, </em>259 Mont. at 86-87, 854 P.2d at 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u00b623  Here, the hotel\u2019s argument that Vandenbosch\u2019s testimony was not offered to prove the truth of what was asserted is belied by the fact that the hotel\u2019s defense was based on its contention that Darlene was intoxicated. The evidence the hotel sought to present, suggesting that Darlene was drunk, was an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of what was asserted, and was inadmissible hearsay pursuant to Rules 801(c) and 802, M.R.Evid. We conclude that the District Court erred when it allowed the hearsay testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">\u00b624  For error to be the basis for a new trial, it must affect the substantial rights of the appellant. <em>See </em>Rule 61, M.R.Civ.P. Because of the inflammatory nature of the evidence, and Darlene\u2019s complete inability to test its reliability by cross-examination, we conclude that the evidence did affect Darlene\u2019s substantial rights and was prejudicial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>For this reason, we reverse the judgment of the District Court and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b625 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it refused to admit photographs offered as demonstrative evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\u00b626  We review the admission of demonstrative evidence for a manifest abuse of discretion. <em>See Cowles v. Sheeline </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 1, 12-13, 855 P.2d 93, 100; <em>Palmer by Diacon v. Farmers Ins. Exch. </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 515, 522-23, 761 P.2d 401, 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">\u00b627 At trial, Darlene sought several times to admit photographs of the hotel entryway taken seven years after the accident. The photos depicted missing strips of carpeting and corners of carpet tiles which were sticking up. The hotel objected to the admission of the photographs on the basis that due to the passage of time, wear and tear, and a change in ownership, the conditions they depicted were more prejudicial than probative. It also objected on the grounds that Darlene alleged her fall was caused by a hole in the carpeting, while the photos depicted other types of defects. Darlene contends the photographs were relevant because they served to demonstrate the effect of wear and tear and improper maintenance on the carpeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">\u00b628  Generally, all relevant evidence is admissible and that which is not relevant is not admissible. <em>See </em>Rule 402, M.R.Evid. Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issue, misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative material. <em>See </em>Rule 403, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">\u00b629  If relevant, demonstrative exhibits are admissible to supplement a witness\u2019s spoken description of the event and to clarify some issue in the case, if they are more probative than prejudicial. <em>See Cowles, </em>259 Mont. at 12, 855 P.2d at 100 (citing <em>Palmer, </em>233 Mont. at 522-23, 761 P.2d at 406). By contrast, \u201cthey are inadmissible only when they do not illustrate or make clearer some issue in the case; that is, where they are irrelevant or immaterial, or where they are of such a character as to prejudice the jury.\u201d <em>Cowles, </em>259 Mont. at 13, 855 P.2d at 100 (citing <em>Workman v. McIntyre Const. Co. </em>(1980), 190 Mont. 5, 24, 617 P.2d 1281, 1291).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">\u00b630  Here, the parties stipulated that the photos were taken seven years after the accident. The District Court heard testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>from a witness responsible for cleaning the carpeting at the time of the accident, through whom Darlene had attempted to introduce the photos, and concluded that the carpeting, as depicted, was sufficiently different from the time of the accident that the photos should not be admitted. The District Court also concluded that the photos were not relevant because they depicted defects of a different nature than those alleged by Darlene.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u00b631 Given the length of time between the accident and the photographs, as well as the change in the condition of the carpeting, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to admit the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\u00b632 Did the District Court err when it denied Plaintiff\u2019s motion to compel discovery?</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\u00b633 Because we have remanded this case for a new trial, we presume that a new discovery schedule will be established and that the parties will have the opportunity to complete any discovery they consider necessary. Therefore, we deem it unnecessary to decide the discovery issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">\u00b634 We reverse the judgment of the District Court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b288-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b288-10\">JUSTICE GRAY</author>\n<p id=\"Aqf\">specially concurs and dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">\u00b635 I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion on issue 2, which holds that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to admit photographs offered as demonstrative evidence. I dissent from the opinion on issue 1 and, for that reason, I would not remand for a new trial. As a further consequence of my dissent, I would address issue 3 and hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Darlene\u2019s motion to compel discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">\u00b636 With regard to issue 1,1 agree with the Court that the pertinent questions are 1) whether the District Court abused its discretion in admitting Vandenbosch\u2019s testimony on cross-examination that the radio caller told him that the woman who had fallen was drunk; and 2) if so, whether the admission of that testimony materially affected Darlene\u2019s substantial rights. I also agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the District Court abused its discretion in admitting the hearsay testimony. It is my view, however, that the Court is wrong \u2014 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>clearly wrong \u2014 in holding that Darlene\u2019s substantial rights were affected, thereby entitling her to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\">\u00b637 The Court\u2019s conclusion that Darlene\u2019s substantial rights were affected by admission of part of Vandenbosch\u2019s testimony and by the reference to it in closing argument by defense counsel is based on far too limited a review of the record before us, a review which would lead the reader to conclude that Vandenbosch\u2019s reference was the only testimony regarding whether Darlene had been drinking before her fall at the Sheraton. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b638 The controlling pretrial order in this case reflects that Darlene contended the Sheraton and its insurer were negligent and that their negligence resulted in serious and permanent injury to her back and legs. The defendants contended, in turn, that they were not negligent in any fashion. They further contended that, assuming some negligence on their part was found, their negligence was not a cause of any damages and/or injuries sustained by Darlene. Finally, they contended that Darlene was negligent and that her negligence contributed to the cause of her damages and/or injuries. The case proceeded to trial on the basis of the pretrial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u00b639 Darlene\u2019s counsel\u2019s opening statement to the jury was brief. The Sheraton\u2019s opening statement tracked through most of the evidence it expected to be presented during the trial. It referenced Darlene\u2019s and her companion\u2019s coming testimony that they had been out dancing, socializing and having a few drinks on the evening in question. Counsel also noted that Darlene would testify that the total of 3 to 4 rum and Diet Cokes she consumed that night \u2014 without having any food \u2014 did not have anything to do with her fall. Counsel made no mention of any coming testimony by Vandenbosch that the radio caller said the woman who fell was drunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u00b640 The 4-day trial proceeded much as outlined by the Sheraton\u2019s counsel in his opening statement, including the testimony about Darlene and her companion having a number of drinks on the night of her fall. The testimony also included, of course, Vandenbosch\u2019s inadmissible hearsay testimony referenced above.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\u00b641 In closing arguments, Darlene\u2019s counsel recounted her testimony that she had been out dancing and socializing and having a few drinks on the evening in question. He argued that the Sheraton was negligent and that, if the hole had not existed in the carpet, she would not have fallen. Darlene\u2019s counsel also argued,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>That evening \u2014 if she was drunk, and she wasn\u2019t \u2014 and she stepped in that hole and fell over backwards they would still be liable. If she was drunk, that\u2019s not a defense [to the Sheraton\u2019s negligence].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0L\">Thus, Darlene\u2019s counsel addressed the matter of her drinking directly in his closing argument, no doubt recognizing that it was necessary to do so because of the testimony of Darlene and her companion regarding their activities that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b642 The closing argument by counsel for the Sheraton runs to nearly 30 pages of transcript. It centered primarily on the lack of proof advanced by Darlene as to any negligence, but also noted that the Sheraton had raised as a defense that Darlene was at fault in the fall. Counsel then made a 1-sentence reference to the portion of Vandenbosch\u2019s testimony about which Darlene complains on appeal: \u201cHe had heard that there was some woman who had been drinking.\u201d That was the extent of counsel\u2019s reference to Darlene\u2019s drinking on the night in question and, of course, Vandenbosch\u2019s testimony aside, Darlene had admitted that she had, in fact, been drinking that night.</p>\n<p id=\"Af2\">\u00b643 Finally, the record reflects that this case went to the jury on a Special Verdict form of a relatively common type. The first question thereon was \u201cWere the defendants negligent?\u201d The second question, \u201cWas the negligence of the defendants a legal cause of Plaintiffs\u2019 [sic] damages?\u201d The third question, \u201cWas the Plaintiff negligent?\u201d As is usual in this type of special verdict form, the jury was instructed to answer yes or no to the first question and, if it answered \u201cno,\u201d to date and sign the Special Verdict. Indeed, that is what the jury did: it answered the first question \u2014 regarding whether the defendants were negligent \u2014 \u201cNo\u201d and that was the end of the jury\u2019s deliberations. In other words, the jury did not reach the causation question or the comparative negligence question.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b644 I submit that, on this record, it is impossible to conclude that Darlene\u2019s substantial rights were affected by Vandenbosch\u2019s testimony about the remainder of the radio call he received. In the context of the other evidence, including Darlene\u2019s own testimony about drinking that night, Vandenbosch\u2019s testimony and defense counsel\u2019s 1-sentence reference to it in a 30-page closing argument, simply was not \u2014 as the Court characterizes it\u2014 \u201cinflammatory\u201d and \u201cprejudicial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u00b645 Moreover, since the jury resolved the case by finding that the defendants were not negligent and did not reach the Special Verdict questions to which the extent of Darlene\u2019s drinking were rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>vant \u2014 namely, causation and comparative negligence \u2014 it cannot be said that Darlene\u2019s substantial rights were affected by the erroneous admission of a small part of Vandenbosch\u2019s testimony. Indeed, we recently addressed a similar situation in <em>Peschke v. Carroll College </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 331, 929 P.2d 874. There, we concluded that the trial court had abused its discretion in admitting a videotape into evidence. We further concluded, however, that the plaintiffs substantial rights were not materially affected because the evidence went to the issue of causation which the jury had not reached because of its threshold finding that the college was not negligent, and held that the error was harmless. <em>Peschke, </em>280 Mont. at 342-43, 929 P.2d at 881. <em>Peschke </em>clearly controls the proper resolution of issue 1 in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\u00b646 On issue 1,1 would hold that Darlene\u2019s substantial rights were not materially affected by the erroneous admission of hearsay evidence and, as a result, that the error was harmless. Thus, I would affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Darlene\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad7\">\u00b647 Finally, as noted above, I also would affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Darlene\u2019s motion to compel discovery. Our cases holding that trial courts have broad discretion in discovery-related matters are legion and require no citation. Darlene simply has not established an abuse of discretion by the District Court in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b648 I would affirm the District Court on all issues raised by Darlene on appeal and I dissent from the Court\u2019s failure to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
