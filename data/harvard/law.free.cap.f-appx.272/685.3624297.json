McCONNELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-14\">Pablo Cesar Machado-Delgado pleaded guilty to illegally reentering the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(1) &amp; (2). At sentencing, the district court enhanced Mr. Machado-Delgado\u2019s base offense level by 16 points pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), finding that a prior Arizona conviction for aggravated assault in 1998 was a felony and a crime of violence. The district court sentenced him to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment and two years of supervised release. On appeal, Mr. Ma-chado-Delgado challenges the district court\u2019s application of this enhancement. Because we find that the aggravated assault was a crime of violence, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-15\">In 1998, Mr. Machado-Delgado was arrested when Phoenix Police Officers came to his home in response to a suspected domestic violence incident. When they arrived, a struggle ensued, and he allegedly tried to resist when an officer restrained him. He pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated assault on an Arizona peace officer, a Class 6 state felony offense. Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13-1204(A)(5) (1998). He was sentenced to one month\u2019s imprisonment and three years of probation. He was deported to Mexico in September of 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-16\">In 2005, Mr. Machado-Delgado was discovered in the United States. He pleaded guilty to illegal reentry in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(1) &amp; (a)(2). The Presen-tence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) provided that Mr. Machado-Delgado\u2019s base offense level was eight, pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(a) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. The PSR recommended a sixteen \u2014 level increase to that level, pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), because his prior Arizona conviction for aggravated assault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>was a felony and a crime of violence. After a three-level downward departure for acceptance of responsibility, the PSR arrived at a total offense level of 21, a criminal history category of III, and a recommended Guidelines range of 46-57 months. At sentencing, the district court adopted the recommendations in the PSR and sentenced Mr. Machado-Delgado to 46 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Mr. Machado-Delgado filed a timely appeal, claiming that the district court erred in applying the sixteen-level upward adjustment because \u201che committed no violence when he assaulted an Arizona peace officer by resisting his arrest.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">This argument is precluded by our Court\u2019s precedent. The sixteen-level upward adjustment for crimes of violence applies to defendants who were previously deported after \u201ca conviction for a felony that is ... (ii) a crime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). Under the commentary to that enhancement, a \u201c \u2018crime of violence\u2019 means any of the following: ... aggravated assault.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2 n. l(B)(iii). \u201cThe offenses listed in the application note to \u00a7 2L1.2 \u2018are always classified as crimes of violence, regardless of whether the prior offense expressly has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez-Castillo, </em>449 F.3d 1127, 1131 (10th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Munguia-Sanchez, </em>365 F.3d 877, 881 (10th Cir.2004)) (further quotation omitted). Because Mr. Machado-Delgado was convicted of \u201caggravated assault\u201d under Ariz. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13-1204, which is enumerated in the commentary\u2019s definition of \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d his conviction qualifies for the enhancement, irrespective of whether actual force was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b710-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
