The Government concedes that a variance existed between the Indictment and the proof presented at trial, but contends that the variance was nonfatal. We conclude that the variance requires reversal of Stain\u2019s conviction for conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">A variance requires reversal \u201cif it prejudices a defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Adamson, </em>291 F.3d 606, 615 (9th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). Such prejudice may result from the \u201cinadequate opportunity to prepare a defense and exposure to unanticipated evidence at trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Morse, </em>785 F.2d 771, 775 (9th Cir.1986). \u201cOne of the primary purposes of an indictment is to inform a defendant of \u2018what he is accused of doing in violation of the criminal law, so that he can prepare his defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Adamson, </em>291 F.3d at 616 (quoting <em>United States v. Tsinhnahijinnie, </em>112 F.3d 988, 991 (9th Cir.1997)). This purpose was not served here. Based on the Indictment, Stain was prepared to defend against a single conspiracy to commit all three robberies. Because the proof at trial supported no such conspiracy and required Stain to defend against a charge not presented in the Indictment, the Indictment \u201cmisled [Stain] and obstructed his defense at trial.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Moreover, the jury was instructed \u201cin such a way as to allow [Stain] to be convicted on the basis of conduct other than that with which he was charged.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Stain\u2019s substantial rights were therefore affected, and we reverse his conviction for conspiracy. We do not remand for resentencing, however, as this reversal does not affect Stain\u2019s sentence. Nor are we persuaded that the variance as to Count One had any impact on Stain\u2019s convictions on the other Counts of the Indictment, so those convictions are not tainted by this variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">Stain argues that insufficient evidence supported his two convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). \u201c[I]n order to be guilty of aiding and abetting under \u00a7 924(c), the defendant must have directly facilitated or encouraged the use of the firearm.\u201d <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>137 F.3d 1094, 1103 (9th Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cEvidence of ... planning directed at the gun itself is sufficient to support ... convictions for aiding and abetting the use of the gun.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1104. The testimony of Kenneth Akins and Vaughan Flanders established that Stain planned for them and directed them to use firearms during the Speedway and Wells Fargo robberies. Because their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>testimony was not \u201cincredible or unsubstantial on its face\u201d and because the jury was entitled to and did believe it, we conclude that sufficient evidence supported Stain\u2019s firearm convictions. <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>803 F.2d 969, 973 (9th Cir.1986); <em>see also Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Admission of the evidence of Stain\u2019s involvement with marijuana was an abuse of discretion, as the evidence was not \u201cinextricably intertwined with the crime charged\u201d and was not admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b). <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>291 F.3d 1180, 1189 (9th Cir.2002) (discussing evidence inextricably intertwined with the crime charged), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Gonzales, </em>506 F.3d 940, 942 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc); <em>see also United States v. Rendon-Duarte, </em>490 F.3d 1142, 1144 (9th Cir.2007) (noting that evidence admissible under Rule 404(b) \u201cmust prove a material element of the offense for which the defendant is now charged\u201d). In light of the overwhelming evidence of Stain\u2019s guilt, however, the admission of the marijuana evidence was harmless. <em>See Rendon-Duarte, </em>490 F.3d at 1145. Corroborated testimony at trial established, among other things, that Stain planned each robbery with his confederates, stated his intent that guns be used during the robberies, and provided equipment (including guns) that was used during the robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">We also affirm Stain\u2019s sentence. The district court did not abuse its discretion in enhancing Stain\u2019s sentence under section 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) of the Sentencing Guidelines, as testimony by Lanita Parker and Aundrai Tucker supported the district court\u2019s finding that \u201ca gun was used in the Bally\u2019s robbery\u201d and that finding was not clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Kim-brew, </em>406 F.3d 1149, 1151 (9th Cir.2005) (reviewing district court\u2019s findings for clear error). We also affirm the district court\u2019s enhancement under section 3Bl.l(b) of the Sentencing Guidelines in light of testimony that Joey Prince recruited Akins for the Speedway robbery. <em>See United States v. Savage, </em>67 F.3d 1435, 1444 (9th Cir.1995) (noting that a person who \u201chelped bring other people into\u201d a money laundering scheme was a \u201cparticipant\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 3B1.1). Lastly, we decline to review for lack of jurisdiction the district court\u2019s implicit denial of Stain\u2019s motion for downward departure. <em>See United States v. Linn, </em>362 F.3d 1261, 1262 (9th Cir.2004) (per curiam). Indeed, by finding that Stain played an aggravating role in the robbery, the district court implicitly found that Stain did <em>not </em>play a mitigating role. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3B1.1, 3B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Conviction on Count One REVERSED; remainder of judgment and sentence AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b644-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
