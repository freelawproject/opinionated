On appeal, London challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 29 motion, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to convict him. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-24\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to deny a Rule 29 motion de novo. <em>United, States v. Osborne, </em>514 F.3d 377, 385 (4th Cir.2008). Where, as here, the motion was based on a claim of insufficient evidence, \u201c[t]he verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>Osborne, </em>514 F.3d at 385. This court \u201ccan reverse a conviction on insufficiency grounds only when the prosecution\u2019s failure is clear.\u201d <em>United States v. Moye, </em>454 F.3d 390, 394 (4th Cir.) (en banc) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 452, 166 L.Ed.2d 321 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-26\">With these standards in mind, we have carefully considered London\u2019s claims that the evidence was insufficient to convict him because officers did not find guns or drugs on his person during the search on May 5, 2005, and because Agent Tadeo\u2019s testimony revealed that Edward Woods, a co-conspirator, was the drug supplier. Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>review of the trial testimony convinces us that the evidence was sufficient to convict London on each count. <em>See United States v. Mastrapa, </em>509 F.3d 652, 657 (4th Cir. 2007) (discussing elements of conspiracy); <em>United States v. Stephens, </em>482 F.3d 669, 673 (4th Cir.2007) (setting forth elements of \u00a7 924(c)(1) offense); <em>Moye, </em>454 F.3d at 395 (discussing elements of \u00a7 922(g) offense); <em>United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 519 (4th Cir.2005) (discussing elements of possession with intent to distribute); <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 873 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc) (setting forth elements of aiding and abetting). Finally, to the extent London contends on appeal that several witnesses against him were not credible, \u201cwe do not weigh the evidence or assess the credibility of witnesses, but assume that the jury resolved any discrepancies [in the testimony] in favor of the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>510 F.3d 433, 440 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Because the evidence was sufficient to support London\u2019s convictions, the district court did not err in denying the Rule 29 motion. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
