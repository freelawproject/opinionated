The arbitration award dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Kevin Nohilly, Gustav Albert Fin-gado, and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. (\u201cthe defendants\u201d), and denied them any relief. For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">We write exclusively for the parties, who are familiar with the factual context and legal history of this case. Therefore, we will set forth only those facts necessary to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">The plaintiffs held accounts with Merrill Lynch at its Freehold, New Jersey office. Kevin Nohilly, a Financial Advisor for Merrill Lynch, initially advised both of the plaintiffs. However, after the plaintiffs divorced in 2000, they split their assets and Clemente sought the advice of Gus Finga-do, the Resident Manager of the Freehold office, while Waszkiewiez continued to use Nohilly\u2019s services.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-16\">On January 29, 2004, the plaintiffs filed a Statement of Claim with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (\u201cNASD\u201d), alleging that the defendants had violated tort law,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> contract law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and New Jersey criminal law,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in them dealings with the plaintiffs. These claims stem from an alleged \u201cstop-loss order\u201d that would have bound Nohilly, and later Fin-gado, to either liquidate or convert the plaintiffs\u2019 investments if the value of the investments dropped by a certain percentage.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-17\">The parties agreed to resolve the matter in an arbitration proceeding under the NASD using a panel of three arbitrators. Between May and August 2006, the panel conducted a fourteen-day arbitration hearing. On August 7, 2006, the panel issued them award, dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, denying all relief to the plaintiffs, and assessing the fees each party must pay. The defendants filed a motion with the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, seeking to confirm the award. The plaintiffs filed a cross motion, seeking to vacate the award. The District Court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to confirm the award, and denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to vacate the award. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-19\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 9, and we have jurisdiction under 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)(1)(D). We exercise de novo review over the District Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>denial of a motion to vacate an arbitration award. <em>Dluhos v. Strasberg, </em>321 F.3d 365, 369 (3d Cir.2003). Our review of the arbitrator\u2019s decision, however, is \u201cextremely deferential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 370. \u201cThe net result ... is generally to affirm easily the arbitration award.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">ra.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The plaintiffs argue that the District Court erred in denying the motion to vacate the arbitration award because the panel of arbitrators were corrupt and biased in violation of the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The FAA permits a court to vacate the award \u201c(1) where the award was procured by corruption, fi\u2019aud, or undue means; [or] (2) where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators, or either of them[.]\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a). Thus, \u201c[v]acatur is appropriate only in \u2018exceedingly narrow\u2019 circumstances[.]\u201d <em>Metromedia Energy, Inc. v. Enserch Energy Servs., </em>409 F.3d 574, 578 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">In demonstrating bias, we require a showing of \u201cevident partiality,\u201d meaning that \u201cthe challenging party must show a reasonable person would have to conclude that the arbitrator was partial to the other party to the arbitration.\u201d <em>Kaplan v. First Options of Chicago, Inc., </em>19 F.3d 1503, 1523 n. 30 (3d Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Moreover, \u201cevident partiality is strong language and requires proof of circumstances powerfully suggestive of bias.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">The instances that the plaintiffs cite as demonstrating the arbitrator\u2019s bias do not rise to the level of demonstrating \u201cevident partiality.\u201d First, the plaintiffs argue that the defendants\u2019 counsel and one of the arbitrators had an exchange in which counsel gave the arbitrator an empty binder, and the two joked that cash was inside the binder. The joke, while not in the best judgment of either the arbitrator or counsel, does not \u201cpowerfully s\u00faggest[]\u201d that the arbitrator was so biased that he could not render a fair decision, especially con- . sidering that it was clearly a joke that was heard by everyone at the hearing. Second, the plaintiffs allege that the same arbitrator and Merrill Lynch personnel had ex parte communications, and argue that the arbitrator \u201clikely determined ... that they were really \u2018a bunch \u25a0 of nice guys,\u2019 \u201d passed these sentiments on to the fellow panelists, and the three panelists decided to find in the defendants\u2019 favor as a result. This argument is, at best, speculative, and is far too tenuous for a reasonable person to conclude that the three panelists were biased in favor of the defendants. Finally, the plaintiffs allege that ' the same arbitrator possibly communicated with a Smith Barney executive regarding this arbitration because, when the plaintiffs contacted the executive, he stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>he was aware that the arbitrator was on this panel. They argue that this alleged communication constituted witness tampering. However, the plaintiffs have offered no proof as to how the executive knew the identity of the arbitrator; thus, any theory is once again speculative, and even if it were true, the contact involved one arbitrator, not the panel. Moreover, Mr. Clemente testified that the executive\u2019s reason for not serving as a witness for the plaintiffs was because he served on other arbitration panels, not because of any contact with the arbitrator, thus negating any suggestion of witness tampering.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Based on the foregoing, we cannot \u201cconclude that the [panel of] arbitrators] w[ere] partial to the other party to the arbitration.\u201d <em>Kaplan, </em>19 F.3d at 1523 n. 30. Therefore, we cannot vacate the arbitration award because the evidence does not demonstrate that the arbitrators were corrupt or biased.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The plaintiffs also argue that the District Court erred in denying the motion to vacate the arbitration award because the panel of arbitrators \u201cmanifestly disregarded the law.\u201d We have stated that one of the \u201cexceedingly narrow circumstances\u201d in which vacatur is appropriate includes \u201cwhere an arbitration panel manifestly disregards, rather than merely erroneously interprets, the law.\u201d <em>Metromedia Energy, </em>409 F.3d at 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-11\">The plaintiffs argue that they presented the panel with a document that was \u201cthe equivalent of a smoking gun,\u201d and as a result, any decision other than one in favor of the plaintiffs demonstrated a \u201cmanifest disregard\u201d of the laws of negligence and fraud. However, the authenticity of this document, which was a fax on Merrill Lynch\u2019s letterhead discussing the plaintiffs\u2019 instructions regarding their \u201cstop-loss\u201d order, was a contested issue during the arbitration proceedings. Thus, the panel\u2019s decision did not demonstrate that it made a choice to manifestly disregard the law, but instead only that it made a choice not to credit a document as authentic. This question was one of fact, not of law, and therefore, we cannot find that the panel manifestly disregarded the applicable laws of negligence and fraud.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">The plaintiffs argue that the panel\u2019s award of forum fees against the plaintiffs is invalid because it is unconscionable. Although the FAA demonstrates a \u201cliberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements,\u201d <em>Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Carp., </em>500 U.S. 20, 24, 111 S.Ct. 1647, 114 L.Ed.2d 26 (1991) (citation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>internal quotation omitted), a provision of an arbitration agreement \u201cmay be revoked upon \u2018grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Southland Corp. v. Keating, </em>465 U.S. 1, 10-11, 104 S.Ct. 852, 79 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984) (quoting 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2). Thus, a court may invalidate an arbitration provision using the \u201cgenerally recognized contract defense[ ] ... [of] unconscionability.\u201d <em>Delta Funding Corp. v. Harris, </em>189 N.J. 28, 912 A.2d 104, 111 (2006) (citing <em>Doctor\u2019s As-socs., Inc. v. Casarotto, </em>517 U.S. 681, 687, 116 S.Ct. 1652, 134 L.Ed.2d 902 (1996)). In <em>Harris, </em>the Supreme Court of New Jersey held that, in a contract of adhesion, a \u201ccost-shifting\u201d provision that permits the arbitrator to allocate the entire cost of arbitration to a consumer would be unconscionable if the arbitrator interprets and applies the provision in that manner. 912 A.2d at 111-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The present case is distinguishable from <em>Harris </em>in two ways. First and foremost, the contract in the present case is not one of adhesion. A contract of adhesion is \u201cpresented to the public on standardized printed forms, on a take-it-or-leave-it basis without opportunity for purchasers to negotiate any of the terms.\u201d <em>Rudbart v. North Jersey Dist. Water Supply Comm\u2019n, </em>127 N.J. 344, 605 A.2d 681, 686 (1992). Here, the plaintiffs chose to submit their claim with the NASD, seeking an NASD arbitration; the plaintiffs were not bound to arbitration \u201con a take-it-or-leave-it basis.\u201d Thus, the decision in <em>Harris, </em>which applied to contracts of adhesion, would not apply to the present case. However, even if <em>Harris </em>did apply, the present case is distinguishable because the panel of arbitrators did not interpret or apply the provision to shift all of the costs to the plaintiffs. Instead, the panel assigned only fifty-two percent of the forum fees to the plaintiffs. Therefore, the panel\u2019s award of forum fees to the plaintiffs based on the arbitration provision was not unconscionable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">rv.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">We have considered the parties\u2019 remaining arguments and find them without merit. For these reasons, we will affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-12\">. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had engaged in fraud, equitable fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of a fiduciary duty, negligence, negligence in violating the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, and negligence in violating the rules of the NASD.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b199-20\">. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had breached their contract, their implied contract, and their quasi-contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b199-21\">. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had violated New Jersey law by engaging in racketeering.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b200-8\">. The defendants argue that the plaintiffs waived their right to argue that the arbitrators were biased because they did not raise their objections to the arbitrators, and in fact, thanked the arbitrators for conducting the proceedings. Other Courts of Appeals would agree that the plaintiffs have waived this argument. <em>See Marino v. Writers Guild of Am., </em>992 F.2d 1480, 1484 (9th Cir.1993) (\"[A] party may not sit idle through an arbitration procedure and \u2022 then collaterally attack that procedure on grounds not raised before the arbitrators when the result turns out to be adverse.... This rule even extends to questions, such as arbitrator bias, that go to the very heart of arbitral fairness.\u201d (internal citation omitted)); <em>see also Brook v. Peak Intern., Ltd., </em>294 F.3d 668, 674 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United Food &amp; Comm. Workers v. Marval Poultry Co., </em>876 F.2d 346, 352 (4th Cir.1989). While we have never published an opinion on this specific point, we find it unnecessary to decide whether the argument has been waived in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b201-8\">. The plaintiffs further argue that the District Court erred in denying the plaintiffs' request to conduct discovery on these matters. We review the District Court's denial of discovery for an abuse of discretion. <em>Brumfield v. Sanders, </em>232 F.3d 376, 380 (3d Cir.2000). In the present case, plaintiffs' counsel admitted to the District Court that he thought it was \"highly unlikely\u201d that the arbitrator engaged in misconduct, but argued that because it was not \"impossible,\u201d he should be allowed to conduct discovery. The District Court concluded that the plaintiffs' assertions of misconduct were unsupported, and there was no appearance of impartiality on the part of the arbitrators. We cannot conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in choosing not to permit discovery, particularly considering that plaintiffs' counsel even admitted that it was \"highly unlikely\u201d that an impropriety actually occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b201-15\">. The plaintiffs further argue that the panel\u2019s manifest disregard for the applicable law resulted in a violation of several public policies, including the public policy of protecting investors. However, because the panel did not manifestly disregard the law, we find these arguments unavailing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b202-5\">. The plaintiffs make two additional arguments as to the forum fees, but both are unavailing. First, the plaintiffs argue that the forum fees were not part of their submission to NASD arbitration. However, they chose to submit their claims to NASD arbitration, and the NASD arbitration rule specifically states that \u201c[t]he arbitrators, in their awards, shall determine the amount chargeable to the parties as forum fees and shall determine who shall pay such forum fees.\u201d NASD Rule 10332(c). Thus, the plaintiffs were on notice that the panel could assess forum fees against the plaintiffs. Second, the plaintiffs argue that the panel could not assess forum fees against the plaintiff's custodial accounts because the plaintiffs had withdrawn the claims regarding those accounts. However, although the arbitration award names the custodial accounts in discussing the \"claimants,\" it subsequently states that the plaintiffs withdrew these claims, and does not indicate that it was assessing any costs regarding these claims. Therefore, we cannot find that the panel erroneously assessed the forum fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
