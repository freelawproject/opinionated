The actions were consolidated, and the district court granted FPLs motions for summary judgment. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"aec-dedup-0\">nAn^nnATixm 1. Jb5AGK.GKUUND.</p>\n<p id=\"AG8\">A. Radiation Releases.</p>\n<p id=\"arg-dedup-0\">FPL began operations at its St. Lucie nuclear power plant (\u201cthe Plant\u201d) near Port St. Lucie, Florida, in 1976. During construction of the Plant in 1975, a wash trough, or \u201csink,\u201d was incorrectly plumbed in the radiation control area. Unbeknownst to FPL, the sink diverted its wastewater directly into the standard sanitary sewage system. In 1978, the Plant began using the incorrectly-plumbed sink to rinse items such as respirators and mops, which had been exposed to radiation. From 1978 to 1979, the Plant\u2019s standard sewage was deposited into a septic tank that was emptied daily and shipped by truck to the Fort Pierce Sewage Treat-ment Plant.</p>\n<p id=\"A8q\">In December 1979, the Plant started an on-site sewage treatment facility. On Jan-uary 8, 1982, and June 22, 1982, sludge from the on-site sewage treatment facility was transported to unoccupied farmland located near \u201cGlades Cutoff\u2019 road (\u201cthe Glades Cutoff site\u201d). The sludge was dis-persed onto a field at the Glades Cutoff site, which was licensed and regulated, but onjy for fcbe disposal of non-radioactive sewage sludge,</p>\n<p id=\"ar6-dedup-0\">0n September 10, 1982&gt; the incorrectly-plumbed gink clogged; and FpL gubse_ quen\u00fcy discovered the original plumbing m.or_ FPL notified the Nuclear Reguia. tory Commission the Florida Of-f\u00edce of Radiation Control, and the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Serviceg (\u201cFDHRS\u201d) about the error and unmonitored disposals. FDHRS took soil and sampleg from varioug locations at the Glades Cutoff site. The presence of Cobalt-60, a radionuclide, was measured , , . , , and recorded. NRC also took samples, and an aerial survey was performed by helicopter. FPL then removed contaminated soil from the Glades Cutoff site. 0ver the next tw0 weeks, more samples were taken and additional contaminated S\u00b0F was removed. In October 1982, FDHRS concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afu\">Based on the decontamination limit of five (5) picocuries per gram [pCi/g] averaged over one square meter ... Florida Power and Light Company has achieved adequate decontamination. Post clean up maximum activities\u2019 levels were no greater than one-half the decontamination limit. These data were from sampies taken at the sites of greatest gam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>ma exposure levels remaining after the decontamination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"af0-dedup-0\">NRC opined: \u201cit is unlikely that anyone received a measurable radiation dose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ARWc\">B. Children\u2019s Cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"AWz\">Ashton Lowe was born on May 3, 1988. At the age of seven, Ashton was diagnosed with medulloblastoma. From his birth until the time of his diagnosis, Ashton lived in Port St. Lucie, Florida. Ashton died of his cancer on May 21, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"az2-dedup-0\">Zachary Finestone was born on March 1, 1994. Prior to his birth, his parents lived near the Plant. Zachary lived in Port St. Lucie, Florida, from August 1995 through August 1998. He was diagnosed with stage IV neuroblastoma, which had spread to his bone marrow, at the age of six. Zachary continues battling his cancer today.</p>\n<p id=\"AMfY\">Plaintiffs expert, Dr. Hari Sharma, presented evidence in this case that the baby teeth of both Ashton Lowe and Zachary Finestone contained elevated levels of Strontium-90 (\u201cSR-90\u201d). SR-90 is a radioactive isotope created by nuclear fission reactions. Common sources of SR-90 in-elude nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons testing fallout. However, routine testing of Florida\u2019s citrus fruit shows that SR-90 has been detected in citrus fruit in St. Lucie County since before the Plant began its operations. .</p>\n<p id=\"AvgO\">C. Proceedings Below.</p>\n<p id=\"A2J\">i Appellants brought their claims against FPL in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida under the Price-Anderson Act, which provides for federal lawsuits asserting public liabili- ^ due to exposure to nuclear radiation. <em>^ee ^ </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2210(n)(2), 2014(hh). FPL filed, a motion for determination of duty owed, and the district court subsequently issued an order holding that the standard of care in Appellants action is se^ ^'or^ ky the Radiation Dose Limits for Individual Members of the Public [outlined *n C.F.R. \u00a7 20.1301] applicable for the time of the releases in question\u201d (\u201cthe Dose Limits\u201d). <em>Finestone v. Fla. Power &amp; Light Co. </em>319 K.Supp.2d 1347, 1350 (S.D.Fla.2004). The district court rejected Appellants\u2019 contention that the standard of care should also include a requirement ]jcensee companies \u201cachieve ... doses ^o members of the public that are as low as js reasonably achievable (ALARA)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1349-50; <em>see also </em>10 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.1101(b).</p>\n<p id=\"ACnt\">Extensive discovery was conducted, and Appellants contend that FPL consistently refused to provide documents crucial to their case. FPL concedes that it \u201cinadvertently\u201d omitted from production a single report on radiation releases in the Glades Cutoff site (\u201cthe Bailey Report\u201d), which Appellants uncovered later in the litigation. As a result of FPL\u2019s failure to timely disclose the Bailey Report, Appellants were granted an adverse jury instruction noting the belated production, and discovery was extended six weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak-\">FPL subsequently filed motions for summary judgment, and Appellants moved for partial summary judgment. The parties filed motions to strike the testimony of various experts. After four days of <em>Dau-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number><em>bert </em>hearings on the parties\u2019 motions to strike, the district court entered an Omnibus Order on January 6, 2006, 2006 WL 267330. The Omnibus Order excluded the testimony of four of Appellants\u2019 expert witnesses and granted FPL\u2019s motions for final summary judgment based on Appellants\u2019 inability to proffer admissible evidence to support their claim that FPL released radiation in excess of the Dose Limits. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"acm-dedup-0\">II. DISCUSSION.</p>\n<p id=\"As6d\">Two broad issues are presented to this Court First Amellante attack the dis-\\_/vUi li\u00bb 1 lloUj xiJDJJCilclIlLo dU\u00fcdLIi bile vilo trict court\u2019s conclusion regarding the appli.cable standard of care in public liability actions under the Priee-Anderson Act. They contend that this Court should reconsider and revise its holding in <em>Roberts v. Florida Power &amp; Light Co., </em>146 F.3d 1305 (11th Cir.1998), and incorporate state law standards of care. In the alternative, they request that we apply ALARA as a requisite standard of care under <em>Roberts. </em>Second, Appellants argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of FPL. They contend that the district court misapplied <em>Dauberi </em>standards when it excluded Appellants\u2019 expert witnesses\u2019 testimony regarding radiation and the Dose Limits, and ignored the \u201cprejudice\u201d caused by FPL\u2019s late production of the Bailey Report.</p>\n<p id=\"Apa\">A. Standard of Care.</p>\n<p id=\"ATZb\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., </em>498 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Burton v. Tampa Hous. Auth., </em>271 F.3d 1274, 1276-77 (11th Cir.2001)). Moreover, a court\u2019s determination of the applicable standard of care in a case like the one at hand is a question of law, also reviewed <em>de novo, See, e.g., Jones v. United, Space Alliance, L.L.C., </em>494 F.3d 1306, 1309 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"AOe\">In <em>Roberts, </em>thig Court held that ,&lt;federal gafety regulations conclusively es-tab]ish the duty of care owed in a public liability action\u00bb 146 F.3d at i308. While Appellants have requested that we recongider thig holdingj \u00abit ig the \u00f1rmly egtab. lighed rule of thig Circuit that each guc. ceeding panel is bound by the holding of the firgt pane] to address an issue of laW; unless and until that holding is overruled en banc, or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Unit</em>ed <em>States v. Hogan, </em>986 F.2d 1364, 1369 (11th Cir.1993). Therefore, we are bound . _ . \"</p>\n<p id=\"abd-dedup-0\">However, <em>Roberts </em>does not preclude a holding that ALARA is a standard of care hi public liability actions \u2014 if, in fact, ALARA is mandated by federal safety reg-dilations. The opinion of the district court for the Northern District of Ohio in <em>McCafferty v. Centerior Serv. Co., </em>983 F.Supp. 715 (N.D.Ohio 1997), may be per-suasive on the question whether ALARA is a current standard of care in public liability actions, as set forth by federal regulation- <em>See also </em>Jason Bjorn Aamodt, Com-ment&gt; <em>Regulating the Standard of Care 0wed to the Public During an Emergency </em>o\u00ed <em>a Nuclear Power Plant, </em>16 Energy L.J. 181,184-89 (1995) (discussing, in part, how NRC guidance provides a measurable and precise ALARA standard); 58 Fed.Reg. 67657 (Jan. 1, 1994) (noting that \u201c[t]he revised standards for Protection a\u00aeainst' radiation incorporated scientific information and reflected changes in the basic philosophy of radiation protection that had occurred since the promulgation of the original regulations\u201d). In <em>McCafferty, </em>the court reasoned that a 1991 amendment adding mandatory ALARA language to a newly created subpart under the federal regulation labeled \u201cStandards for Protection Against Radiation,\u201d which also con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>tains the Dose Limits relied upon by the district court below, \u201cdemonstrates an intention to have the ALARA principle ... act as a standard for radiation protection.\u201d 983 F.Supp. at 719.</p>\n<p id=\"AJHq\">While this Court finds the <em>McCafferty </em>rationale reasonable, we are not called upon to decide whether ALARA is mandated by current regulation. Rather, it is undisputed that the radiation releases at issue in this case occurred prior to the 1991 amendment discussed in <em>McCafferty. </em>In fact, Appellants conceded at oral argument that in order for this Court to conclude ALARA applies to their claims, we must hold that ALARA was the requisite standard of care \u201call along\u201d; that cannot be done.</p>\n<p id=\"afu-dedup-0\">As correctly held by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>In re TMI, </em>67 F.3d 1103 (3d Cir.1995), an ALARA standard of care did not exist in the federal regulations prior to the 1991 amendment. Before the amendment, ALARA language, as it pertains to public radiation exposure, was lo-eated in a portion of the regulations dealing with licensing, which also included a clarification that the guidelines outlined therein were \u201cnot to be construed as radiation protection standards.\u201d 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.34a(a). ALARA was also included in a different portion of the \u201cStandards for Protection Against Radiation\u201d section referenced above. This particular pre-amendment language, which was officially removed in 1994 as superseded by the revised radiation protection standards initiated in 1991, <em>see </em>58 Fed.Reg. 67657 (Jan. 1, 1994), stated only that licensees <em>\u201cshould, </em>in addition to complying with the <em>requirements </em>set forth in this part, make every reasonable effort to maintain radiation exposures, and releases of radioactive materials in effluents to unrestricted areas, as low as is reasonably achievable,\u201d 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.1 (1991) (emphasis added). This language does not establish the pre-amendment ALARA requirement for public liability that Appellants want this Court to adopt, and we affirm the district court\u2019s use of the Dose Limits as the applicable standard of care in this case,</p>\n<p id=\"Atz\">B. Evidentialy Bui den.</p>\n<p id=\"azj-dedup-0\">Appellants nevertheless maintain that they presented sufficient evidence, in the form of expert testimony, that FPL breached the Dose Limits. In its Omnibus Order, the district court excluded the testimony of Arnold Gundersen, Martin Resnikoff, Stanley Waligora, Christopher Busby, and Robert Peter Gale under the principies of <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993)- Appellants focus their appellate argument on the exclusion of their \u201cdose calculation\u201d experts: Gundersen, Resnikoff, and Waligora. Aside from a sinSle footnote in their initial brief&gt; Appellants do not discuss Gale and Busby&gt; two of their \u201ccausation\u201d experts, Because we do n\u00b0t reach the issue of causation unless Appellants can show they bave sufficient evidence of a breach of the Dose Limits&gt;this Court ^ focus its initial in(3uiry on the dose calculation experts. To that end&gt; Appellants argue that althouSb tbe district court couched its ruling in terms of tbeir \u201creliability,\u201d it is clear from the Omnibus Order that the dose calculation experts\u2019 testimony was excluded only because their conclusions conflicted those of the NRC.</p>\n<p id=\"A7X\">A district court\u2019s decision to exclude expert testimony is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 152, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999). \u201cThat standard applies as much to the trial court\u2019s decisions about how to determine reliability as to its ultimate conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, \u201cwe defer to the district court\u2019s ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>unless it is \u2018manifestly erroneous,\u2019 \u201d and \u201cwe give the district court \u2018considerable leeway1 in the execution of its duty.\u201d <em>Rink v. Cheminova, Inc., </em>400 F.8d 1286, 1291 (11th Cir.2005) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"A9CN\">Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 702, as well as <em>Daubert </em>and its progeny, \u201cdistrict courts must act as \u2018gatekeepers[,\u2019 admitting] expert testimony only if it is both reliable and relevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo fulfil their obligation under <em>Daubert, </em>district courts must engage in a rigorous inquiry to determine whether: \u2018(1) the expert is qualified to testify competently regarding the matters he intends to address; (2) the methodology by which the expert reaches his conclusions is sufficiently reliable as determined by the sort of inquiry mandated in Daubert; and (3) the testimony assists the trier of fact, through the application of scientific, technical, or specialized expertise, to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1291-92 ducting <em>City of Tuscaloosa v. Harcros Chems., Inc., </em>158 F.3d 548, 562 (11th Cir. 1998)). \u201cThe party offering the expert has the burden of satisfying each of these three elements by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1292 (citing <em>Allison v. McGhan Med. Corp., </em>184 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"aot-dedup-0\">\u201cIn ascertaining the reliability of a particular scientific expert opinion, we consider, to the extent possible: (1) whether the expert\u2019s theory can be and has been tested; (2) whether the theory has been subjected to peer review and publication; (3) the known or potential rate of error of the particular scientific technique; and (4) whether the technique is generally accepted in the scientific community.\u201d <em>Quiet Tech. DC-8, Inc. v. Hurel-Dubois UK Ltd., </em>326 F.3d 1333, 1341 (11th Cir.2003) (citing <em>McCorvey v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>298 F.3d 1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2002)). \u201cNotably, however, these factors do not exhaust the universe of considerations that may bear on the reliability of a given expert opinion, and a federal court should consider any additional factors that may advance its Rule 702 analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Kumho Tire Co., </em>526 U.S. at 150, 119 S.Ct. 1167).</p>\n<p id=\"ASvF\">Yet, a \u201cdistrict court\u2019s gatekeeper role under <em>Daubert </em>\u2018is not intended to supplant the adversary system or the role of the jury.\u2019\u201d <em>Maiz v. Virani, </em>253 F.3d 641, 666 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Allison, </em>184 F.3d at 1311). \u201c[Vjigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means \u00b0f attacking shaky but admissible evidence.\u201d <em>Allison, </em>184 F.3d at 1311 (quoting <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 596, 113 S.Ct. 2786). \u201cThe judge\u2019s role is to keep unreliable and irrelevant information from the jury be-cause of its inability to assist in factual determinations, its potential to create confusion, and its lack of probative value.\u201d <em>Id- </em>at 1311-12. After a thorough review of fhe dose calculation experts\u2019 reports and testimony, it is evident that the district court did not abuse its discretion; exclusion of these experts under <em>Daubert </em>was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"AhWt\">This Court does question the district court\u2019s focus on radiation samples taken by government agencies as a \u201creal world test\u201d of the conclusions of Gundersen, Waligora, and Resnikoff. While reliability of an ex-Pert\u2019s opinion can be gauged by \u201cwhether ^ie exPei't\u2019s theory can be and has been tested,\" <em>Quiet Tech. DC-8, Inc., </em>326 F.3d at 1341, the sample results by government agencies are not actual tests of these ex-Perts\u2019 theories. In fact, there are plausible explanations that could account for the differences between these experts\u2019 conclusi\u00b0ns&gt; if correct, and the sample results.</p>\n<p id=\"aff-dedup-2\">However, in this case, the district court also faulted the assumptions underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>Gundersen, Waligora, and Resnikoffs methodologies. For instance, Gundersen bases his expert conclusions on hypotheticals that begin with the assumption that a truckload of radioactive sewage plant solids shipped from the Plant for disposal in Barnwell, South Carolina, in 1991 is the material that was dug up from the Glades . . . .. . Cutoff site nearly a decade earlier in 1982. . , ., \u25a0 , , There is, however, no evidence to support ... ,. ,, , ,, ono , . this assumption that the 828 cubic feet of , \u2022. , ... . , . i aa material, which weighs approximately 100,-000 pounds, was from the Glades Cutoff, nor any explanation why the Plant would hold on to such a large amount of material for almost ten years. Yet, Gundersen takes the radiation concentration of the sewage solids in the 1991 shipment and extrapolates backward using decay calculations for radioactive isotopes \u2014 effectively multiplying the radiation measurement for the 1991 shipment \u2014 to conclude that the material dumped in 1982 had an excessive radiation concentration. Simply put, this is \u201cthe kind of scientifically unsupported \u2018leap of faith\u2019 which is condemned by <em>Daubert.\u201d Rink, </em>400 F.3d at 1292 (citing <em>Rider v. Sandoz Pharms. Corp., </em>295 F.3d 1194, 1202 (11th Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"AaLd\">' Waligora and Resnikoff, authors of a joint report, also made unsupported \u201cleaps of faith.\u201d For example, these experts extrapolated a dose exposure calculation by using an isotope ratio that FPL submitted to the NEC in its Fmal Safety Analysis Report (\u201cFSAR) aspartoks ongmal license application. This FSAR ratio was . . , <em>\u201e </em>, \u201e \u2022 , derived from the contents of a spent fuel , . ,, pool m a separate building from the source \u201e ,, f ^ . . of the Glades Cutoff site sewage sludge. tt \u2022 Using the FSAR isotope ratio, Waligora \u201c f. and Resnikoff concluded that other radion- . 1-4, ii uclides were present m the sewage sludge . ,,41 ,,1 1. 4. 4 and calculated a total radiation concentration in excess of the Dose Limits. However, no expert was able to provide support for the assumption that the isotope ratios in the spent fuel pool would equate to those in the sewage sludge. When ques-tioned at his <em>Daubert </em>hearing, Waligora would not say that use of the FSAR ratio, was appropriate or scientifically accept-able. Waligora could only testify that \u201cit was the best thing we could go with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ABF\">_ , . , . . . The choices made and utilized by these , experts diner from a situation m which an ^ x , expert inputs hard data arrived at by <em>1 </em>\u201e ,, ,, . \u201e 7 unassailable methods. <em>Rink, </em>400 F.3d at . . , , , 1293' Thls 18 not a case where the tnal court reJected exPerts only because their fmal inclusions were inconsistent with the fmdinSs of other exPerts or a&amp;'encies' \u201cHere&gt; the data fthese three excluded ex\" perts] produced was driven by the method-olo8T IM used- and thus the district cour^s inquiry into how [they]^ arrived at ^Im data is not inappropriate. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, we cannot say the district court erred when it examined and rejected unsupported assumptions underlying these three experts\u2019 methodologies. And, with-out their dose calculation experts, Appellants have not presented the sufficient ad-missible evidence of a breach of the Dose Limits needed to survive summary judgment on their Price-Anderson Act public lability actions.</p>\n<p id=\"AijK\">Appellants nevertheless maintain ^ summary judgment is inappropriate beeause ^ district court found that they ha(J been judiced b the Mure to pro. duce the Bailey Report.

Moreover, discovery was extended six weeks to allow Appellants time to follow up on information garnered in the Bailey Report. It appears from the record that no additional discovery extension was sought. Apparently, this was because Appellants were eager to keep their January 2006 trial date due to concerns related to Zachary\u2019s serious illness. We cannot find fault, therefore, with the district court\u2019s decision to enter judgment based on the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">III. CONCLUSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">These are truly tragic cases. We extend our deepest sympathies to the families involved, and we sincerely hope that Zachary prevails in his fight against cancer.
