Cartelli, Jr. and Albert D. LaTouche appeal from judgments of conviction on nine counts of mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, following a jury trial, entered on March 11, 2005 and March 18, 2005, respectively, in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (Underhill, J.). Cartelli was sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>tenced principally to a term of 42 months\u2019 imprisonment, and LaTouche was sentenced principally to a term of 33 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court imposed joint and several liability on both defendants for restitution in the amount of $757,000. Cartelli\u2019s appeal includes an appeal from a separate conviction for credit card fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(5), which was consolidated with the mail fraud case for sentencing purposes. We assume the parties\u2019 familiai\u2019ity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">On appeal, Cartelli raises two issues: first, that the district court erred in vertically and horizontally departing from the Sentencing Guidelines range in sentencing him to 42 months\u2019 imprisonment, and second, that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a mistrial based on the publicity generated by a U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office press release prior to the completion of all jury deliberations. La-Touche also raises two issues on appeal: (1) the district court erred in providing a \u201cno ultimate harm\u201d instruction as part of the jury charge, and (2) the district court abused its discretion in declining to hold a hearing to investigate conversations two of the jurors may have had with them wives. We address the issues in turn, consolidating the two allegations of juror taint.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">A. <em>Cartelli\u2019s Enhanced Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Cartelli argues that the district court erred in vertically departing from the Guidelines calculated offense level of 18 to a higher offense level that included in its range 42 months\u2019 imprisonment. We review the sentence imposed by the district court for both substantive and procedural reasonableness. <em>United States v. Rattoballi, </em>452 F.3d 127, 131 (2d Cir.2006). We review the district court\u2019s \u201cexercises of discretion for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Selioutsky, </em>409 F.3d 114, 119 (2d Cir.2005). The district court based its vertical departure on application note 11 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1 of the 1998 version of the Sentencing Guidelines, the version applied in this case. Application note 11 provides, \u201c[i]n cases in which the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) does not fully capture the harmfulness and seriousness of the conduct, an upward departure may be warranted.\u201d This Court has noted that the factors in application note 11 are \u201cencouraged factor[s],\u201d meaning that \u201cthe court is authorized to depart if the applicable Guideline does not already take [them] into account.\u201d <em>United States v. Karro, </em>257 F.3d 112, 121 (2d Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 96, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996)). In light of the victims\u2019 statements of the additional harms they suffered from the crimes, which went beyond mere monetary losses, the district court was within its discretion to depart vertically in consideration of those non-monetary harms.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Cartelli further argues that the district court erred in horizontally departing from the Guidelines when it increased Cartelli\u2019s criminal history from category I to category II, contending that by doing so the district court eliminated any benefit Car-telli might have received by the consolidation of the two convictions for sentencing purposes and the grouping of offenses under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(d). In authorizing departures from a Guidelines calculated Criminal History Category, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 provides that \u201c[i]f the information indicates that the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, the court may consider imposing a sentence departing from the otherwise applicable guideline range.\u201d While the district court acknowledged that but for the fortuity of the timing of the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>convictions, Cartelli would not have received the benefit of starting with Criminal History Category I, this was not the district court\u2019s sole basis for its upward departure. The district court\u2019s decision to horizontally depart was also based on Car-telli\u2019s prior uncharged conduct, his abandonment of legitimate employment in favor of engaging in fraud, and his high likelihood of recidivism. We cannot find that the district court exceeded its allowable discretion in finding that Criminal History Category I did not adequately represent Cartelli\u2019s past criminal history and in departing horizontally to Criminal History Category II.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">B. <em>\u201cNo Ultimate Harm\u201d Instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">LaTouche argues that the district court erred in giving a \u201cno ultimate harm\u201d charge to the jury because the charge improperly defined the specific intent necessary to constitute that element of the offense. In support of his argument, La-Touche relies on our ruling in <em>United States v. Rossomando, </em>144 F.3d 197 (2d Cir.1998), where this Court found error in the use of a \u201cno ultimate harm\u201d instruction. LaTouche\u2019s arguments, however, fail to consider our subsequent rulings in <em>United States v. Koh, </em>199 F.3d 632 (2d Cir.1999), and <em>United States v. Berkovich, </em>168 F.3d 64 (2d Cir.1999), in which we upheld the use of \u201cno ultimate harm\u201d instructions. As in <em>Berkovich, </em>the instruction in this case was proper because (1) there was sufficient factual predicate to necessitate the instruction, (2) the instruction clearly required that in order to convict the jury must find that LaTouche had entered into the scheme with the intent to defraud, and (3) there was no evidence that the instruction caused the jury to be confused about the issue of intent. <em>See Berkovich, </em>168 F.3d at 67. We find no error in the district court\u2019s use of the \u201cno ultimate harm\u201d instruction as part of the jury charge given in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">C\u2019 <em>Juror Taint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">Cartelli argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion for a mistrial based on the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office\u2019s press release and subsequent newspaper articles that followed the jury\u2019s determination that the defendants were guilty of the crimes charged but preceded the jury\u2019s final calculation of the loss amount.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cA district court\u2019s decision regarding juror impartiality is reviewed for abuse of discretion and deserves deference.\u201d <em>United States v. McDonough, </em>56 F.3d 381, 386 (2d Cir.1995) \u201c[Ajbsent evidence to the contrary, we presume that jurors remain true to their oath and conscientiously observe the instructions and admonitions of the court.\u201d <em>United States v. Rosario, </em>111 F.3d 293 (2d Cir.1997) (quoting <em>United States v. Easter, </em>981 F.2d 1549, 1553 (10th Cir. 1992)). When the issue of the press release was raised before the district court, it properly undertook the three-step procedure laid out in <em>United States v. Gaggi, </em>811 F.2d 47 (2d Cir.1987), for determining \u201cwhat effect, if any, [the potentially prejudicial publicity] has had on that juror\u2019s ability to decide the case fairly,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 51. The district court individually questioned the five jurors who had knowledge of the press coverage, asking what knowledge they had and if the coverage had entered into then* deliberations. Each juror stated that the press coverage had no bearing on his or her remaining delibera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>tions. The court was, therefore, well within its discretion to find that the jury remained impartial. Upon review, Cartel-li has made no showing which would cause us to reject the presumption that jurors are truthful, <em>see United States v. Cox, </em>324 F.3d 77, 87 (2d Cir.2003), or on which we might find that the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">LaTouche argues that the district court erred in failing to further inquire into whether two jurors had engaged in misconduct by speaking with their wives about the case. LaTouche\u2019s request for the further hearing was prompted by responses of two of the jurors during the inquiry into the effect of the press release, each indicating that his wife had brought the newspaper coverage to his attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">A district court is required to hold a hearing investigating juror misconduct when \u201creasonable grounds for investigation exist.\u201d <em>United States v. Vitale, </em>459 F.3d 190, 197 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Sun Myung Moon, </em>718 F.2d 1210, 1234 (2d Cir.1983)). \u201cReasonable grounds are present when there is clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence, that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety has occurred which could have prejudiced the trial of a defendant.\u201d <em>Moon, </em>718 F.2d at 1234. \u201cThis court has consistently refused to allow a defendant to investigate \u2018jurors merely to conduct a fishing expedition.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Ianniello, </em>866 F.2d 540, 543 (2d Cir.1989) (quoting <em>United States v. Moten, </em>582 F.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir.1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Although defense counsel had the opportunity to examine the jurors during the course of the investigatory hearing on the effect of the press releases, defense counsel chose not to inquire further about the jurors\u2019 conversations with their wives. In fact, counsel asked no questions at all of the juror who stated \u201cthere were little bits and pieces that [he] said to [his wife].\u201d When counsel later requested that the district court conduct further inquiry, the court was presented with mere speculation as to what sort of conversations the jurors may have had with their wives or even whether those conversations addressed more than the mere fact that the jurors were on a federal jury in Bridgeport, Connecticut. It is indisputable that counsel made no presentation of \u201cclear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence, that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety ha[d] occurred\u201d necessitating an investigatory hearing into the spousal conversations. <em>Moon, </em>718 F.2d at 1234. We therefore find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to hold a hearing on the issue of the jurors\u2019 potential conversations with their wives.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">We have considered all of Defendants-Appellants\u2019 other arguments and find them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-7\">. Although the argument suggests that there was some quibble over the propriety of the U.S. Attorney's Office\u2019s dissemination of a press release prior to the completion of the jury\u2019s deliberations, the thrust of the argument on appeal deals with how the district court handled the inquiry into the press release's impact on the jury\u2019s deliberations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
