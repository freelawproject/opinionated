Jan. 29, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-23\">The BIA\u2019s regulations require an alien to file a motion to reconsider within 30 days of the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reconsidered. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2). Here, there is no dispute that Khanal\u2019s July 2006 motion was untimely where the BIA issued a final removal order in December 2002. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). However, Khanal argues that the BIA abused its discretion by declining to <em>sua sponte </em>reconsider his case in light of our decision in <em>Ming Shi Xue v. BIA, </em>439 F.3d 111 (2d Cir.2006). We lack jurisdiction to review a decision of the BIA regarding whether to reopen or reconsider a case <em>sua sponte </em>under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-25\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-27\">. Even if we maintained jurisdiction over the instant petition, we would find no abuse of discretion in the BIA's decision, when the change in law was not pertinent to the ground upon which the BIA denied petitioner relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
