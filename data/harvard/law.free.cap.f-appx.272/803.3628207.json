After re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>view, we vacate Tolbert\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for resentenc-ing in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">Tolbert pled guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and stipulated that the amount in possession was 5 grams or more of crack cocaine. According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Tolbert was involved in two separate sales of crack cocaine. Although the drug quantity of the first sale was unknown, the second sale involved 1.31' grams of crack cocaine. While arresting Tolbert at his residence, police found an additional 24.88 grams of crack cocaine. Thus, 26.19 grams of crack cocaine were attributed to Tolbert.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">In August 2007, the PSI calculated a base offense level of 28, pursuant to the then existing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(6), based on a drug quantity between 20 and 35 grams of crack cocaine, and applied a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), (b). Based on an adjusted offense level of 25 and a criminal history category of II, the PSI calculated an advisory guidelines range of 63 to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment. The statutory minimum sentence was 60 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">Tolbert filed a mitten objection to the PSI\u2019s base offense level calculation, claiming that he should receive a base offense level of 14 (the offense level for the same amount of cocaine powder) because there was no scientific justification for the guidelines disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine offenses. In a separate sentencing memorandum, Tolbert argued that, after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court should consider the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities in \u00a7 3553(a)(6). Tol-bert further argued under \u00a7 3553(a)(6) that the 100:1 crack/powder ratio in the guidelines leads to substantial unwarranted sentencing disparities. Tolbert also noted that the Sentencing Commission had sent Congress a proposed amendment to reduce the disparity by lowering the base offense level for crack cocaine offenses by two levels, which would likely become effective November 1, 2007.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, Tolbert requested the statutory minimum 60-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-12\">At the October 12, 2007 sentencing hearing, Tolbert raised his objection to the crack/powder disparity and noted the Sentencing Commission\u2019s proposed amendment to the guidelines. The district court responded that it had \u201calways been of the opinion ... that the sentencing guidelines \u2014 the hundred-to-one ratio between powder cocaine and crack cocaine in fact created a disparity, which the guidelines were designed to do away with. I have felt like that the guideline range for crack cocaine was too high.\u201d However, the district court noted the numerous times in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>which the Sentencing Commission had previously recommended changing the crack cocaine guidelines, and Congress\u2019s unwillingness to make that change. The district court opined that, even if they did make the change, \u201cmore than likely they\u2019re not going to make it retroactive.\u201d The district court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-5\">Now, whether they\u2019re going to make that change, or whether they make that change, I don\u2019t know. But we\u2019re here today having a sentence based on the current state of the law, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to follow today, the current state of the law, and not what some subjective thing that Congress might do in the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">The district court adopted the PSI\u2019s fact findings and overruled Tolbert\u2019s objections to the crack/powder disparity. After recognizing that the guidelines were advisory and considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court sentenced Tolbert to 63 months\u2019 imprisonment, the low end of the advisory guidelines range, and 5 years\u2019 supervised release. The district court found no basis for a departure from the advisory guidelines range. The parties raised no further objections after sentencing. The instant appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">This Court held in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353 (11th Cir.2006), that federal courts were \u201cnot at liberty to supplant [Congress\u2019s] policy decision\u201d that \u201ccrack offenders should be punished more severely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1367. In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Supreme Court overruled <em>Williams </em>and determined that \u201cit would not be- an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes.\u201d <em>Kimbrough, </em>552 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-11\">In a recent decision involving a case remanded from the Supreme Court in light of <em>Kimbrough, </em>this Court vacated and remanded to the district court for resentenc-ing consistent with <em>Kimbrough </em>after determining that (1) the defendant had raised a <em>\u201cKimbrough-type </em>claim\u201d in the district court and in his initial appeal, (2) the district court had rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the court had authority to consider the crack/powder disparity as a sentencing factor and had not indicated that it would enter the same sentence even if it had such authority, and (3) this Court\u2019s opinion in the defendant\u2019s first appeal had relied on <em>Williams, </em>which was overruled by <em>Kimbrough. United States v. Stratton, </em>519 F.3d 1305, 1306-07 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">The same factors found in <em>Stratton </em>are present here and warrant vacating and remanding Tolbert\u2019s sentence in light of <em>Kimbrough. </em>Tolbert raised a, <em>\u201cKim-</em>brough-type claim\u201d in the district court that the crack/powder ratio resulted in unwarranted sentencing disparities. However, the district court recognized the disparity but essentially indicated that, based on the current law, it could not reduce Tolbert\u2019s sentence due to the crack/powder disparity. The state of the law at the time of Tolbert\u2019s sentencing was <em>Williams, </em>which held that the district court did not have the authority to consider the crack/powder disparity at sentencing. As noted earlier, <em>Kimbrough </em>overruled <em>Williams. </em>Thus, while the district court did not err in calculating Tolbert\u2019s advisory guidelines range under the guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing, the district court, in light of <em>Kimbrough, </em>did err in concluding it was unable to consider the crack/powder disparity as a sentencing factor under \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>Finally, the district court did not state that it would impose the same sentence if it could consider the crack/powder disparity. To the contrary, the district court stated that it had \u201calways been of the opinion\u201d that the 100:1 crack/powder ratio \u201cin fact created a disparity\u201d and \u201cthat the guideline range for crack cocaine was too high.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Therefore, we vacate Tolbert\u2019s sentence and remand this case to the district court for the limited purpose of resentencing Tolbert in light of <em>Kimbrough.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-10\">. In May 2007, the Sentencing Commission submitted proposed guidelines amendments to Congress that included, <em>inter alia, </em>a two-level reduction to the base offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1(c) for crack cocaine violations. <em>See </em>Amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for United States Courts, 72 Fed. Reg. 28571-72 (2007). The amendment to \u00a7 2D 1.1(c) became effective on November 1, 2007. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 706 (Supp.2007); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(p) (stating that proposed amendments \u201ctake effect on a date specified by the Commission ... except to the extent that the effective date is revised or the amendment is otherwise modified or disapproved by Act of Congress\u201d). Tolbert was sentenced before the effective date of this amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
