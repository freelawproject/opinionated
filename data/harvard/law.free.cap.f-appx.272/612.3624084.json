The IJ denied Gomez Lucero\u2019s motion to terminate the proceedings and ordered her removed from the United States. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">Gomez Lucero argued before the IJ that her statements recorded on Form 1213 (Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien) should be suppressed because her request to speak with her attorney while in secondary inspection was denied in violation of her regulatory and constitutional rights. Our review of these questions of law is <em>de novo. Vasquez-Zavala v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 1105, 1107 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">The exclusionary rule is generally not applicable in removal proceedings, except in cases of \u201cegregious\u201d conduct that \u201ctransgress[es] notions of fundamental fairness and undermine[s] the probative value of the evidence obtained.\u201d <em>Gonzalez-Rivera v. INS, </em>22 F.3d 1441, 1448 (9th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 1050-51, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 82 L.Ed.2d 778 (1984)). No such conduct occurred in this case. First, Gomez Lucero\u2019s regulatory right to counsel was not violated because there is no evidence in the record that she was the \u201cfocus of a criminal investigation.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.5(b). Second, even if she was entitled to <em>Miranda </em>warnings, we have long held that violation of <em>Miranda </em>does not require suppx\u2019ession in removal proceedings. <em>Trias-Hernandez v. INS, </em>528 F.2d 366, 369 (9th Cir.1975). Third, there is no evidence that her statements were made involuntaxily \u201cor otherwise affected by the circumstances of her arrest.\u201d <em>In re Toro, </em>17 I. &amp; N. Dec. 340, 344 (BIA 1980). The 1-213 is therefore probative evidence, the use of which is not fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b637-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9lh Cir.
