He asked the district court to resentence him based on a correctly calculated guideline range. The district court denied the motion. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>United States v. Dutton, </em>No. 3:94-cr-00103-GCM (W.D. N.C. Oct. 29, 2007). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
