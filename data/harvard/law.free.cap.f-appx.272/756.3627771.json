Cargill, <em>pro se, </em>appeals the U.S. Tax Court\u2019s order (1) dismissing Cargill\u2019s petition for redetermination of a deficiency, pursuant to Rule 149(b) of the Tax Court Rules of Practice and Procedure for failure to produce evidence, (2) determining the amount of deficiency and additional tax due, and (3) ordering that Cargill pay a $4,000 penalty as a sanction, pursuant to 26. U.S.C. \u00a7 6673(a)(1)(B). Cargill argues that the Tax Court abused its discretion by dismissing her petition because it failed to acknowledge her signed 1999 tax return, which, according to Cargill, shifted the burden to the Commissioner to show that the deficiency was correct. In addition, Cargill maintains her argument that she was exempt from filing a federal income tax return because the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) 1040 Tax Form was not compliant with the 1995 Paperwork Reduction Act (\u201cPRA\u201d), 44 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3501-3520, due to the absence of a valid Office of Management and Budget (\u201cOMB\u201d) control number. Cargill also argues that the Tax Court abused its discretion by imposing a sanction against her for maintaining a frivolous position. Both parties filed motions for sanctions in this Court. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm the decision of the Tax Court. In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>we grant the Commissioner\u2019s motion for sanctions and deny Cargill\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"AW1\">The Commissioner notified Cargill that she was deficient for the 1999 tax year because she faded to report $19,147 in income. In her <em>pro se </em>original and amended petitions seeking a redetermination of the deficiency, Cargill claimed that she was not required to file a federal tax return because the 1999 1040 IRS Tax Form was not compliant with the PRA. Thus, Cargill argued that the burden shifted to the Commissioner, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7491, to prove the amount of deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"A4W\">In its written order, the Tax Court stated that both the original and amended petitions contained \u201cfrivolous \u00e1nd groundless arguments that merit no extended discussion.\u201d The court stated, \u201c[s]uffice it to say that the lack of an OMB number does not serve to invalidate an IRS notice nor does the lack of an OMB number violate the [PRA,] ... [and Cargill s] argument regarding the exemption amount is equally frivolous.\u201d In a footnote, the court stated that Cargill had a previous tax case dismissed for failure to state a claim and a $1,000 penalty was imposed against her, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6673(a). The court ordered that Cargill file an amendment to the petition in order to identify specific exemptions, deductions, and credits.</p>\n<p id=\"AU11\">In her Amendment to Amended Petition, Cargill again asserted her PRA argument. Cargill attached a copy of an unsigned joint 1999 IRS 1040 return<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a corresponding IRS Schedule A that itemized various deductions and an IRS Schedule C that itemized various business expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"ahp-dedup-1\">In its written order of dismissal and decision, the Tax Court dismissed the petition, pursuant to Rule 149(b), because Car-gill failed to produce evidence. The court noted that based its decision on the Commissioner\u2019s stipulation of facts that were deemed established. The court specifically found that Cai'g\u00fcl failed to sub' stantiate her claimed deductions and business exPenses set forth on her unsiSned j\u00b0int IRS 1040 Form' The court also de' termined that\u2019 for the 1999 tax year\u2019there was (1) a in income tax due in the amount of $4\u2019419\u2019 (f} an addition to tax due in the amount of $662.85 pursuant to LKC- \u00a7 6651(a)(1), and (3) a $4,000 penalty as a sanction, pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 6673.

Tax forms are covered by the PRA. <em>See Dole v. United Steelworkers of Am., </em>494 u.S. 26, 32-33, 110 S.Ct. 929, 933, 108 L.Ed.2d 23 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"apo-dedup-0\">In <em>Neff; </em>we rejected the argument that a tax return need not be filed because of the absence of an OMB control number on Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.6091-2 (as amended in 1978), which states where income tax re-turns must be filed. <em>Neff, </em>954 F.2d at 699-700. Specifically, we stated that \u201cCongress created [the taxpayer\u2019s] duty to file the Returns in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6012(a), and ... Congress did not enact the PRA\u2019s public protection provision to allow OMB to abrogate any duty imposed by Con-gress.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203 (stating penalties for willful failure- to file <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>return, supply information, or pay tax); <em>James v. United States, </em>970 F.2d 750, 753 n. 6 (10th Cir.1992) (noting that the lack of an OMB number on IRS notices and forms does not violate the PRA).</p>\n<p id=\"ayx-dedup-1\">At least one circuit court has determined that the 1995 PRA Amendments do not alter the conclusion that the IRS 1040 Form is in compliance with the PRA. <em>See United States v. Patridge, </em>507 F.3d 1092, 1094 (7th Cir.2007), <em>pet. for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 11, 2008) (No. 07-1045) (rejecting taxpayer\u2019s argument that the IRS 1040 <em>\u00b0 </em>: , A,m , , Form lacked a valid OMB number and ... ,, , ,, , ,, statmg that we have no doubt that the t-do i, r an\u00bb IRS has complied with the [PRA], even though the OMB number displayed on the IRS 1040 Form has been constant since 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"AvHk\">m[1] Initially, Cargills claim that she , , , , was not required to me a federal tax re- , , ,, Tr&gt;c, iri.A \u201e . . turn because the IRS 1040 Form failed to i iimcdd* \u2022 -4.1 4-comply with the 1995 PRA is without merit, and the 1995 Amendments did not alter that result</p>\n<p id=\"ALKI\">Despite Cargill\u2019s claim to the contrary, both the Commissioner and the Tax Court acknowledged the Schedule A itemized deductions and the Schedule C business expenses, even though the Commissioner maintained that the 1999 joint return was invalid. However, the stipulation of facts, which was deemed admitted, provided that Cargill had not filed a valid return for the 1999 tax year and had not provided any substantiation to support the claimed deductions and expenses on her unsigned joint return^ Further, other than the addition of her signature, Cargill failed to provide any evidence that she was entitled to those deductions and expenses she claimed on the return, even though the Tax Court provided her with ample opportunity to do so. Thus, the Commissioner\u2019s deficiency determination was presumptively correct, and Cargill failed to meet Her burden of introducing credible evidence with respect to the is-sue of whether she was entitled to the deductions and expenses she claimed, Accordingly, because Cargill failed to pro-duce evidence on an issue of fact to which she had the burden of proof, the Tax Court did not abuse its discretion by dis-missing Cargill\u2019s petition for redetermination of a deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"A57\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"A7O\">. \u201e _ \u201e . \u201e We review the Tax Court s imposition oi . \u201e , \u201e , sanctions for an abuse of discretion. <em>R</em>oberts <em>v. C.I.R., </em>329 F.3d 1224, 1229 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"Agh\">Section 6673 permits the Tax Court to impose sanctions in any amount up to $25,000, if the taxpayer \u201cinstitutes or T \u201e . . maintains proceedings primarily tor delay <em>1 </em>\u201e . , \u201e \u201e or his position is frivolous or groundless, 1 . w M; see <em>also </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6673(a)(l)(A)(B). \u2019 ; In <em>Roberts\u2019 </em>we aff\u00edrmed sanctl0ns where the law was settled prior to the proceedings, and the taxpayer was \u201con notice that claims were frivolous.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>329 F.3d at 1229; <em>see also Pollard v. Comm\u2019r, </em>816 F.2d 603, 604-05 (11th Cir.1987) (hold-jng no akuse of discretion where (1) Tax Qourt specifically found frivolous taxpayer&gt;g argument that had been rejected by this Court on numerous occasions, and (2) taxpayer had previously brought other fnV0lous tax claims); <em>Webb, </em>872 F.2d at 381 (holding that the Tax Court did not a^use Fg discretion by imposing a $2,300 sanction against the taxpayers because, even though the taxpayers claimed charita^le contribution deductions on their federaj income tax returns, the taxpayers failed demonstrate any charitable contribuyons a qualified organization).</p>\n<p id=\"aup-dedup-0\">Cargill\u2019s claim that she was not required to file a federal tax return has been rejected by this Court. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>(1) Cargill was on notice that her claim was frivolous and that she would be sanetioned, (2) Cargill continued to maintain her position, and (3) Cargill previously had been sanctioned by the Tax Court. Accordingly, the Tax Court did not abuse its discretion in imposing $4,000 in sanctions against Cargill.</p>\n<p id=\"aqdz-dedup-0\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"A8K\">The Commissioner moves for sanetions to be imposed against Cargill for maintaining a frivolous appeal, pursuant to Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912. The Commissioner reports that the average expense in attorney salaries and other costs incurred in the defense of frivolous taxpayer appeals in which sanctions were awarded during 2004 and 2005 is greater than $11,000 and asks that this Court impose a sanction against Cargill in the amount of $8,000.</p>\n<p id=\"ARhV\">Cargill also moves for sanctions against four attorneys with the Department of Justice, Tax Division, Appellate Section. According to Cargill, this Court should impose $8,000 in sanctions, pursuant to Rule 38 and Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for maintaining a \u00f1ivo-lous position and denying Cargill protection under the PRA.</p>\n<p id=\"AXJ\">Pursuant to Rule 38, \u201c[i]f a court of appeals determines the appeal is frivolous, it may, after a separately filed motion or notice from the court and reasonable opportunity to respond, award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.\u201d Fed.R.App.P. 38; see <em>also </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482(c)(4) (\u201cThe United States Court of . , <em>, </em>,, 0 ^ t i. n i. Appeals and the Supreme Court shall have the power to require the taxpayer to pay to the United States a penalty in any case where the decision of the Tax Court is affirmed and it appears that the appeal was instituted or maintained primarily for delay or that the taxpayer\u2019s position in the appeal is frivolous or groundless\u201d); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912 (\u201cWhere a judgment is affirmed by the Supreme Court or a court of appeals, the court in its discretion may adjudge to the prevailing party just dam-ages for his delay, and single or double costs\u201d). \u201cThe advisory committee notes to Fed.R.App.P. 38 clearly indicate that at-torney\u2019s fees, as well as double costs, can awarded to the appellee in the event appellant prosecutes a frivolous appeal. Biermannn <em>v. Comm'r, </em>769 F.2d 707, 708 n. 1 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"AxE\">In light of the settled case law rejecting the position advanced by Cargill, together with the explicit warnings offered by the Tax Court, Rule 38 sanctions against Cargill are appropriate,</p>\n<p id=\"AcvF\">Cargill\u2019s motion for sanctions against the Commissioner is without merit. Ac-cordingly, Cargill\u2019s motion for sanctions is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"agj-dedup-0\">In light of the foregoing, the decision of the Tax Court is</p>\n<p id=\"AENQ\">AFFIRMED; the Commissioner\u2019s mo-tion for sanctions in the lump-sum of $8,000 is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A3X\">. Cargill later provided a signed copy of the 1999 joint return. However, the Commissioner maintains that the joint return is not valid because both Cargill and her husband had already filed individual returns for the 1999 tax year.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
