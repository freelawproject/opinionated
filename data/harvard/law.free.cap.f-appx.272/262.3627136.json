Dowdell seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his motion filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">When the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed no more than sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S. Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v.

We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-19\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b287-14\"> For the purpose of this appeal, we assume that the date appearing on the notice of appeal filed by Dowdell is the earliest date it could have been properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court.
