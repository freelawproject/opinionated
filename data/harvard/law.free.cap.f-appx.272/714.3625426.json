R.App. P. 34(a); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The cause is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b739-10\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"b739-11\">TIMOTHY M. TYMKOVICH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b739-12\">Guadalupe Rios-Pinela pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute and dispense a controlled substance in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). He was sen-fenced to 120 months imprisonment. On appeal, Rios-Pinela\u2019s counsel submitted a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating her belief that any appeal would be wholly frivolous. We agree with defendant\u2019s counsel, and AFFIRM the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-16\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b739-17\">Rios-Pinela entered into a plea agreement with the government. In exchange for the government seeking to dismiss two out of the three counts in its indictment, Rios-Pinela pleaded guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute and dispense a controlled substance in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Rios-Pinela also agreed to waive his appellate rights, excepting two circumstances: (1) the district court sentenced him outside the properly calculated United States Sentencing Guidelines range, or (2) the government appealed the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-18\">Ordinarily, the waiver would preclude this appeal. But at the plea hearing the district court agreed with Rios-Pinela when the latter stated, \u201cI have the right to appeal whatever sentence you impose.\u201d R., Vol. Ill, Tr. of Plea Hearing at 20. This exchange took place immediately before Rios-Pinela signed the plea agreement, and casts some doubt as to whether he knowingly and voluntarily agreed to waive his appellate rights. <em>See United States v. Wilken, </em>498 F.3d 1160, 1168-69 (10th Cir.2007) (concluding the district court\u2019s erroneous statement concerning defendant\u2019s appellate rights cast doubt on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>whether the waiver of those rights was knowing and voluntary). Due to the doubt created by the court\u2019s statement, a panel of this coimt refused to grant the government\u2019s motion to enforce the plea agreement and allowed Rios-Pinela\u2019s appeal to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Following our order denying the government\u2019s motion, Rios-Pinela\u2019s counsel submitted an <em>Anders </em>brief. She concluded none of Rios-Pinela\u2019s potential issues for appeal were meritorious. The government did not submit a brief in reply. Rios-Pinela was given time to file additional arguments with this court, but failed to do so. After conducting a full examination of the record, we agree with defense counsel that Rios-Pinela\u2019s claims are entirely frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">In her <em>Anders </em>brief, Rios-Pinela\u2019s counsel raised two issues on the merits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The first related to ineffective assistance of counsel. The second discussed whether Rios-Pinela\u2019s sentence comported with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">\n<em>A. Ineffective Assistance of Co unsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">We decline to review Rios-Pinela\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim at this time. \u201cIneffective assistance of counsel claims should be brought in collateral proceedings, not on direct appeal. Such claims brought on direct appeal are presumptively dismissible, and virtually all will be dismissed.\u201d <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>428 F.3d 928, 931 (10th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). There is nothing special about this case to cause us to depart from the normal rule that ineffectiveness claims will only be considered on collateral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">\n<em>B. Sentencing Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b740-13\">We review a district court\u2019s sentencing decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Smart, </em>518 F.3d 800, 806 (10th Cir.2008). \u201cIn sentencing defendants, district courts exercise a guided discretion within a range specified by Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 809. . The sentence imposed must be both procedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 802-03. Sentences imposed within a properly calculated Guidelines range ar\u00e9 accorded a presumption of substantive reasonableness. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>509 F.3d 1290, 1298 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-14\">We find nothing in the record to indicate the district court\u2019s sentencing determination was either procedurally ,or substantively unreasonable. Procedurally, the court correctly determined the low end of the appropriately calculated Guidelines range was 120 months, due to the mandatory minimum imposed by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Cano-Varela, </em>497 F.3d 1122, 1131 (10th Cir.2007). Substantively, 120 months was a reasonable sentence considering the nature of the crime and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See, e.g., Hernandez, </em>509 F.3d at 1297-98 (\u201cA sentence is substantively reasonable when it reflects the gravity of the crime and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as applied to the case.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Rios-Pinela cannot overcome the presumption of substantive reasonableness which attaches to his within-Guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-15\">Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Rios-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>Pinela to the mandatory minimum term of 120 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">After fully examining the record, we conclude Rios-Pinela can raise no legally non-frivolous arguments on appeal. We therefore AFFIRM the sentence below and GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw from the case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b739-19\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-9\">. Counsel also raised a third issue entitled \"Waiver of Appeal.\u201d Since we reach the merits, this claim is moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
