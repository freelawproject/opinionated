On appeal, he alleges that the district court failed to allow him to fully allocute prior to sentencing him, in violation of Fed.R.Crim.P. 32. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">Because Garcia-Benitez did not raise this claim below, our review is for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (providing standard). The record reveals that Garcia-Benitez was invited to personally address the court prior to sentencing, and did so. There is no indication that the district court \u201ccut him off,\u201d as he claims in his brief, or otherwise prevented him from speaking as much as he desired prior to imposition of the sentence. Accordingly, this claim fails. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
