The district court sentenced Molina to the statutory mandatory minimum of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, and Molina timely appealed. Molina contends on appeal that the district court\u2019s imposition of the statutory minimum sentence was improper because the court erroneously denied a sentencing reduction under the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(f) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2007); <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 5C1.2 (2005). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">A defendant is eligible for an offense level reduction and a sentence below an otherwise applicable statutory minimum if he meets all five requirements set forth in the applicable statute. <em>See United States v. Beltran-Ortiz, </em>91 F.3d 665, 667 (4th Cir.1996). After permitting Molina to testify at the sentencing hearing as a verbal proffer of all information and evidence concerning his offenses, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(f)(5) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007); USSG \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5), the court found portions of Molina\u2019s testimony were untruthful. We conclude this finding was not clearly erroneous and the denial of a safety valve reduction below the statutory minimum on this basis was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">Accordingly, we affirm Molina\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b293-11\"> Molina does not contest his conviction on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
