We must decide whether there was sufficient evidence to justify the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>proved the requisite elements of force and knowledge. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Because we write exclusively for the parties and the parties are familiar with the facts and proceedings below, we will not revisit them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">In appeals from non-jury convictions, findings of historical or narrative facts are subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review. <em>United States v. Delerme, </em>457 F.2d 156, 160 (3d Cir.1972). In reviewing the \u201cultimate factual question of guilt,\u201d we must determine whether there was substantial supportive evidence. <em>Id. </em>Williams expressly withdrew his request that the District Court make specific findings of fact pursuant to Rule 23(c), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. We may \u201cimply findings of fact that support a general finding of guilt in a non-jury trial where the evidence so warrants and the defendant has not requested special findings under [Rule 23(c)]____\u201d <em>United States v. Farrell, </em>126 F.3d 484, 491 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">We have reviewed the evidence and are satisfied that the adjudicative facts implied by the District Court\u2019s determination are sufficient to uphold Williams\u2019 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-14\">Williams contends that \u201cthe Government did not prove the degree of force necessary to sustain a conviction....\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 11. We are satisfied, however, that Williams\u2019 physical assault of Officer Burkey \u2014 by biting Officer Burkey\u2019s gloved hand (a bite that resulted in redness, a blood blister and bruising) \u2014 satisfies the element of \u201cforcibly.\u201d <em>See United States v. Goodwin, </em>440 F.2d 1152, 1154 (3d Cir.1971) (\u201cWe are satisfied that, when defendant pushed and struggled with the agents and attempted to break away from their grasp, he was guilty of forcible assault. ...\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-16\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-17\">Williams also contends that the government failed to prove the requisite mens rea. In support of this contention, Williams directs us to the circumstances of the assault: he had been hard-restrained for over eleven hours and was speaking irrationally. For example, witnesses testified that, on the day of the assault, Williams had accused correctional officers of intending to drown him; had said, at the 11:30 p.m. check, \u201cThey are going to cut my back open\u201d; and had said something to the effect of \u201cThey are going to kill me.\u201d App. at 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-18\">Nonetheless, testimony revealed that Williams had spit at the officers earlier in the day after they had restrained him and growled when he bit Officer Burkey. Thus there was sufficient evidence to sustain the government\u2019s burden to prove that Williams forcibly assaulted a correctional officer in the performance of his official duties, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(a). ******</p>\n<p id=\"b219-19\">We have considered all contentions raised by the parties, and we conclude that no further discussion is necessary. The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
