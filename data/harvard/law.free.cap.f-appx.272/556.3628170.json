The evidence of Rito\u2019s son\u2019s asthma condition and his educational difficulties concerned the same basic hardship grounds as Rito\u2019s application for cancellation of removal. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 602-03 (9th Cir.2006). We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that the evidence would not alter its prior discretionary determination that Rito failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>establish the requisite hardship. <em>See id. </em>at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Rito\u2019s evidence of the birth of her daughter, the separation from her children\u2019s father and her medical condition may have been a basis for relief, but the BIA considered the evidence submitted and acted within its broad discretion in determining that the evidence was insufficient to warrant reopening. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b581-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
