INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002). The regulations state that a motion to reopen removal proceedings must be filed no later than ninety days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). A review of the administrative record demonstrates that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely. Petitioner\u2019s final administrative order of removal was entered on April 2, 2004. Petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen was filed on November 14, 2005, more than ninety days after the date on which the final order of removal was entered. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Petitioner seeks review of the BIA\u2019s denial of her request to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen proceedings, but this court lacks jurisdiction. <em>See Ekimian v.
