Worrels was sentenced to 167 months in prison and 7 years of supervised release. Worrels\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). For reversal, in both counsel\u2019s brief and Wor-rels\u2019s pro se brief, Worrels argues that the district court erred by believing it could not credit the information provided by Worrels that had not yet resulted in a-successful prosecution or investigation in determining the appropriate substantial-assistance departure reduction from his advisory Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">We disagree with Worrels and conclude that the district court did not have to consider assistance that was not substantial or that did not result in the investigation or prosecution of another person in determining the appropriate departure reduction. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) (upon motion of government,, court has authority to impose sentence below mandatory minimum sentence to reflect defendant\u2019s'\u201csubstantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person\u201d); <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>509 F.3d 450, 453 (8th Cir.2007) (substantial-assistance reduction is judged by degree and quality of assistance actually provided, not defendant\u2019s willingness to do more); <em>see also United States v. Fields, </em>512 F.3d 1009, 1012 (8th Cir.2008) (if assistance is not helpful, defendant may not receive benefit of departure); <em>United States v. Saenz, </em>428 F.3d 1159, 1164 (8th Cir.2005) (same); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>241 F.3d 1049, 1055 n. 5 (8th Cir.2001) (additional post-sentencing substantial assistance can be considered pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b) motion). The record shows that the court properly considered the government\u2019s evaluation of the assistance rendered and gave appropriate consideration to the other U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">After reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed. 2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel leave to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-9\">. The Honorable Ronald E. Longstaff, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
