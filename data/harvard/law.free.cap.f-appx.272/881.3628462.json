Specifically, Siler alleges that Hancock School District (1) discriminated against him based on his gender by transferring him from his position as principal of Hancock Central High School to lead teacher at the district\u2019s Alternative School and by failing to hire him as an assistant principal when such positions subsequently opened, and (2) retaliated against him for filing a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission by withholding his paycheck. Siler also complained that the defendants violated his due process rights by transferring him without a hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">After a careful review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs and oral arguments, we conclude that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Hancock School District. Accepting for the sake of argument that Siler\u2019s transfer was an adverse employment action pursuant to Title VII and that Siler made out a prima facie case, Siler did not present sufficient evidence to raise an inference of pretext or intentional discrimination in response to Hancock School District\u2019s evidence of legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its actions. <em>Carter v. Miami, </em>870 F.2d 578, 585 (11th Cir.1989). With reference to Siler\u2019s claim asserting discrimination based on Hancock School District\u2019s failure to hire him for other administrator positions, there was no error because Siler did not apply for the publicly advertised positions in question and so failed to establish a prima facie case. <em>Vessels v. Atlanta Indep. Sch. Sys., </em>408 F.3d 763, 768 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Creen, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973)). There is no merit to Siler\u2019s conclusory statement that he had a property right in the positions that entitled him to forgo applying for the jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">There is likewise no merit to Siler\u2019s retaliation claim because the four-day delay in the issuance of his paycheck was not an \u201cadverse action\u201d such that it reasonably would have dissuaded an employee from filing a complaint and, therefore, Siler failed to make out a prima facie case. <em>Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 2415, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006); <em>Gupta, v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, </em>212 F.3d 571, 588 (11th Cir. 2000).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">Finally, we find no error in the summary judgment in favor of Hancock School District on Siler\u2019s due process claim. Under the relevant Georgia statutes, in this kind of case, an employee has a right to a hearing when facing a demotion. Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 20-2-940(b)-(f), 20-2-942(b)(2). To qualify as a demotion, the subsequent position must be accompanied by a decrease in salary. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 20-2-943(a)(2)(C). In this ease, Siler was unable to demonstrate that he suffered a decrease in salary and, therefore, there was no due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-14\">. District employees Mr. Herbert Monroe, Chairman; Mr. Melvin Smith; Ms. Ruby Clayton; Ms. Felicia Stewart; Ms. Denise Ransom; Dr. Florence Reynolds, Superintendent; and Mr. Tyrone Evans, in their individual and official capacities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b907-6\"><em>. </em>Siler raises two additional issues. First, Siler argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for default judgment. Second, Siler argues that the district court erred on the issue of sealing his exhibits and motion to unseal that referred to a third-party. We reject these arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b907-13\">. We do not reach Siler\u2019s assertion that Hancock School District\u2019s refusal to provide him with a written contract also was a retaliatory act because this was not raised in the district court proceedings. <em>Rothenberg v. Sec. Mgmt. Co., </em>667 F.2d 958, 961 n. 8 (11th Cir. 1982) (\"Normally, an appellate court will not consider facts that were not presented to the district court.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
