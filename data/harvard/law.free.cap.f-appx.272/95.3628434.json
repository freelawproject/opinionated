Jan. 4, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-25\">As a preliminary matter, because Hossain did not petition for review of the BIA\u2019s December 2001 denial of his motion to consider his untimely brief or the BIA\u2019s April 2002 decision summarily affirming the IJ\u2019s decision, and because this Court previously dismissed his petition for review of the BIA\u2019s March 2003 decision denying his motion to reconsider, we limit our review to the BIA\u2019s January 2006 decision denying his motion to reopen. <em>Cf. Ke </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number><em>Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 89-90 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Hossain failed to establish that his untimely motion to reopen qualified for an exception to the time limitation based on \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d in Bangladesh. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Hossain argues that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen because the BIA failed to address (1) his argument that the BIA erred by not accepting his untimely brief appealing the IJ\u2019s decision, and (2) his argument that he fears persecution in Bangladesh based on his Muslim religion and having children born out-of-wedlock. These arguments are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">First, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by declining to consider, for a third time, Hossain\u2019s argument that the BIA\u2019s December 2001 decision denying his motion to consider his untimely brief was erroneous. <em>Cf. Jin Ming Lin v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 109, 111 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Ke Zhen Zhao, </em>265 F.3d at 97 (\u201c[W]hen faced with a motion to reopen, the [BIA] has an obligation to consider the record as a whole.\u201d). Because Hossain never petitioned for review of the BIA\u2019s December 2001 decision denying his motion to consider his untimely brief, his argument is unexhausted. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Ke Zhen Zhao, </em>265 F.3d at 89-90. In any event, the BIA\u2019s failure to consider his untimely brief does not meet an exception to the time limitations applicable to motions to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h) (providing that the \u201ctime and numerical limitations ... shall not apply to a motion to reopen\u201d to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality\u201d if such evidence was \u201cnot available\u201d at the time of the previous hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">Second, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by rejecting Hossain\u2019s argument that reopening was appropriate \u201cdue to his [pre-marital] relationship and fathering a child, against the teaching of his religion customs, traditions and culture.\u201d In this regard, the BIA found that Hossain failed \u201cto demonstrate that any change in circumstances that has occurred in Bangladesh would materially affect his eligibility for asylum.\u201d Hossain, who claims to fear persecution based on his membership in the \u201cJatio Party,\u201d alleged no changed circumstances <em>in Bangladesh; </em>rather he claimed that his personal circumstances <em>in the United States </em>had changed-namely his \u201cpre-marital relationship\u201d with his current wife and \u201cfathering a child\u201d in the United States. This \u201cevidence ... does not fit under the exception set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 [100] 3.2(c)(3)(ii).\u201d <em>Jian Huan Guan v. BIA, </em>345 F.3d 47, 49 (2d Cir.2003); <em>see also Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 274 (2d Cir.2006) (finding that \u201c[t]he law is clear that a petitioner must show changed country conditions in order to exceed the 90-day filing requirement for seeking to reopen removal proceedings. A self-induced change in personal circumstances cannot suffice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">Finally, the BIA properly noted that Hossain failed \u201cto demonstrate any change in circumstances that has occurred in Bangladesh would materially affect his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>eligibility for asylum.\u201d Although the 2004 U.S. Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Bangladesh, which Hossain had submitted in support of his motion to reopen, states that the government\u2019s poor human rights record worsened during the year and that political violence still existed, Hossain never established how any change in the report specifically would affect him. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Indeed, to the extent Hossain\u2019s claim was based on the same factual predicate previously found not credible, the BIA properly noted that Hos-sain failed to overcome the IJ\u2019s prior adverse credibility finding. <em>See Qin Wen Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 143, 147 (2d Cir.2007); <em>Kaur, </em>413 F.3d at 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
