Chase, denying his application for relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Wan Hai Liu, </em>No. A77-977-422 (B.I.A. Jul. 12, 2005), <em>aff'g </em>No. A77-977-422 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 5, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ \"without issuing an opinion, <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 59 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yu Sheng Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 159 (2d Cir.2004). The Court reviews <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">We conclude that the IJ\u2019s finding that Liu failed to meet his burden of proof was proper. Liu\u2019s claim for CAT relief is based on his belief that \u201cthere \u00e1re a lot of people who are smuggled out of the [Fuji-an] province\u201d and that if he were returned, \u201cthey would detain [him] and lock [him] up, put [him] in prison.\u201d In support of his claim, Liu testified that his cousin, whose situation he heard about from his family over the phone, had been subjected to such treatment. Liu testified that his cousin had been \u201ccaptured and returned back and he was put in prison\u201d and \u201cleft there for three months.\u201d When the IJ asked Liu if he knew anyone \u201cwho was deported from America back to China,\u201d Liu responded that he only knew of one friend with whom he had \u201clost contact when he returned back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">Further, Liu failed to demonstrate a likelihood that the authorities are aware of his illegal departure or that they would target him because of it if he returned. Even if the authorities were to become aware of his departure, the evidence before the IJ only showed that he would, at most, be subjected to administrative detention or fined. We have found that criminal prosecution and punishment for illegal departure do not constitute persecution in the absence of evidence that the authorities have a motive other than law enforcement for preventing the departure or punishing of an individual upon return. <em>See Saleh v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>962 F.2d 234, 239 (2d Cir.1992). Further, Liu failed to present evidence that the Chinese government specifically tortures persons who are returned from the United States after illegally departing China, a situation the IJ distinguished from that of Liu\u2019s cousin, who was detained while attempting to illegally depart China for Japan. <em>Mu-Xing Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 144-45 (2d Cir.2003) (finding that a petitioner\u2019s failure to present particularized evidence of torture of military deserters was fatal to his claim for relief under the CAT); <em>see also Pierre v. Gonzales, </em>502 F.3d 109, 118-19 (2d Cir.2007) (holding that beyond evidence of inhumane prison conditions, a CAT claimant must provide some evidence that the authorities act with the specific intent to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering on those detained). Accordingly, the IJ reasonably found that Liu failed to establish his eligibility for relief under the CAT. Therefore, the IJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>did not err in finding that Liu failed to meet his burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
