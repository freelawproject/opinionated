Having engaged in a careful <em>de novo </em>review of the record and having thoroughly considered Arzuman\u2019s arguments, we agree with the district court that there are no genuine issues of material fact and the appellees are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all three of Arzuman\u2019s claims. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number><em>Devin v. Schwan\u2019s Home Serv., Inc., </em>491 F.3d 778, 785 (8th Cir.2007) (standard of review). Construed in the light most favorable to Arzuman, the summary judgment record is insufficient to establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment, hostile work environment, or retaliation. <em>See Devin, </em>491 F.3d at 785-89 (describing the showings required to make out a prima facie case under these three theories of employment discrimination).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Accordingly, we agree with the thorough and well-reasoned opinion of the district court and affirm its judgment. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-31\">. The Honorable Nanette K.
