On appeal, Sherrod argues that his prior federal lawsuit does not preclude his current \u00a7 1983 suit because the facts underlying the instant action arose after he filed his original complaint in the prior suit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After careful review, we affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-17\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application of <em>res judicata. See E.E.O.C. v. Pemco Aeroplex, Inc., </em>383 F.3d 1280, 1285 (11th Cir.2004). <em>Res judicata, </em>or claim preclusion, bars a party from relitigating a cause of action that was, or could have been, raised in a previous suit between the parties that resulted in a final judgment on the merits. <em>In re Piper Aircraft Corp., </em>244 F.3d 1289, 1296 (11th Cir. 2001). A party seeking to invoke <em>res judicata </em>must satisfy four elements: \u201c(1) the prior decision must have been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (2) there must have been a final judgment on the merits; (3) both cases must involve the same parties or their privies; and (4) both cases must involve the same causes of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the party satisfies these requirements, the district court must determine whether the new claims could have been raised in the prior suit, and if so, the claims are barred by <em>res judicata. Id. </em>The preclusion of claims that \u201ccould have been brought\u201d does not include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>claims that arose after the original complaint was filed in the prior action, unless the plaintiff actually asserted the claim in an amended pleading, but <em>res judicata </em>does not bar the claim simply because the plaintiff elected not to amend his complaint. <em>Pleming v. Universal-Rundle Corp., </em>142 F.3d 1354, 1357 (11th Cir.1998). This is true even if the plaintiff discussed the facts supporting the subsequent claim in support of his claims in the prior case. <em>Id. </em>at 1358-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Here, the district court\u2019s <em>res judicata </em>dismissal was based on Sherrod\u2019s previous \u00a7 1983 civil rights action against the same defendants, or their privies <em>(\u201cSherrod I </em>\u201d). In <em>Sherrod I, </em>in a third amended complaint filed on October 24, 2003, Sherrod asserted a \u00a7 1983 action against the Board, alleging equal protection and free speech violations based on retaliation. Sherrod later filed a fourth amended complaint against the Board, and added the individual defendants named in the present action, alleging that, in retaliation for speaking out against the exploitation of African-American athletes and the defendants\u2019 failure to infuse African and African-American history into its world history curriculum, the defendants had violated Sherrod\u2019s free speech, due process, and equal protection rights by repeatedly transferring him, giving him negative evaluations, and ultimately terminating him.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">In <em>Sherrod I, </em>the district court dismissed the individual defendants, as untimely added, and sua sponte struck the equal protection and due process claims, as they exceeded the scope of the authorized amendment to the third amended complaint. Additionally, the court found that although the fourth amended complaint sufficiently alleged that the individuals involved in his transfers and teaching assignments had final authority over those areas, the complaint did not allege that there was a practice or custom of transferring employees on the basis of race or in retaliation for exercising his constitutional rights. Accordingly, the court granted the defendants partial summary judgment on the \u201cpractice or custom\u201d theory. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Sherrod on the remaining, free-speech claim, but the district court entered judgment as a matter of law for the Board, and denied Sher-rod\u2019s motions for a new trial, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a), and relief from the court\u2019s order granting judgment as a matter of law, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60. This Court dismissed Sherrod\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s order granting judgment as a matter of law, because the appeal was untimely filed, and affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of Sherrod\u2019s motion for relief under Rules 59(a) and 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">On March 8, 2007, Sherrod filed the instant suit alleging various violations of his equal protection, free speech, and due process rights. The district court found that all of Sherrod\u2019s claims were barred by <em>res judicata </em>because they were or could have been presented in <em>Sherrod I </em>had Sherrod timely sought to include them in that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">The preclusion of claims that \u201ccould have been brought\u201d does not include claims that arose after the original complaint was filed in the prior action, unless the plaintiff actually asserted the claim in an amended pleading. <em>Pleming, </em>142 at 1357. Because the following claims arose after Sherrod filed his third amended complaint on October 24, 2003 in <em>Sherrod I,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>and thus could <em>not </em>have been brought in that action, the district court erred by dismissing them: (1) in Count I, Sherrod\u2019s claim against defendant St. John, <em>compare </em>CM7ECF for the U.S. Dist. Ct. for the S.D. Fla., no. 9:02-cv-80764, Doc. Entry 100 at 33 (stating that Sherrod\u2019s child, Surya, was in the <em>fifth </em>grade at the time the fourth amended complaint was filed), <em>with </em>Rl-5 at 25-27 (stating that St. John taught Surya in the <em>seventh </em>grade); (2) in count 2, Sherrod\u2019s claim against defendant Crutchfield, based on her 2004 recommendation that he be terminated<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; (3) in Count 2, Sherrod\u2019s due process claim against all of the named defendants, with regal'd to their failure to inform the district court, in the course of the <em>Sherrod I </em>proceedings, that Principal Hall no longer worked for the Board; (4) Count IV\u2019s retaliation claim as to defendants Johnson and Crutchfield, the underlying facts of which all occurred in 2004; and (5) the claims in Count V against defendants Johnson, Pare-Evans, and Middletown, which arose during the course of the <em>Sher-rod I </em>proceedings, or shortly thereafter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We vacate and remand for further consideration of only the foregoing claims, and affirm in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-15\">. Sherrod also argues the district court erred by finding that the individual defendants to the instant action were parties to, or in privity with parties to, his earlier federal lawsuit. We find no clear error in the district court\u2019s privity findings. <em>Cf. E.E.O.C. v. Pemco Aeroplex, Inc. </em>383 F.3d 1280, 1285 (11th Cir.2004) (reviewing district court's finding of privity for clear error).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b854-6\">. Although, in his untimely fourth amended complaint in <em>Shenvd I, </em>Sherrod referenced some of the facts underlying the claims we hold were not barred by <em>res judicata, </em>his mere discussion of those facts in his fourth amended complaint does not have <em>res judicata </em>effect. <em>See Pleming, </em>142 F.3d at 1358-59.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b855-7\">. As best we can tell from the record we have before us, Sherrod\u2019s intervening state lawsuit also did not preclude Sherrod's \u00a7 1983 action against Crutchfield, because the state administrative hearing and appeal involved Sher-rod's termination and the performance-assessment procedures of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 1012.34, while the instant action concerns alleged free speech, due process, and equal protection violations that Crutchfield, and the other defendants, allegedly committed in retaliation against Sherrod for speaking out on the Board's failure to implement the education courses enumerated in Fla. Stat. \u00a7 1003.42.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b855-23\">. Sherrod's Rule 60(b)(2) motion in <em>Sherrod I </em>did not preclude the claim because the basis for the motion was that Sherrod had discovered that Principal Hall had filed a retaliation suit against the Board, not that Johnson, Pare-Evans, and Middletown had violated his due process and equal protection rights. <em>See </em>CM/ECF for the U.S. Dist. Ct. for the S.D. Fla., no. 9:02-cv-80764, Doc. Entry 239.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
