Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same). Such a causal nexus is required to support the grant of asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000); <em>Abdel-Rahman v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 444, 450-51 (4th Cir.2007); <em>Saldarriaga v. Gonzales, </em>402 F.3d 461, 466 (4th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1169, 126 S.Ct. 1330, 164 L.Ed.2d 47 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. We dispense with oral 'argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b256-10\"> Because Barahona-Padilla does not challenge the Board\u2019s affirmance of the denials of asylum based on his membership in a particular social group, withholding of removal, or CAT relief, we will not consider the disposition of those claims. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b); <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir. 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
