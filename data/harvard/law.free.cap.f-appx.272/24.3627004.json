Hladylowycz denying petitioner\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Xue Mei Chen a.k.a. Weihong Liu, </em>No. A77 993 813 (B.I.A. Jul. 10, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A77 993 813 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 7, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Where, as here, the BIA adopts and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See, e.g., Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews questions of law and the application of law to fact <em>de novo. See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland See., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">We conclude that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. The agency found that there were \u201cmaterial discrepancies\u201d between Chen\u2019s testimony, her credible fear interview, and her airport interview. <em>See Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 396-98 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">Where an adverse credibility finding is based on inconsistencies.between an applicant\u2019s testimony and the record of her airport interview, we examine the interview to ensure that it represents a \u201csufficiently accurate record of the alien\u2019s statements to merit consideration\u201d in assessing credibility. <em>See Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 179 (2d Cir.2004). Here, the record of Chen\u2019s airport interview is sufficiently reliable because: the record consists of a verbatim list of the questions posed and Chen\u2019s answers; she was provided with a Chinese interpreter; she indicated that she understood the questions; her answers were responsive; and she was asked questions designed to elicit the details of her asylum claim, such as why she left China, whether she feared returning to China, and whether she would be harmed if she were returned. The record of the interview also indicates that she was given a chance to ask questions, she was asked whether there was anything she wanted to add to her statement, and she initialed each page and signed the statement. Because there is no indication that Chen\u2019s testimony was coerced, unfairly truncated, or mistranslated in any way, \u201cit is entirely appropriate that a factfinder consider such testimony when making a credibility assessment.\u201d <em>See Yun-Zui Guan, </em>432 F.3d at 397; <em>see also Kanacevic v. INS, </em>448 F.3d 129, 136-37 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">Similarly, we agree with the agency that the record of Chen\u2019s credible fear interview was reliable as well, \u201cnotwithstanding the asylum officer\u2019s failure to provide a verbatim transcript.\u201d <em>See Diallo v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 624, 633 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3 (2d Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">Having found that the agency reasonably relied on the statements Chen made in both her airport and credible fear interviews, we further find that substantial evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>dence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. The agency properly found that Chen\u2019s statement at her airport interview that she was a member of Falun Gong and practiced every morning was inconsistent with her subsequent hearing testimony that she had never been a practitioner and that her fear was based on the Chinese government imputing the beliefs of her friend and co-worker to her. This inconsistency is supported by the record and is substantial when measured against the record as a whole because it calls into question the basis of Chen\u2019s alleged fear. <em>See Secaida-Rosales, </em>381 F.3d at 308-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">The agency also properly found an inconsistency between Chen\u2019s assertion at her credible fear interview that she had not been identified as a Falun Gong practitioner \u201cbut fears she might be accused\u201d and her subsequent testimony that the police came to her house, told her mother that she practiced Falun Gong, and instructed her to have Chen report to the police station. Given these material inconsistencies, which go to the heart of Chen\u2019s claim for relief, we find no error in the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>See </em>id.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Because the only evidence of a threat to Chen\u2019s life or freedom depended upon her credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on her applications for withholding of removal and CAT relief. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2006); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005). To the extent that Chen based her CAT claim before the agency on her fear of torture for having departed China illegally, she has not raised that claim before this Court. Thus, we deem that claim to have been waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, Chen\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b50-6\">. Because we find that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence, we need not reach its additional finding that Chen failed to satisfy her burden of proof.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
