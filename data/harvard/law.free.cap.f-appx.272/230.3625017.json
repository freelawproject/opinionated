The applicable regulation clearly provides that (subject to an exception not relevant here) \u201c[i]n the case of an arriving alien who is placed in removal proceedings, the immigration judge does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate any application for adjustment of status filed by the arriving alien.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1)(H); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.2(a)(1) (2007) (stating that the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services \u201chas jurisdiction to adjudicate an application for adjustment of status filed by any alien, unless the immigration judge has jurisdiction to adjudicate the application under [the exception set forth in] 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1)\u201d).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">We also hold that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Akhtar\u2019s motion to remand proceedings to the immigration judge. <em>See Obioha v. Gonzales, </em>431 F.3d 400, 408 (4th Cir.2005) (standard of review of denial of motion to remand). Therefore, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-14\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b255-10\"> To the extent that Akhtar seeks to challenge the validity of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(4)(ii)(B) (2007), his failure to raise this claim before the Board deprives us of jurisdiction. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
