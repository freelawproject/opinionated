Sanders reserved the right to challenge on appeal the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress the evidence seized from his apartment at 629 S. Beechfield Avenue. He raises numerous claims challenging the validity of the search warrant and the district court\u2019s conclusion that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Sanders asserts for the first time on appeal that Detective Brooks violated Sanders\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights by using Sanders\u2019 keys to enter the Beechfield Avenue apartment before the state court judge issued the warrant and by conducting a protective sweep of that apartment. Next, Sanders asserts that Detective Brooks illegally searched another address without a warrant and that such search then rendered the items seized at the Beechfield Avenue apartment fruit of the poisonous tree. Sanders also contends that the search warrant was invalid because he did not make any representations to Detective Brooks about where he lived. Because Sanders believes that the warrant was based upon Brooks\u2019 misleading statements, he asserts that the district court\u2019s factual finding that he concealed the Beechfield Avenue apartment was clearly erroneous. Sanders did not raise these claims in the motion to suppress filed in the district court. Accordingly, we find that they are waived under the terms of his plea agreement. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3), (f); <em>United States v. Ricco, 52 </em>F.3d 58, 62 (4th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Lockett, </em>406 F.3d 207, 212 (3d Cir.2005) (\u201c[I] n the context of a motion to suppress, a defendant must have advanced substantially the same theories of suppression in the district court as he ... seeks to rely upon in this Court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">Sanders also asserts on appeal, as he did below, that the search warrant was invalid because there was no probable cause to believe that his drug activity was linked to the Beechfield Avenue apartment and that the good faith exception did not apply. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings underlying a motion to suppress for clear error and the district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo. <em>United States v. McCoy, </em>513 F.3d 405, 410 (4th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)). When a suppression motion has been denied, this court reviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>United States v. Colonna, </em>511 F.3d 431, 434 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">In reviewing the validity of a search warrant, the relevant inquiry is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the issuing judge had a substantial basis for concluding that there was probable cause to issue the warrant. <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983); <em>see United States v. Chandia, </em>514 F.3d 365, 373 (4th Cir.2008) (noting that magistrate\u2019s probable cause determination entitled to \u201cgreat deference\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number><em>United, States v. Grossman, </em>400 F.3d 212, 218 (4th Cir.2005) (\u201c[I]t is reasonable to suspect that a drug dealer stores drugs in a home to which he owns a key.\u201d). Even if a warrant is found to be defective, the evidence obtained from the defective warrant may nevertheless be admitted under the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule if the officers\u2019 reliance on the warrant was objectively reasonable. <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 922-23, 104 S.Ct. 3430, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984). With these standards in mind, we have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal and conclude that the district court did not err in denying Sanders\u2019 motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process. <em>AFFIRMED.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
