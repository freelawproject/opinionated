Ayuso appeals his 60-month sentence for possession with intent to distribute 100 or more marijuana plants, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Ayuso argues that the district court erred by failing to sustain his objection to the probation officer\u2019s assignment of one criminal history point for a petty larceny conviction in 2001 (\u201c2001 Petty Larceny\u201d) because the government failed to produce a sufficiently reliable record of conviction, and the record reflects that the district court did not believe that the government met its burden. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-15\">Ayuso pled guilty to the charge pursuant to a written plea agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Ayuso was assigned a total of two criminal history points: (1) one point for a 2002 conviction for driving while intoxicated (\u201c2001 DUI\u201d); and (2) one point for the 2001 Petty Larceny. Ayuso\u2019s guideline imprisonment range was 21 to 27 months. Because he had two criminal history points, Ayuso did not qualify for safety valve consideration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his objections to the report, Ayuso asserted that the probation officer had \u201cnot produced or verified by certified disposition that the criminal history points [were] a result of convictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b858-16\">At the sentencing hearing, the court noted that it had a certified copy of the computerized docket sheet for the 2001 Petty Larceny, but found that the document was ambiguous. The government later provided a waiver of preliminary hearing document for Ayuso\u2019s 2001 Petty Larceny. The government stated that this document indicated that there was a conviction following an entry of guilty, and, thus, even assuming that it was a diversionary disposition, it would still be counted under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(f).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>tion officer agreed with the government\u2019s assessment. Referring to the waiver of preliminary hearing document, the court stated,</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">It is certified. It states [Ayuso\u2019s] case number, his address, the date of arrest, the date of birth, his race, his gender. And, again, there is a paragraph that deals with different sorts of events that might occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">There is a file stamp, and although the file stamp is not congruent with the blanks that the file stamp is supposed to fill in, it seems to me that the unmistakable import of this document is that there was an adjudication of guilt for [Ayuso] in this case back in 2001. I can\u2019t think of any other possible way to read or interpret this certified state court document.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">As I read it, it says that [Ayuso] was brought before the Court on October 1st of 2001, that he entered a plea of guilty, that he was adjudicated guilty on those charges, and he was assessed court costs and/or fine of $136. And that, under Section 4A1.2 of the Guidelines, counts as a prior sentence. So that means that the safety valve is unavailable to [Ayu-so]. The court sentenced Ayuso to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, the statutory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the sentencing guidelines, and we review factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilks, </em>464 F.3d 1240, 1242 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 693, 166 L.Ed.2d 539 (2006) (internal citations omitted). The district court must correctly interpret and apply the Guidelines when calculating the appropriate advisory guideline range. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178-79 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">In calculating a defendant\u2019s criminal history category, one point is added for each prior sentence under 60 days. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(c). \u201cThe term \u2018prior sentence\u2019 means any sentence previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of <em>nolo conten-dere, </em>for conduct not part of the instant offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(l). The Commentary notes that a diversionary disposition is counted only where there is a finding or admission of guilt in a judicial proceeding. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1, comment. (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-13\">\u201c[W]hen a defendant challenges a factual basis of his sentence, the government has the burden of establishing the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Ndiaye, </em>434 F.3d 1270, 1300 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 128, 166 L.Ed.2d 95 (2006) (citation omitted). \u201cThe district court\u2019s factual findings for purposes of sentencing may be based on, among other things, evidence heard during trial, undisputed statements in the PSI, or evidence presented during the sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>Id/, see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a) (\u201cIn resolving any dispute concerning a factor important to the sentencing determination, the court may consider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-16\">We have held that a certified copy of a conviction is not necessary to support a finding of a conviction. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>183 F.3d 1291, 1301 (11th Cir. 1999) (noting that, \u201c[wjhile the best approach would always be to produce a certified copy of the conviction, we find the sources the district court relied upon-a PSI, the on-the-record statements of a probation officer, and the notes of another probation officer-when taken together, were sufficiently reliable to support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>court\u2019s finding that Herndon had been convicted of the weapons charge in question\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Acosta, </em>287 F.3d 1034, 1038 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that an uncertified copy of a juvenile adjudication, where the original was sealed and unavailable in its original form, proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had a prior drug conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">To prove the fact of Ayuso\u2019s 2001 Petty Larceny conviction, the government submitted the computerized docket sheet for case number B01057031, which listed the charge \u201cPetit Larceny, Theft,\u201d along with the disposition, \u201cCONV/CTS/FINE/COST,\u201d and the -date \u201c10/01/2001.\u201d The waiver of preliminary hearing document, which was poorly copied, nevertheless clearly displayed case number B01-57031 and showed a rectangular stamp with several markings inside, including three \u201cG\u2019s.\u201d The date \u201cOCT\u2014 12001\u201d also appeared inside the rectangular stamp at a slightly different angle. Although the stamps were not applied directly over the text, the court reasonably interpreted that the three \u201cG\u2019s\u201d referred to (1) Ayuso entering a plea of guilty, (2) the state court finding Ayuso guilty of the charge, and (3) the state court adjudging Ayuso guilty. Moreover, the probation officer agreed that the document indicated that there was a conviction following an entry of a guilty plea. Ayuso has offered no viable alternative explanation for the stamp\u2019s markings. Additionally, although the computerized docket sheet was ambiguous standing alone, it corroborates the court\u2019s finding that Ayuso was convicted of petty larceny when read in conjunction with the waiver of preliminary hearing document and the probation officer\u2019s testimony. Further, Ayuso\u2019s argument that the district court did not believe that the government met its burden of proving the fact of Ayuso\u2019s 2001 Petty Larceny conviction is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Therefore, the district court considered relevant, sufficiently reliable information and, thus, did not clearly err in finding that the government proved by a preponderance of the evidence the fact of Ayuso\u2019s 2001 Petty Larceny conviction. Accordingly, the court properly assigned one point for the prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">In light of the foregoing, Ayuso\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b858-11\">. The government is not enforcing the plea agreement's appeal waiver.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b858-12\">. To qualify for safety valve consideration, the defendant must have, among other things, only one criminal history point. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. If found eligible, the defendant can be sentenced in accordance with the applicable guidelines without regard to any statutory minimum sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b858-17\">.
