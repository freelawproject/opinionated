We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision, and we review both the decision of the IJ and the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">\u201cThe IJ\u2019s factual determinations, including credibility determinations, are reviewed under\u2018a substantial evidence standard, which provides that the IJ\u2019s decision can be reversed only if the evidence compels a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2006) (quotations omitted). \u201cUnder this highly deferential test, we affirm the IJ\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">\u201cAn alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1)). \u201cTo qualify for asylum, the alien must be a \u2018refugee.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"afp-dedup-0\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">\u201cThe asylum applicant must establish eligibility for asylum by offering credible, direct, and specific evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287 (quotations omitted). \u201cThe testimony of an applicant, if found to be credible, is alone sufficient to establish these factors. Conversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). However, \u201can adverse credibility determination does not alleviate the IJ\u2019s duty to consider other evidence produced by an asylum application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cFurther, the IJ must offer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">.\u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006). For example, in <em>Chen, </em>we upheld an adverse credibility determination where the IJ cited \u201ca number of inconsistencies and discrepancies between Chen\u2019s asylum application, his credible fear interview, and his testimony at the removal hearing.\u201d 463 F.3d at 1231-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">In the instant case, the IJ, citing several inconsistencies in the record, found Yolanda, Cesar, and Juan Felipe were not credible witnesses, and Petitioners failed to present a credible claim for asylum. The IJ noted numerous inconsistencies, includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>ing: (1) the date of Cesar\u2019s alleged kidnapping, (2) the location of Cesar when he was kidnapped, (3) how many people were with Cesar when he was kidnapped, (4) the actions Petitioners took to alert the authorities of Cesar\u2019s kidnapping, (5) the timing of Yolanda taking Juan Felipe out of school, and (6) Cesar\u2019s and Juan Felipe\u2019s location of hiding before they left Colombia for the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Additionally, the IJ found Yolanda\u2019s-credibility was undermined by the fact she came to the United States on two occasions after the alleged kidnapping, but never requested asylum or informed immigration officials she feared persecution in Colombia. The IJ also noted Cesar testified Yolanda returned to Colombia twice because she never had any intention of remaining in the United States, a fact which undermines her subjective fear of persecution. Similarly, the IJ found the credibility of Juan Maria was undermined because he never filed an asylum application, and found the credibility of Juan Felipe undermined because he inexcusably filed an untimely asylum application and failed to inform immigration officials he feared persecution in Colombia. Further, the IJ noted Yolanda was not familiar with the name of the lieutenant who wrote the letter in the record, and the letter erroneously provided Petitioners left Colombia in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">In sum, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, as a review of the record confirms there were numerous inconsistencies, and Petitioners cannot meet them burden of establishing the IJ failed to provide specific, cogent reasons for its ruling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. Because the record supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s denial of Petitioners\u2019 asylum applications, as they failed to offer credible evidence in support of their claims. Furthermore, there is no allegation the IJ failed to consider the documentary evidence submitted by Petitioners, as the inconsistencies identified by the IJ were based on both the record, in particular, the asylum applications and Yolanda\u2019s narrative, and the testimony at the healing. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">Because substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and the denial of Petitioners\u2019 applications for asylum we need not consider the IJ\u2019s alternative finding with respect to nexus and particular social group. Further, because Petitioners failed to establish a claim for asylum on the merits, they also necessarily failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 1288 n. 4. Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b811-16\">. Petitioners did not appeal the IJ\u2019s denial of their CAT claim to the BIA. Thus, Petitioners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies with respect to the IJ\u2019s denial of their CAT claim, and we lack jurisdiction to consider the issue. <em>See Alim v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 1239, 1253 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-24\">Additionally, in their brief, Petitioners do not challenge the IJ's determination that Juan Felipe\u2019s asylum application was untimely. Thus, they have abandoned this issue on appeal. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b813-7\">. The only inconsistency identified by the IJ not supported by the record was the finding the record did not contain any evidence Cesar attended military school.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
