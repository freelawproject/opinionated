July 6, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 694 710 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 30, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, the Court may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect the Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion. <em>Jigme Wangchuck v. DHS, </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. I.N.S., </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir. 2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t. of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law, including what quantum of evidence will suffice to discharge an applicant\u2019s burden of proof. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. I.N.S., </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003); <em>Islami v. Gonzales, </em>412 F.3d 391, 396 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">As an initial matter, we deem Huang\u2019s challenge to the agency\u2019s pretermission of her asylum claim and her application for relief under the CAT abandoned, as she has failed to raise those claims in her brief to this Court. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"ax-dedup-0\">We conclude that the BIA did not err in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of Huang\u2019s application for withholding of removal. The agency properly found that Huang established no personal knowledge of harm befalling any Chinese citizen who returned to the Fujian Province with two United States citizen children. <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir. 2004). The agency also found that the Aird affidavit was of limited relevance since it was prepared for a separate case, it predated the 2005 State Department Profile of Asylum Claims in the record, and it did not prove the existence of a national policy of forced sterilization for those returning from abroad. <em>See Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 274 (2d Cir.2006) (finding an Aird affidavit dated September 2004 to be of limited relevance). While Huang submitted numerous affidavits from family members, these affidavits came from relatives whose children were born in China, and thus, were not probative of how authorities in China treat Chinese nationals with U.S. born children. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005). Accordingly, in the absence of \u201csolid support in the record\u201d for a fear of persecution, the agency did not err in denying Huang\u2019s application for withholding of removal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
