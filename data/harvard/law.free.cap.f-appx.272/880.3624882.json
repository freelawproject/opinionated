However, we reverse as to his retaliation claim. The district court found that Rashad had established facts sufficient to support his prima facie case of retaliation; however, the court found that Rashad could not point to sufficient evidence rebutting Fulton County\u2019s proffered reason for terminating him. We find evidence in the record from which a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that Fulton County\u2019s proffered reason for terminating Rashad \u2014 insubordination \u2014 was merely pretextual. Thus, summary judgment on the retaliation claim was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
