He asserts that the district court erred in imposing a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) based upon a determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>tion that his prior burglary offense was a crime of violence. Perez was convicted under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(3), which does not require the perpetrator to have the intent to commit a crime upon entering the premises. <em>See </em>Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(3). Without such a requirement, the offense does not meet the generic definition of \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d as necessary to be a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>United States v. Herrera-Montes, </em>490 F.3d 390, 391-92 (5th Cir. 2007). In light of this error, we must vacate Perez\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 362-65 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Perez also asserts that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to address his arguments for a downward variance and because our post-<em>jBooker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rulings have reinstated the mandatory guidelines regime. Because we have determined that the case should be remanded for resentencing, we need not consider Perez\u2019s arguments about the reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Finally, Perez challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v.
