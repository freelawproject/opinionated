Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000), \u201c[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General under paragraph (2),\u201d which includes both the Attorney General\u2019s decisions whether an alien has complied with the one-year time limit and whether there are changed or extraordinary circumstances excusing the untimeliness. Courts of appeal have uniformly held this jurisdiction-stripping provision precludes judicial review not only of all such determinations, but also of the merits of the underlying asylum claim. <em>See Chen v. U.S. Dep,t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 151 (2d Cir.2006) (collecting cases). Given this jurisdictional bar, we cannot review Albert\u2019s challenge to the finding that his asylum application was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Albert also contends the Board and the immigration judge erred in denying his request for withholding of removal. \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b) (2007). Based on our review of the record, we find that Albert failed to make the requisite showing. We therefore uphold the denial of his request for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">Accordingly, we deny Albert\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-9\"> In his brief before this court, Albert has failed to raise any challenges to the denial of his request for protection under the Convention Against Torture. We therefore find that he has waived appellate review of this claim. See <em>Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 189 n. 7 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
