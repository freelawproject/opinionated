Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 600 (9th Cir.2006) (concluding that the court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of motion to reopen for failure to establish a prima facie case if a prior adverse discretionary decision was made by the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-26\">The BIA also properly determined that petitioners\u2019 motion, construed as a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>to reconsider, was untimely. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1008.2(b) (providing that a motion to reconsider must be filed within 30 days after the date on which a final administrative decision was filed).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b582-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
