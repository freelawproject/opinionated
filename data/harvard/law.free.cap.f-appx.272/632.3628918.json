We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition, <em>Sass v. Cal. Bd. of Prison Terms, </em>461 F.3d 1123, 1126 (9th Cir.2006), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">Respondent\u2019s contention that Chan does not have a clearly established liberty interest in parole is foreclosed. <em>See id. </em>at 1127-28. Respondent\u2019s contention that the \u201csome evidence\u201d standard does not apply to parole decisions is also foreclosed. <em>See Biggs v. Terhune, </em>334 F.3d 910, 915 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-16\">Chan contends that the Board\u2019s 2003 decision denying him parole violated his due process rights because the Board relied exclusively on his commitment offense and other unchanging factors in its decision. We reject the contention. The Board relied on Chan\u2019s failure to continue to participate in self-help programming subsequent to his last parole denial and his insufficient parole plans, in addition to the commitment offense and other unchanging factors in reaching its decision. <em>See Sass, </em>461 F.3d at 1128-29. Furthermore, Chan was afforded an opportunity to be heard and he received a statement of reasons explaining why his parole was denied. <em>See Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal &amp; Corr. Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 14-16, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-17\">We also conclude that some evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision to deny parole. <em>See Superintendent v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 455, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985); <em>Irons v. Carey, </em>505 F.3d 846, 851-52 (9th Cir.2007). Accordingly, Chan has failed to demonstrate that the state court\u2019s decision denying .this claim \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d or \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>see also Hill, </em>472 U.S. at 454-56, 105 S.Ct. 2768.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-18\">Chan\u2019s contentions that the Board\u2019s decision violated California parole law are questions of state law that we will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>review here. <em>See Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991) (\u201c[I]t is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine state-court determinations on state-law questions\u201d); <em>Langford v. Day, </em>110 F.3d 1380, 1389 (9th Cir.1997) (A federal habeas petitioner \u201cmay not ... transform a state-law issue into a federal one merely by asserting a violation of due process. We accept a state court\u2019s interpretation of state law, ... and alleged errors in the application of state law are not cognizable in federal habeas corpus\u201d) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b657-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
