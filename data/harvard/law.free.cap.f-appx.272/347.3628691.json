For his successive-habeas application, pursuant to <em>Atkins v. Virginia, </em>536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002) (execution of mentally-retarded criminal cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by Eighth Amendment), the district court denied relief but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on one issue. Lewis\u2019 request for a COA from this court on additional issues is DENIED. The issue for which the district court granted a COA will be addressed in a subsequent opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">In September 1990, during the burglary of George Newman\u2019s residence, Lewis murdered him and sexually assaulted his fianc\u00e9. A state-court jury convicted Lewis in April 1994 of capital murder; he was sentenced to death. Holding the trial court had not applied the recently revised special issues, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) upheld the conviction but remanded for a new punishment-phase hearing. <em>Lewis v. State, </em>No. 71,887 (Tex. Crim.App. 19 Jun. 1996) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">On remand, Lewis was again sentenced to death; the TCCA affirmed. <em>Lewis v. State, </em>No. 71,887 (Tex.Crim.App. 28 Jun. 1999). Lewis did not seek review by the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">While his direct appeal was pending, Lewis requested state post-conviction relief. It was denied. <em>Ex parte Lewis, </em>No. 44,725-01 (Tex.Crim.App. 19 Apr. 2000) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Lewis then requested federal habeas relief, which was denied in 2002. Our court affirmed that denial. <em>Lewis v. Cockrell, </em>58 Fed.Appx. 596 (5th Cir.2003) (unpublished). The Supreme Court denied review in October 2003. <em>Lewis v. Dretke, </em>540 U.S. 841, 124 S.Ct. 108, 157 L.Ed.2d 75 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">Following the 2002 <em>Atkins </em>decision, Lewis filed a successive-habeas application in state court, contending he is mentally retarded and thus, in the light of <em>Atkins, </em>ineligible for execution. The TCCA, in July 2003, stayed Lewis\u2019 scheduled execution and remanded the matter to a state trial court to consider the <em>Atkins </em>claim. <em>Ex parte Lewis, </em>No. 44,725-02, 2003 WL 21751491 (Tex.Crim.App.24 Jul.2003) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">The state trial court conducted an evi-dentiary hearing in December 2004. That court, in February 2005, rendered findings of fact and conclusions of law, and recommended relief be denied. The TCCA denied relief, based on the state trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions, and on the court\u2019s independent review. <em>Ex parte Lewis, </em>No. 44,725-02 (Tex.Crim.App.29 Jun.2005) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-13\">Between the state trial court\u2019s February 2005 recommendation and the TCCA\u2019s denial of relief that June, and concerned about the limitations period of the Antiter-rorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Lewis received permission from this court to file a successive federal habeas application for his <em>Atkins </em>claim, conditioned on the denial of relief by the TCCA. <em>In re Lewis, </em>No. 05-40484 (5th Cir. 15 Apr. 2005) (unpublished). Lewis filed his federal application in district court on 20 April 2005. Therefore, when the TCCA denied relief that June, which prompted Lewis\u2019 execution being set, the federal district court granted Lewis\u2019 unopposed motion to stay the execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-14\">In June 2007, that court ruled Lewis failed to establish he is mentally retarded; all relief was denied. <em>Lewis v. Quarterman, </em>No. 5:05-CV-70, 2007 WL 1830748 (E.D. Tex. 22 Jun. 2007) (unpublished). That August, the district court granted a COA on one issue. That COA is whether, based upon the evidence submitted in the state-court proceeding, the following TCCA determination was unreasonable: Lewis failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he had significantly sub-average general intellectual functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Lewis seeks a COA on additional issues. In that regard, his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 successive-habeas application is subject to AEDPA. <em>E.g., Penry v. Johnson, </em>532 U.S. 782, 792, 121 S.Ct. 1910, 150 L.Ed.2d 9 (2001). Under AEDPA, Lewis may not appeal the denial of habeas relief unless he first obtains a COA from either the district, or this, court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c); <em>Miller v. Dretke, </em>404 F.3d 908, 912 (5th Cir.2005) (citations omitted). The district court must first decide whether to grant a COA; only if it is denied by that court may a COA on that issue be requested here. Fed. R.App. P. 22(b)(1). Having been denied a COA on all but one issue by the district court, Lewis asks this court to grant a COA on others.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">To obtain a COA, Lewis must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a <em>constitutional right </em>\u201d. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (emphasis added); <em>see Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). To make such a showing, when, as here, the district court\u2019s habeas denial is on the merits, Lewis must demonstrate \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further\u201d. <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029 (quoting <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">In deciding whether to grant a COA, we can make only a threshold inquiry into the district court\u2019s application of AEDPA to Lewis\u2019 constitutional claims; we may not consider the factual or legal merits in support of the claims. <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhen a court of appeals sidesteps this process by first deciding the merits of an appeal, and then justifying its denial of a COA based on its adjudication of the actual merits, it is in essence deciding an appeal without jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 336-37, 123 S.Ct. 1029. For purposes of our threshold inquiry, we are cognizant that, under AEDPA, the district court was required, -with limited exceptions, to defer to the state court\u2019s resolution of Lewis\u2019 claims. Those exceptions turn on the character of the state-court\u2019s ruling. <em>Foster v. Quarterman, </em>466 F.3d 359, 365 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">First, on questions of law, as well as mixed questions of law and fact, the district court was required to defer to the state-court\u2019s decision unless it \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\u201d. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>see Miller, </em>404 F.3d at 913. The state-court\u2019s decision is considered contrary to clearly established federal law if it \u201creaches a legal conclusion in direct conflict with a prior decision of the Supreme Court or if it reaches a different conclusion than the Supreme Court based on materially indistinguishable facts\u201d. <em>Miller, </em>404 F.3d at 913 (quoting <em>Miniel v. Cockrell, </em>339 F.3d 331, 337 (5th Cir.2003)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Second, our threshold inquiry must recognize the district court\u2019s obligation to defer to the state-court\u2019s factual findings, unless they \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding\u201d. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). Along that line, the district court was required to presume the state-court\u2019s factual findings were correct, unless Lewis rebutted that presumption by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">Moreover, our threshold inquiry requires consideration of a COA request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>against the backdrop of the elements of Lewis\u2019 underlying constitutional claims. <em>See Miller, </em>404 F.3d at 913. Needless to say, meaningful review of whether Lewis has made the requisite 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d requires our considering these elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Lewis seeks a COA on the following two claims: the district court erred by refusing to consider an affidavit <em>not </em>presented in the state-court proceeding; and the State should bear the burden of proving a capital defendant is <em>not </em>mentally retarded. In addition, he <em>seems </em>to request a COA on whether the district court was required to review the scientific methodology applied by the experts in state court. None of these issues satisfies the above-stated standard for granting a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Lewis seeks a COA on whether the district court should have considered the affidavit of Dr. Gale Roid, the author of the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales, Fifth Edition (IQ test). Dr. Roid\u2019s affidavit challenges Dr. Susan Rosin\u2019s administration of this IQ test to Lewis. Lewis claims: Dr. Rosin\u2019s failure to follow procedures resulted in flawed findings; and state-court reliance on Dr. Rosin\u2019s testimony was objectively unreasonable. The district court ruled: because Dr. Roid\u2019s affidavit had <em>not </em>been presented in a state-court proceeding, it could <em>not </em>be considered because of the limitations imposed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2) (no habeas relief unless state-court decision \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence <em>presented in the State court proceeding\u201d, </em>(emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">In seeking a COA for this claim, Lewis does <em>not </em>assert the denial of the requisite <em>constitutional right. </em>As noted, the district court granted a COA on whether the state court\u2019s determination (that Lewis failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he had significantly sub-average general intellectual functioning) was unreasonable, based upon the evidence submitted in the state-court proceeding. Accordingly, in considering this issue on the merits, our court will necessarily review Dr. Rosin\u2019s administration of the IQ test. The related evidentiary ruling Lewis presents here, concerning Dr. Roid\u2019s affidavit, as a request for an expansion of the already-granted COA, pertains to possible evidence to be considered when the merits are addressed for the issue on which the district court granted a COA. (In addressing those merits, our court will decide whether Dr. Roid\u2019s affidavit should have been considered by the district court.) Restated, this evidentiary issue is <em>not </em>one for which a COA is required; again, it does <em>not </em>concern the denial of a constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">Lewis <em>seems </em>to request a COA for whether the district court was required to review the scientific methodology applied by experts in state court to determine whether he was mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">Assuming he is making such a request, once again, no denial of a constitutional right is asserted. As discussed above, this is instead an evidentiary question, <em>not </em>involving the requisite denial of such a right. Therefore, a COA <em>is not </em>required. If this issue was properly raised earlier, it will be considered when the merits are addressed in a subsequent opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-15\">In the alternative, assuming this is a proper subject for a COA request, Lewis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>did not present this issue in his COA request in district court. Along that line, as discussed <em>supra, </em>before this court can consider a COA request, a COA for that issue must have been denied by the district court. <em>Brewer v. Quarterman, </em>466 F.3d 344, 346 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 63, 169 L.Ed.2d 52 (2007); <em>Whitehead v. Johnson, </em>157 F.3d 384, 388 (5th Cir.1998). In other words, \u201clack of a ruling on a COA in the district court causes this court to be without jurisdiction to consider\u201d a COA belatedly requested here. <em>Sonnier v. Johnson, </em>161 F.3d 941, 946 (5th Cir.1998) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Lewis requests a COA on whether the state court violated his constitutional rights by imposing on him the burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he is mentally retarded. Lewis claims the State should instead bear the burden to prove, <em>beyond a reasonable doubt, </em>he is <em>not </em>mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">The Supreme Court has left \u201cto the State[s] the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon [their] execution of sentences\u201d. <em>Atkins, </em>536 U.S. at 317, 122 S.Ct. 2242 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Ford v. Wainwright, 477 </em>U.S. 399, 416-17, 106 S.Ct. 2595, 91 L.Ed.2d 335 (1986)). Along that line, Texas has \u201cplace[d] the burden of proof upon the defendant to show mental retardation by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d. <em>Ex parte Briseno, </em>135 S.W.3d 1, 12 (Tex.Crim.App.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">A COA does <em>not </em>appear to be requested for any other issue. If one is requested, however, it is denied because of inadequate briefing. <em>E.g., Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 612-13 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">For the foregoing reasons, a COA is DENIED. The issue for which the district court granted a COA will be addressed in a subsequent opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b372-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
