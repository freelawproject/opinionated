We review the denial of a motion for a continuance for abuse of discretion. <em>Lendo v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 439, 441 (4th Cir.2007); <em>Onyeme v. INS, </em>146 F.3d 227, 231 (4th Cir.1998). The court \u201cmust uphold the IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance \u2018unless it was made without a rational explanation, it inexplicably departed from established policies, or it rested on an impermissible basis, e.g., invidious discrimination against a particular race or group.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lendo, </em>493 F.3d at 441 (quoting <em>Onyeme, </em>146 F.3d at 231).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-24\">Because the immigration judge was without jurisdiction to consider Bamford\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>application for adjustment of status, we find no abuse of discretion in denying the motion for a continuance. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
