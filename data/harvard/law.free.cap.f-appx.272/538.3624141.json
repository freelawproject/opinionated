The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> imposed a prison term of 27 months to run consecutively to his undischarged federal and state terms of imprisonment, and a 3-year term of supervised release to run concurrently with his undischarged federal term of supervised release. On appeal, Allen\u2019s counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he requests permission to withdraw and presents arguments related to the calculation of Allen\u2019s base offense level under the Guidelines, the requirement that Allen\u2019s sentence run consecutively to his undischarged state sentence, and the denial of Allen\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-15\">We conclude that the district court properly determined Allen\u2019s base offense level to be 13. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2P1.2(a)(2) (base offense level of 13 applies if contraband possessed in prison was narcotic drug); <em>United States v. Blanton, </em>281 F.3d 771, 775 (8th Cir.2002) (district court\u2019s interpretation and application of Guidelines reviewed de novo). Although the indictment mistakenly referred to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(b)(2), instead of \u00a7 1791(b)(1) (applicable when the offense involved narcotic drug), Allen was not prejudiced by the mistake because he stated at the plea hearing that he was not promised anything as to what his sentence would be, he conceded that heroin is a narcotic drug, and he was sentenced at the bottom of the properly calculated Guidelines range \u2014 well below both the 10-year maximum he acknowledged and the correct 20-year statutory maximum. <em>Cf. </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(3) (unless defendant was misled and thereby prejudiced, neither error in citation nor citation\u2019s omission is ground to dismiss indictment or to reverse conviction); <em>United States v. Czeck, </em>671 F.2d 1195, 1197 (8th Cir.1982) (\u201cAn indictment is fatally insufficient when an essential element \u2018of substance\u2019 is omitted, rather than one \u2018of form\u2019 only.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-16\">We further conclude there is no merit to Allen\u2019s challenge to the requirement that his new sentence run consecutively to his undischarged state sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(c) (\u201cAny punishment imposed under subsection (b) for a violation of this section by an inmate of a px\u2019ison shall be consecutive to the sentence being served by such inmate at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>the inmate commits such violation.\u201d); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(a) (if instant offense was committed while defendant was serving term of imprisonment, sentence for instant offense shall be imposed to ran consecutively to undischarged term of imprisonment); <em>Swepston v. United States, </em>289 F.2d 166, 168 (8th Cir.1961) (right to impose consecutive sentences is inherent in federal courts).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">We also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Allen\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea, because during the plea hearing, Allen confirmed his understanding of\u2014 among other things \u2014 the possibility of a consecutive sentence of up to 10 years in prison and the limitations on his ability to withdraw a guilty plea. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B) (defendant may withdraw plea if he can show fair and just reason for requesting withdrawal); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>481 F.3d 1113, 1114 (8th Cir.) (abuse-of-discretion standard; guilty plea should not be set aside lightly; affirming district court\u2019s denial of request to withdraw plea and rejecting defendant\u2019s claim that he did not fully understand ramifications of plea where district court fully advised him of those ramifications at plea hearing and defendant testified under oath that he understood them), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 122, 169 L.Ed.2d 85 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment and we grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw on condition that counsel inform appellant about th\u00e9 procedures for filing petitions for rehearing and for certiorari.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b563-12\">.
