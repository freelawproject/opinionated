Hall, <em>Judge), </em>granting summary judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellee Pratt <em>&amp; </em>Whitney Power Systems, Inc. (\u201cPWPS\u201d) on all of Medeiros\u2019s claims of age discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq., </em>and the Connecticut Fair Employment Practices Act (\u201cCFEPA\u201d), Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 46a-60(a)(l) and 46a-100. Medeiros alleged that PWPS unlawfully terminated his employment on account of his age, and the District Court applied the burden-shifting analysis articulated in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-03, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), to these claims. In doing so, the District Court held that no genuine issue of material fact existed on the issue of whether PWPS\u2019s asserted reasons for terminating Medeiros\u2019s <em>employment </em>\u2014 ie., its general efforts to cut costs due to deteriorating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>conditions for the energy industry in 2002 and the specific results of comparative assessment of the Project Management Group, as conducted by James Maus, the group supervisor \u2014 were pretext for unlawful discrimination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of PWPS and, therefore, we vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the remaining background, procedural history, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The first basis for our vacatur lies in the District Court\u2019s consideration of evidence of pretext in the context of an employer\u2019s summary judgment motion. The District Court acknowledged the \u201csubjective nature\u201d of the Employee Assessment Matrix used by Maus to evaluate those in the Project Management Group, including Me-deiros. The District Court also correctly noted that a subjective evaluation, without more, cannot permit a finding of pretext, as long as the results of such an evaluation \u2014 and thus the reasons asserted for the adverse employment action \u2014 are \u201cclear[,j ... specific, [and] honest.\u201d <em>Byrnie v. Town of Cromwell, </em>243 F.3d 93,104-05 (2d Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). In considering the Employee Assessment Matrix, the District Court found that it \u201cprovides fairly clear and specific reasons for the ranking of employees, and it is undisputed that PWPS utilized that matrix, and then dismissed the lowest-ranking employees.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, in deciding to grant summary judgment in favor of PWPS, the District Court did not consider evidence of the subjective nature of the Employee Assessment Matrix to be part of Medeiros\u2019s \u201caggregate evidence of pretext\u201d in the record. However, the District Court noted that the subjective nature of the assessment process required it to undertake \u201ca particularly careful review of whether the record contains evidence that PWPS\u2019s explanation is not credible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>In reviewing the record, the District Court identified two pieces of evidence that, in its view, might undermine the otherwise legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons articulated by PWPS. First, despite having served as supervisor for only a few months when he completed the Employee Assessment Matrix for his subordinates, Maus did not \u201cfamiliarize himself with the individual educational backgrounds or pri- or work experiences of the employees he was ranking.\u201d This failure contravened the relevant directions contained in the Employee Assessment Guidelines, and the District Court concluded that evidence on this issue \u201ccould be found probative of pretext.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Second, although Maus testified during his deposition that he had met with another supervisor named David Tur-ley to determine whether Turley agreed with his assessments, Turley testified that he did not recall any such meeting. The District Court concluded that a reasonable jury could question Maus\u2019s credibility generally based on this inconsistency in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Despite concluding that Medeiros had proffered evidence challenging the credibility of PWPS\u2019s explanation for his termination, the District Court nonetheless concluded that summary judgment was appropriate. In doing so, the District Court acknowledged that \u201c[i]t is possible, although not obvious ..., that [this evidence] ... could persuade a reasonable jury to question as pretext [the employer\u2019s] explanation for Medeiros\u2019[s] low ranking.\u201d Inexplicably, however, the District Court nonetheless decided to grant summary judgment because Medeiros\u2019s evidence of pretext was \u201cfairly weak.\u201d On a motion for summary judgment, a district court must consider the evidence in the context of whether any reasonable finder of fact \u2014 not merely the district court itself \u2014 could return a verdict in favor of the non-moving party. <em>See Higazy v. Templeton, </em>505 F.3d 161, 168-69 (2d Cir.2007). Moreover, the District Court\u2019s conclusion conflicts with the guidance of the Supreme Court that \u201c[p]roof that the defendant\u2019s explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional discrimination, and it may be quite persuasive.\u201d <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 147, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). Here, in granting summary judgment, the District Court improperly substituted its own assessment of the evidence of pretext for that of a reasonable jury. We have previously vacated a grant of summary judgment in such circumstances. <em>See, e.g., D\u2019Cunha v. Genovese/Eckerd Corp., </em>479 F.3d 193, 196 (2d Cir.2007) (vacating a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of an employer where the employee had proffered evidence that arguably undermined employer\u2019s reasons for failing to hire employee).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Furthermore, the District Court improperly excluded other evidence from its consideration of the \u201caggregate evidence of pretext\u201d in the record. Despite the fact that Avram had supervised Medeiros for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>approximately fifteen months, the District Court excluded the Avram affidavit from its compilation of pretext evidence because Avram did not supervise Medeiros or any other employee in the Project Management Group in 2002. However, Avram specifically states, in his affidavit, that he would have ranked Medeiros \u201camong the top two or three\u201d and that a \u201cfair comparison of these employees could not have resulted in Mr. Medeiros\u2019 being ranked in the bottom three.\u201d While the probative value of this evidence is weakened by the fact that Avram left PWPS in July 2001, a reasonable jury could nonetheless view the Avram affidavit as circumstantial evidence undermining the credibility of Maus\u2019s evaluation of Medeiros and his peers, thus serving as evidence of pretext. <em>See Reeves, </em>530 U.S. at 147, 149, 120 S.Ct. 2097. This is particularly possible given the fact that Avram\u2019s tenure as Manager of the Project Management Group was significantly longer than Maus\u2019s few months in the position at the time that Maus completed the Employee Assessment Matrix for each of his subordinates. Indeed, the District Court itself noted that \u201cAvram\u2019s statement could lead a reasonable jury to infer that Medeiros had qualities that made him a good employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">In excluding the Avram affidavit, the District Court relied on <em>Bynvie </em>to hold that an employee seeking to prevent summary judgment on his discrimination claim solely on the basis of a discrepancy in qualifications must demonstrate that his ! credentials were \u201cso superior to the credentials of the person selected for the job that \u2018no reasonable person, in the exercise of impartial judgment, could have chosen the candidate selected over the plaintiff for the job in question.\u2019\u201d 243 F.3d at 103 (quoting <em>Deines v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Protective &amp; Regulatory Sens., </em>164 F.3d 277, 280-81 (5th Cir.1999)). However, <em>Bynvie </em>also held that the mere fact that such a discrepancy in qualifications between an unsuccessful job applicant and the successful applicant is not sufficient, without more, to withstand summary judgment does not strip such evidence of all probative value whatsoever. <em>See id. </em>In <em>Byrnie, </em>we vacated the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the employer on the plaintiffs disparate treatment claims on the ground that a reasonable jury could find the employer\u2019s reasons for failing to hire the plaintiff were not credible due to the discrepancy in qualifications <em>and </em>the employer\u2019s digressions from its established hiring procedures when considering the successful candidate\u2019s application. <em>See id. </em>at 103-04. Here, the District Court erred in excluding the Avram affidavit from its consideration of the \u201caggregate evidence of pretext\u201d in the record and thereby concluding, in essence, that the affidavit lacked any probative value on Medeiros\u2019s discrimination claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the judgment of the District Court and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>REMAND the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-6\">. The District Court was arguably unclear as to whether its decision to grant summary judgment in favor of PWPS rested solely on this ground. In considering the fourth prong of a prima facie case of age discrimination under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework, the District Court stated that it \"doubtfed] that Medeiros ... made even the 'de minimus\u2019 [sic] prima facie showing that the circumstances surrounding the termination could lead a reasonable jury to infer that the discharge was motivated by age discrimination.\u201d Although the District Court also later characterized Medeiros\u2019s prima face case as \u2018\u2018fairly weak,\u201d the District Court did not explicitly conclude that no reasonable jury could find, based on the evidence in the record, that Medeiros had not established a prima facie case of discrimination. As a result, we will assume, for purposes of this appeal, that the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of PWPS only on the ground that no reasonable jury could find that PWPS's asserted reasons for terminating Medeiros were pretextual.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b103-9\">. It is unclear from the District Court's decision whether it made a factual finding regarding the clarity and specificity of the Employee Assessment Matrix or, instead, concluded that no reasonable jury could find that the assessment process was unclear and non-specific, as required by <em>Byrnie, </em>243 F.3d at 104-05, to permit a finding of pretext. To the extent that the District Court failed to evaluate the evidence in the record from the perspective of what <em>any </em>reasonable juty could find, such an approach is inappropriate on a motion for summary judgment. <em>See Higazv v. Templeton, </em>505 F.3d 161, 168-69 (2d Cir.2007) (stating that such a motion must be denied when, after \"examining the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, ... a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party\u201d (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)). Indeed, a reasonable jury could conclude that one supervisor\u2019s assigning numbers merely based upon his own subjective evaluation of different aspects of a subordinate\u2019s job performance provides, at best, only unclear and non-specific reasons for that employee\u2019s termination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b104-5\">. As to the related evidence of Medeiros's past performance reviews, the District Court held that such evidence was not probative of pretext because the relevant Employee Assessment Guidelines state that the \u201ckey focus\u201d of the evaluation was \u201cthe ability of the employee to perform under current and projected business conditions.\u201d As any reviews related only to Medeiros's <em>past </em>job performance, the District Court apparently did not consider them relevant to the issue of Medeiros's current performance. In this respect, the District Court erred because a reasonable jury could view such positive reviews as circumstantial evidence of Medeiros's abilities in 2002, notwithstanding Maus\u2019s evaluation to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b105-7\">. The District Court appears to have erred, for similar reasons, in concluding that evidence of differences in education and work experiences between Medeiros and favorably treated employees in the Project Management Group was not probative of pretext. As in its analysis of the Avram affidavit, the District Court examined whether \"no reasonable person, in the exercise of impartial judgment\u201d would have ranked these individuals above Medeiros based solely on this evidence. The proper inquiry is simply whether the evidence has <em>any </em>probative value on the issue of whether the employer's reasons for Medeiros\u2019s termination were credible. <em>See Byrnie, </em>243 F.3d at 103-04. After considering evidence of Me-deiros's and his peers' education and work experiences in isolation from all of evidence of pretext to conclude that this evidence, without more, would not support a jury\u2019s finding of pretext, the District Court then erroneously held that the evidence lacked any probative value whatsoever.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
