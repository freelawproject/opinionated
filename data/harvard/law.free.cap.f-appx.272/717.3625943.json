BALDOCK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b741-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-21\">Defendant Hugo Snyder-Aguirre was indicted on, among other things, one count of illegal reentry of a previously deported alien in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(1), and one count of assaulting a federal officer in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(a)(1). Prior to the scheduled trial, Defendant\u2019s third appointed counsel (in the course of nine months) moved the district court for permission to file a motion in limine which Defendant prepared himself and insisted on presenting to the Court. Defendant\u2019s proffered motion suggested the Government denied him due process of law in the context of his anticipated civil deportation proceeding, which, in turn, tainted his criminal prosecution. Following the district court\u2019s denial of Defendant\u2019s motion in limine, Defendant entered a conditional guilty plea to the two aforementioned counts. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2). Defendant pled guilty subject only to the reservation in a plea agreement of (1) his right to appeal the denial of his motion in limine and (2) his right to collaterally attack his conviction based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The district court sentenced Defendant to seventy months imprisonment, and he appealed. On appeal, Defendant \u2014 now represented by a fourth appointed counsel \u2014 argues (1) the district court denied him the right to proceed pro se at the motion in limine hearing, and (2) his counsel was ineffective in performing a \u201chybrid representation\u201d at the hearing which did not allow a full exposition of Defendant\u2019s arguments, both in violation of his Sixth Amendment-rights. We dismiss Defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Generally, a defendant who has acknowledged in open court that he is in fact guilty of the offense with which he is charged may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights <em>occurring prior to the entry of his guilty plea:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">\u201c[A] guilty plea represents a break in the chain of events which has preceded it in the criminal process. When a criminal defendant has solemnly admitted in open court that he is in fact guilty of the offense with which he is charged, he may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea. He may only attack the voluntary and intelligent character of the guilty plea by showing that the advice he received from counsel was not [competent]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\"><em>United States v. Salazar, </em>323 F.3d 852, 856 (10th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973)). Under Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2), a defendant, with the consent of the Government and district court, may enter a conditional guilty plea, reserving in writing the right to have us review an adverse determination of a specified pretrial motion. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>374 F.3d 955, 957 (10th Cir. 2004). The question in this case is whether Defendant\u2019s reservation of his right to appeal the denial of his motion in limine extends to his Sixth Amendment arguments. In other words, Defendant may advance his Sixth Amendment arguments only if he did not waive them by pleading guilty. In deciding this question, we ask \u201c(1) whether the disputed appeal falls within the scope of the waiver of appellate rights; (2) whether the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights; and (3) whether enforcing the waiver would result in a miscarriage of justice----\u201d <em>United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315, 1325 (10th Cir.2004) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-12\">In his opening brief, Defendant only obliquely touches upon the substantive merits of his motion in limine for the obvious reason that his motion was meritless. Nor does he assert that his waiver of his appellate rights as part of his guilty plea was unknowing or involuntary. Instead, Defendant claims he was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel. But Defendant did not reserve the right to appeal the denial of this Sixth Amendment rights. The arguments which Defendant presents to us on appeal simply have nothing to do with the merits of his motion in limine. If Defendant\u2019s counsel got stuck in a \u201chybrid representation\u201d situation to Defendant\u2019s detriment, if counsel failed to present evidence favorable to Defendant, or if counsel failed to properly argue Defendant\u2019s motion in limine, Defendant may raise those claims, consistent with the terms of his plea agreement, on collateral review pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Galloway, </em>56 F.3d 1239, 1240 (10th Cir.1995) (en banc). No miscarriage of justice could possibly occur by our failure to address Defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment arguments at this stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-13\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b741-18\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
