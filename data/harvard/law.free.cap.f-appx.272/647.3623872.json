Schow appeals the district court\u2019s decision upholding the Social Security Administration Commissioner\u2019s denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>of Schow\u2019s application for Supplemental Security Income benefits. We reverse the district court and remand this matter for further proceedings. The parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, so we do not repeat it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">The court reviews de novo the district court\u2019s order affirming the administrative law judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) denial of social security benefits. <em>Orn v. Astrue, </em>495 F.3d 625, 630 (9th Cir.2007). The court will disturb the denial of benefits only if the decision \u201ccontains legal error or is not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">1. <em>The ALJ Correctly Rejected Five of Schow\u2019s Claimed Errors.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">We hold that five of Schow\u2019s objections are not persuasive. First, the ALJ provided clear and convincing reasons for rejecting Dr. Colistro\u2019s medical opinion regarding Schow\u2019s purported mental impairments. <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that an ALJ must provide clear and convincing reasons for rejecting an examining physician\u2019s uncontradicted medical opinion). The ALJ properly concluded that Dr. Colistro\u2019s opinion was \u201cnot supported by the treatment record,\u201d evidenced by facts including that Schow denied having any mental impairment; did not seek treatment for depression or mental health counseling; had only \u201cmild limitations in activities of daily living, social functioning, or concentration, persistence or pace\u201d; and had no extended decompensation episodes.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Second, we find that any error in evaluating Drs. Sibell and Siddiqui\u2019s diagnosis regarding myofascial dysfunction, and Dr. Krueger\u2019s assessment of chronic pain syndrome, was harmless. <em>See Robbins v. Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>466 F.3d 880, 885 (9th Cir.2006) (stating that error is harmless if it is inconsequential to the ultimate determination). While the ALJ did not discuss these diagnoses by name, and thus did not provide clear and convincing reasons for rejecting them, <em>Lester, </em>81 F.3d at 830, the ALJ actually considered the reported physical effects of these conditions in arriving at the disability determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">Third, the record supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Schow\u2019s myofascial dysfunction, depression, obsessive-compulsive tendencies, and somatic preoccupation were not severe. Schow failed to meet his burden of proving that these conditions significantly limited his physical or mental ability to do basic work activities. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.912, 416.921; <em>Thomas v. Barnhart, </em>278 F.3d 947, 954-55 (9th Cir. 2002). The ALJ\u2019s decision is reasonably based on his rejection of Dr. Colistro\u2019s medical opinion, Schow\u2019s repeated denials of depression, and his decision not to seek treatment. Moreover, Schow did not raise mental impairments in his initial benefits claim or his request for reconsideration. Additionally, Schow offered no evidence of myofascial dysfunction and chronic pain syndrome aside from the brief reports from Drs. Siddiqui, Sibell, and Krueger, which, in any event, the ALJ considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">Fourth, the ALJ did not improperly reject the non-examining physician opinions from the Disability Determination Services consultants, Drs. Pritchard and McDonald. We find that the ALJ properly treated these non-examining physicians\u2019 opinions as opinion evidence and explained that they were entitled to \u201csignificant weight.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(f)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Fifth, the ALJ adequately explained his reasons for giving \u201clittle weight\u201d to the opinion of Thanh Nguyen, a nurse practitioner. An ALJ may consider opinions from sources other than \u201cacceptable medical sources,\u201d like a nurse practitioner, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.918(d)(1), and may discount those opinions by providing reasons that are \u201cgermane\u201d to that source. <em>Cf. Bayliss v. Barnhart, </em>427 F.3d 1211, 1218 (9th Cir.2005) (stating that inconsistency with medical evidence is a proper reason to discount an opinion); <em>Dodrill v. </em>Shalala, 12 F.3d 915, 918 (9th Cir.1993) (addressing the discounting of lay witness testimony). The ALJ stated that Nguyen was not an \u201cacceptable medical source\u201d and cited inconsistencies between her opinion and the medical record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">2. <em>The ALJ\u2019s Decision Must Be Reversed and Remanded Because of Three Remaining Errors.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">We determine, however, that three of Schow\u2019s objections are well taken and require that the matter be reversed and remanded. First, the ALJ did not provide \u201cclear and convincing\u201d reasons for rejecting Schow\u2019s subjective pain and physical limitation testimony. Such reasons were required because Schow provided objective evidence of his degenerative disc disease and the ALJ made no finding of malingering. <em>See Robbins, </em>466 F.3d at 883 (holding that \u201cunless an ALJ makes a finding of malingering based on affirmative evidence thereof, he or she may only find an applicant not credible by making specific findings as to credibility and stating clear and convincing reasons for each.\u201d) (citing <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1283-84 (9th Cir.1996)). Credibility findings must be \u201csufficiently specific to permit the court to conclude that the ALJ did not arbitrarily discredit claimant\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>278 F.3d at 958.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">The dissent argues that our holding from <em>Robbins, </em>which requires that an ALJ provide clear and convincing reasons for an adverse credibility finding unless he makes a \u201cfinding of malingering based on affirmative evidence thereof,\u201d 466 F.3d at 883, is anomalous in that the weight of our cases hold that the mere existence of \u201caffirmative evidence suggesting\u201d malingering vitiates the clear and convincing standard of review. Although the dissent is correct in its assessment of our case law, we find that the record does not contain \u201caffirmative evidence suggesting\u201d that Schow was malingering, and, therefore, the ALJ was still required to support his credibility finding with clear and convincing reasons. The dissent points to \u201caffirmative evidence\u201d consisting of \u201c[tjhree separate medical tests between March 2000 and April 2001\u201d that showed \u201cunremarkable\u201d or normal results, and a fourth examination conducted by nurse practitioner Ramirez-Williams on March 21, 2000. Dissent at 654. Any reliance on Ramirez-Williams\u2019s findings is immediately suspect because the ALJ found that he was not an \u201cacceptable\u201d medical source and gave his opinions \u201clittle weight.\u201d It would be inconsistent to both credit Ra.mirez-Williams\u2019s intimation that Schow was a malingerer and reject Nguyen\u2019s express opinion that Schow was not a malingerer when the ALJ rejected both of these nurses\u2019 opinions for the same reasons. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Likewise, the April 11, 2001 medical visit does not provide reliable support for the dissent\u2019s position because that visit was with nurse Nguyen, whose opinion was properly rejected by the ALJ and who expressly opined that Schow was not a malingerer. Further, despite the fact that x-rays taken during a March 3, 2000 visit with Dr. Berselli were \u201cunremarkable,\u201d Dr. Berselli did find Schow\u2019s symptoms legitimate enough to order an MRI because Schow \u201cmay well have a cervical disc herniation.\u201d The final piece of affirmative evidence would seemingly come from a December 15, 2000 neurosurgical consultation, which lasted 15 minutes, indicating good range of motion of the neck and resulting in an MRI finding of a mild bone spur \u201cbut nothing really remarkable causing spinal cord compression or nerve root compression.\u201d The findings from this brief examination are mixed at best and, by themselves, do not constitute affirmative evidence of malingering.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">The ALJ provided eight reasons for his adverse credibility finding, which we must analyze under the clear and convincing standard. At least five of these reasons do not support the credibility finding. The record does not support the ALJ\u2019s reasons regarding Schow\u2019s alleged failure to report numbness to his physicians and the closeness in time of Schow\u2019s incarceration and work stoppage. Likewise, the record does not support the existence of a treatment gap, and the ALJ improperly penalized Schow for his insurance company\u2019s refusal to cover therapy during that purported treatment gap. <em>See Orn, </em>495 F.3d at 638 (inability to pay adequately explains a treatment gap). Further, the ALJ improperly questioned Schow\u2019s credibility based on his failure to provide objective evidence of his rest needs. <em>See Robbins, </em>466 F.3d at 883 (ALJ may not reject testimony as incredible \u201csolely because it is not substantiated affirmatively by objective medical evidence\u201d). Finally, the ALJ overstated Schow\u2019s ability to carry on daily activities. <em>See, e.g., Orn, </em>495 F.3d at 639 (a claimant need not be \u201cutterly incapacitated\u201d to be disabled, and the mere fact that the claimant can perform certain daily activities does not detract from his credibility as to the purported disability overall). What remains are three reasons that might legitimately support the ALJ\u2019s credibility finding: (\u00cd) findings of normal muscle strength and range of motion in 2000 and early 2001, some of which the ALJ discounted; (2) some \u201cinconsistencies on examination\u201d noted by nurse practitioner Ramirez-Williams, albeit whose opinion the ALJ gave \u201clittle weight\u201d; and (3) evidence of Schow\u2019s unreported earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">We do not use a mechanical formula for determining whether properly supported reasons for an adverse credibility determination are \u201cclear and convincing.\u201d Instead, we must evaluate whether the determination is supported by substantial evidence, <em>ie., </em>relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Orn, </em>495 F.3d at 630. Our only prior decision under relatively similar factual circumstances comes from <em>Batson v. Commissioner of Social Security Administration, </em>359 F.3d 1190, 1197 (9th Cir.2004), where the court upheld a credibility finding because all but one of the ALJ\u2019s reasons were properly supported by the record. Here, the ALJ\u2019s reasons were not clear and convincing. The finding of urireported earnings is proper for consideration, but hardly compels the adverse credibility finding. Add to that the ALJ\u2019s reliance on the opinion of a nurse practitioner who the ALJ deemed to be an unacceptable medical source and whose opinion the ALJ gave \u201clittle weight,\u201d and the same result persists. Even with the addition of some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>normal findings as to muscle strength and range of motion, the ALJ\u2019s conclusion is not supported by relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might find adequate. Moreover, given the number of unsubstantiated reasons for the adverse credibility determination, we must conclude that the ALJ arbitrarily discredited Schow\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The ALJ next erred in rejecting lay witness observations from Schow\u2019s mother, Cory Fleming, and friend, Lynn Sims. The ALJ erred by characterizing Fleming\u2019s and Sims\u2019s observations of Schow\u2019s pain and physical limitations as \u201cbased to a great extent on the claimant\u2019s self-report of symptoms.\u201d The record indicates that these witnesses\u2019 comments were based on them own observations, not self-reporting. <em>See Dodrill, </em>12 F.8d at 918-19 (cautioning against characterization of witnesses\u2019 observations as mere repetition of the claimant\u2019s self-reporting). The ALJ compounded this error by relying heavily on the adverse credibility finding as to Schow\u2019s testimony. In doing so, he failed to provide reasons for rejecting Fleming\u2019s and Sims\u2019s observations that were \u201cgermane to each witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 919. At oral argument, the Commissioner\u2019s counsel even conceded that the ALJ \u201cbootstrapped\u201d his rejection of Fleming\u2019s and Sims\u2019s observations with the credibility finding. Moreover, the erroneous credibility finding provided a problematic foundation for rejection of these observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The ALJ\u2019s error was not harmless because it is not clear from the record that the error was inconsequential to the ultimate disability determination. <em>Robbins, </em>466 F.3d at 885. When fully credited, these witnesses\u2019 statements corroborate Schow\u2019s testimony and provide independent observations of his pain and physical limitations. This might have affected the formulation of Schow\u2019s residual functioning capacity and, as a result, the analysis at steps four and five.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Finally, by erroneously rejecting Schow\u2019s testimony and the lay witnesses\u2019 obseivations, the ALJ improperly omitted certain limitations from the residual functioning capacity that were supported by the record. <em>Embrey v. Bowen, </em>849 F.2d 418, 422 (9th Cir.1988) (\u201cHypothetical questions posed to the vocational expert must set out all the limitations and restrictions of the particular claimant....\u201d). As a result, the ALJ asked the vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d) a series of hypotheticals at step five that were based on an incomplete set of assumptions. The omissions rendered the questions posed, and her responses, legally deficient and of no evidentiary value. <em>Robbins, </em>466 F.3d at 886 (hypotheticals to a VE based on an incomplete set of limitations are legally inadequate and the VE\u2019s responses have no evidentiary value). Therefore, the ALJ\u2019s determination that Schow was not disabled, which was based on the VE\u2019s deficient responses, was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">Based on the foregoing, the ALJ\u2019s decision was not free of legal error and was not supported by substantial evidence. Therefore, we reverse the district court\u2019s decision affirming the ALJ with directions to remand to the ALJ for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b673-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b674-8\">. Schow overstates Dr. McDonald\u2019s assessment that Schow \"had limited ability to reach in all directions.\u201d The record reflects that Dr. McDonald\u2019s opinion was limited to \u201d[n]o constant overhead reaching,\u201d and the ALJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>adequately accounted for the other limitations set forth in the opinions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b675-8\">. Schow correctly argues that the ALJ misread Nguyen's opinion to reflect that Schow spent 20 hours a day lying down. However, this error was harmless because the AO ultimately adopted Nguyen\u2019s opinion that Schow could spend two hours of an eight-hour workday sitting and two hours standing or walking.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b677-12\">O\u2019SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aaf\">dissenting in part and concurring in the judgment:</p>\n<p id=\"Aqc\">While I concur in the judgment, I respectfully suggest that the court fails to accord proper deference to the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) rejection of Schow\u2019s testimony concerning his subjective symptoms. The majority would apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>a \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard of review of a credibility determination, but such standard is appropriate only where \u201cthere is no affirmative evidence suggesting [Schow] is malingering.\u201d <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1283-84 (9th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">In <em>Robbins v. Social Security Administration, </em>466 F.3d 880 (9th Cir.2006), we appeared to hold that the clear and convincing standard is required when an ALJ fails to conclude that a claimant is malingering. However, as the majority\u2019s disposition acknowledges, we cited <em>Smolen </em>for that proposition, which requires only the existence of \u201caffirmative evidence suggesting\u201d that a claimant is malingering. <em>Smolen, </em>80 F.3d at 1283-84. Our other cases addressing the clear and convincing standard more clearly adopt the <em>Smolen </em>test. <em>See, e.g., Lingenfelter v. Astrue, </em>504 F.3d 1028 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201c[If] there is no evidence of malingering, \u2018the ALJ can reject the claimant\u2019s testimony about the severity of her symptoms only by offering specific, clear and convincing reasons for doing so.\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>Smolen, </em>80 F.3d at 1281 and citing <em>Robbins, </em>466 F.3d at 883); <em>Greger v. Barnhart, </em>464 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2006); <em>Dodrill v. Shalala, </em>12 F.3d 915 (9th Cir.1993) (\u201cIf there is medical evidence establishing an objective basis for some degree of pain and related symptoms, and no evidence affirmatively suggesting that claimant was malingering, the Secretary\u2019s reason for rejecting a claimant\u2019s testimony must be clear and convincing.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Moreover, our precedent does not require an <em>express </em>finding of malingering. Indeed, <em>Smolen </em>noted both that the ALJ \u201cmade no finding\u201d that the claimant was malingering <em>and </em>that none \u201cof the evidence suggest she was doing so.\u201d <em>Smolen, </em>80 F.3d at 1284 n. 6. The latter statement, of course, would be superfluous if only an express finding of malingering was required. Here, the ALJ certainly implied that Schow was malingering. After indicating that on March 21, 2000, Schow \u201crequested a note asking that he not have to work so many hours\u201d due to his back pain while incarcerated, \u201c[c]linical findings were inconsistent and [Schow] exhibited non-reproducible physical findings, interesting posturing that is not consistent with his known pathology ... [Schow] stated that he could not move his arm or neck but when asked to do so during the examination he was able to. His history was noted to be inconsistent about where it hurt and what made it hurt.\u201d The purpose of noting these observations clearly was to imply that Schow had lied about or exaggerated his back pain to avoid prison work-that is, to point out that Schow had malingered.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">In any event, because the mere existence of \u201caffirmative evidence suggesting\u201d that a claimant is malingering vitiates the applicability of a clear and convincing standard of review, such standard is not required here. <em>Smolen, </em>80 F.3d at 1283-84. Three separate medical tests between March 2000 and April 2001 showed either \u201cunremarkable\u201d results as to Schow\u2019s back condition or normal range of motion within Schow\u2019s neck and back; one doctor noted that Schow\u2019s pain began \u201cfor no apparent reason.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During a fourth examination by nurse-practitioner Ramirez-Williams on March 21, 2000, Schow initially complained of severe pain every time he was touched, but later in the examination, he was able to tolerate a moderate degree of pressure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>without any physical discomfort. Ramirez-Williams also concluded that \u201c[tjhere are no examination findings consistent with [a history of back pain or degenerative neck changes] at this time.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such evidence affirmatively suggests that Schow was malingering, and on that ground alone I would affirm the ALJ\u2019s decision. That some of the ALJ\u2019s supporting arguments were in error is, of course, irrelevant; the foregoing grounds were both proper and sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Moreover, while I disagree with the majority\u2019s application of the clear and convincing standard of review, the evidence in the record is sufficiently compelling that I would affirm the ALJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding even under that standard. Here, the ALJ properly relied on the fact that Schow appears to have starkly lied to the ALJ about his work history. Schow represented to the ALJ that he had no earnings following 1997, but he in fact earned revenue during that period from a book that he previously had published. Moreover, when Schow saw Dr. Robert Norton on November 5, 1999, he indicated that he \u201cworks at several jobs,\u201d including as a construction worker; he came to Dr. Norton \u201cwith eight days of low back pain which has occurred while he was active at work.\u201d Schow made the same representation in forms that he submitted prior to his incarceration for an unrelated offense in January 2000. These evince that Schow had, in fact, been working after 1997 (indeed, that he had worked <em>several </em>jobs), despite his representation to the contrary. I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Schow\u2019s failure to report such work history \u201chardly compels\u201d the ALJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Orn v. Astrue, </em>495 F.3d 625, 630, 636 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201cFactors that an ALJ may consider in weighing a claimant\u2019s credibility include ... inconsistencies in testimony or between testimony and conduct.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">With that said, I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that reversal is required in light of the ALJ\u2019s failure properly to discredit the lay witness testimony in this case, and I therefore concur in the judgment. While the ALJ was correct that the testimony could be discredited to the extent that it was founded on Schow\u2019s self-reporting, the testimony in large part was also based upon the witness\u2019 extensive personal observations of Schow. Accordingly, unless the ALJ properly cites alternative grounds for rejecting the lay testimony that are \u201cgermane to each witness,\u201d <em>Dod-rill, </em>12 F.3d at 919, the ALJ must provide a hypothetical to the vocational expert that accounts for their observations of Schow\u2019s limitations.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-6\">. The majority\u2019s disposition parses through these examinations to determine whether each individually suggests malingering. However, even if the each examination is separately suspect, the fact that they all revealed virtually the same results certainly suggests malingering when taken as a whole.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b679-6\">. The majority's disposition concludes that the ALJ could not rely on such evidence because the ALJ also concluded that Ramirez-Williams was not an \"acceptable medical source.\u201d Of course, the ALJ could reject his medical opinions while crediting his firsthand observations of Schow\u2019s behavior.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
