The district court dismissed Harris\u2019s complaint because his allegations did not support a claim of deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. The district court also denied Harris\u2019s request to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. Harris\u2019s IFP motion is a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Harris does not address the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing his \u00a7 1983 complaint. Because he fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, any argument is abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Harris has not shown that he will present a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, the motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as one strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Harris is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>the limited circumst\u00e1nces set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
