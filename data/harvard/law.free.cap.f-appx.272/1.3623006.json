It is</p>\n<p id=\"b25-16\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the judgment of the District Court be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-17\">Wendell Harris-Rorie appeals his conviction as relying on evidence derived from an unlawful seizure. On appeal, for the first time, he describes this seizure as taking the form of a police officer\u2019s order not to leave the scene without providing identification. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that this claim is not waived under Fed. R.Crim.P. 12(e), his forfeiture mandates plain error review, and we affirm the judgment as not plainly erroneous. The district court found as a matter of historical fact, cf. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 184 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996), that the officer\u2019s statements were not in the nature of an order to remain, and there is no clear error in this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-19\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. See Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
