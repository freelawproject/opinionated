Lamb pretermitting petitioner\u2019s application for asylum and denying his applications for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Mingzhong Chen, </em>No. A 97 371 469 (B.I.A. June 7, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 97 371 469 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 30, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">As an initial matter, Title 8, Section 1158(a)(3) of the United States Code provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s finding that an asylum application was untimely under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), or its finding of neither changed nor extraordinary circumstances excusing the untimeliness under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). While the courts retain jurisdiction, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), to review constitutional claims and \u201cquestions of law,\u201d Chen has challenged only the IJ\u2019s purely factual determinations. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s pretermission of Chen\u2019s asylum application and dismiss the petition for review to that extent. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 329-31 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">When the BIA adopts and affirms the IJ\u2019s decision, then adds supplemental analysis, as here, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See, e.g., Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland, Security, </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, which was based on Chen\u2019s submission of a fraudulent document and inconsistencies between Chen\u2019s testimony and his asylum application. <em>See Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">The IJ properly found that an affidavit Chen submitted \u2014 allegedly from his nephew in New York \u2014 was fraudulent. Indeed, Chen\u2019s testimony indicated that: (1) he has never had a nephew or any other relative in New York; (2) he did not know the name of the author of the affidavit when presented with it; and (3) contrary to the affidavit, he never received any financial assistance after moving to New York. <em>See Niang v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 138, 146 (2d Cir.2007) (holding that an IJ\u2019s findings regarding the authenticity of evidence ordinarily merit deference except where \u201cthe IJ based his conclusion on unjustified assumptions and engaged in unsupported speculation\u201d); <em>Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 167-69 (2d Cir.2007). The IJ properly relied on the submission of this fraudulent document to support her adverse credibility determination where nothing in the record indicated that Chen did not know or had no reason to know that the document was fraudulent. <em>See Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 238-39 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">The IJ also properly found that Chen\u2019s testimony conflicted with his asylum application regarding the date of his initial arrest and whether he was handcuffed to a wall or an iron fence after his second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>arrest. Although these inconsistencies may be minor, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that they, together with the submission of the fraudulent document, cumulatively demonstrated Chen\u2019s lack of credibility. <em>See Tu Lin, </em>446 F.3d at 402. Moreover, as the IJ observed, Chen failed to corroborate his claim with any evidence from his parents and neighbors. The lack of such evidence rendered Chen unable to rehabilitate his testimony, the credibility of which had been called into question. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Because the only evidence that Chen was likely to be persecuted or tortured depended upon his credibility, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination necessarily precludes success on his claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED, in part, and DENIED, in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
