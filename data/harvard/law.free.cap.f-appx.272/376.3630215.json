McDuffie appeals the judgment of the district court dismissing his appeal from the bankruptcy court. We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of McDuffie\u2019s appeal in this case for abuse of discretion, that dismissal being grounded in several acts of delay and perceived lack of good faith on the part of the Debtor-Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-17\">As both parties to this appeal have suggested that oral argument is not warranted, we decide it on the basis of arguments presented in their briefs and the contents of the record on appeal. Having now carefully reviewed the law as presented by the parties and set forth in the rulings of the bankruptcy court and the district court, as applied to the facts reflected in the record on appeal, we are convinced that the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing McDuffie\u2019s appeal. Largely on the basis of the reasons stated by the district court, we affirm its dismissal of the subject appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b401-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
