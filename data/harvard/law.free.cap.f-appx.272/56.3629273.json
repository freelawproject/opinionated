Bian-co, Judge), entered on July 20, 2006, sentencing him on a guilty plea principally to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release, for one count of assault with a dangerous weapon in aid of racketeering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959(a)(3), and one count of discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(iii). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the balance of the facts, procedural history, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Hemmings argues that his sentence is (1) procedurally unreasonable because the District Court failed to appreciate its authority to grant a downward departure based on harsh conditions of detention and potential negative consequences of deportation, and (2) substantively unreasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review a district court\u2019s sentence for procedural and substantive reasonableness, a standard \u201cakin to review for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 27 (2d Cir.) (citing <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103, 114 (2d Cir.2005)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 260, 166 L.Ed.2d 202 (2006). First, an appellate court must:</p>\n<p id=\"Aks\">ensure that the district court committed l no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-15\"><em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Second, in reviewing for substantive reasonableness, we must \u201ctak[e] into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 26-27. \u201cAlthough a refusal to downwardly depart is generally not appealable, review is available when a sentencing court misapprehended the scope of its authority to depart or the sentence was otherwise illegal.\u201d <em>United States v. Valdez, </em>426 F.3d 178, 184 (2d Cir.2005). Similarly, a defendant ordinarily has no right to appeal the extent of a downward departure, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Hargrett, </em>156 F.3d 447, 450 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1048, 119 S.Ct. 607, 142 L.Ed.2d 547 (1998); <em>United States v. Doe, </em>996 F.2d 606, 607 (2d Cir.1993) (per curiam), except insofar as he contends that the district court made such an error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-17\">I. Procedural Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b81-18\">Hemmings contends that the District Court erred in refusing to grant a greater downward departure on the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>uniquely hard conditions of detention and the potential for exceptionally negative consequences of deportation. The record makes clear that the District Court did not misapprehend its departure authority or make an error of law. On the contrary, the District Court considered the reasons that Hemmings now claims it failed to consider \u2014 namely, concerns about safety that arose during Hemmings\u2019s 26 months of pretrial detention or that might arise if Hemmings is eventually deported to Jamaica. At sentencing, the District Court based its decision to grant a downward departure in part on Hemmings\u2019s \u201cconcerns about his own safety and the safety of his family members in Jamaica.\u201d The District Court explicitly acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s within [its] discretion to\u201d depart even further to \u201ca sentence below ten years.\u201d It nonetheless imposed the sentence in light of \u201cthe need for deterrence, the need to provide for a just punishment ... and to promote proper respect for the law.\u201d We do not require robotic incantations by district judges. <em>See Crosby, </em>397 F.3d at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Hemmings\u2019s argument that the District Court should have held a hearing to explore the conditions of detention is also unavailing because the record demonstrates that Hemmings was \u201cgiven an adequate opportunity to present his position as to matters in dispute.\u201d <em>United States v. Maurer, </em>226 F.3d 150, 151-52 (2d Cir. 2000) (per curiam) (explaining that \u201c \u2018[t]he district court is not required ... to hold a full-blown evidentiary hearing in resolving sentencing disputes.... All that is required is that the court afford the defendant some opportunity to rebut the Government\u2019s allegations.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Slevin, </em>106 F.3d 1086, 1091 (2d Cir.1996)). We thus find no indication that the District Court failed to properly appreciate and apply its sentencing discretion, <em>see Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 29-30; <em>see also United States v. Ministro-Tapia, </em>470 F.3d 137, 141 (2d Cir.2006), and we reject Hem-mings\u2019s arguments to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">II. Substantive Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Hemmings also argues that his 120 months\u2019 prison sentence is substantively unreasonable. The District Court recognized that there were strong factors pulling for and against leniency in this case. It acknowledged the factors pulling towards a downward departure and gave Hemmings full credit for those factors. However, the District Court could not overlook what it \u201cview[ed] as an extremely serious offense\u201d combined with a pattern of illegal activity. The record makes clear that the District Court considered the applicable Guidelines range of 177 to 191 months, the government\u2019s U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5kl.l motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), the Presentence Report, the severity of the crime, and defendant\u2019s statement. The District Court then chose a sentence of 120 months, 57 months below the Guidelines range \u2014 finding no more was needed to serve the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We must \u201cgive[ ] due deference to the District Court\u2019s reasoned and reasonable decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on the whole, justified the sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 601. We thus conclude that the District Court carefully considered the section 3553(a) factors, <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2463, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 19, 168 L.Ed.2d 795 (2007), and that the sentence was well within the broad range of reasonable sentences that the District Court could have imposed. <em>See Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b81-13\">. The briefs and appendix in this case were filed under seal. Insofar as we discuss information derived from sealed documents, those documents are unsealed to the limited extent referenced in this order, although the full documents shall remain physically withheld from public review. <em>See United States v. Verk-hoglyad, </em>516 F.3d 122, 124 n. 2 (2d Cir.2008). Because we find that our usual presumption in favor of public dispositions has not been overcome in this case, we decline to file this order under seal; however to protect Hem-mings\u2019 safety, certain details, unessential to the ultimate disposition, have been omitted from this order. <em>See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, </em>435 F.3d 110, 119 (2d Cir. 2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
