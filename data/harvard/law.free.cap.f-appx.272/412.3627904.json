He contends the district court erred by adjusting his offense level for recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>The court based the adjustment on the placement of four illegal aliens in the sleeper compartment of McKinley\u2019s tractor/trailer. One of the four was found in a small compartment in the vehicle \u2014 a closet behind the driver where a freezer typically is placed. The other three were found beneath a mattress. McKinley argued that all four were underneath the mattress while he was driving and that the alien in the closet must have put himself there to evade capture after McKinley had left the vehicle at a checkpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">At the sentencing hearing, the government conceded that there was no specific contradictory evidence, and the district court \u2014 though expressing some skepticism regarding McKinley\u2019s account \u2014 did not decide as a factual matter when the alien had entered the closet, instead adjusting the offense level based on the assumption that all four were beneath the mattress; the court ruled that such placement alone constituted reckless endangerment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We consequently do not address whether \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) would have been satisfied if the court had been convinced, as a factual matter, that the alien was actually transported in that small closet.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual determinations for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Solis-Garcia, </em>420 F.3d 511, 514 (5th Cir.2005). A factual finding is clearly erroneous only if the court, after reviewing the record, \u201cis left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (internal citations and quotations omitted). There are limits to this deference. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Leal, </em>74 F.3d 600, 608 n. 1 (5th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">In McKinley\u2019s tractor/trailer, the sleeper compartment was not partitioned from the driver, was air-conditioned, and had doors at either end. At the sentencing hearing, McKinley testified that the mattress weighed only 10-15 pounds, and that evidence was not rebutted. The court nonetheless characterized the mattress as \u201cking-size\u201d and ruled that there was danger of suffocation because the aliens might have been reluctant to lift the mattress for fear of discovery, and the initial stages of suffocation caused by such a fear-induced delay might have weakened their bodies such that they would have been unable to remove the mattress to prevent death.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">Though not discounting the legitimacy of the district court\u2019s concern generally, we do not think it is applicable here. A 15-pound mattress does not \u201ccreat[e] a <em>substantial </em>risk of death or serious bodily injury,\u201d \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) (emphasis added), to four adult men. If there is evidence that the mattress was significantly heavier, perhaps that could constitute a sufficiently \u201csubstantial risk,\u201d but no such evidence was presented, and the pictures of the mattress in the presentence report support McKinley\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-13\">In <em>United States v. Zuniga-Amezquita, </em>468 F.3d 886, 889 (5th Cir.2006). we held that in assessing dangerousness under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>\u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6), five non-exhaustive factors should be considered: \u201cthe availability of oxygen, exposure to temperature extremes, the aliens\u2019 ability to communicate with the driver of the vehicle, their ability to exit the vehicle quickly, and the danger to them if an accident occurs.\u201d \u201cThe risk must ... be greater than that of an ordinary passenger not wearing a seatbelt in a moving vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 890.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">On the evidence presented, there were no extreme temperatures, the aliens could communicate freely with McKinley, there were doors for relatively easy escape, there was normal airflow, and it was not more dangerous to lie in the sleeper compartment than it would have been to travel without a seatbelt. The aliens thus faced no more risks than those faced by the aliens in <em>Solis-Garcia, </em>in which we held that \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) was inapt.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The judgment of sentence is VACATED AND REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b436-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b436-27\">. \"If the offense involved intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person, increase by 2 levels, but if the resulting of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>fense level is less than level 18, increase to level 18.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b437-8\">. Specifically, the district court stated at the hearing that \"even if [McKinley was] correct as to the individual found in that closet compartment [and] that all four individuals were under that mattress from the beginning of this trip ... when you have four people cramped up under a mattress that ... can result in suffocation and therefore is reckless endangerment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b437-15\">. The district court likened the mattress to a plastic bag, which a person normally is strong enough to remove from his head, but after having the bag on his head for a while, he can no longer remove it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
