There was evidence that Sprint\u2019s store manager wanted to terminate Portee\u2019s employment after Portee\u2019s angry dispute with a customer. There was no evidence that the reason the manager gave to Michelle Dugas in the Human Resources department, who was responsible for making the termination decision, was a pretext for racial discrimination, nor was there any evidence that the termination was in any way motivated by racial animus. <em>See Noyes v. Kelly Servs., </em>488 F.3d 1163, 1170 (9th Cir.2007); <em>Guz v. Bechtel Nat\u2019l, Inc., </em>24 Cal.4th 317, 100 Cal.Rptr.2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089, 1113 (2000) (explaining that California courts look to federal precedent when applying FEHA).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Plaintiff was an at-will employee terminated for violation of company policies against physical restraint of customers. California has never recognized a public policy in favor of permitting such activity. The termination was not in violation of public policy under California law as defined by its Supreme Court. <em>See City of Moorpark v. Superior Court, </em>18 Cal.4th 1143, 77 Cal.Rptr.2d 445, 959 P.2d 752, 762 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Plaintiffs conduct, and not the lack of a security guard, was the proximate cause of the termination. The negligence claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b661-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>by 9th Cir.
