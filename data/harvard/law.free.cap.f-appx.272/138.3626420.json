The procedural history of this case and the details of Staples\u2019s claims are well known to the parties, set forth in the District Court\u2019s thorough opinion, and need not be discussed at length. Briefly, Staples was sentenced by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to fifty-seven months in prison based on his conviction for possession of a firearm by a felon. In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Staples argued that he was entitled to credit on his federal sentence for time served before trial. The District Court denied the petition, and Staples filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-21\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>Cradle v. U.S. ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b), a defendant can only receive credit towards a federal sentence for prior custody \u201cthat has not been credited against another sentence.\u201d Staples does not dispute that the time at issue was credited towards his state sentence. Staples argues that he is entitled to the credit pursuant to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ruggi-ano v. Reish, </em>307 F.3d 121 (3d Cir.2002), because the federal sentencing court recommended that he receive credit from the time of his arrest. However, as explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>by the District Court, the rule of <em>Ruggi-ano </em>does not apply to Staples\u2019 sentence calculation because Staples had not yet been sentenced on his state charges at the time of his federal sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">For the above reasons, as well as those set forth by the District Court, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
