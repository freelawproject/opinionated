He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Our review of the docket sheet reveals that the district court recently has acted in Dais\u2019 case and the case is proceeding. Accordingly, although we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny the mandamus petition. We also deny as interlocutory Dais\u2019 motion to vacate the district court\u2019s order of January 4, 2008. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-19\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
