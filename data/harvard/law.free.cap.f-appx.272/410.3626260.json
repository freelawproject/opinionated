In addition, he appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his Fed.R.CivP. 60(b) motion challenging the dismissal of his complaint. Veasey argues that the defendants were not immune from damages because they had not taken the oaths required by the Texas Constitution and therefore were not proper state officials. For the same reason, he asserts that his complaint was not barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">Veasey failed to articulate a violation of a federal right, save a conclusory allegation that the appellees\u2019 actions violated his due process rights. Merely alleging a constitutional violation or making a conclusory allegation is insufficient. <em>Kinash v. Callahan, </em>129 F.3d 736, 738 (5th Cir. 1997). Accordingly, Veasey\u2019s complaint was frivolous. <em>See Gonzales v. Wyatt, </em>157 F.3d 1016, 1019 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-17\">Additionally, Veasey\u2019s complaint challenged his conviction and imprisonment without alleging that his conviction had been reversed, expunged, or otherwise called into question. Accordingly, it was barred. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. As Veasey\u2019s complaint was frivolous, we need not reach the district court\u2019s alternative determination that Veasey\u2019s claims were barred by absolute immunity. Because Veasey does not address the reasoning for the denial of his Rule 60(b) motion, he has waived any challenge to that denial. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-18\">Veasey\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit. Accordingly, it is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-19\">Veasey is cautioned that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint as frivolous both count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See generally Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir. 1996). He is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will be unable to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
