Principi, </em>02-1046, 2004 WL 1737854 (Jul. 29, 2004) and dismiss James L. Williams\u2019s cross-appeal. Williams has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-31\">This case was stayed pending the court\u2019s disposition in <em>Sanders v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 881 (Fed.Cir.2007) and its companion case <em>Simmons v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 892 (Fed.Cir.2007). In <em>Sanders, </em>this court held that any 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103(a) error should be presumed prejudicial and the Secretary has the burden of rebutting this presumption. <em>Id. </em>at 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>The Secretary concedes that the only issue raised in his appeal is identical to the issue decided in <em>Sanders </em>and <em>Simmons </em>and therefore summary affirmance is appropriate. The Secretary also asserts that Williams\u2019s cross-appeal should be dismissed. We agree. It is only necessary and appropriate to file a cross-appeal when a party seeks to enlarge its own rights under the judgment or lessen the rights of its adversary under the judgment. <em>Bailey v. Dart, </em>292 F.3d 1360, 1362 (Fed.Cir.2002) (citing <em>United States v. Am. Ry. Excess Co., </em>265 U.S. 425, 435, 44 S.Ct. 560, 68 L.Ed. 1087 (1924)). Here, in his brief, Williams only seeks to preserve the CAVC\u2019s judgment. Thus, his cross-appeal is not proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">(1) The judgment of the CAVC is summarily affirmed. The case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">(2) Williams\u2019s cross-appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
