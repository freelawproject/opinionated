TYMKOVICH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">In February 2006, Marcial Mendez entered the United States at a Department of Transportation Port of Entry in Gallup, New Mexico. The tractor trailer he was riding in was selected for inspection by New Mexico Motor Transportation Division officers. The officers discovered 447 pounds (168.6 kilograms) of cocaine in the trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Mendez pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 831(a)(1) and \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). The district court sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of 135 months followed by a supervised release term of 5 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">After Mendez filed a timely notice of appeal, his counsel submitted an Anders<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brief, and moved to withdraw his representation. Mendez did not file any materials on his own behalf. Because we agree that Mendez has no meritorious claims on appeal, we GRANT counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and AFFIRM Mendez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">\u2022 We review a federal criminal sentence for reasonableness, giving deference to the district court under \u201cthe familiar abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see United States v. Smart, </em>518 F.3d 800, 805 (10th Cir.2008) (noting that it is now \u201cwell settled that we review a district court\u2019s sentencing decisions solely for abuse of discretion\u201d). Reasonableness \u201chas both procedural and substantive components.\u201d <em>United States v. Atencio, </em>476 F.3d 1099, 1102 (10th Cir. 2007); <em>see Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597 (noting that a reviewing court \u201cmust first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error\" and then (it should \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-16\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-17\">We first review Mendez\u2019s sentence for procedural reasonableness. The district court correctly calculated Mendez\u2019s sentence under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (USSG), except for an error that favored the defendant. The court properly decided the base offense level was 38 because the offense involved 150 kilograms or more of cocaine. . USSG \u00a7 2D 1.1(c)(1). The court, however, mistakenly adopted the Pre-Sentence Report\u2019s recommendation to subtract two levels based on \u00a7 2D l.l(b)(9)\u2019s cooperation provision \u2014 a mistake that resulted in a lower guideline range for Mendez.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-18\">The court also awarded Mendez a three-level reduction for accepting responsibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>for the offense, USSG \u00a7 3El.l(a) \u2014 (b), which resulted in a total offense level of 33. Mendez scored a criminal history category I because he had no prior offenses. Based on an offense level of 33 and criminal history category I, the court properly concluded the advisory guideline imprisonment range was 135 to 168 months. It then sentenced Mendez to 135 months of imprisonment and 5 years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">In the <em>Anders </em>brief, Mendez\u2019s counsel addressed three potential procedural errors regarding (1) the substantial assistance departure provision, (2) the minor role adjustment provision, and (3) other important Guideline factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">1. Substantial Assistance Departure</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">At sentencing, Mendez argued the court should apply the substantial assistance departure provision. Under \u00a7 5K1.1, a court may only apply this provision if the government makes a motion \u201cstating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Vargas, </em>925 F.2d 1260, 1267 (10th Cir. 1991). The government did not file such a motion. Some case law in our circuit also suggests a court may grant this departure if a prosecutor acted in bad faith in refusing to file the motion. <em>See United States v. Kovac, </em>23 Fed.Appx. 931, 937-38 (10th Cir.2001) (describing' conflicting case law on this issue). It is unnecessary to resolve this intra-circuit conflict in this case because nothing in the record indicates the prosecutors acted in bad faith. Therefore, the district court properly declined to grant Mendez a substantial assistance departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">2. Minor Role Adjustment</p>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">Mendez also argued at sentencing that he qualified for a minor role adjustment under USSG \u00a7 3B1.2(b). Under this provision, the court should decrease the defendant\u2019s offense level by two \u201c[i]f the defendant was a minor participant in any criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A defendant\u2019s role in an offense is a finding of fact which we review for clear error. <em>United States v. James, </em>157 F.3d 1218, 1219 (10th Cir. 1998). The defendant bears the burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he was a minor participant. <em>United States v. Santistevan, </em>39 F.3d 250, 254 (10th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">Mendez argued that he qualified for this departure because he was merely a transportation courier. Even if Mendez was simply a courier, however, this does not mean he automatically qualifies for a minor role adjustment. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>512 F.3d 1268, 1276 (10th Cir. 2008).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court nonetheless con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>eluded Mendez played a more substantial role in the drug operation than simply transporting the cocaine. As the sentencing judge explained, \u201cI find the quantity of the cocaine with which the defendant was entrusted, the fact that the cocaine was found in his personal tractor-trailer, and his own rendition of events ... clearly indicate the defendant was more than merely a courier.\u201d R., Vol. IV at 11. Because these findings of fact are reasonable inferences based on the evidence in the record, the court did not err in denying this departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">3. Failure to Consider Other Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Finally, the <em>Anders </em>brief suggests Mendez\u2019s sentence could be unreasonable because the district court failed to account for his remorse and lack of criminal history, status as the primary breadwinner for his family, and favorable opinion in the community. Contrary to Mendez\u2019s assertions, the court did favorably account for his remorse and lack of criminal history. <em>See </em>R., Vol. II at 7-8, UK 26, 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">With regards to his status as a breadwinner, the USSG explicitly states \u201cfamily ties and responsibilities are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a departure may be warranted.\u201d USSG \u00a7 5H1.6.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court did not clearly err in refusing to grant Mendez a departure based on his breadwinner status; nothing in the record indicates the impact on Mendez\u2019s family will be substantially greater than the impact incarceration would impose on other similarly situated families. <em>Id. </em>cmt. l(B)(ii.). Mendez did not convincingly explain why a small departure in the length of his sentence would effectively address the loss of family support. <em>Id. </em>cmt. l(B)(iv.). The district court therefore properly applied the Guidelines in fashioning a sentence tailored to Mendez and his personal characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-12\">Finally, the district court did not err by denying Mendez\u2019s request to grant a departure based on the favorable community opinion of him. Such a decision is not procedural error because this factor is not listed in the USSG. Whether the decision constitutes substantive error will be addressed in the next part.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-14\"><em>Post-Booker,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we review the length of a sentence for substantive reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Hamilton, </em>510 F.3d 1209, 1217-18 (10th Cir.2007) (\u201cIn evaluating the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, we ask whether the length of the sentence is reasonable considering the statutory factors delineated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d). \u201c[W]e accord a prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>erly calculated Guidelines sentence a presumption of substantive reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>509 F.3d 1290, 1298 (10th Cir.2007); <em>see Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597 (\u201cIf the sentence is within the Guidelines range, the appellate court may, but is not required to, apply a presumption of reasonableness.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The district court has a wide range of discretion in striking a balance among the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Smart, </em>518 F.3d at 808 (\u201cWe may not examine the weight a district court assigns to various \u00a7 3553(a) factors ... as a legal conclusion to be reviewed de novo.\u201d). Nothing in the district court\u2019s analysis disturbs the presumption of reasonableness or suggests an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Mendez\u2019s counsel argued that the district court should grant a variance based on the community\u2019s positive opinion of Mendez. Such evidence is perhaps relevant for evaluating \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). The record indicates the court considered this evidence, but concluded it did not justify a variance. Due to the broad discretion courts are granted to consider \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we cannot conclude that such a decision constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">After a careful review of the record, we conclude Mendez has no meritorious claims on appeal. We therefore GRANT counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and AFFIRM Mendez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b728-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel.

Under this section, if the defendant meets the criteria set forth in subdivisions one through five of \u00a7 5C 1.2(a), then the defendant\u2019s level should be decreased by two.

The court erroneously concluded that Mendez satisfied this requirement, despite Mendez\u2019s concession that he had not fully cooperated with the government. For example, during the sentencing hearing, Mendez told the judge \"I ask forgiveness from the government and the U.S. Attorney for not having given them all of the information that they needed.\u201d R., Vol. IV at 8.
