Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 260, 166 L.Ed.2d 202 (2006). Silvestri now appeals from a May 4, 2006 district court decision (Michael B. Mukasey, <em>Chief Judge) </em>denying his motion for resentencing. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>vant procedural history, facts, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">We examine <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines, and we evaluate its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Rattoballi, </em>452 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir.2006). We review for \u201creasonableness\u201d the decision of a district court declining to alter a sentence following <em>Crosby </em>remand. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>475 F.3d 468, 474 (2d Cir.2007). In reviewing for reasonableness, we apply no <em>per se </em>rules as to the reasonableness of a sentence. <em>Crosby, </em>397 F.3d at 115. \u201cReasonableness review does not entail the substitution of our judgment for that of the sentencing judge. Rather, the standard is akin to review for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 27 (2d Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 192, 166 L.Ed.2d 143 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Silvestri argues that in deciding whether to grant his motion for resentencing, the District Court failed to give a \u201creal explanation of the reasons for the sentence.\u201d However, in a written statement accompanying its original sentence, the District Court made specific reference to both the \u201cseriousness of defendant\u2019s conduct\u201d and \u201cthe difficulties defendant will face in prison as a former police officer.\u201d In open court at resentencing, the District Court specifically rejected counsel\u2019s argument about the loss of a pension. He also \u201cconsidered] everything that [counsel] said\u201d and could not \u201cconceive of [his] having done anything different[ly].\u201d We do not require \u201crobotic incantations\u201d by trial judges. <em>See Crosby, </em>397 F.3d at 113. The reasons given by the District Court in this case are more than sufficient to explain the sentence at the bottom of the Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Villafuerte, </em>502 F.3d 204, 210 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Silvestri also argues that the District Court did \u201cnot tak[e] into consideration the unique background and specific characteristics of this defendant\u201d \u2014 namely, the loss of his pension, his nineteen years as a police officer, and the possible effect that his police service would have on his time in prison. It is clear from the record, however, that the District Court considered the applicable Guidelines range of 151 to 180 months, the Presentence Investigation Report, the severity of the crime, and the statements and letters of Silvestri\u2019s counsel. The District Court made specific reference to the purposes of punishment and deterrence and the seriousness of the crime. It then chose a sentence of 151 months \u2014 at the very bottom of the Guidelines range \u2014 finding no more was needed to serve the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We thus conclude that the District Court carefully considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2463, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 19, 168 L.Ed.2d 795 (2007); <em>United States v. Verkhoglyad, </em>516 F.3d 122, 127 (2d Cir.2008), and that the sentence was well within the broad range of reasonable sentences within the discretion of the District Court to impose, <em>see Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 30 (\u201c[W]e presume, in the absence of record evidence suggesting otherwise, that a sentencing judge has faithfully discharged [his] duty to consider the statutory factors.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">We have considered all of the appellant\u2019s arguments and find them without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
