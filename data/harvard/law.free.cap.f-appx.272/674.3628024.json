LUCERO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A0l\">Defendant-appellant Gene A. Gordon entered a conditional guilty plea to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). His plea agreement preserved his right to appeal one issue: Whether \u00a7 922(g)(1) is uncon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>stitutional because it is not supported by the Commerce Clause. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"ags-dedup-0\">Title 18, section 922(g)(1) of the United States Code criminalizes the possession of a firearm \u201cwhich has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce\u201d by anyone convicted of a crime punishable by more than one year\u2019s imprisonment. Gordon admitted to being a felon and possessing a Beretta handgun. In addition, because Beretta does not manufacture weapons in Kansas, Gordon acknowledged that the government could easily prove that the weapon had been transported in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"A0A\">On appeal, Gordon argues that the felon-in-possession statute violates the Commerce Clause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contends that the mere fact that the handgun was transported across state lines provides an insuffieient nexus to interstate commerce when his own possession occurred entirely within the State of Kansas. He relies primarily on <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), and <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000). <em>See Lopez, </em>514 U.S. at 551, 115 S.Ct. 1624 (holding that a federal statute criminalizing firearm possession in school zones was not supported by the Commerce Clause because it lacked an intrastate commerce element); <em>Morrison, </em>529 U.S. at 617-18, 120 S.Ct. 1740 (rejecting an argument that \u201cCongress may regulate noneconomic, violent criminal conduct based solely on that conduct\u2019s aggregate effect on interstate commerce\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"apg-dedup-0\">Long before these cases, in <em>Scarborough v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 563, 97 S.Ct. 1963, 52 L.Ed.2d 582 (1977), the Supreme Court upheld a felon-in-possession statute that required no \u201cmore than the minimal nexus that the firearm have been, at some time, in interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575, 97 S.Ct. 1963. Even after <em>Lopez </em>and <em>Mor\u00f1son, </em>\u201c[t]he constitutional understanding implicit in <em>Scarborough </em>that Congress may regulate any firearm that has ever traversed state lines has been repeatedly adopted for felon-in-possession statutes by this Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Patton, </em>451 F.3d 615, 634 (10th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Dorris, </em>236 F.3d 582, 584-86 (10th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Farnsworth, </em>92 F.3d 1001, 1006 (10th Cir. 1996); <em>United States v. Bolton, </em>68 F.3d 896, 400 (10th Cir.1995). We are bound by these prior decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"A6u_\">Gordon argues that even if we are less than persuaded that \u00a7 922(g) violates the Commerce Clause, we should apply the \u201cconstitutional doubt\u201d doctrine of <em>Jones v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000). <em>Jones </em>held that when a statute is susceptible to two constructions \u2014 one clearly constitutional and another raising grave constitutional questions \u2014 courts should adopt the clearly constitutional reading. <em>Id. </em>at 857, 120 S.Ct. 1904- We disagree that the natural construction of \u00a7 922(g), which criminallzes possession of a firearm that has at any time in the past crossed state lines, creates any constitutional doubt. <em>See United States v. McNeill, </em>239 Fed.Appx. 449, 450-51 (10th Cir.2007) (unpublished) (citing <em>United States v. Grisel, </em>488 F.3d 844, 847 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc)) (\u201c[N]o doubts regarding the construction of a statute exist when prior precedent directly upholds that construction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"ApZ\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AH04\"> The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel, The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A7t\">. Gordon states that he challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g) to preserve the issue for further review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
