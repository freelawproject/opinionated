Chew, denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Zheng-Yan Liu, </em>No. A97 661 237 (B.I.A. Sep. 20, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A97 661 237 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 4, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">When the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., Cham Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial-evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). The Court reviews <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">We find that the record supports the agency\u2019s burden-of-proof finding. Liu argues that he is statutorily eligible for relief based on the persecution he suffered for his alleged resistance to China\u2019s family-planning policy. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42); <em>Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 309-10 (2d Cir. 2007) <em>(en banc). </em>But in <em>Shi Liang Lin, </em>we found that a petitioner whose</p>\n<p id=\"b111-13\">\u201capplication for asylum was based upon his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s two forced abortions and threats from family planning officials that they would fine and sterilize [him] if his fianc\u00e9e became pregnant again ... failed to demonstrate that he acted in a manner that could constitute \u2018resistance\u2019 or opposition to a coercive family control program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-14\">494 F.3d at 314. Liu similarly claims that he and his wife \u201cviolated and opposed\u201d the family-planning policy by having a second child in an urban household, that they had resisted abortion and sterilization procedures, and that they are wanted by the government \u201cfor sterilization.\u201d As in <em>Shi Liang Liu, </em>however, such assertions do not constitute \u201cresistance or opposition to a coercive family control program.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Thus, the agency properly denied relief on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-15\">The agency also properly found that Liu did not establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. To establish asylum eligibility based on future persecution, an applicant must show that he or she subjectively fears persecution and that this fear is objectively reasonable. <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Cir.2004). A fear may be considered well-founded \u201ceven if there is only a slight, though discernible, chance of persecution.\u201d <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 284 (2d Cir. 2000) (citing <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 431, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987)). However, a fear is not objectively reasonable if it lacks \u201csolid support\u201d in the record and is merely \u201cspeculative at best.\u201d <em>Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005). Here, the IJ found that Liu\u2019s fear of sterilization was speculative because he has never been detained or arrested, his two children currently live with his wife in China, she has never been forced to have an abortion, and she was able to avoid sterilization by paying a fine. Under these circumstances, the IJ properly, found insufficient evidence that Liu will be singled out for future persecution. Moreover, because Liu was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, he was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Finally, because Liu failed to argue that the agency erred in denying CAT relief or assert that he established a likelihood of torture upon return to China, we deem that claim abandoned. <em>Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\u25a0 For the foregoing reasons,' the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
