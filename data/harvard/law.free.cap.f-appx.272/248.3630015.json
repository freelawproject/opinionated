In his informal appellate brief, Furtado failed to address the district court\u2019s basis for dismissing his case. Therefore, Furtado has waived appellate review of that issue. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b) (\u201cThe Court will limit its review to the issues raised in the informal brief.\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm. Furtado\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
