Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo claims of constitutional violations in immigration proceedings. <em>See Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-25\">We lack jurisdiction to review Ulloa Cor-rea\u2019s contention that he met the continuous physical presence requirement because he not only failed to raise that issue before the BIA, but in fact conceded in his appeal brief that he lacked the requisite physical presence. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (explaining that this court lacks jurisdiction to review contentions not raised before the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-26\">We reject Ulloa Correa\u2019s contention that the 10-year physical presence requirement violates his due process rights. <em>See Padil</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number><em>la</em>\u2014Padilla <em>v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 972, 979-80 (9th Cir.2006) (holding that the 10-year physical presence requirement and the stop-time rule satisfy due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">We are not persuaded that Ulloa Correa\u2019s removal results in the deprivation of his children\u2019s due process rights. <em>See Mamanee v. INS, </em>566 F.2d 1103, 1106 (9th Cir.1977) (holding that deportation of parents does not result in unconstitutional deportation of child).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b591-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
