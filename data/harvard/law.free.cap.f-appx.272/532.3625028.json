The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> calculated an advisory Guidelines imprisonment range of 120-135 months, and sentenced Vargas-Gonzalez to 120 months. On appeal, his counsel seeks permission to withdraw and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of Vargas-Gonzalez\u2019s Category I criminal history and the lower sentences of some co-conspirators, and that the requirement of a government motion to depart below the mandatory minimum violates the separation-of-powers doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">We conclude that Vargas-Gonzalez\u2019s sentence is not unreasonable because the district court did not have discretion to sentence him below 120 months, absent a substantial-assistance motion by the government under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) or qualification for relief from the statutory minimum under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). <em>See United States v. Gregg, </em>451 F.3d 930, 937 (8th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Chacon, </em>330 F.3d 1065, 1066 (8th Cir.2003); <em>see also United States v. Harris, </em>493 F.3d 928, 932 (8th Cir.2007) (court of appeals accords sentence within advisory Guidelines range presumption of reasonableness), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1263, 170 L.Ed.2d 111 (2008). We have previously held that the requirement of a government motion to depart below the mandatory minimum does not violate the separation-of-powers doctrine. See <em>United States v. Holbdy, </em>489 F.3d 910, 914 (8th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-16\">After reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We also grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw, subject to the condition that counsel comply with the requirements of Part V of this court\u2019s Plan to Implement the Criminal Justice Act by advising Vargas-Gonzalez of the procedures for filing a petition for writ of certiorari pro se.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b557-12\">.
