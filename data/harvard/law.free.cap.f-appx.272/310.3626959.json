Our review of Davis\u2019 petition reveals that it merely repeats arguments he presented in a prior petition under \u00a7 2254. Davis\u2019 petition is, therefore, a successive petition to vacate or modify sentence under \u00a7 2254 for which Davis has not received authorization under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 (2000). <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>840 F.8d 200, 206-07 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2254 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of ap-pealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any disposi-tive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Davis has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-14\">To the extent Davis\u2019 notice of appeal and informal brief could be construed as a motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2254 petition, we deny such authorization because he has not shown he would benefit from newly discovered evidence or retroactive application of a new rule of constitutional law. <em>See Winestock, </em>340 F.3d at 208. We also deny Davis\u2019 motion for an en banc hearing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-15\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
