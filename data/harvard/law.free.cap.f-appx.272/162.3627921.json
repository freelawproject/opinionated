For the following reasons, we will grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-23\">Zheng is a native and citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China. He entered the United States on or about November 26, 2004. That same day, Zheng was placed in removal proceedings and was charged with removability pursuant to Immigration Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 212(a)(6)(A)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). On February 17, 2005, Zheng filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>June 14, 2005, a merits hearing was held before Immigration Judge Mirlande Tadal.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">According to Zheng\u2019s testimony before the Immigration Judge and his asylum application, Zheng left China because he was persecuted by the Chinese government for \u201c[s]preading Falun Gong.\u201d Zheng first became involved with Falun Gong in 1999 when he met a friend who began to teach him about the movement. In 2000, this friend gave Zheng some Falun Gong books and handbills to keep at his house. Zheng testified that he read these materials whenever he had time, but did not participate in Falun Gong activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Zheng contends that, in March 2004, he overheard his co-workers speaking negatively about Falun Gong and concluded that they had been \u201cbrainwashed\u201d by the Chinese government\u2019s anti-Falun Gong propaganda. Zheng testified that he decided to attempt to change his co-workers\u2019 views. Zheng went home and retrieved the handbills about Falun Gong that his friend had previously given him. Zheng then returned to work and distributed them to his co-workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Zheng further testified that, on March 25, 2004, around 9:00 a.m., two village officials went to the construction site where Zheng was working, and accused him of spreading Falun Gong materials and Falun Gong thoughts. Zheng was detained and brought to a local village office. Zheng claims he was interrogated and ordered to confess to spreading Falun Gong. When Zheng refused, he was beaten and his hands were burned. Zheng was not given anything to eat during his detention. When Zheng\u2019s family learned he had been detained around 10:00 p.m. that same day, they went to the office where he was held, and paid a bribe to his guard. Zheng escaped out an unlocked back door and headed for the waterside where his family was waiting for him with a boat. Zheng took the boat to another village and hid at his aunt\u2019s home. Eventually, Zheng fled to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">In support of his application, Zheng submitted an addendum recounting his experiences, an affidavit from a friend in the United States attesting to his current practice of Falun Gong, a letter from his father, a Chinese residence ID card, a birth certificate, pictures of Zheng practicing Falun Gong in the United States, and background information regarding the Chinese government\u2019s suppression of Fa-lun Gong. The 2004 State Department Country Report for China is also a part of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">The IJ denied Zheng\u2019s application. The IJ found that his testimony \u201coverall was unbelievable and implausible\u201d and that he was \u201cunable to testify credibly as to the alleged events that purportedly took place in March 2004.\u201d The IJ concluded that his testimony was inconsistent in that he initially testified he had a conversation with his co-workers on March 25, 2004, and then changed his testimony to state that the conversation took place on March 1, 2004. The IJ found Zheng\u2019s testimony inconsistent because he initially stated that he was able to convert his co-workers into believing that Falun Gong was not a cult, and then later stated that he had not convinced his co-workers of this. The IJ explained that Zheng appeared to have limited, if any, knowledge of Falun Gong because he was unable to provide any specific information about what he had read and what involvement he had with the movement.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">The IJ further rejected as \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d Zheng\u2019s contention that his parents were able to bribe an official and secure his escape from detention. The IJ explained that Zheng\u2019s account of his escape had a lot of \u201choles\u201d in it because, given that Zheng did not know of his par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>ents\u2019 arrangements until later, it was unclear how Zheng knew to walk out the open back door, and find a boat waiting for him at the waterside. Accordingly, the IJ concluded that Zheng had not established that he had suffered past persecution or had a well-founded fear of persecution if he returned to China.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The IJ recognized, however, that \u201chad [Zheng] provided credible testimony, had he submitted clear evidence that the government did indeed seek to harm him because of his involvement with the Falun Gong, the respondent would have established his eligibility for asylum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Citing <em>Matter of Burbano, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 872 (BIA 1994), the BIA adopted and affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s June 14, 2005, oral decision \u201cinsofar as she found that the respondent had not satisfied the burden of proof for the requested relief.\u201d The BIA expressed agreement with the Immigration \u2022 Judge\u2019s conclusion that Zheng failed to provide sufficient details to explain certain implausible aspects of his claim, including how he was able to escape from his detention \u201cby walking through an unlocked rear door .. to find, without any prior notice ... his parents waiting to aid his escape.\u201d The BIA also found that, in view of Zheng\u2019s inability to provide \u201cmeaningful details about Falun Gong,\u201d it was \u201cimplausible\u201d that he was able to successfully convert anyone to Falun Gong. Moreover, although this issue was not analyzed by the Immigration Judge, the BIA went on to hold that the documentary evidence that Zheng submitted was \u201cminimal\u201d and constituted inadequate \u201ccorroborating evidence.\u201d The BIA added that Zheng\u2019s testimony about the events of March 2004 was \u201cnotably lacking in detail.\u201d The BIA concluded, therefore, that it was \u201cunable to determine that the Immigration Judge\u2019s findings of fact were clearly erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">We exercise jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s final order of removal under INA \u00a7 242(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a). Because the BIA appears to have substantially relied on the findings of the IJ, we have jurisdiction to review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ. <em>See Xie v. Ashcroft, </em>859 F.3d 239, 242 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Our review of these decisions is for substantial evidence, considering whether they are \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Balasubramanrim v. INS, </em>143 F.3d 157, 161 (3d Cir.1998) (quotation omitted). The decisions must be affirmed \u201cunless the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion, but. compels it.\u201d <em>Zubeda v. Ashcroft, </em>333 F.3d 463, 471 (3d Cir.2003) (quotation omitted). Adverse credibility determinations must be based on \u201cspecific, cogent reasons,\u201d not on \u201cspeculation, conjecture, ... and otherwise unsupported personal opinion,\u201d <em>Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228, 249-50 (3d Cir. 2003) (en banc), or minor inconsistences that do not go to the \u201cheart of the asylum claim.\u201d <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Ceballos-Castillo v. INS, </em>904 F.2d 519, 520 (9th Cir.1990)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">The legal precepts underlying Zheng\u2019s claim are well established. To establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>eligibility for asylum, an applicant must demonstrate past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution that is both subjectively and objectively reasonable. <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 191, 195 (3d Cir.2005). An applicant who establishes that he or she has suffered past persecution on account of one of the five grounds enumerated in the INA \u201ctriggers a rebut-table presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution, as long as that fear is related to the past persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196 (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1)) (quotation omitted). Whereas asylum is discretionary, withholding of removal under INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A), is mandatory if the applicant meets a more stringent standard \u2014 that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he or she will be persecuted on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion if deported to his or her home country. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lukwago v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 157, 182 (3d Cir.2003)). To obtain relief under the Convention Against Torture, an applicant must establish that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal. <em>Toure v. Attorney General of the United States, </em>443 F.3d 310, 317 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">We have recognized that an alien may be eligible for asylum if the persecution that he has suffered, or has a well-founded fear of suffering, is on account of a political opinion the applicant actually holds or on account of one the foreign government has imputed to him. <em>Singh, </em>406 F.3d at 196 (quotation omitted). In determining whether persecution existed on account of political opinion, we focus on whether the persecutor has attributed a political view to the victim and acted on that attribution. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Here, the basis for the BIA\u2019s dismissal of Zheng\u2019s appeal is not entirely clear. Rather than explicitly adopt the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, the BIA stated that it was adopting and affirming the IJ\u2019s oral decision only \u201cinsofar as she found that respondent had not satisfied the burden of proof for the requested relief.\u201d However, the BIA\u2019s analysis appears to affirm the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding because the BIA expressed approval of the IJ\u2019s findings that Zheng\u2019s claims were implausible and lacking in detail.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However \u2014 although the issue was not analyzed by the IJ \u2014 the BIA went on to consider whether Zheng had presented adequate corroborating evidence for his claims. The BIA \u201cobserve[d]\u201d that Zheng had presented inadequate corroborating evidence, adding that \u201cthe documentary evidence submitted at the hearing was minimal, consisting of a letter from the respondent\u2019s father, and a letter from a Falun Gong practitioner in New York.\u201d Zheng\u2019s putative failure to present adequate corroborating evidence appears to have been the basis for the BIA\u2019s holding that Zheng \u201cwas unable to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">As we have previously held, the BIA may sometimes require \u201cotherwise-credible applicants to supply corroborating evidence in order to meet their burden of proof.\u201d <em>Abdulai v. Ashcroft, </em>239 F.3d 542, 554 (3d Cir.2001). The BIA has adopted rules which require corroboration in fil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>stances where it is reasonable to expect such proof from a witness and there is no satisfactory explanation for its absence. <em>Toure, </em>443 F.3d at 323. We adopted the BIA\u2019s rules \u201cas our own\u201d in <em>Abdulai </em>and formulated a three-part inquiry: (1) an identification of facts for which it is reasonable to expect corroboration; (2) the presence or absence of such corroboration in the record; and (3) the adequacy of the applicant\u2019s explanation for its absence. <em>Id.; see also Mulanga v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 123, 133-34 (3d Cir.2003) (discussing <em>Abdulai).</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Neither the BIA nor the IJ engaged in the foregoing three-part inquiry here. Zheng was not given notice of what corroboration was expected, nor was he given an opportunity to present an explanation for his putative failure to provide such corroboration. <em>See Chukwu, </em>484 F.3d at 192. Indeed, no testimony regarding these issues was ever developed.4 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, we are obliged to remand. <em>See Toure, </em>443 F.3d at 323 (\u201cWe have repeatedly held that the BIA\u2019s ... failure to engage in the three-part inquiry described above requires that the BIA\u2019s findings regarding corroboration be vacated and remanded.\u201d); <em>Voci v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 607, 616-617 (3d Cir.2005) (remanding where it was unclear from the BIA\u2019s opinion whether the BIA believed the applicant had failed to provide adequate corroboration, and where, even if this had been clear, the BIA did not apply the three-part <em>Abdulai </em>inquiry); <em>Kayembe, </em>334 F.3d at 238-239 (\u201cWhen deficiencies in the BIA\u2019s decision make it impossible for us to meaningfully review its decision, we must vacate that decision and remand so that the BIA can further explain its reasoning.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we will grant the petition for review, and remand the case to the BIA for clarification of the basis for its dismissal and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-9\">. On appeal, Zheng contends for the first time that the IJ failed to make an explicit negative credibility determination. However, before the BIA, Zheng took the position that the IJ \u201cerred in making a negative credibility finding in this case.\u201d Upon reviewing the IJ\u2019s oral decision, we conclude the IJ clearly did make an adverse credibility determination, as Zheng conceded before the BIA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AFc\">. Zheng applied for asylum before May 11, 2005, and therefore the REAL ID Act\u2019s new standard for credibility determinations does not apply to him. <em>Chulcwu v. Attorney General of the United States, </em>484 F.3d 185, 189 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b189-6\">. Thus, the instant case is distinguishable from cases where we have previously applied the rule that, where the BIA makes no explicit findings about an applicant\u2019s credibility, we will proceed as if the applicant's testimony were credible. In the cases in which we have applied this rule, the BIA has made no findings of its own regarding credibility, assumed credibility, or indicated generally that it found the applicant credible. <em>See Lusingo v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 193, 197 n. 5 (3d Cir.2005); <em>Li v. Attorney General, </em>400 F.3d 157, 163-64 (3d Cir.2005); <em>Kayembe v. Ashcroft, </em>334 F.3d 231, 235 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b190-4\">. The Government contends that the BIA's \"commentary\u201d regarding corroboration was made in the form of observations, not holdings, and therefore does not trigger the three-pronged test detailed in <em>Abdulai. </em>We disagree, given that the BIA\u2019s statements about corroboration were immediately followed by the following holding: \u201cIn light of the foregoing, the respondent is unable to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b190-19\">. We have held that the REAL ID Act does not change our rules regarding the duty to develop the applicant\u2019s testimony, and in particular, to develop it in accord with the <em>Abdu-lai </em>steps. <em>Chukwu, </em>484 F.3d at 192.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
