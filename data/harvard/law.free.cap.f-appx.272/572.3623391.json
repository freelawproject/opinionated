We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we vacate and remand. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b596-27\">Flores-Arvizu contends that the government failed to meet its burden of estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>lishing that his 1997 conviction under California Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11379(a) qualifies as a drug trafficking offense for purposes of a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). We conclude that the documents and judicially noticeable facts presented to the district court at the time of sentencing do not satisfy the government\u2019s burden of establishing \u201cclearly and unequivocally\u201d that \u201cthe conviction was based on all of the elements of a qualifying predicate offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Navidad-Marcos, </em>367 F.3d 903, 908 (9th Cir.2004). The district court stated that it was relying on a police report allegedly incorporated into Flores-Arvizu\u2019s plea agreement to the underlying offense. The record, however, indicates that the police report was not entered into the record in the district court at the time of sentencing. Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">\u201cThe government will have the opportunity at re-sentencing to offer additional judicially-noticeable evidence to support the enhancement.\u201d <em>Navidad-Marcos, </em>367 F.3d at 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">In his reply brief, Flores-Arvizu moves to strike pages 47-78' of the government\u2019s Supplemental Excerpts of Record. Because these documents are not properly part of the record on appeal, this motion is granted without prejudice to the government submitting these documents to the district court upon re-sentencing. <em>See </em>Fed R.App. P. 10(a); Ninth Circuit Rule 10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b596-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
