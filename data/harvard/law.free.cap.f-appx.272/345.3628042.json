We hold that, under a limited review to determine whether Balistreri suffered \u201clegal prejudice,\u201d the order does not constitute legal prejudice and therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">Balistreri sued the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife) in Texas state court. MetLife removed to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction. Approximately fifteen months later, Balistreri moved for voluntary dismissal without prejudice. The United States Magistrate Judge recommended the dismissal conditioned on Balistreri\u2019s payment of his and MetLife\u2019s court costs. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendations and entered final judgment dismissing the suit without prejudice and ordering Bal-istreri to pay $672.12, representing both parties\u2019 costs. Balistreri did not attempt to reinstate his claims rather than comply with the condition. He timely filed this appeal challenging the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b370-17\">Rule 41(a)(2) provides district courts with the discretion to grant a plaintiffs motion for voluntary dismissal, which allows the plaintiff \u201cto withdraw his action from the court without prejudice to future litigation.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The rule also grants to district courts the discretion to attach conditions tailored to prevent unfair prejudice to a defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-18\">While the grant of a plaintiff\u2019s dismissal without prejudice is a final judgment for purposes of appeal, a plaintiff is generally foreclosed from appealing the dismissal because it is not an involuntary adverse judgment for the plaintiff.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In other words, a plaintiff received what he wanted and is left \u201cas if he had never brought the first suit.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, if the conditions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>dismissal involve \u201clegal prejudice,\u201d the plaintiff may appeal the district court\u2019s grant of the plaintiffs own motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We have previously noted that most dismissals are conditioned on the plaintiffs payment of costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Generally, conditions requiring the payment of money do not involve legal prejudice, which occurs when the \u201cplaintiff is severely circumscribed in his freedom to bring a later suit.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">In this case, the district court conditioned Balistreri\u2019s voluntary dismissal on his payment of $672.12, representing both parties\u2019 costs. That condition does not circumscribe his freedom to bring a later suit. While we have noted in dicta that a hypothetical case involving an exorbitant sum might constitute legal prejudice,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> this court and other circuits have dismissed appeals contesting far larger sums of money than that at issue here.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Since the award of costs does not constitute legal prejudice, Balistreri cannot appeal the order and we must dismiss his appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, because Balistreri cannot appeal from this order, we do not address his arguments regarding alleged errors oceur-ring before the voluntary motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b370-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
