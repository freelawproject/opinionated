He appeals also the related disgorgement and civil penalty ordered by the district court. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">Findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and upheld if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, they are plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>SEC v. Rubera, </em>350 F.3d 1084, 1093-94 (9th Cir.2003). A disgorgement order is reviewed for abuse of discretion, <em>SEC v. First Pac. Bancorp, </em>142 F.3d 1186, 1190 (9th Cir.1998), as is the imposition of a civil penalty and its amount, <em>SEC v. Sargent, </em>329 F.3d 34, 38 (1st Cir.2003); <em>SEC v. Presto Telecomms., Inc., </em>237 Fed.Appx. 198, 200 (9th Cir.2007) (citing 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77t(d)(2)(C), 78u(d)(8)(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">As the parties are well aware of the facts, we do not reiterate them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-14\">First, Yuen contests the district court\u2019s credibility findings and its rejection of his claim to a good faith reliance defense. Specifically, Yuen argues that the district court clearly erred by finding the KPMG auditors credible despite contradictions in KPMG\u2019s own work papers and documents it submitted to the SEC. However, these auditors stated that they did not learn of material facts until after those documents were created. Especially because \u201c[credibility determinations ... are matters left to the trier of fact,\u201d <em>United States v. Vasquez, </em>858 F.2d 1387, 1391 (9th Cir.1988), it was far from clear error for the district court to credit the fully informed testimony of these auditors. In the same vein, there was ample evidence that Yuen did not make a full disclosure to the auditors, and thus the district court properly rejected his good faith reliance defense. <em>See SEC v. Goldfield Deep Mines Co., </em>758 F.2d 459, 467 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Next, Yuen challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to prove he acted with scienter. Scienter can be established \u201cby proving either actual knowledge or recklessness\u201d through direct and circumstantial evidence. <em>Provenz v. Miller, </em>102 F.3d 1478, 1490 (9th Cir.1996). Yuen\u2019s attempt to use the pleading standard laid out by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2), to argue that individual pieces of evidence were insufficient to show scienter is unconvincing in this civil enforcement action. Furthermore, the weight of the evidence was well beyond the amount needed to support the district court\u2019s findings and conclusions that Yuen intended to manipulate Gemstar\u2019s accounting and thereby defraud the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Yuen argues also that even if the district court did not clearly err in its finding of scienter, it abused its discretion in relying on the SEC\u2019s expert concerning the disgorgement amount. We disagree. Faced with a proffer of expert testimony, the trial judge must make a \u201cpreliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is ... valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.\u201d <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 592-93, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993). Here, both parties and two experts agreed that the method used by the SEC\u2019s expert \u2014 the event study methodology \u2014 is the generally accepted method of calculating disgorgement. The district court was within its discretion to allow the expert\u2019s testimony. Furthermore, the district court, as the trier of fact, was also within its discretion in weighing the evidence and in setting the disgorgement amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Finally, Yuen argues that the district court abused its discretion in setting the civil penalty because it was disproportionate to Yuen\u2019s conduct and because he was motivated by the desire to strengthen Gemstar. To the contrary, the district court properly found Yuen committed securities fraud with scienter, and Gemstar\u2019s April 2002 corrective disclosure alone resulted in a market loss of over $3 billion. The district court was well within its discretion in setting the civil penalty equal to the disgorgement amount. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77t(d)(2)(C); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u(d)(3)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b641-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
