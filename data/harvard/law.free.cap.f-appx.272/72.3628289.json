May 14, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 560 324 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 13, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">It is well established that the submissions of <em>pro se </em>litigants must be construed liberally and interpreted to raise the strongest arguments that they suggest. <em>See Triestman v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>470 F.3d 471, 474 (2d Cir.2006). When the BIA issues a short opinion affirming the IJ\u2019s decision in part and modifying it in part, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA, confining our review to the rationale of the IJ on which the BIA relied. <em>See Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122, 125 (2d Cir.2007). As such, we assume Chen\u2019s credibility because the BIA did so. <em>See also Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271-72 (2d Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Dong Gao, </em>482 F.3d at 126. However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that substantial evidence does not support the agency\u2019s denial of Chen\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims. We agree with Chen that the agency failed to properly take into account the record evidence. For instance, assuming (as the BIA did) that Chen credibly testified that Chinese officials were aware that he practiced Falun Gong, evidence of China\u2019s treatment of Falun Gong adherents \u201cwould have been highly relevant\u201d to his fear of persecution. <em>Rizal v. Gonzales, </em>442 F.3d 84, 93 (2d Cir.2006); <em>see also Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 130 (2d Cir.2005). The agency\u2019s failure to consider the evidence of conditions in China \u2014 however meager it may have been \u2014 was therefore in error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Rizal, </em>442 F.3d at 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">In addition, it was error for the agency to fail to consider Chen\u2019s testimony that one of his fellow Falun Gong adherents was detained, beaten, forced to denounce Falun Gong and to undergo reeducation. <em>See Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 127-30 (2d Cir.2004). We have observed that the experiences of similarly-situated friends and family are relevant to whether an applicant\u2019s fear is well-founded. <em>See Poradisova v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 70, 80 (2d Cir.2005). Our conclusion that the agency\u2019s decisions were flawed in this respect is further supported by the wording <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>of the BIA\u2019s decision \u2014 that police inquiries about Chen\u2019s \u201cwhereabouts [were] not <em>alone </em>sufficient to demonstrate that [he] would be mistreated by the government on account of a protected ground\u201d \u2014 which suggests that further evidence may have swayed its analysis of Chen\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Furthermore, the IJ\u2019s rejection of three letters Chen submitted because they were not authenticated was flawed for two reasons. First, while the IJ found it significant that the letters failed to include an \u201cattestation that the statements that are being provided are under the penalties of law or being sworn to,\u201d all three of the letters did, in fact, contain the statement, \u201cI swear that the above statements are all facts.\u201d Second, \u201c[i]t is not entirely clear what the IJ believed should have been done to authenticate the [letters].\u201d <em>Cao He Lin, </em>428 F.3d at 404. If the IJ expected authentication of the documents pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1287.6, this was improper because this regulation \u201cis not the exclusive means of authenticating records before an [IJ],\u201d <em>id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted), and because the documents were not \u201cofficial records [or] public documents,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 406. While the IJ had broad discretion as to the weight afforded to Chen\u2019s letters, <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 342 (2d Cir.2006), his reasons for completely rejecting them were insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">Additionally, Chen correctly argues that he was never asked to explain why he failed to provide medical evidence of his mental or physical condition or evidence of his practice of Falun Gong in the United States. Because the IJ did not give Chen \u201cadequate and meaningful notice\u201d of his desire for this evidence, <em>Ming Shi Xue v. BIA, </em>439 F.3d 111, 122 (2d Cir.2006), it was improper for the agency \u201cto rely on the absence of [that] evidence to hold that [Chen] ha[d] not satisfied his burden of proof.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Cao He Lin, </em>428 F.3d at 394-95; <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii). Moreover, the IJ erred by failing to assess whether Chen could reasonably obtain the requested evidence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii); <em>see also Niang v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 138, 148 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">Moreover, the IJ\u2019s demands for additional corroboration of Chen\u2019s practice of, or involvement with, Falun Gong in the U.S. reflect an improper focus on Chen\u2019s \u201cthoughts, actions, and motives,\u201d <em>Chun Gao, </em>424 F.3d at 129, while ignoring the fact that he was eligible for asylum if Chinese authorities would persecute him in the future \u201con the basis of <em>their </em>belief ... that he was a member or supporter of the Falun Gong movement,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 130 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">Given the aforementioned errors, it cannot b\u00e9 confidently predicted that, examin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>ing all of the relevant evidence and applying the appropriate legal standards, the agency would again find that Chen had failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See, e.g., Beskovic v. Gonzales, </em>467 F.3d 223, 227 (2d Cir.2006). Accordingly, remand is appropriate so that the agency can further analyze Chen\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">While we would ordinarily consider Chen\u2019s CAT claim waived because he failed to raise it in his brief to this Court, <em>Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005), in light of the constellation of errors in the agency\u2019s decisions, we also remand this claim for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED, the BIA\u2019s decision is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\">. We note that the record before the agency contained only three brief news articles discussing China\u2019s treatment of Falun Gong adherents and did not include a copy of the most recent human rights report prepared by the U.S. State Department. Where, as here, the record is largely \"silent as to [the] contemporary treatment of persons with backgrounds similar to [the applicant's],\u201d <em>Qun Yang v. McElroy, </em>277 F.3d 158, 163 (2d Cir. 2002), our review is frustrated. <em>See also id. </em>(noting that while the burden of proof rests with the asylum applicant, the government also bears a \u201cburden of production,\" particularly with respect to \"State Department documents\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b98-5\">. Moreover, presuming the credibility of Chen\u2019s allegations about the multiple visits by police to his parents\u2019 home, the BIA\u2019s bald statement that these visits did not give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution \u2014 without further analysis \u2014 was legally insufficient where \u201d[t]he only inference that can reasonably be drawn from these facts is that the visits made by the authorities were not social in nature.\u201d <em>Chun Gao, </em>424 F.3d at 131. To the extent that the record contains evidence of China's treatment of Falun Gong adherents, such evidence \"clearly indicated] a concerted effort on the part of the Chinese government to persecute such individuals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b98-11\">. Regarding the IJ\u2019s finding that it was implausible that Chen began practicing Falun Gong to improve his self-esteem and to lose weight when there was no evidence that Fa-lun Gong practice could help him achieve those results, we note that this finding was not properly tethered to any record evidence. <em>See Wensheng Yan v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 63, 67 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b98-12\">. Similarly, the IJ\u2019s finding that Chen\u2019s fear of persecution was undermined by the fact that he never served as a master or teacher of Falun Gong was erroneous where the IJ failed to explain how this would affect the possibility that Chinese authorities will persecute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Chen on account of his practice of Falun Gong. <em>Cf Rizal, </em>442 F.3d at 90.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
