Because the parties are aware of the facts of the case, we do not recount them here. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-20\">Perez-Aguilar first argues that the district court failed to properly articulate on the record that it considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. Although Perez-Aguilar did not raise an objection on this ground at sentencing, he did file a sentencing memorandum in which he argued that the district court should consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and in which he argued that the factors should persuade the district court to impose a sentence below the guidelines range. We need not decide whether Perez-Aguilar\u2019s sentencing memorandum properly preserved the reasonableness standard of review; under either a plain error or unreasonableness standard, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-21\">Although the district court did not specifically cite the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>factors, it \u201cset forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that [the district court] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Although the district court\u2019s analysis on the record was brief, it was legally sufficient. The district court considered the guidelines range and applied a sentence within that range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4); <em>United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 992 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc) (stating that a \u201cwithin-Guidelines sentence ordinarily needs little explanation\u201d and \u201c[t]he district court need not tick off each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to show that it has considered them\u201d). \u201cThe record makes clear that the sentencing judge listened to each argument\u201d presented by Perez-Aguilar, but \u201csimply found these circumstances insufficient to warrant a sentence lower than the Guidelines range....\u201d <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2469.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The district court specifically imposed a sentence within the guidelines range because it reflected the seriousness of the offense, stating that the guidelines sentence was appropriate because it was a \u201csignificant\u201d sentence for a \u201csignificant\u201d offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). The district court considered Perez-Aguilar\u2019s history and characteristics when it heard argument regarding his family and when it explicitly noted Perez-Aguilar\u2019s behavior over the previous ten years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Finally, the district court determined that the disparity between the guidelines sentence in this case and the sentence ordinarily imposed on \u201cfast track\u201d defendants was not unwarranted despite Perez-Aguilar\u2019s argument that his conduct was similar to that of defendants permitted to plead pursuant to a \u201cfast track\u201d program. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Perez-Aguilar also argues that the panel should vacate his sentence because the district coui't erroneously applied a 16-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) based on Perez-Aguilar\u2019s prior conviction under CalPenal Code \u00a7 286(b)(1). Because Perez-Aguilar never objected to the application of the 16-level enhancement in the district court, we review this issue for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">The district court did not err in applying the 16-level enhancement because Perez-Aguilar\u2019s prior conviction for \u201csodomy with another person who is under 18 years of age\u201d in violation of Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 286(b)(1) categorically constitutes statutory rape under the guidelines and thus qualifies as a crime of violence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) &amp; app. n. l(B)(iii). It is irrelevant that California sets the age of consent at eighteen and most other states set it at sixteen or seventeen because \u201c[t]he term \u2018statutory rape\u2019 is ordinarily, contemporarily, and commonly understood to mean the unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor under the <em>age of consent specified by state statute.\u201d United States v. Gomez-Mendez, </em>486 F.3d 599, 603 (9th Cir.2007) (emphasis added). Because the guidelines do not define statutory rape, we apply this definition for purposes of our categorical analysis under <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). <em>See id. </em>Based on the definition in <em>Gomez-Mendez, </em>we find that Perez-Aguilar\u2019s prior conviction under CalPenal Code \u00a7 286(b)(1) categorically qualifies as statutory rape and thus constitutes a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b646-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
