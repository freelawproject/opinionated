Mar. 8, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A29 967 817 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 18, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">As an initial matter, contrary to the government\u2019s assertion, Orellan\u00e1-Gutier-rez timely petitions this Court for review of the agency\u2019s denial of his application for cancellation of removal and not from the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider. Even if this Court were to liberally construe Orellana-Gutierrez\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief, filed in support of his April 2007 petition for review, as a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s July 2007 denial of his motion to reconsider, such a petition would have been untimely. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (providing that a petition for review \u201cmust be filed not later than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal\u201d); <em>see also Khouzam v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 161, 167 (2d Cir.2004) (declining to consider the BIA\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s motion to reconsider where petitioner had timely petitioned the Court for review of the underlying decision but not from the denial of his motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, the Court may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect the Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion. <em>Jigme Wangchuck v. DHS, </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). However, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the factual determinations underlying a decision regarding cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>see also Barco-Sandoval v. Gonzales, </em>516 F.3d 35, 38-39 (2d Cir.2008) (citing <em>De La Vega v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 141, 144-46 (2d Cir.2006)). Nonetheless, this Court retains jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and questions of law. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact are reviewed <em>de novo. See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Here, Orellana-Gutierrez argues that the agency erred by: (1) determining that his U.S. citizen daughter would not suffer \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship;\u201d and (2) failing to consider his U.S. citizen stepdaughter and his son as qualifying relatives and declining to make a hardship determination with regard to them. This Court lacks jurisdiction to review Orellana-Gutierrez\u2019s first argument because it merely challenges the agency\u2019s discretionary hardship determination with regard to Orellana-Gutierrez\u2019s U.S. citizen daughter and clearly does not raise a constitutional question or question of law. <em>See De La Vega, </em>436 F.3d at 145-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Orellana-Gutierrez\u2019s second argument appears to raise a question of law, namely whether the agency erred in determining that his U.S. citizen stepdaughter and non-U.S. citizen, non-lawful permanent resident son were not qualifying relatives for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(D). <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 330-32 (2d Cir.2006). However, Orellana-Gutierrez did not assert before the IJ or the BIA that either his stepdaughter or his son were qualifying relatives for purposes of his application for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>cancellation of removal. In his application for cancellation of removal, Orellana-Gu-tierrez stated only that his removal would cause hardship to his \u201cU.S. citizen child or children,\u201d and the only U.S. citizen child he listed was his daughter. Likewise, on appeal to the BIA, Orellana-Gutierrez challenged only the IJ\u2019s hardship determination with regard to his U.S. citizen daughter and did not mention his stepdaughter or son. Thus, as Orellana-Gu-tierrez did not assert that his stepdaughter or son were qualifying relatives for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(D), the IJ and BIA did not consider the issue. As such, Orellana-Gutierrez\u2019s purported challenge to the agency\u2019s finding regarding this issue does not present a colorable question of law, and this Court lacks jurisdiction to review his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for remand is DENIED because the Court can not consider new evidence that was not presented to the agency. As we have completed our review, any stay of .removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
