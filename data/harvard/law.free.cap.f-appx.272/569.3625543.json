Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 1001, 1004 (9th Cir.2003), and petitioner\u2019s argument otherwise fails to raise a colorable constitutional claim. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005). Petitioner contends that the BIA failed to consider some or all of the evidence, but he fails to overcome the presumption that the BIA did review the record. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 603 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b593-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
