We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition, <em>see Sass v. Cal. Bd. of Prison Terms, </em>461 F.3d 1123, 1126 (9th Cir.2006), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">Respondent\u2019s contentions that Washington does not have a clearly established liberty interest in parole, and that a Certificate of Appealability is required, are foreclosed. <em>See id. </em>at 1127-28. Respondent\u2019s contention that the \u201csome evidence\u201d standard does not apply to parole decisions is also foreclosed. <em>See McQuillion v. Duncan, </em>306 F.3d 895, 904 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">We conclude that Washington\u2019s equal protection rights were not violated because he has failed to show that others similarly situated were treated more favorably and that the disparate treatment was based on an impermissible motive. <em>See United States v. Estrada-Plata, </em>57 F.3d 757, 760 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">Washington contends that the Board\u2019s 2001 decision denying him parole violated his due process rights because: (1) the Board relied exclusively on his commitment offense and other unchanging factors in its decision; (2) the record at the parole hearing was incomplete; and (3) the psychological evaluations of Washington were flawed, resulting in certain denial. We reject these contentions. The Board relied on factors in addition to the commitment offense and other unchanging factors in reaching its decision, including Washington\u2019s failure to continue participating in substance abuse programming although his commitment offense was drug-related and his addiction problems were severe, and the insufficiency of his parole plans, as reported in his psychological evaluation. <em>See Sass, </em>461 F.3d at 1128-29. Furthermore, Washington was afforded an opportunity to be heard regarding the psychological evaluations and the evidence that he contends was missing from the record, and he received a statement of reasons explaining why his parole was denied. <em>See Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal &amp; Corr. Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 14-16, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-13\">We conclude that some evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision to deny parole. <em>See Superintendent v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 455, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985); <em>Irons v. Carey, </em>505 F.3d 846, 851-52 (9th Cir.2007). Accordingly, Washington has failed to demonstrate that the state court\u2019s decision denying this claim \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d or \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\u201d <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>see also Hill, </em>472 U.S. at 454-56, 105 S.Ct. 2768.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b659-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
