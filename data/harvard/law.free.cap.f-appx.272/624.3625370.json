Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004), and implausible, <em>see Don v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 738, 743 (9th Cir.2007). Substantial evidence thus supports the finding that petitioner isn\u2019t eligible for asylum, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B), so he is also necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal, <em>see Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). Petitioner\u2019s claim for relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) fails because a reasonable adjudicator would not be compelled to find that it\u2019s more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-21\">Even if we were to assume that the BIA didn\u2019t affirm the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, petitioner wouldn\u2019t be eligible for asylum, withholding of removal or CAT relief. A single beating incident that didn\u2019t require hospitalization and didn\u2019t cause petitioner to apply for asylum when he was previously in the United States, and vague threats don\u2019t amount to persecution, <em>see Li v. Ashcroft, </em>356 F.3d 1153, 1158 (9th Cir.2004) (en banc), or torture, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-22\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b648-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b648-23\">W. FLETCHER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AgA\">concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-24\">I write separately to highlight the deficiencies in the order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d), which lead me to conclude that the BIA did not affirm the adverse credibility determination of the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d). The government concedes that the IJ denied relief in a decision that \u201cturned on\u201d an adverse, credibility determination. However, the BIA order gives no indication that it affirmed based on adverse credibility. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>BIA order states, \u201cWe agree that the respondent has not demonstrated eligibility for asylum and also affirm the Immigration Judge\u2019s determination that the respondent has failed to establish grounds for granting the other forms of relief requested.\u201d In support of this sentence, the BIA cites authorities that are entirely irrelevant to an adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">First, the BIA cites 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), the provision establishing the one-year filing deadline for asylum applications. The IJ\u2019s decision makes no mention of this deadline because the petitioner\u2019s application was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Second, the BIA cites <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987), which held that the \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution\u201d standard for asylum eligibility is a less demanding standard than the \u201cmore likely than not\u201d standard for withholding of deportation. <em>Id. </em>at 448-49, 107 S.Ct. 1207. Because the IJ found that the petitioner was not credible, neither standard was relevant to the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Third, the BIA cites <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984), which held that to be entitled to withholding of deportation, an individual\u2019s application must \u201cbe supported by evidence establishing that it is more likely than not that the alien would be subject to persecution on one of the specified grounds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489. Again, because the IJ found that the petitioner was not credible, this standard was not relevant to the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Fourth, the BIA cites <em>Zheng v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 1186 (9th Cir.2003), which held that when an individual claims entitlement to relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) because of the conduct of non-governmental actors, that individual need not show that the \u201cgovernment is willfully accepting of the torture of its citizens by a third party\u201d in order to show government acquiescence. <em>Id. </em>at 1197. <em>Zheng </em>is irrelevant to the IJ\u2019s decision, because all of the petitioner\u2019s allegations involved government actors.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">Fifth, the BIA cites <em>Matter of S-V-, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1306 (BIA 2000), the CAT acquiescence case overruled by <em>Zheng. Zheng, </em>332 F.3d at 1192, 1197; <em>see Ochoa v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1166, 1172 (9th Cir. 2005). <em>Matter of </em>S-V- is not only irrelevant \u2014 it is no longer good law.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">The only language that even remotely suggests that the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is the penultimate sentence of the order, which states, \u201cInasmuch as we are in agreement with the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision, we affirm his decision based upon and for the reasons set forth therein.\u201d Given the bizarre and illogical combination of citations in the BIA order, and the BIA\u2019s utter failure to give any indication that it was cognizant of the actual basis for the IJ\u2019s decision, I do not think this sentence is sufficient to demonstrate that the BIA actually affirmed the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">I nonetheless concur in the judgment. Assuming, as the BIA appeal\u2019s to do, that the petitioner was credible, <em>cf. Krotova v. Gonzales, </em>416 F.3d 1080, 1084 (9th Cir. 2005), a reasonable adjudicator would not be compelled to find that the petitioner has suffered past persecution, that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution, or that. it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to Armenia. <em>See Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 339-40 (9th Cir.1995); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
