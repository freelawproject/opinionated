O\u2019BRIEN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b731-22\">James Lynn Hill was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm and sentenced to 120 months imprisonment. He appealed and on May 18, 2007, we affirmed. <em>United States v. Hill, </em>224 Fed. Appx. 825 (10th Cir.2007) (unpublished).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On August 16, 2007, after the mandate issued, Hill sought leave of the district court to correct or modify the record on appeal, claiming various errors in the indexes and headings of the trial and sentencing transcripts. On August 23, 2007, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>the court denied Hill\u2019s application on the merits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">On August 31, 2007, Hill appealed from the district court\u2019s denial of his application for leave to correct or modify the record. He also filed an ex parte notification of <em>Brady </em>request/violation, which we construed as a motion requesting discovery, and a letter regarding his appeal, which we construed as a motion to correct the record. Hill\u2019s appeal is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Because the issue of mootness implicates-our jurisdiction, we may consider it <em>sua sponte. See McClendon v. City of Albuquerque, </em>100 F.3d 863, 867 (10th Cir.1996). Without a pending appeal, there is no record to correct, and we could not afford Hill any effectual relief. <em>See In re Overland Park Fin. Corp., </em>236 F.3d 1246, 1254 (10th Cir.2001) (\u201cA case is moot when it is impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief whatever to a prevailing party.\u201d) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">We therefore DISMISS Hill\u2019s appeal. We likewise DISMISS his motion to correct the record and his motion requesting discovery. We also DENY Hill\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal. Hill is obligated to continue making partial payments until all fees have been paid, as ordered by the district court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-23\">. The mandate issued on June 11, 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b732-8\">. The court presumed Hill\u2019s application was not moot because he intended to file a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court. Hill had actually filed such a petition on August 16, 2007, prior to the issuance of the district court\u2019s order. The Supreme Court subsequently denied Hill's petition. See <em>Hill v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 327, 169 L.Ed.2d 230 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b732-26\">. The district court determined Hill should be required to pay a partial filing fee of $150.00, one-third of the required filing fee.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
