The district court affirmed and Mendoza now appeals. Finding no error, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The facts are not in substantial dispute. In his application for SSI, Mendoza alleged significant disabilities, including back problems, hepatitis C, liver problems, gastroe-sophogeal reflux disease, and vision problems. The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) below determined that Mendoza is not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d) and was therefore not entitled to SSL The Appeals Council denied further review; the decision of the ALJ therefore became the final decision of the Commissioner.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">We review the denial of benefits only to ascertain whether substantial evidence supports the final decision and whether the Commissioner used the proper legal standards to evaluate the evidence. We affirm the Commissioner\u2019s findings whenever supported by substantial evidence. Substantial evidence \u201cis more than a mere scintilla and less than a preponderance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-7\"><em>Master son v. Barnhart, </em>309 F.3d 267, 272 (5th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Newton v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000)) (citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">Mendoza appears to challenge the evi-dentiary basis of the ALJ\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The evidence before the ALJ was more than sufficient to establish that Mendoza was not disabled within the meaning of the Act and despite his various maladies. <em>See Loza v. Apfel, </em>219 F.3d 378, 390 (5th Cir. 2000) (describing five-element test for determining existence of a disability, including evaluation of applicant\u2019s present ability to engage in substantial gainful activity and applicant\u2019s ability to return to past work). In particular, the evidence showed that Mendoza engaged in substantial gainful employment \u2014 as a dishwasher for a restaurant \u2014 during the periods relevant to his application for SSI. As such, Mendoza did not qualify as disabled under \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(i). Further, Mendoza\u2019s work as a dishwasher also supported the ALJ\u2019s determination that Mendoza remained capable of working full time, and was therefore not disabled. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(iv). Thus, though there is medical evidence that Mendoza was in some degree of pain,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>the ALJ is nevertheless supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b384-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-8\">. This is a generous reading of Mendoza's brief. The arguments advanced by Mendoza are difficult to discern, even given our generous approach to <em>pro se </em>briefs. Mendoza served a prison sentence from March 1974 to February 2003 and was accordingly not eligible for SSI. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1382(e)(1); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.468. Most of Mendoza\u2019s arguments appear directed towards the putative illegality of the Act making prisoners ineligible for SSI-Mendoza cites both liberty interest concerns and <em>ex post facto </em>concerns. But the ALJ found that Mendoza was actually not disabled; Mendoza\u2019s eligibility turns on that determination, not his incarceration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b385-9\"><em>. </em>Section 1382c(a)(3)(A) provides in relevant part: \"an individual shall be considered to be disabled for purposes of this subchapter if he is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical ... impairment which ... can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b385-14\">. Mendoza makes some reference to a motion to file an affidavit in support of his brief, presumably with the purpose of establishing new medical evidence. This motion is not properly before us, as Mendoza was notified of the motion\u2019s failure to comply with 5th Cir. R. 31.1 but failed to cure its defects. Moreover, Mendoza apparently attempted to submit this new evidence to the district court, which appropriately found that it only supported filing of a new SSI application, not remand to the Social Security Administration. <em>See Ellis v. Bowen, </em>820 F.2d 682, 684 (5th Cir. 1987); 42 U.S.C. 405(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
