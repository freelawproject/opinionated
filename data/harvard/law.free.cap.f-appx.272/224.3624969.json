Hope\u2019s attorney filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), certifying there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning the propriety of Hope\u2019s sentence. In his pro se supplemental brief, Hope maintains the district court erred in sentencing him as an armed career criminal. The Government did not file a brief. We have considered the various arguments on appeal and reviewed the relevant record and, for the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-25\">As recently determined by the Supreme Court, \u201c[r]egardless of whether the sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>tenee imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range, the appellate court must review the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We remain charged with reviewing sentences for reasonableness, <em>id. </em>at 594, 597, which requires that we consider both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of a sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">In determining whether a sentence is procedurally reasonable, this court first assesses whether the district court properly calculated the defendant\u2019s advisory Guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 596-97. This court must then consider whether the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selected a sentence based on \u201cclearly erroneous facts,\u201d or failed to sufficiently explain the selected sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 597; <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). Finally, we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, \u201ctaking into account the \u2018totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473, (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). This court may afford sentences that fall within the properly calculated Guidelines range a presumption of reasonableness, <em>see id., </em>a presumption permitted by the Supreme Court. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2459, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">Hope contends the district court erred in classifying him an armed career criminal and enhancing his sentence accordingly. More specifically, Hope argues his 1991 conviction for voluntary manslaughter was improperly counted because his civil rights, which had been revoked upon conviction, were restored. This contention fails. The North Carolina Parole Board\u2019s restoration order expressly excluded Hope\u2019s civil right to possess a firearm from the general restoration of his rights. Thus, this conviction was properly counted. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20) (2000). More-' over, contrary to Hope\u2019s contention, the age of this offense is irrelevant. <em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.4, cmt. n. 1 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">The district court properly calculated Hope\u2019s advisory Guidelines range, considered the statutory sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007), and imposed a sentence at the top-end of that range. Our review of the record reveals no procedural or substantive defect in Hope\u2019s sentence, and Hope has not overcome the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his sentence. <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2459, 2462. In addition to imposing a reasonable sentence, the district court conducted a thorough Rule 11 colloquy prior to accepting Hope\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entirety of the record and found no meritorious issues. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We require that counsel inform Hope, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Hope requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Hope. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately set forth in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
