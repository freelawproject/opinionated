We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">When a district court upholds a determination of the Commissioner, we \u201creview the administrative record <em>de novo </em>to determine whether there is substantial evidence supporting the Commissioner\u2019s decision and whether the Commissioner applied the correct legal standard.\u201d <em>Machadio v. Apfel, </em>276 F.3d 103, 108 (2d Cir.2002). Substantial evidence means \u201cmore than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">[1] Netter argues that the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) and the district court erred in discounting his credibility on the basis of a decades-old conviction for armed robbery and his history of substance abuse. But he cites no controlling legal authority for the proposition that these are impermissible considerations. More to the point, the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination also l\u2019ested on other grounds, such as the inconsistency between Netter\u2019s testimony and a treating orthopedic surgeon\u2019s clinical notes. Ultimately, \u201c[i]t is the function of the [Commissioner], not [the reviewing courts], to resolve evidentiary conflicts and to appraise the credibility of witnesses, including the claimant.\u201d <em>Carroll v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>705 F.2d 638, 642 (2d Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">Moreover, the district court did not affirm the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination on different grounds than those on which the ALJ relied. The district court relied on the same set of inconsistencies identified by the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-13\">[2] Netter claims that the ALJ and the district court should have given controlling or significant weight to a treating physician\u2019s opinion that he is disabled. However, Dr. Regalia\u2019s opinion that Netter is disabled is inconsistent with her own clinical observations that Netter\u2019s neck pain was controlled and that she expected significant improvement in his condition. In addition, Dr. Anthony Leone, a specialist in orthopedic surgery who also treated Netter (at the recommendation of Dr. Regalia), confidently opined that Netter was not \u201cby any stretch of the imagination, totally disabled.\u201d Dr. Leone\u2019s clinical findings that Netter\u2019s sensations, strength and reflexes were \u201cgrossly normal\u201d support his conclusion. Finally, Dr. Leone\u2019s opinion was consistent with the opinions of multiple state-employed consultative doctors and Dr. Chandra Gowda.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-14\">Under the applicable regulations, even \u201cnonexamining sources\u201d may \u201coverride treating sources\u2019 opinions, provided they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>are supported by evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Schisler v. Sullivan, </em>3 F.3d 563, 568 (2d Cir.1993) (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(f), 416.927(f)). Where, as here, a treating specialist and state-employed physicians are in agreement that an individual is not disabled, and where this conclusion is supported by record evidence, the Commissioner may reject the contrary opinion of one treating physician. <em>See Veino v. Barnhart, </em>312 F.3d 578, 588 (2d Cir.2002) (\u201cGenuine conflicts in the medical evidence are for the Commissioner to resolve.\u201d (citing <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 399, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971))). We find no error in the ALJ\u2019s decision not to give controlling or significant weight to Dr. Regalia\u2019s opinion, nor in the ALJ\u2019s resulting conclusions as to Netter\u2019s physical capabilities, as both decisions are supported by evidence in the record. Moreover, because the distinct court relied on Dr. Regalia\u2019s conservative treatment regimen merely as additional evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s determination rather than as \u201ccompelling\u201d evidence sufficient in itself to overcome an \u201cotherwise valid medical opinion,\u201d the district court did not impermissibly \u201csubstitute his own expertise or view of the medical proof for the treating physician\u2019s opinion,\u201d <em>Shaw v. Chater, </em>221 F.3d 126, 134-35 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Netter\u2019s final claim is that the ALJ was obliged to affirmatively develop the record because it found Dr. Regalia\u2019s clinical records to be lacking. However, the ALJ rejected Dr. Regalia\u2019s opinion because it was contradicted by the opinions of other doctors and the record evidence\u2014 not because it was inadequately supported by her own clinical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">We have considered Netter\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the final judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
