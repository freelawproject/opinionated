The BIA, however, did not address the continuous residence issue, and instead based its decision solely on the basis that petitioners failed to establish exceptional or extremely unusual hardship to petitioners\u2019 qualifying relative. This court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that petitioners failed to demonstrate the requisite hardship. <em>See Martinez-Ro</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>sas <em>v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The IJ granted voluntary departure for a 60-day period, and the BIA streamlined and changed the voluntary departure period to 30 days. However, in <em>Padilla-Padilla v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 972, 981 (9th Cir.2006), we held that \u201cbecause the BIA issued a streamlined order, it was required to affirm the entirety of the IJ\u2019s decision, including the length of the voluntary departure period.\u201d We therefore remand to the BIA to reinstate the 60-day voluntary departure period.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b620-26\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
