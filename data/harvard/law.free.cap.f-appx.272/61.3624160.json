May 24, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 903 223 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 13, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). Here, because Cui does not challenge the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, but challenges the supplemental portion of the BIA\u2019s decision denying her due process challenge, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision with regards to Cui\u2019s due process challenge. <em>Id. </em>We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Ro-sales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-14\">We have held that due process requires that an applicant receive a full and fair hearing which provides a meaningful opportunity to be heard. <em>Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 104-05 (2d Cir.2006) (citations omitted). Specifically, with respect to the need for adequate translation, we have held that \u201cwhere the translation of the asylum application was nonsensical, the accuracy and scope of the hearing translation are subject to grave doubt....\u201d <em>See Augustin v. Sava, </em>735 F.2d 32, 37-38 (2nd Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-15\">Here, Cui argues that her right to a full and fair hearing was denied because her native language is Korean and the hearing was held in Mandarin. However, Cui stated in her application that she is Chinese by birth and her native language is Mandarin, while also noting that she is of Korean ethnicity and speaks Korean fluently. Further, Cui\u2019s attorney stated that Mandarin is her best language during her master calendar hearing, and failed to object when the IJ announced at the beginning of the merits hearing that the official Court interpreter would be speaking Mandarin. Moreover, there was only one mention of translation during the entire merits hearing and that was when Cui\u2019s counsel detected what he believed to be an error in the translation of Cui\u2019s testimony. Aside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>from that instance, there was never any translation-related objection or a statement by Cui that she was having any trouble understanding the interpreter. Indeed, the fist time that Cui\u2019s counsel raised this issue was on appeal to the BIA. Accordingly, we find that Cui was provided with a meaningful opportunity to be heard and her due process rights were not violated. <em>Li Hua Lin, </em>453 F.3d at 104-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
