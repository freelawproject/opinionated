Principi, </em>02-309 be summarily affirmed. Lillie B. Joyce has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-26\">This case was stayed pending the court\u2019s disposition in <em>Roan v. Principi, </em>2004-7093, which was stayed pending the court\u2019s disposition in <em>Sanders v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 881 (Fed.Cir.2007) and its companion case <em>Simmons v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 892 (Fed. Cir.2007). In <em>Sanders, </em>this court held that any 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103(a) error should be presumed prejudicial and the Secretary has the burden of rebutting this presumption. <em>Id. </em>at 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-27\">The Secretary concedes that the only issue raised in this appeal is identical to the issue decided in <em>Sanders </em>and <em>Simmons. </em>Under these circumstances, summary affirmance is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-28\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b925-29\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b925-30\">(1) The stay of proceedings is lifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-31\">(2) The judgment of the GAVC is summarily affirmed. The case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-32\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
