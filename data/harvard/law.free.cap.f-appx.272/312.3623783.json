This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and cex*tain intex*locutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The portion of the order denying a tempo-x\u2019axy restraining oi\u2019der and access to the law library is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral ox\u2019der. Accordingly, we dismiss that aspect of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-17\">On the other hand, the district court\u2019s denial of a request for a preliminary injunction is immediately appealable. 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) (2000). With respect to the district court\u2019s denial of Williams\u2019 motions for a preliminary injunction, we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm this portion of the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
