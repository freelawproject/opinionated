Nelson, which denied her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Jia Yan Weng, </em>No. A98 718 209 (B.I.A. July 3, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 718 209 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 21, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir .2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">When deciding a claim for asylum and related relief, \u201can IJ must: (1) \u2018decide explicitly\u2019 whether or not the candidate\u2019s testimony was credible (without relying exclusively on the lack of corroborating evidence); and, if credible, (2) determine whether additional corroboration is nonetheless necessary for the candidate to meet his or her burden of proof.\u201d <em>Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir. 2008) (citing <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 290 (2d Cir.2000)). We have held that \u201c[vjague, unclear, and passing statements do not suffice to fulfill the agency\u2019s obligation to \u2018rule explicitly on the credibility of [a petitioner\u2019s] testimony,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Diallo, </em>232 F.3d at 287), and that appellate \u201creview is frustrated when it is unclear whether the agency has made an adverse credibility determination,\u201d <em>id.; see also Ivanishvili v. US. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 342 (2d Cir.2006) (finding \u201cit remarkable, not to mention frustrative of judicial review, that the IJ did not in any way analyze or weigh [the applicant\u2019s] testimony\u201d). Indeed, the failure to consider the credibility of an applicant\u2019s testimony may deny asylum applicants the benefit of the agency\u2019s rule that an applicant\u2019s burden of proof may be sustained \u201cbased on credible testimony alone or, by extension, credible testimony combined with convincing explanations for lack of corroboration.\u201d <em>Diallo, </em>232 F.3d at 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">Here, although the IJ recognized the requirements identified in <em>Zaman </em>and <em>Diallo, </em>she failed to make an explicit determination as to Weng\u2019s credibility. Unlike our determination in <em>Zaman, </em>the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions here do not support a finding that the IJ\u2019s analysis \u201cwas sufficient to qualify as an \u2018explicit credibility finding.\u2019\u201d <em>Zaman, </em>514 F.3d at 237. In <em>Zaman, </em>we noted that the IJ expressed reasoned doubts about the applicant\u2019s credibility and made no other findings to support his decision to deny relief. <em>Id. </em>at 237-38. Moreover, we recognized in that case that \u201cwhile the BIA\u2019s order does not explicitly tell us whether the IJ made an adverse credibility determination, neither does it indicate the IJ\u2019s decision was anything else.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238. Here, in evaluating Weng\u2019s evidence, the IJ failed to evalu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>ate the credibility of Weng\u2019s testimony, making only an explicit finding that his corroborating evidence failed to satisfy his burden of proof. Additionally, in adopting and affirming the IJ\u2019s decision, the BIA made no mention of a credibility determination, and \u201cagree[d] with th\u00e9 Immigration Judge that the respondent did not provide sufficient corroborating evidence to satisfy the burden of proof.\u201d Thus, unlike in <em>Za-man, </em>it is clear that the agency rested its denial of relief on its explicit burden of proof finding, and we will not treat the IJ\u2019s decision as having made an explicit adverse credibility finding. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Having failed to make an explicit adverse credibility finding, the IJ\u2019s decision must be construed to have been based on the her finding that Weng\u2019s corroborative evidence should be given little weight. Although the weight afforded to evidence \u201clies largely within the discretion of the IJ,\u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 342 (2d Cir.2006) (alteration, citation, and internal quotation remarks omitted), the IJ\u2019s failure to make an explicit credibility determination here frustrates our review. <em>See Zaman, </em>514 F.3d at 237; <em>see also Diallo, </em>232 F.3d at 290. For example, if the IJ found Weng\u2019s testimony not credible based solely on a lack of sufficient corroborating evidence, such a decision might constitute error. <em>See Diallo, </em>232 F.3d at 290 (noting that an applicant\u2019s \u201csimple failure to produce any particular documentary support cannot serve as the sole basis of an adverse credibility finding\u201d). On the other hand', if the IJ found Weng\u2019s testimony credible, but found that additional corroborating evidence was necessary to satisfy his burden of proof, the IJ\u2019s determination that the documents he submitted were insufficient would amount to a burden of proof finding based on a lack of corroborating evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 288-90. As such, the IJ would have been required to explain why it was reasonable to expect additional corroborating evidence and why Weng\u2019s explanations for the lack of such additional evidence were insufficient. <em>Id. </em>at 290. We cannot find that the IJ did so. For these reasons, the lack of a \u25a0credibility finding below frustrates this Court\u2019s review. Accordingly, we remand the case to the agency in order for it to make an explicit credibility finding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED. As we have completed our review, Weng\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b124-5\">. We further note that the agency's past persecution finding appears to have been flawed where the IJ ignored certain incidents of harm described by Weng. <em>See Gjolaj v. BCIS, </em>468 F.3d 140, 143 (2d Cir.2006) (holding \u201cthat incidents alleged to constitute persecution ... must be considered cumulatively, and that a series of incidents of mistreatment may together rise to the level of persecution even if each incident taken alone does not\u201d) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
