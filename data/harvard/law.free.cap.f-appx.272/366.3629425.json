Rodriguez-Vasquez argues that our pattern jury instruction on the defense of duress places a constitutionally impermissible burden on the defendant, and he asserts that the instruction violates principles of equal protection because other circuits require a defendant raising a defense of duress to make a less onerous showing. He contends that his sentence is excessive because the district court erroneously determined that he was not entitled to a reduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility. Rodriguez-Vasquez\u2019s challenge to the burden of proof required to establish the defense of duress is foreclosed by <em>Dixon v. United States, </em>548 U.S. 1, 126 S.Ct. 2437, 2442-48, 165 L.Ed.2d 299 (2006). His contention that our pattern instruction on duress violates principles of equal protection fails because he does not suggest that the challenged instruction has a discriminatory purpose. <em>See United States v. Chavez, </em>281 F.3d 479, 486-87 (5th Cir.2002). We affirm the sentencing court\u2019s determination that Rodriguez-Vasquez was not entitled to a reduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility. <em>United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 458 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b391-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
