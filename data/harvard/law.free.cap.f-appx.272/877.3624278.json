Jones, III appeals from a summary judgment entered in favor of Automobile Protection Corp. (\u201cAPCO\u201d). Because we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s judgment, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-26\">Jones entered into the Independent Contractor Agreement with APCO whereby he agreed to solicit automobile dealers for the purpose of marketing and servicing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>APCO\u2019s extended vehicle service contracts. The relationship between the parties deteriorated, and APCO ultimately terminated the Agreement. Soon thereafter, APCO filed suit against Jones primarily seeking a declaratory judgment regarding the parties\u2019 rights under the Agreement, and Jones responded with counterclaims of his own seeking declaratory judgment and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Jones\u2019s principal claim is that the Agreement guaranteed him the exclusive right to market and service APCO\u2019s extended vehicle service contracts in his geographical territory, and that APCO breached the Agreement by appointing other agents in the same region and reassigning certain accounts formerly serviced by Jones to them. We find no error because the Agreement does not provide Jones an exclusive right to market APCO\u2019s extended vehicle service contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">We also find no error in the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment as to his claims that APCO breached the Agreement by reassigning Jones\u2019s accounts, by tortiously interfering with Jones\u2019s relationship with his employees, by failing to allow him a pre-termination opportunity to cure any default in the Agreement, and by preventing him from servicing his accounts after terminating him for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Finally, we agree with the district court\u2019s determination that the purported oral agreement concerning Jones\u2019s administration of recreational-vehicle accounts is not enforceable. It was not memorialized in writing, and no exceptions to Georgia\u2019s Statute of Frauds, Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 13-5-31, apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
