July 2, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-21\">Where, as here, an alien files a timely petition for review from the denial of a motion, but not from the underlying affir-mance of a removal order, we may review only the denial of the motion. <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 90 (2d Cir.2001). Thus, we must confine our review to the BIA\u2019s July 2007 denial of Lin\u2019s motion, and are precluded from reviewing his challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of his underlying claim for relief. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-22\">However, Lin challenges only the agency\u2019s decision that denied his application for relief on adverse credibility grounds, failing to present any argument challenging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>the BIA\u2019s decision that his motion to reopen was untimely. Although we generally construe the papers filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants liberally, <em>Marmolejo v. United States, </em>196 F.3d 377, 378 (2d Cir.1999), \u201cwe need not manufacture claims of error for an appellant proceeding <em>pro se.\u201d LoSacco v. Middletown, </em>71 F.3d 88, 93 (2d Cir.1995) (citations omitted); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A). Here, even construed liberally, Lin has not challenged the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen in any respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal in the absence of manifest injustice. <em>Yueqiug Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). There is no indication here that declining to consider the arguments Lin has waived would result in a manifest injustice. Indeed, even if we were to review the BIA\u2019s decision, we could not find that it abused its discretion by denying Lin\u2019s motion. <em>See id.; Ke Zhen Zhao, </em>265 F.3d at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
