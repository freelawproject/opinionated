Wolle, <em>Judge) </em>in favor of Defendant-Appellee D'ynAir Services, Inc. (\u201cDynAir\u201d), and against Chacko, following a bench trial on Chacko\u2019s employment discrimination claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the procedural history, facts, and relevant issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u201cA finding of discrimination is a finding of fact, as are findings of discriminatory intent, and causation.\u201d <em>Cifra v. G.E. Co., </em>252 F.3d 205, 213 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted). Whether a work environment is sufficiently hostile to violate Title VII is a question of fact, <em>see Schiano v. Quality Payroll Sys., Inc., </em>445 F.3d 597, 600 (2d Cir.2006), as is the question of whether plaintiff met his burden of proof of a prima facie case of retaliation, <em>see Manoharan v. Columbia Univ. Coll. of Physicians &amp; Surgeons, </em>842 F.2d 590, 594 . (2d Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u201cFindings of fact, whether based on oral or other evidence, must not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and the reviewing court must give due regard to the trial court\u2019s opportunity to judge the witnesses\u2019 credibility.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a)(6). \u201cThe decisions as to whose testimony to credit and which of permissible inferences to draw are solely within the province of the trier of fact, and where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the fact-finder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Cifra, </em>252 F.3d at 213 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cBut, when a district court makes findings of fact predicated upon an incorrect legal standard such findings are not binding on an appellate court.\u201d <em>Weissmana v. Freeman, </em>868 F.2d 1313, 1317 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 883, 110 S.Ct. 219, 107 L.Ed.2d 172 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"Ah\">The District Court properly determined that Chacko failed to prove that he applied for a specific promotion. The conclusion that this scuttled Chacko\u2019s discriminatory failure to promote claim is legally correct. <em>See Petrosino v. Bell Atlantic, </em>385 F.3d 210, 226-27 (2d Cir.2004) (\u201c[T]he second element of a <em>prima facie </em>case cannot be established merely with evidence that a plaintiff generally requested promotion consideration.\u201d). In addition, Chacko did not establish that he was entitled to the \u201cnarrow\u201d exception to the specific application requirement. <em>See id. </em>at 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">The District Court\u2019s determination that Chacko failed to prove a sufficiently hostile work environment is a permissible view of the evidence supported by the law. <em>See Sehiano, </em>445 F.3d at 604-05 (explaining factors, including frequency and severity of discriminatory conduct, to guide fact-finder\u2019s determination of whether a hostile work environment exists). We cannot say that the District Court clearly erred in determining that the use of slurs was infrequent and that Chacko failed to prove sufficiently severe or pervasive misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">The District Court properly determined that Chacko failed to prove that DynAir retaliated against him. The District Court\u2019s determination that Chacko did not complain to DynAir about any slurs is not clearly erroneous. Chacko argues, as his trial counsel did, that he questioned supervisors regarding the company\u2019s \u201cpromotional policy\u201d and that \u201c[rlight from this moment\u201d the retaliation against him commenced. The District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Court determined that during his employment \u201cChacko did not report to a superior any discriminatory conduct.\u201d The record reflects that although Chacko asked about the promotion policy, he did not suggest that he was complaining about discrimination. Nor could DynAir reasonably have understood that Chacko\u2019s questions about promotions were directed at conduct prohibited by Title VII. <em>See Galdieri-Ambrosini v. Nat\u2019l Realty &amp; Dev. Corp., </em>136 F.3d 276, 292 (2d Cir.1998) (\u201c[I]mplicit in the requirement that the employer have been aware of the protected activity is the requirement that it understood, or could reasonably have understood, that the plaintiffs opposition was directed at conduct prohibited by Title VIL\u201d). Accordingly, the District Court did not err in finding that Chacko failed to prove retaliation in violation of Title VII.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">To the extent Chacko seeks to supplement the record with evidence not presented at the bench trial, we decline to consider this evidence. <em>See Leibowitz v. Cornell Univ., </em>445 F.3d 586, 592 n. 4 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam); <em>Int\u2019l Bus. Mach. Corp. v. Edelstein, </em>526 F.2d 37, 45 (2d Cir.1975) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">We have considered all of Chacko\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A_Q\">. We previously held that Chacko\u2019s appeal was timely filed. <em>See Chacko v. Dynair Servs., Inc., </em>115 Fed.Appx. 477 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b137-9\">. The allusion to discrimination in Chacko's December 19, 1990 letter to George Hogan, which neither Chacko nor his trial counsel has invoked as a basis for his retaliation claim, does not alter this conclusion. The only challenged action DynAir took subsequent to this letter was to alert Chacko that \"[djuring the past five months [he has] missed an excessive amount of time\u201d and direct him to improve his attendance. Applying the standard articulated by the Supreme Court during the pendency of this appeal, we find that under the circumstances this action would not \"have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White. </em>548 U.S. 53, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 2415, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
