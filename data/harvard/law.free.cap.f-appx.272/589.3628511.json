We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We grant in part and deny in part the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-26\">An intervening change in the law requires us to remand on the issue of continuous physical presence. In <em>Ibarra-Flores, </em>we held that administrative voluntary departure under threat of deportation breaks the accrual of continuous physical presence only where the alien is informed of the terms of the departure and knowingly and voluntarily accepts them. <em>See Ibarra-Flores v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 614, 619 (9th Cir.2006); <em>see also Tapia v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 997, 1004 (9th Cir.2005). Because there is no indication that Gutierrez Escobar was informed of the terms of his de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>parture or that he accepted them knowingly and voluntarily, we remand for further proceedings consistent with <em>Ibarra-Flores.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">We review constitutional claims de novo. <em>See Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001). Gutierrez-Escobar\u2019s contention that the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act\u2019s repeal of suspension of deportation violates equal protection or due process is unpersuasive. <em>See id. </em>at 517. (\u201cLine-drawing decisions made by Congress or the President in the context of immigration must be upheld if they are rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.\u201d); <em>see also Jimenez-Angeles v. Ashcroft, </em>291 F.3d 594, 599 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that the court lacks jurisdiction over challenges to the agency\u2019s timing of initiation of proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED in part; DENIED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b613-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
