For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-26\">Tandadjaja, a native and citizen of Indonesia, entered the United States on April 8, 2000, as a non-immigrant visitor and was authorized to remain temporarily within the United States until December 7, 2000. On March 22, 2003, Petitioner was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>issued a Notice to Appear, which alleged that he was in the country without authorization. In response, Tandadjaja conceded that he was removable and applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">In denying his claims on September 12, 2005, the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) concluded that Tandadjaja\u2019s asylum application was untimely. The IJ further found that Tandadjaja had not satisfied the requirements for withholding of removal pursuant to \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A) or under the CAT. On March 26, 2007, the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and dismissed Tandadjaja\u2019s appeal. Tandadjaja petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Initially, Tandadjaja argues that the BIA\u2019s failure to analyze and the IJ\u2019s failure to consider an expert witness\u2019s affidavit violated his right to due process. Due process requires a \u201cfull and fair hearing\u201d with a \u201creasonable opportunity to present evidence.\u201d <em>Jarbough v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>483 F.3d 184, 192 (3d Cir.2007). \u201c[T]he question for due process purposes is not whether the BIA reached the <em>correct </em>decision; rather, it is simply whether the Board made an individualized determination of [Tandadjaja\u2019s] interests.\u201d <em>Abdulai v. Ashcroft, </em>239 F.3d 542, 550 (3d Cir.2001) (emphasis in original). Furthermore, to prevail on his due process claim, Tandadjaja must show substantial prejudice. <em>Jarbough, </em>483 F.3d at 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Upon review of the record, we find no due process violation. Both the decisions of the IJ and the BIA indicate that Tandadjaja\u2019s expert witness\u2019s affidavit was considered. Although the IJ did not specifically cite the affidavit in the body of the decision, the IJ listed the affidavit among the evidence considered. Furthermore, the BIA specifically stated that it considered the affidavit on appeal. Because the BIA\u2019s opinion evidences its consideration of the individualized circumstances of Tan-dadjaja\u2019s appeal, we conclude that no due process violation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">Next, Tandadjaja argues that the BIA and the IJ erred in concluding that he failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. Because the BIA adopted a portion of the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ. <em>See Shehu v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>482 F.3d 652, 657 (3d Cir.2007). We will sustain their determinations if they are supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>Id. </em>Under the substantial evidence standard, we will uphold the determinations of the BIA and the IJ \u201cunless the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Zubeda v. Ashcroft, </em>333 F.3d 463, 471 (3d Cir.2003) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">In order to establish that he is entitled to withholding of removal, Tandadjaja must demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he will be subject to persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion if he returned to Indonesia. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). Tandadjaja concedes that he has not suffered past persecution. Accordingly, Tan-dadjaja must demonstrate a \u201cclear probability\u201d that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Wang v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 134, 139 (3d Cir.2005); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). \u201cTo establish a well-founded fear of future persecution an applicant must first demonstrate a subjective fear of persecution through credible testimony that [his] fear is genuine. Second, the applicant must show, objectively, that \u2018a reasonable person in the alien\u2019s circumstances would fear persecution if returned to the country in question.\u2019 To satisfy the objective prong, a petitioner must show [he] would be individually sin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>gled out for persecution or demonstrate that \u2018there is a pattern or practice in his or her country of nationality ... of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lie v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 530, 536 (3d Cir.2005) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The BIA and the IJ concluded that Tandadjaja failed to demonstrate a pattern or practice of persecution of ethnic Chinese in Indonesia. The BIA relied, in part, on the United States Department of State Country Reports for 2003, which state that the government of Indonesia officially promotes ethnic and racial tolerance. Although Tandadjaja submitted an affidavit from an expert witness that indicated the situation in Indonesia remained dire for Chinese nationals, the BIA and the IJ acted within their discretion in giving greater weight to the State Department\u2019s own assessments of the situation. <em>See Ambartsoumian v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 85, 89 (3d Cir.2004) (holding that \u201cState Department reports may constitute \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 for the purposes of reviewing immigration decisions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Given the deferential standard of review that governs, we will not disturb the decisions of the BIA and the IJ.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we will deny Tandadjaja\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-5\">. Tandadjaja does not allege any incidents or likelihood of torture, and, thus, cannot meet the criteria for relief under the CAT. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
