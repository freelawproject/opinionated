To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence [s]he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 488-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Johnson fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that she seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">Additionally, we uphold the denial of Johnson\u2019s request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3) [2000].\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because Johnson fails to show that she is eligible for asylum, she cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">We also find that substantial evidence supports the finding that Johnson fails to meet the standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2007). We find that Johnson failed to make the requisite showing before the immigration court.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">Finally, Johnson claims that errors in transcription and translation violated her right to a full and fair hearing under the Due Process Clause. As Johnson fails to establish that her rights were \u201ctransgressed in such a way as is likely to impact the results of the proceeding,\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 320-21 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Jacinto v. INS, </em>208 F.3d 725, 728 (9th Cir.2000)), we find that she is not entitled to relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-14\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-15\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
