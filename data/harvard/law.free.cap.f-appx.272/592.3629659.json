Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073, 1084-85 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc), that the sentence it imposed would not have been materially different had it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>known that the Sentencing Guidelines were advisory. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Labuff contends that, upon remand, the district court failed to properly analyze the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a), and that his sentence is unreasonable. We conclude that his sentence is reasonable because the record indicates that the district court \u201cproperly understood the full scope of [its] discretion in a <em>post-Booker </em>world.\u201d <em>United States v. Combs, </em>470 F.3d 1294, 1296-97 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Labuff also contends that, at sentencing, the district court abused its discretion by imposing his sentence to run consecutively to a prior undischarged sentence without adequately considering the factors set forth in Application Note 3(A) to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c). We conclude that the district court adequately considered those factors and justified the sentence as a whole with reference to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Fifield, </em>432 F.3d 1056, 1063-66 (9th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Perez-Perez, </em>512 F.3d 514, 516-17 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b616-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
