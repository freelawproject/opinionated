In his motion to reopen, petitioner renewed his argument that his qualifying relatives would experience the requisite hardship, but failed to present new evidence of hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-23\">The evidence that petitioner presented with his motion to reopen concerned the same basic hardship grounds as his application for cancellation of removal, and we therefore lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that the evidence was insufficient to establish a pri-ma facie case of hardship. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 601-03 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b586-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
