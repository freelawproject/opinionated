On April 15, 2005, petitioner was convicted in the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County, Pennsylvania, of possession of cocaine with intent to deliver, delivery of a controlled substance, and conspiracy to commit possession with intent to deliver cocaine. He was sentenced to a term of two to four years imprisonment. Severino was there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>after issued a Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) on March 14, 2006, charging him with being removable pursuant to INA \u00a7 287(a)(2)(A)(iii) and (B)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) and (B)(i), for having been convicted of aggravated felonies and controlled substance violations. At a hearing on June 7, 2006, Severino, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>conceded the factual allegations contained in the NTA. Based on these admissions, the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) sustained the charges and ordered Severi-no removed to the Dominican Republic. Although Severino reserved his appellate rights, no appeal was ever filed and the order of removal became final on July 7, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Severino returned to the Immigration Court on November 13, 2006, with the filing of a counseled motion seeking to reopen his removal proceedings. In that \u25a0motion, Severino argued that his state convictions did not qualify as drug trafficking aggravated felonies, and that the IJ should have notified him of his right to proceed with the assistance of counsel and to seek the cancellation of removal under INA \u00a7 240A, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b. In a Decision and Order issued on November 15, 2006, the IJ denied Severino\u2019s reopen motion. The IJ concluded that Severino had been advised of his right to proceed with counsel of his choice and that, given the untimeliness of the motion and Severino\u2019s failure to show any exceptional circumstances warranting the reopening of proceedings, there was no need to address Severino\u2019s contention that his drug convictions do not constitute aggravated felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Severino sought review of this decision. The Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) dismissed the appeal in an Order dated January 26, 2007, 2007 WL 416802. The BIA concluded that Severino\u2019s reopen motion was properly denied as untimely insofar as it was not filed within 90 days after the entry of the final administrative order of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1). While recognizing that an IJ has limited discretionary power to reopen proceedings <em>sua spoute </em>after the expiration of the relevant filing deadlines, the BIA noted that such action is only warranted upon a showing of exceptional circumstances and that Severino had not shown any such exceptional circumstances. This timely petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Initially, we note that our review extends only to the BIA\u2019s order denying Severino\u2019s motion to reopen; his claims that he is not subject to removal as an aggravated felon are not properly before us. Aside from the fact that Severino failed to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to the IJ\u2019s Decision of June 7, 2006, his current petition for review was filed more than eight months after the issuance of that order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) and(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">While Congress has explicitly granted federal courts the power to review \u201cany final order of removal\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), and implicit in this jurisdictional grant is the authority to review the denial of a motion to reopen any such final order, <em>see Cruz v. Attorney General of U.S., </em>452 F.3d 240, 246 (3d Cir.2006), there are certain situations in which the jurisdiction-stripping provisions of \u00a7 1252(a)(2) limit or eliminate our jurisdiction to review such denials. \u201c[I]f an alien is removable for having committed one of the offenses enumerated in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), we lack jurisdiction to review a denial of a motion to reopen, except to the extent that it raises constitutional claims or questions of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C)-(D).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246-247 (3d Cir.2006), <em>citing McAl-lister v. Attorney General, </em>444 F.3d 178, 183 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">As respondent correctly notes, there is no dispute that Severino is an alien and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>there can be no doubt that his controlled substance convictions qualify as criminal offenses under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B), bringing his violations within the ambit of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jurisdiction-stripping provision in \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), thus precludes our review of the denial of the motion to reopen unless Severino has raised an issue of law or a constitutional claim. Neither appears present in the instant case as Severino fails to challenge the BIA\u2019s untimeliness ruling in any respect and, instead, limits his statement of the issue presented to whether the IJ erred in his initial finding that petitioner\u2019s criminal convictions constituted aggravated felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Moreover, \u201c[wjhere \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) applies, factual or discretionary determinations fall outside the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals entertaining petitions for review.\u201d <em>Cruz, </em>452 F.3d at 247, <em>citing Sukwanputra v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d 627, 634 (3d Cir.2006). The BIA noted the IJ\u2019s discretion to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen proceedings even after the expiration of the relevant filing deadlines, <em>see </em>BIA\u2019s Order of 1/26/07 at 1, <em>citing In re J-J-, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997), but nevertheless declined to direct that the removal proceedings be reopened in an exercise of that discretion. As we have held on previous occasions, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to reopen <em>sua sponte </em>because that decision is confined to the unfettered discretion of the BIA. <em>See Calle-Vujiles v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 472, 475 (3d Cir.2003) (\u201cBecause the BIA retains unfettered discretion to decline to sua sponte reopen or reconsider a deportation proceeding, this court is without jurisdiction to review a decision declining to exercise such discretion to reopen or reconsider the case.\u201d); <em>see also Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>469 F.3d 51, 53 (1st Cir.2006) (noting that \u201cthe BIA and the IJ had plenary discretion to determine whether to grant the [ ] motion to reopen sua sponte, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(a) (defining BIA\u2019s authority to reopen); 1003.23(b) (defining IJ\u2019s authority)\u201d and, thus, \u201c[b]y its very nature, [ ] denial of such discretionary relief is unreviewable.\u201d); <em>Enriquez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 246, 250 (5th Cir. 2004) (court of appeals lacks jurisdiction \u201cto consider whether the [BIA] should have compelled the [IJ] to reopen a case based on the IJ\u2019s sua sponte authority.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">Accordingly, the petition for review is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-5\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law ..., and except as provided in subpara-graph (D), no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section 212(a)(2) [1182] or 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D) [1227].... INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), in turn, describes as de-portable for having committed a controlled substance violation:</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">Any alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of a violation of (or a conspiracy or attempt to violate) any law or regulation of a State, the United States, or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of Title 21), other than a single offense involving possession for one\u2019s own use of 30 grams or less of marijuana [].</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
