Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Rice v. Maryland, </em>No. 8:07-cv-03294-RWT (D.Md. Jan. 3, 2008). We dispense with oral argument beeaus\u00e9 the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-12\"> Generally, dismissals without prejudice are interlocutory and not appealable. <em>Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union 392, </em>10 F.3d 1064, 1066 (4th Cir.1993). However, a dismissal without prejudice could be final if no amendment to the complaint could cure the defect in the plaintiff's case. <em>Id. </em>at 1066-67. We conclude that the defects in this case can only be cured by something more than an amendment to the complaint and that the order is therefore appealable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
