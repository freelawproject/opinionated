We have reviewed the administrative record and find no abuse of discretion in the Board\u2019s order. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2007) (standard of review); <em>Jean v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 475, 481, 482-83 (4th Cir.2006) (same). We therefore deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In Re: Essong Engoulou, </em>No. A98-317-657 (B.I.A. June 18, 2007). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-20\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
