June 20, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">When the agency denies a motion to reopen, this Court reviews the BIA\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Ni\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See Kaur, </em>413 F.3d at 233-34. The BIA accurately noted that, whereas a timely motion to reopen would have been due in June 2004, Ni did not file his motion until January 2007, well beyond the 90-day filing deadline. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). .</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">Further, the BIA properly found that Ni failed to establish that his due process rights were violated by his prior attorneys\u2019 conduct. Ni contends that his prior counsel was ineffective because he failed to include his forced sterilization claim in his asylum application, and because he provided an interpreter for a medical ex\u00e1mination who refused to translate to the physician the details of that claim. Ni asserts that, if not for these \u201cerrors,\u201d there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the result of his proceedings would have been different \u2014 i.e., that the IJ would not have made an adverse credibility finding. However, the BIA appropriately observed that, even assuming that Ni\u2019s prior counsel was responsible for the omission and interpreter problems, the IJ found Ni\u2019s testimony not credible based on several other grounds. For instance, apart from the omission of the forced sterilization and the translation issue, the IJ found that the omission from Ni\u2019s application of his detention and his wife\u2019s intrauterine device insertion undermined his credibility. Likewise, the IJ emphasized that, in contrast to his assertions in his written application, Ni failed to testify about the problems he experienced in China due to his alleged participation in the June 4th student democracy movement. Moreover, the IJ found Ni\u2019s testimony internally inconsistent with respect to where the sterilization occurred. Contrary to Ni\u2019s assertion that the IJ placed \u201cgreat importance\u201d on his attorney\u2019s alleged errors, the IJ found that the remaining findings were \u201cmore important reasons\u201d why he \u201cabsolutely\u201d did not believe Ni\u2019s testimony. That adverse credibility finding was affirmed by the BIA in its 2004 order, and we denied Ni\u2019s petition for review of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-12\">Given that Ni failed to overcome the adverse credibility finding below, he was unable to demonstrate that his prior counsel\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness prejudiced his claim. <em>See e.g., Esposito v. INS, </em>987 F.2d 108, 111 (2d Cir.1993). Thus, the BIA properly denied Ni\u2019s motion and provided adequate reasoning for doing so. <em>See Ke Zhen Zhao, </em>265 F.3d at 93. We therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>decline to reach the BIA\u2019s additional finding concerning whether Ni exercised due diligence during the period he sought to toll.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
