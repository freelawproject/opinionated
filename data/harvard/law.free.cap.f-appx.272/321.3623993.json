Daniels, Jr. On September 23, 2005, Officer Castro of the Dallas police force made a call for back-up from a drug arrest, requesting \u201cCode 1\u201d non-emergency cover. Officer Wolverton responded, and as he was speeding through an intersection around 8:00 PM, he swerved around a stopped car and hit Daniels, a pedestrian. Daniels sustained fatal injuries, and his family sued under \u00a7 1983 for violation of the Fourteenth Amendment right to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-18\">The central dispute is whether the district court, in dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 claims with prejudice and granting Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion, used the proper standard for actions that \u201cshock the conscience\u201d and are a constitutional violation under <em>County of Sacramento v. Lewis.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We need not cabin this case into the narrow distinctions among high-speed chases and other responses to emergencies and non-emergencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>It matters not here whether we apply an intent-to-harm standard for chases or a lower standard of deliberate indifference; Wolverton\u2019s actions do not fall within the ambit of either. This is a case that, although tragic, involves negligence or even gross negligence but not deliberate indifference <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; under a substantive due process inquiry, ordinary tort liability does not obtain. As the Seventh Circuit held under a deliberate indifference inquiry in <em>Hill v. Shobe,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">The fact that a public official committed a common law tort with tragic results fails to rise to the level of a violation of substantive due process .... motor vehicle accidents caused by public officials or employees do not rise to the threshold of a constitutional violation actionable under \u00a7 1983, absent a showing that the official knew an accident was imminent but consciously and culpably refused to prevent it. It is insufficient to show that a public official acted in the face of a recognizable but generic risk to the public at large.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In an unpublished opinion in <em>Smith v. Walden, </em>we similarly affirmed a deliberate indifference holding in the police context. The district court held that a police officer who was speeding without lights or a siren in response to a non-emergency call and killed an innocent passenger did not act with \u201cthe level of arbitrary or intentional conduct that shocks the conscience in the constitutional sense.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A7U\">We find no facts in the pleadings or the record, viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, showing that Wolverton acted with the recklessness required for deliberate indifference.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nor do we find error in the district court\u2019s treatment of Plaintiffs\u2019 facts and pleadings. No matter how favorably a court treats the Plaintiffs\u2019 facts and pleadings, they do not demonstrate the requisite factors for deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-13\">Finally, Plaintiffs assert that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for the City. Plaintiffs claim that the City could still be liable if Wolverton\u2019s actions did not violate Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights and that the court erred in concluding <em>ipso facto </em>that without a constitutional violation by Wolverton, the City could not be liable. We are not persuaded. In <em>City of Canton v. Harris, </em>the Court asked \u201cwhether there was a direct causal link between a municipal policy or custom and the alleged constitutional deprivation.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, </em>the Court held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>original language of \u00a7 1983 \u201cimposes liability on a government that, under color of some official policy, \u2018causes\u2019 an employee to violate another\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While the officer here exceeded the posted speed limit, proceeding at a speed of approximately 60 miles per hour, perhaps 57 or 58 miles per hour, he did not act, as we have concluded, with a level of recklessness that was a breach of a constitutional duty. Any link between a city policy as to the speed at which an officer may respond to non-emergency calls and this accident cannot perforce constitute a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
