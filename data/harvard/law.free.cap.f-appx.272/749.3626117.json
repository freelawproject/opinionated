Background</p>\n<p id=\"AvQb\">Maytubby was charged in an eleven-count indictment on a variety of drug trafficking and firearm offenses. He filed a motion to suppress evidence gathered in two separate searches of his home, which occurred on July 6, 2005, and October 17, 2004, and a search of his vehicle. The district court denied the motion as to the October 17 search and the search of the vehide&gt; It the motiori; howevei. tQ suppresg evidence seized in the July 6 search, concluding the search was conducted in violation of the Fourth Amendment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>Counts nine, ten, and eleven of the indictment related to the events of July 6. Count nine charged Maytubby with possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, cocaine, and marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Counts ten and eleven charged firearms violations under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(3), 924(c)(l)(C)(I). After the evidence was suppressed, counts nine, ten and eleven were dismissed. A jury convicted Maytubby on the eight remaining charges.</p>\n<p id=\"AfAz\">The presentence report (PSR) included in its Sentencing Guidelines calculations the drug quantities seized in the July 6 search, which were suppressed by the district court at trial. Maytubby objected to the inclusion of the July 6 quantities in his sentencing memorandum and at his sen- , . , . ,. , . , , tencmg hearing. The district court over- , , ,. , . <em>, </em>, . . , , ruled his objection, determining, based on Un<em>ited States v. Ryan, </em>236 F.3d 1268, 1272 (10th Cir.2001), that evidence suppressed at trial may be considered by the sentencing court. Maytubby filed a notice of apPeab</p>\n<p id=\"A3H0\">TT . . II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"ALp2\">On appeal, Maytubby asks this court to reverse his sentence based on a miscalculation of the Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Todd, </em>515 F.3d 1128, 1135 (10th Cir.2008) (\u201cWhen a district court does err in calculating the applicable Guidelines range, we must remand for re-sentencing....\u201d). Specifically, he argues the district court erred in including the suppressed drug quantities from the July 6 search in its calculation of the Guidelines range. He claims the dictionary definition of the word \u201csuppress\u201d demonstrates that suppressed evidence no longer legally exists and cannot be considered by the court under any circumstances. When consider-mg the calculation of a Guidelines range, this court reviews legal questions, such as the one presented here, de novo. <em>United States v. Tom, </em>494 F.3d 1277, 1281 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"arv-dedup-0\">In <em>United States v. Ryan, </em>this court held a district court does not err in relying on evidence obtained during an illegal search during sentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 236 F.3d at 1272. Maytubby acknowledges the holding in <em>Ryan </em>is directly on point in this case&gt; but argues that this court can disre8'ard that holdinS because <em>RVan </em>did not address the denary definition of the word \u201csuppress.\u201d This argument is with-\u00b07ut meA \u201cUnder the doctrine of <em>stare dm </em>tdls Pa?el cann\u00b0\u00ed ovfton the de,; cisi\u00f3n ot another panel of this court.\" <em>United States v. Meyers, </em>200 F.3d 715, 720 (10th Cir.2000). Absent <em>en banc </em>reeonsid- ,. ,. 0 \u201e eration or superseding Supreme Court authis court is bound b our ior precedent Id.; <em>see also United States v. VanDam, </em>493 F.3d 1194, 1198 n. 2 (10th Cir.2007) (holding the panel could not overrule <em>Ryan </em>absent <em>en banc </em>reconsidera- .. tion or supeivenmg Supreme Court precedent). Accordingly, we apply <em>Ryan </em>and hold the district court did not err when it considered previously suppressed drug quantities in calculating the applicable Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"AyGr\">For the foregoing reasons, this court AFFIRMS the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AYe\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AA3\">. There is an exception to this rule when there is evidence the officers' illegal conduct was undertaken with the intent to secure an increased sentence. <em>United States v. Ryan, </em>236 F.3d at 1272. Maytubby, however, does not argue the officers conducting the July 6 search intended to increase his sentence,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
