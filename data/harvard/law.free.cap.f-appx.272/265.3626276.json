R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion. Because that motion directly attacked his conviction, the district court was without jurisdiction to consider the motion, which was, in essence, a successive and unauthorized 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) petition. <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 206 (4th Cir. 2003)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-24\">The district court\u2019s order is not appeal-able unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000); <em>Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 369 (4th Cir.2004). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dispos-itive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Owens has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Additionally, we construe Owens\u2019 notice of appeal and informal brief as an application to file a second or successive petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir. 2003). In order to obtain authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2254 petition, a prisoner must assert claims based on either: (1) a new rule of constitutional law, previously unavailable, made retroactive by the Supreme Court to cases on collateral review; or (2) newly discovered evidence, not previously discoverable by due diligence, that would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty of the offense. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2) (2000). Owens\u2019 claims do not satisfy either of these criteria. Therefore, we deny authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
