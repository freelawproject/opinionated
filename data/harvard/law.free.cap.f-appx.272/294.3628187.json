We lack jurisdiction to review this determination pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). <em>Niang v. Gonzales, </em>492 F.3d 505, 510 n. 5 (4th Cir.2007); <em>see Almuhtaseb v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 743, 747-18 (6th Cir.2006) (collecting cases). Traore\u2019s due process challenge we find to be merely an attack on the immigration judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence and factual findings, and therefore not within the jurisdictional exception of 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (West 2005 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2007). Given the jurisdictional bar, we cannot review the underlying merits of Traore\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Traore also contends that the Board and the immigration judge erred in denying her request for withholding of removal. \u201c[A]n alien asserting a claim for withholding of removal on persecution grounds must show that it is more likely than not that her life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal because of her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Niang, </em>492 F.3d at 510 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Based on our review of the record, we hold that Traore failed to make the requisite showing before the immigration court. We therefore uphold the denial of her request for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">We also find that substantial evidence supports the denial of relief under the Convention Against Torture. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2007). We find that Traore failed to sustain her burden of proof before the immigration court</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
