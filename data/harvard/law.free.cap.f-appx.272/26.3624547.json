Mar. 26, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 718 140 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, Oct. 17, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-21\">Where, as here, the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, this Court reviews both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions\u2014 or more precisely, the Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number><em>on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc). However, the Court will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">As an initial matter, contrary to the government\u2019s argument, we have jurisdiction to review Lin\u2019s challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of relief under the CAT. Lin\u2019s failure to exhaust this category of relief, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), is excused because, in its decision, the BIA specifically addressed Lin\u2019s CAT claim. <em>See Xian Tuan Ye v. DHS, </em>446 F.3d 289, 296-297 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Waldron v. INS, </em>17 F.3d 511, 515 n. 7 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">However, in addition to the statutory requirement that petitioners exhaust each category of relief, this Court generally will not consider arguments regarding individual issues that were not exhausted before the agency. <em>Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 107 n. 1, 122-123 (2d Cir.2007). While not jurisdictional, this judicially-imposed issue exhaustion requirement is mandatory. <em>Id. </em>at 119-120. In particular, a petitioner must challenge all findings that are dispositive of his claims, and the failure to do so is fatal to his petition for review. <em>See Steevenez v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 114, 117-118 (2d Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">In his appeal to the BIA, Lin failed to challenge any of the inconsistencies that formed the basis of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> His argument to the BIA regarding credibility, that the IJ should have given him \u201cthe benefit of the doubt,\u201d was not sufficient to exhaust the arguments he raises before this Court as to the IJ\u2019s individual inconsistency and implausibility findings. <em>See Steevenez, </em>476 F.3d at 117-118.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">Furthermore, while the BIA referred to the IJ\u2019s specific adverse credibility findings, its mere mention of those findings does not excuse Lin\u2019s failure to offer any meaningful challenge to those findings before the BIA. <em>Cf. Waldron, </em>17 F.3d at 515 n. 7; <em>Xian Tuan Ye, </em>446 F.3d at 296-297. Indeed, the BIA specifically noted in its decision that Lin did not \u201cspecifically address or provide a reasonable explanation for any of the inconsistencies\u201d relied upon by the IJ in her decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">Thus, because we find that Lin failed to exhaust any challenge to the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding, and because that finding was dispositive of each of Lin\u2019s applications for relief, <em>see Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77 (2d Cir.2005), we deny the petition for review, <em>see Steevenez, </em>476 F.3d at 117-118.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b52-7\">. We note that the Government has asserted exhaustion as an affirmative defense in this case. <em>See Lin Zhong, </em>480 F.3d at 124.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
