Lamb, denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Young Yun Chen, </em>No. A79 425 055 (B.I.A. Apr. 30, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A79 425 055 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 23, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-24\">After a hearing on the merits, the IJ denied Chen relief, finding him not credible. The BIA affirmed and Chen appealed to this Court. While Chen\u2019s appeal was pending, we issued our decision in <em>Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc), a decision fatal to his petition. In <em>Shi Liang Lin, </em>we held that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42), the statute on which Chen relies, does not apply to a spouse such as he, who has not \u201cdem\u00f3n-stratele!] \u2018other resistance to a coercive population control program\u2019 or \u2018a well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>founded fear that he ... will be ... subject to persecution for such ... resistance. .....494 F.3d at 314 (alterations in original) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)). We are obligated to apply this intervening precedent. <em>See, e.g., Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 723 (2d Cir.2007) (applying intervening precedent of <em>Shi Liang Lin </em>to petitioner\u2019s claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Chen argues that, in <em>Shi Liang Lin, </em>we \u201cdid not make any finding concerning whether a forced abortion of a person\u2019s unborn child could be a persecutory act,\u201d and if such an act constitutes persecution, \u201cthen the fact that this would occur during resistance to a coercive population control program would apply to male asylum applicants.\u201d Contrary to Chen\u2019s argument, in <em>Shi Liang Lin </em>we explicitly held that the definition of \u201crefugee\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42) does not extend automatically to partners (legally related or otherwise) of individuals who have been forcibly sterilized or forced to have an abortion. 494 F.3d at 314 (affirming, in part, <em>In re S-L-L-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1, 8-11 (B.I.A. 2006)). We also held in <em>Shi Liang Lin </em>that an alien may establish eligibility for asylum by demonstrating past persecution based on his or her own \u201cother resistance\u201d to a coercive population control program or a well-founded fear that he or she will be subjected to persecution for such \u201cresistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Chen fails to allege that he engaged in any resistance, he is unable to establish his eligibility for asylum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). Id.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Because Chen is unable to meet the standard for asylum, he is necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on his claim for withholding of removal, which rested on the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). Last, because Chen failed to challenge the denial of his CAT claim in his brief to this Court, we deem any such argument waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005) (stating that we consider waived and normally will not address issues that are not sufficiently argued in the briefs).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b54-8\">. Because Chen does not qualify for asylum as a matter of law, we need not address his challenge to the IJ's adverse credibility finding or his related claims that the IJ violated his due process rights and that the BIA engaged in improper fact-finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
