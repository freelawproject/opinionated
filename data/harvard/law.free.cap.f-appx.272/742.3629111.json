BALDOCK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b767-28\">Under former \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), a lawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>permanent resident (LPR) subject to removal could apply for a removal waiver if the basis of removal was analogous to a ground of inadmissibility under INA \u00a7 212(a). Petelo Falaniko sought such a waiver after he was charged with removal .as an aggravated felon, but an Immigration Judge (IJ) denied his application. The IJ found that Mr. Falaniko\u2019s status as an aggravated felon convicted of a crime of violence rendered him ineligible for relief because there was no analogous ground of inadmissibility under INA \u00a7 212(a). The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed. Mr. Falaniko now petitions this court for review, arguing that he is eligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver despite his status as an aggravated felon. We reject his arguments and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Mr. Falaniko is a native and citizen of Western Samoa. He entered this country in 1975 as an LPR but pleaded guilty in 1994 to the Utah crime of forcible sexual abuse. Mr. Falaniko\u2019s conviction prompted the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to initiate removal proceedings in 2003 under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), which authorizes removal of an alien convicted of an aggravated felony. Appearing before an IJ, Mr. Falaniko conceded the ch\u00e1rges but sought a waiver under former \u00a7 212(c) of the INA. When the IJ denied his application, Mr. Falaniko appealed to the BIA, arguing, among other things, that he was eligible for a waiver under <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), which held that Congress did not retroactively repeal \u00a7 212(c) to deny relief from otherwise eligible aliens. Mr. Falaniko argued that <em>St. Cyr </em>was dispositive because he was eligible and pleaded guilty before \u00a7 212(c) was' repealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">The BIA rejected Mr. Falaniko\u2019s argument. The BIA reasoned that notwithstanding <em>St. Cyr, </em>Mr. Falaniko remained ineligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver because the basis of his removal \u2014 his status as an aggravated felon convicted of a crime of violence \u2014 had no statutory counterpart under \u00a7 212(a) of the INA as required by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(f)(5). The BIA ruled that absent a statutory counterpart, Mr. Falan-iko was ineligible for relief under \u00a7 212(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">Mr. Falaniko subsequently petitioned this court for review, arguing that forcible sexual abuse has a statutory counterpart in \u00a7 212(a) as it is a crime of moral turpitude. He further argues that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(f)(5) violates <em>St. Cyr </em>because it retroactively attaches new disabilities to his plea agreement by imposing the statutory-counterpart requirement to qualify for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver. Lastly, he contends the BIA found him ineligible for a waiver because it analyzed the wrong definition of \u201caggravated felony.\u201d The government responds that the provision for crimes of moral turpitude under \u00a7 212(a) is not a statutory counterpart to the basis of Mr. Falaniko\u2019s removal; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(f)(5) does not violate <em>St. Cyr </em>because it merely codified existing law; and, in any event, we have no jurisdiction to consider the petition because it challenges a discretionary decision of the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">When the decision to grant or deny a removal waiver rests on an exercise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>discretion, we have no jurisdiction to review it. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii); <em>In re Edwards, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 191, 194-95 (BIA 1990). In this case, however, the denial of a removal waiver rested on the determination that Mr. Falaniko was not eligible for a waiver under \u00a7 212(c). This presents a question of law as to the applicability of \u00a7 212(c) and a constitutional claim of equal protection, both of which we review de novo. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Ferry v. Gonzales, </em>457 F.3d 1117, 1126 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">We begin by examining the evolution of waivers under the INA. Historically, the government could expel LPRs from this country in one of two ways: removal after entry, INA \u00a7 237 (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227), or exclusion upon reentry, INA \u00a7 212(a) (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)). <em>Zamora-Mallari v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 679, 683 (7th Cir.2008). The nature of the proceeding dictated the type of waiver available: LPRs facing removal could apply only for a removal waiver under INA \u00a7 244, while inadmissible LPRs could apply only for a waiver of inadmissibility under \u00a7 212(c). This seemingly simple scheme sometimes created anomalous results, however, for if after temporarily leaving the United States an LPR returned and was not immediately placed in inadmissibility proceedings, he or she could apply only for a \u00a7 244 waiver when the government later initiated removal proceedings. But because \u00a7 212(c) waivers were easier to obtain, <em>see Blake v. Carbone, </em>489 F.3d 88, 94 (2nd Cir.2007), and were granted in more than half the cases in which they were sought, <em>Hem v. Maurer, </em>458 F.3d 1185, 1188 (10th Cir. 2006), these LPRs insisted they remained eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">To remedy the problem, the agency extended \u00a7 212(c) inadmissibility waivers to LPRs who had temporarily gone abroad but were readmitted and subsequently faced removal. <em>See In re GA-, </em>7 I. &amp; N. Dec. 274 (BIA 1956). And to correct the resultant equal-protection violation caused to LPRs who had never temporarily departed, courts and the agency further extended \u00a7 212(c) relief to certain LPRs facing removal who did not depart. <em>See Francis v. INS, </em>532 F.2d 268, 271-73 (2nd Cir.1976); <em>In re Silva, </em>16 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 26, 30 (BIA 1976). We approved this approach. <em>See Vissian v. INS, </em>548 F.2d 325, 328 n. 3, 330 (10th Cir.1977) (noting BIA\u2019s changed position that a \u00a7 212(c) waiver of inadmissibility \u201cmay be granted to a permanent resident alien in a deportation proceeding regardless of whether he departs the United States following the act or acts which render him deportable,\u201d and recognizing that IJ\u2019s contrary conclusion was \u201capparently erroneous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">The catch, however, is that \u201cnot every act that renders someone [removable] makes him [inadmissible], and vice versa.\u201d <em>Zamora-Mallari, </em>514 F.3d at 683. Thus, to ensure that an LPR subject to removal was similarly situated to an inadmissible LPR, the agency required that there be \u201ca comparable ground\u201d for removal and inadmissibility \u2014 that is, LPRs in removal proceedings could apply for a waiver under \u00a7 212(c) only if them basis for removal under \u00a7 237 was also a basis for inadmissibility under \u00a7 212(a). <em>See Leal-Rodriguez v. I.N.S., </em>990 F.2d 939, 949 (7th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">Eventually, after twice restricting aggravated felons from \u00a7 212(c) relief, Congress repealed \u00a7 212(e) altogether, <em>see </em>Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-597 (1996). The Supreme Court in <em>St. Cyr, </em>however, ruled that IIRIRA did not apply retroactively to deny aliens relief under \u00a7 212(c) when they otherwise would have been eligible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>for relief at the time they pleaded guilty to the removable offense. 533 U.S. at 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271. <em>St. Cyr </em>thus reinstated the agency\u2019s comparable-grounds analysis to discern whether LPRs who pleaded guilty before Congress repealed \u00a7 212(c) were otherwise eligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">To ameliorate the complexity created by these administrative decisions, court cases, and Congressional actions, the agency promulgated 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(f)(5). That regulation provides that an LPR is not eligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver if he or she is removable \u201con a ground which does not have a statutory counterpart in section 212 of the Act.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(f)(5). This \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d analysis replaced the agency\u2019s longstanding comparable-grounds analysis and remains the test used to ensure that removable aliens who seek relief under \u00a7 212(c) are eligible for a waiver. It is against this backdrop that we proceed to consider Mr. Falaniko\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">1. Statutory Counterpart Analysis: Basis of Removal vs. Underlying Offense</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Initially, Mr. Falaniko challenges the BIA\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 212(a) contains no statutory counterpart to the basis of his removal. He argues that his underlying crime, forcible sexual abuse, is a crime of moral turpitude, which is a basis of inadmissibility under \u00a7 212(a), <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">Several Courts of Appeals have rejected similar attempts to characterize a particular underlying offense as a crime of moral turpitude to satisfy the statutory-counterpart test. <em>See, e.g., Kim v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 58, 62-63 (1st Cir.2006); <em>Caroleo v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 158, 168 (3rd Cir.2007); <em>Avilez-Granados v. Gonzales, </em>481 F.3d 869, 872 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Zamora-Mallari, </em>514 F.3d at 691-93; <em>Vue v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 858, 863 (8th Cir.2007). The Ninth Circuit first forged the analytical trail followed by these courts, <em>see Komarenko v. INS, </em>35 F.3d 432, 435 (9th Cir.1994), but it recently has signaled a potential shift in its approach, <em>see Abebe v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 1092, 1104-05 (9th Cir.2007) (reaffirming <em>Komarenko), pet. for reh\u2019g en banc granted sub nom. Abebe v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 909 (9th Cir.2008). Only in the Second Circuit may an LPR assert that his underlying offense constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude for purposes of statutory-counterpart analysis. <em>See Blake, </em>489 F.3d at 103-05 (remanding cases to BIA to determine whether offenses constitute crimes of moral turpitude under \u00a7 212(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">The rift between the Second Circuit and these other circuits emanates from whether the statutory ground of removal or the underlying criminal offense should be compared to INA \u00a7 212(a) for purposes of statutory-counterpart analysis. The Second Circuit looks to the underlying criminal offense, while the rest examine the statutory ground of removal. The choice can have great implications in situations such as this, where the basis for removal\u2014 one\u2019s status as an aggravated felon convicted of a crime of violence \u2014 is not analogous to the basis of inadmissibility for having committed a crime involving moral turpitude, but the underlying offense constituting the aggravated felony, here\u2014 forcible sexual abuse, could qualify as a crime involving moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">The Third Circuit took up the question in <em>Caroleo, </em>where an LPR had pleaded guilty to multiple offenses, including attempted murder. 476 F.3d at 160. Charged with removal for having committed an aggravated-felony crime of violence, the LPR sought a \u00a7 212(c) waiver, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>arguing that attempted murder is a crime involving moral turpitude, which is a ground of inadmissibility under \u00a7 212(a). <em>See id. </em>at 164. Rejecting the argument, the court explained that \u00a7 237 \u201clists the grounds upon which the Attorney General may order an alien removed\u201d if the alien\u2019s underlying criminal conviction falls into one of the statutory grounds. <em>Id. </em>The court distinguished this preliminary analysis used to determine the LPR\u2019s removability, i.e., whether the underlying crime constituted an enumerated ground of removal under \u00a7 237, from a secondary analysis used to determine whether the particular statutory ground of removal had a corresponding ground of inadmissibility under \u00a7 212(a). <em>See id. </em>Because the LPR\u2019s underlying crime \u2014 attempted murder-was an aggravated-felony crime of violence, the court found the crime \u201cplay[ed] no role in\u201d determining whether the basis for his removal had a statutory counterpart for inadmissibility under \u00a7 212(a). <em>Id. </em>at 168. Instead, the court held that \u201c[o]nce the government has categorized [the] offense as a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 in removal proceedings, and that categorization has been upheld, [the] \u00a7 212(c) inquiry focuses on whether <em>this statutory ground </em>for removal is substantially equivalent to any of the grounds for [inadmissibility]\u201d under \u00a7 212(a). <em>Id. </em>The court thus looked to whether the LPR\u2019s ground for removal \u2014 his status as an aggravated felon convicted of a crime of violence \u2014 was the statutory counterpart to \u00a7 212(a)\u2019s ground of inadmissibility for crimes of moral turpitude. <em>Id. </em>Under this analysis, the court found it clearly was n\u00b0f- <em>dd.</em></p>\n<p id=\"a4d-dedup-0\">By contrast, the Second Circuit in <em>Blake </em>focused on the underlying criminal offense, holding that eligibility for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver turns on whether an LPR\u2019s particular offense <em>\u201ccould </em>form the basis of a ground of [inadmissibility].\u201d 489 F.3d at 104 (emphasis added). Like the other circuits, the Second Circuit rejected the broad proposition that aggravated felonies are per se crimes of moral turpitude and vice versa, But believing itself bound by precedent to \u201cexamine the circumstances of the [removable] alien, rather than the language Congress used to classify his or her status,\u201d the court declined to simply compare the statutory grounds of removal to the statutory grounds of inadmissibility. <em>Id, </em>Instead, the court concluded that \u201c[i]f the offense that renders a lawful permanent resident [removable] would render a similarly situated lawful permanent resident [inadmissible], the [removable] lawful permanent resident is eligible for a waiver of [removal] \u201d <em>Id </em>at 103</p>\n<p id=\"As4\">The Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Blake </em>is rooted m its earlier equal-protection case, <em>Francis\u2019 </em>532 R2d 268\u2019 where oan LPR subject t removal was denied eligibility f\u00b0r a \u00a7 212(c) waiver because he had never temporarily departed the United States, pbe com\u2019i found an equal-protection violation because other similarly situated LPRs in removal proceedings were deemed eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief by virtue of the fact teat they previously had left the country but were not immediately placed in inadmissibility proceedings when they reentered. The <em>Francis </em>court found the LPR\u2019s failure to temporarily depart the United States an \u201cirrelevant and fortuitous factor[ ]\u201d to his eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief, <em>id- </em>at 273, and thus required that eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) waivers be extended to non-departing LPRs in removal proceedings,</p>\n<p id=\"AJU\">Attempting to adhere to <em>Francis\u2019s </em>mandate that \u201cpermanent resident aliens who are in like circumstances, but for irrelevant and fortuitous factors, be treated in a like manner,\u201d <em>id., </em>the Second Circuit in <em>Blake </em>concluded that \u201cwhat makes one alien similarly situated to another is his or her act or offense, which is captured in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>INA as either a ground of [removal] or ground of [inadmissibility],\u201d 489 F.3d at 104. But by focusing on the underlying offense, the court neglected the varying circumstances that render LPRs removable versus inadmissible under the INA and thereby omitted from its analysis any mechanism to ensure that removable LPRs are similarly situated to inadmissible LPRs. Indeed, it is precisely because Congress delineated different grounds for removal and inadmissibility that LPRs in removal proceedings are not similarly situated to LPRs in inadmissibility proceedings unless the statutory basis for removal is substantially equivalent to a statutory basis for inadmissibility. <em>Valere v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 757, 762 (7th Cir.2007). ., ,, , Absent this congruity, there can be no . , .... mi \u2022 i i equal-protection violation. This has always been the reason for requiring a statutory counterpart:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWb\">Generally, when courts have found an equal protection violation, the exeluda-bility and deportation provisions have been substantially identical. That way, the only distinction between the two classes of persons the statute created was that one class of individuals had traveled abroad and returned, and the other had not. It is this arbitrary distinction that violates equal protection, In the instant case, the provisions are entirely dissimilar, and the distinction between the two classes is not arbitrary or unreasonable. For this reason, the linchpin of the equal protection analysis in this context is that the two provisions be \u201csubstantially identical.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3RP\"><em>Kornarenko, \u25a0 </em>35 F.3d at 435 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"A-R\">By comparing the statutory grounds of removal to the statutory grounds of inadmissibility, courts are assured that LPRs in removal proceedings are similarly situated to LPRs in inadmissibility proceedings when the two provisions are substantially equivalent. By contrast, comparing the underlying criminal offense does not ensure such congruity where, as here, the offense <em>could </em>be included among a broad category of inadmissible offenses, but need n\u00b0t be. We therefore agree with the First\u2019 Third- Fifth- Seventh\u2019 EiShth\u2019 and Ninth Circuits that the statutorily Prescribed basis of removal should be COmpared to tbe statutory ^\u00b0unds of in' admissibility for purposes of statutory , . t counterpart analysis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AvaH\">In Mr. Falaniko\u2019s case, he was ordered removed for having committed an aggravated-felony crime of violence. He doeg not cha]]enge that classification. Sea Pett. Br at 7 (\u00abhis conviction for forcible gexual abuse&gt; a crime of violence under \u00a7 INA i0i(a)(43)(F)\u201d), 8-9 (\u201cthe crime of violence for which he was convicted\u201d), 13 (\u201cthe crime of violence that formed the basis of the Notice to Appear\u201d). Consequently, we look to whether this basis of removal is the statutory counterpart to crimes involving moral turpitude under INA \u00a7 212(a). \u201cThe BIA has held that the \u2018crime of violence\u2019 aggravated felony ground for removal under INA \u00a7 237 is not \u2018substantially equivalent\u2019 to INA \u00a7 212(a)\u2019s \u2018crime involving moral turpitude\u2019 ground for [inadmissibility] such that the tyvo can be considered statutory counter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>parts.\u201d <em>Caroleo, </em>476 F.3d at 168 (emphasis omitted) (quoting <em>In re Brieva-Perez, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 766, 772-3 (BIA 2005)). The BIA\u2019s interpretation of the INA is entitled to deference. See <em>Chevron, U.S.A, Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). Accordingly, because Mr. Falaniko\u2019s ground of removal has no statutory counterpart under INA \u00a7 212(a), he is not eligible for relief under INA \u00a7 212(c).</p>\n<p id=\"ASJ\">2. Retroactive Application of 8 C F R \u00a7 1212 3(f)(5)</p>\n<p id=\"afr-dedup-0\">Mr. Falaniko next argues that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(f)(5) violates <em>St. Cyr </em>by retroactively establishing a^ new scheme for deciding his eligibility for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver. As we have already discussed, however, the regulation merely codified existing law. <em>See Vue, </em>496 F.3d at 863. Indeed, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(f)(5) simply ciarified the agency\u2019s preexisting comparable-grounds analysis after the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>St. Cyr. </em>The regulation is not impermissibly retroactive because it does not deny or impair vested rights, nor does it create new obligations, impose new duties, or attach new disabilities. <em>See Landgraf v. USI Film Pro</em>ducts, 511 U.S. 244, 269, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"Ae8\">3. Definition of \u201cAggravated Felony\u201d Lastly, Mr. Falaniko contends the BIA failed to find a corresponding statutory ground of inadmissibility because it analyzed the wrong definition of \u201caggravated felony.\u201d He maintains the BIA reviewed 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A), which includes \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d in its definition of \u201caggravated felony,\u201d rather than \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F), which defines \u201caggravated felony\u201d as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d It is clear from the BIA\u2019s decision, however, that the agency correctly examined \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). The BIA referenced \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d while discussing the statutory-counterpart rule, but immediately cited an agency case that applied that rule to the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d found at \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). Although the BIA cited \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A) at the conclusion of its decision, it had already rejected Mr. Falaniko\u2019s eligibility arguments and was addressing his retroactivity contention. The BIA explained the Supreme Court\u2019s recognition in <em>St. Cyr </em>that the amended definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d clearly applied retroactively, while the provision of IIRIRA repealing \u00a7 212(c) <em>m </em>not The BIA&gt;S citation of \u00a7 noi(a)(43)(A) is admittedly curious given that the Supreme Court did not specificajjy reference that subsection, but in the context of the BIA\u2019s decision, the citation does little more than exemplify the retroactive application of the entire amended definition.
