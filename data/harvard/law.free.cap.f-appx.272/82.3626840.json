Townes, <em>District Judge), </em>entered on September 27, 2006, adopting the Report &amp; Recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) of the Magistrate Judge (Stephen M. Gold, <em>Magistrate Judge), </em>granting Defendant-Appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>denying Davis\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment, and thereby dismissing the case. Relying on the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 <em>et seq., </em>Davis challenges the determination by the Army Board for Correction of Military Records (\u201cABCMR\u201d) in denying the following requested relief: (1) remove a 1995-96 job performance evaluation from Davis\u2019s record; (2) include a statement in Davis\u2019s record that the absence of three years of evaluations was not her fault; and (3) remove any reference in her record to a \u201chardship discharge.\u201d We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the background, procedural history, and issues on appeal. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AqB\">Davis\u2019s appeal was waived when she failed timely to object to the R &amp; R of the Magistrate Judge. \u201cIn general, failure to object timely to a magistrate\u2019s report operates as a waiver of any further judicial review of the magistrate\u2019s decision,\u201d <em>Caidor v. Onondaga County, </em>517 F.3d 601, 604 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted), provided that \u201cthe party had received clear notice of the consequences of the failure to object,\u201d <em>Frank v. Johnson, </em>968 F.2d 298, 300 (2d Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 1038, 113 S.Ct. 825, 121 L.Ed.2d 696 (1992). Davis received such clear notice in the R &amp; R itself, which contained explicit instructions on where and by what date to file objections, as well as a warning that Davis\u2019s failure to do so would waive any such objections. Davis failed to file any objections until roughly four months after the deadline to do so. Although we may excuse this waiver \u201cin the interests of justice,\u201d <em>Roldan v. Racette, </em>984 F.2d 85, 89 (2d Cir.1993), Davis has not provided any convincing argument that justice requires us to overlook her waiver of these issues below. Instead, Davis offers only the assertion that she has already suffered \u201cgreat prejudice\u201d based upon nothing more than the underlying conduct she seeks to challenge. As we find no basis in the record to excuse Davis\u2019s failure to object to the R &amp; R, we conclude that she has waived any such objections for pui'-poses of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
