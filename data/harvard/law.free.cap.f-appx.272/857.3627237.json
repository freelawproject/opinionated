Garcia argues that the district erred by applying a four-level enhancement to his base offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), for possession of a firearm in connection with another felony offense where, according to his claims, the only evidence of facilitation was a speculative inference based on the proximity of the gun to the drugs found in his ear.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">\u201c[We] review[ ] the distxict court\u2019s application and interpretation of the sentencing guidelines under the <em>de novo </em>standard of review, but reviewf ] its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 693 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cFor a factual finding to be \u2018cleax\u2019ly erroneous,\u2019 [we], \u2018after reviewing all of the evidence, must be left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d 1134, 1137 (11th Cir.2004) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">In calculating the guideline range for a firearm possession offense under \u00a7 922(g), a four-level increase to the base offense level is required \u201c[i]f the defendant ... possessed any firearm ... in connection with another felony offense.... \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). Effective November 1, 2006, the Guideline was amended to add the following commentary:</p>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">14. <em>\u201cIn Connection With </em>\u201d.\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b882-13\">(A) <em>In General. </em>\u2014 Subsection[] (b)(6) ... appl[ies] if the firearm or ammunition facilitated, or had the potential of facilitating, another felony offense....</p>\n<p id=\"b882-15\">(B) <em>Application When Other Offense is Burglary or Drug Offense. </em>\u2014 Subsection[ ] (b)(6) ... applies] ... in the case of a drug trafficking offense in which a firearm is found in close proximity to drugs, drug-manufacturing materials, or drug paraphernalia. In these cases, application of subsection[ ] (b)(6) ... is warranted because the presence of the firearm has the potential of facilitating another felony offense ...</p>\n<p id=\"b882-16\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n. 14 (2006) (emphasis added). \u201c[C]ommentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statxxte, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.\u201d <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-17\">In cases addressing the \u201cin connection with\u201d language prior to the recent Amendment, we, relying on analogous guideline provisions, have suggested that mere possession might be enough to apply the enhancement in circumstances where it is reasonable to assume that the defendant possessed the firearm to prevent the theft of property related to the underlying of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>fense. <em>See Rhind, </em>289 F.3d at 694-96 (holding that defendants possessed firearms in connection with counterfeiting offenses where it was reasonable to conclude that the presence of the firearms protected the counterfeit money); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>276 F.3d 1231, 1234-35 (11th Cir. 2001) (noting we have held, in addressing the \u201cin connection with\u201d requirement of analogous guideline provisions, that an enhancement is properly applied where it was reasonable to assume possession was for prevention of theft). Although these cases were decided prior to the Amendment, a firearm possessed for theft protection would have the potential to facilitate the underlying offense. <em>See Jackson, </em>276 F.3d at 1234-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Here a loaded firearm was discovered in close proximity to a few week\u2019s worth of Garcia\u2019s personal use drugs. Moreover, when Garcia was arrested, he asked the arresting officer not to take the drugs because \u201cthey will kill me.\u201d From these factors, an inference could be drawn that Garcia carried the firearm to prevent the theft of the drugs. Thus, the district court did not clearly err by finding that the firearm was used in connection with Garcia\u2019s felony drug possession. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-10\">. As is noted at the close of this opinion, there is additional evidence that supports the district court's determination. Specifically, Garcia made a statement from which one could infer that he possessed the firearm to protect his drugs from theft. Furthermore, in the record excerpts provided by Garcia, the district court judge explicitly stated that he did not rely solely on the proximity of the gun to the drugs to find that Garcia possessed the gun in facilitation of the other felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
