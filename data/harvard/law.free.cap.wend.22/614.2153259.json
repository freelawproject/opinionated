The writ of error was afterwards quashed, and the plaintiff brought this action on the bond.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b615-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number><em>A.

But this in an action- on an error bond, and if there has been a breach of the condition, I am not aware that this, or any other court can grant equitable relief, as is done in suits on bail bonds and recognizances of bail. There is no reason, therefore, for restricting the action to the court in which the proceeding originated.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
