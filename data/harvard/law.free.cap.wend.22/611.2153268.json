The premises being wholly unoccupied, there being no dwelling house or other building thereon, and the assignee of the lessee having no place of residence known to the plaintiff, and he not being able to make personal service of the declaration, caused it to be served by affixing a copy, with the proper notice, in a conspicuous place on a post standing on the demised premises.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b611-7\"><em>G.

He cited 2 <em>R.

S. </em>303, \u00a7 1, retains the action of ejectment, declaring that it \u201c may be brought in the cases and the manner heretofore accustomed, subject to the provisions hereinafter contained.\u201d The 14th section declares, that \u201c if the premises claimed are not actually occupied, the declaration and notice shall be served on the defendant named therein personally, or, if he cannot be found, by leaving the same with some person of proper age at the residence of such defendant.\u201d The 15th section requires a special application for the rule to plead, where the service is made in any other manner than on the defendant personally. The statute has thus cut off all methods of ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>vice in cases where the premises are not actually occupied, save those specifically mentioned in section 14. The former provision for service as between landlord and tenant not having been retained, the only remedy left to the plaintiff is an actual entry at common law, or the proceeding under 2 <em>R. S. </em>512, \u00a7 24, <em>5, 6, 7. </em>The provisions of these sections were evidently intended to come in place of the former, 1 <em>R. L. </em>441, \u00a7 23, <em>et seq. </em>the mode of service in which was adopted by <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>12 <em>Wendell </em>180. In deciding the latter case, the provisions of 2 <em>R. S. </em>512, seem to have been overlooked. Looking at these in connection with the provisions of &lt;\u00a7&gt; 14, cited, we are all of opinion that the practice laid down in <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Moran </em>cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
