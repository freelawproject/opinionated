The declaration was served on the 24th June last. The time * for pleading was first - enlarged by consent; an order for further time was then made by Judge Ulshoeffer, of the Newr York common pleas, <em>in the absence of the circuit judge; </em>and subsequently a <em>further </em>order was made by Judge Inglis, of the New-York common-pleas, <em>without stating the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number><em>absence of the circuit judge. </em>The plaintiff disregarded the last order, entered the defendant\u2019s default, and proceeded to judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b647-4\"><em>H. H. Martin, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ao5\">to show that judge Inglis had authority to make the order, cited <em>Statutes of </em>1832, <em>p. </em>189, \u00a7 6; 1834, p. 118, \u00a7 5; and 1839, <em>p. 96, chap. </em>116, \u00a7 <em>2.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b647-6\"><em>W. Parmelee, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A71\">insisted that the order might be disregarded, first, because it did not purport to be made in the absence of the circuit judge ; and second, because the 95th rule provides that \u201c if a second order for time shall be made by a <em>supreme court commissioner, </em>.the plaintiff may treat the same as a nullity.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b647-7\"><em>Martin, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABa\">said Judge Inglis stood <em>in the place of the circuit judge, </em>and did not act as a <em>supreme court commissioner </em>in making the order.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b647-8\">\n<em>By the Court,</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"AFb\">Bronson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9n6\">The sixth section of the act of 1832 provides, that \u201c no person acting as a supreme court commissioner in the city of New-York, shall be authorized to make any order or do any act relative to suits pending in the supreme court; but <em>in the absence from the city of New-York, or sickness of the circuit judge </em>of the first circuit, such duties may be performed by the <em>first judge </em>of the common pleas, or the <em>recorder </em>of.the city.\u201d By the acts of 1834 and 1839, the same powers that may be exercised by the first judge are conferred on the <em>associate </em>judges of common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">Although the fact is not stated in the order of Judge Inglis, it is but a reasonable intendment that the circuit judge was absent or sick at the time the order was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">II. Judge Inglis was not the representative of the circuit judge in making the order; he acted as a <em>supreme court commissioner. </em>2 <em>R. S. </em>281, \u00a7 32. And the 95th rule is general, that a second order for a time to plead made by a supreme court commissioner may be treated as a nullity. The act of 1832 does not confer any new powers on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>judges of the New York common pleas, and the recorder of the city; it only suspends the exercise of powers which they before possessed, during the time that the circuit judge is in the city, and able to discharge his duties. The plaintiff was therefore regular; but as there is an affidavit of merits, the defendant must be relieved on the usual terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
