The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We agree, although our reasoning is different from that of the trial court, and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">The plaintiff, Location Realty, Inc., brought this action against the defendant, General Financial Services, Inc., to recover a real estate commission. The defendant moved for summary judgment and the trial court granted the motion and rendered judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">The following facts and procedural history are undisputed. The plaintiff brought this action against the defendant to recover a real estate commission that the plaintiff claimed it had earned pursuant to a listing agreement effective November, 1998, in connection with certain land located on the Berlin Turnpike in Berlin. The plaintiff alleged that the listing agreement complied with General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a (b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>included the lease of the subject property. The plaintiff alleged further that, during the term of the listing agreement, the defendant had entered into a lease agreement with a tenant, namely, CVS, by virtue of which the defendant is liable to the plaintiff for a commission in the amount of approximately $145,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The listing agreement between the parties covered the period from November, 1998, to December 31, 2000. The defendant and CVS entered into their lease on August 26, 1999. The plaintiff has had a real estate broker\u2019s license, issued pursuant to chapter 392 of the General Statutes; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 20-311 through 20-329ff; since August 27, 1990,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> including the time period of the listing agreement and the lease, and including the time at which this action was brought in June, 2002. During that time period, the plaintiffs president was Michael C. O\u2019Brien,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> who was licensed as a real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>estate salesperson, but was not licensed as a real estate broker until October, 2001. Furthermore, O\u2019Brien actively participated in the plaintiffs real estate brokerage business; indeed, he was instrumental in securing the listing agreement in question, and signed it on behalf of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">On the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the defendant argued that: (1) General Statutes \u00a7 20-312 (b)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> requires that, if a corporation is licensed as a real estate broker, every officer who actively participates in its brokerage business must be licensed as a broker; (2) General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a (a)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provides that no person not duly licensed may commence or bring an action for a commission; (3) the plaintiff was not duly licensed because O\u2019Brien lacked a broker\u2019s license; and (4) therefore, the plaintiffs action must fail as a matter of law. The plaintiff countered that the statutory scheme did not permit the court, as opposed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>real estate commission, collaterally to invalidate the plaintiffs broker\u2019s license in the context of this private action for a commission otherwise properly earned. Thus, as presented to the trial court, the case turned on the intersection of two statutory sections, namely, \u00a7\u00a7 20-312 and 20-325a (a). The trial court agreed with the defendant and granted its motion for summary judgment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">In this court, the parties reiterated the same statutory contentions that they had presented to the trial court, namely, their arguments relying on the effect of the intersection of \u00a7\u00a7 20-312 and 20-325a (a). After oral argument before this court, however, we issued an order to the parties directing them to file supplemental briefs on the following issue: \u201cWhat effect, if any, does General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 20-325a (c) have on the issue presented in this appeal?\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 20-325a (c) provides: \u201cNothing in subsection (a) of this section or subdivisions (2) to (6), inclusive, of subsection (b) of this section shall prevent any licensee from recovering any commission, compensation or other payment in respect to acts done or services rendered, if such person has substantially complied with subdivisions (2) to (6), inclusive, of subsection (b)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of this section and it would be inequitable to deny such recovery.\u201d We conclude that this statutory provision requires the reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>This case presents a question of statutory interpretation over which we have plenary review.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute [s] [themselves], to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding [their] enactment, to the legislative policy [they were] designed to implement, and to [their] relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 577, 816 A.2d 562 (2003).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Bonner, </em>272 Conn. 489, 493-94, 863 A.2d 680 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>We first address the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly rendered summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiff was not duly licensed as a broker and, therefore, was barred from bringing this action by \u00a7 20-325a (a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We conclude that, considering only \u00a7\u00a7 20-312 and 20-325a (a), as the trial court did, the plaintiff was not duly licensed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We also conclude, however, as our following discussion indicates, that that fact alone is insufficient to deny the plaintiff the right to recover the commission it claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">It is useful to begin our inquiry with a general overview of the statutory scheme. That scheme recognizes two types of licensed providers of real estate services: brokers, defined in General Statutes \u00a7 20-311 (l),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and salespersons, defined in \u00a7 20-311 (2).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Both are subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>to the licensing provisions of the real estate commission, which is part of the department of consumer protection (department). See generally General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 20-311 and 20-312. One critical distinction between the two types of licensed providers is disclosed by General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 20-314 (d) (1) and (2).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> That statute then provided that an individual could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>licensed as a salesperson upon successful completion of an approved course in real estate practices and principles of at least thirty classroom hours, or the equivalent experience or education as determined by the real estate commission. General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 20-314 (d) (2). The statute also then provided, however, that an individual could be licensed as a broker only if he met four requirements: (1) he had been actively engaged for at least two years as a salesperson under the supervision of a broker; (2) he had successfully completed an approved course of at least thirty classroom hours of real estate practices and principles; (3) he had successfully completed an approved course in real estate appraisal of at least thirty classroom hours; and (4) he had successfully completed a course, approved by the real estate commission, of at least thirty classroom hours \u201cas prescribed by the commission . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 20-314 (d) (1). It is apparent, therefore, that a broker\u2019s license requires more education and experience, and more demanding qualifications, than a salesperson\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">In addition, licenses for either status may be granted \u201conly to persons who bear a good reputation for honesty, truthfulness and fair dealing and who are competent to transact the business of a real estate broker or real estate salesperson in such manner as to safeguard the interests of the public.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 20-314 (a). Furthermore, there are continuing education requirements for both brokers and salespersons. General Statutes \u00a7 20-319 (b). Finally, the department may suspend or revoke any such license for a variety of acts of misconduct, including \u201ca violation of any provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>of this chapter or any regulation adopted under this chapter. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 20-320 (13).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">With this background in mind, we turn to the first particular question involved in this appeal, namely, the applicability of \u00a7 20-325a (a). We begin with the language of the statutes involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Section 20-312 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shah act as a real estate broker . . . without a license issued by the commission . . . .\u201d Section 20-312 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo . . . corporation shall be granted a real estate broker\u2019s license, unless every . . . officer of such . . . corporation who actively participates in its real estate brokerage business holds a license as a real estate broker . . . .\u201d This language strongly suggests that a corporation\u2019s broker\u2019s license is valid only if every officer of the corporation who actively participates in its brokerage business is licensed as a broker.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Section 20-325a (a), which addresses the question of civil actions brought to recover commissions, provides: \u201cNo person who is not licensed under the provisions of this chapter, and who was not so licensed at the time the person performed the acts or rendered the services for which recovery is sought, shall commence or bring any action in any court of this state, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>October 1,1971, to recover any commission, compensation or other payment with respect to any act done or service rendered by the person, the doing or rendering of which is prohibited under the provisions of this chapter except by persons duly licensed under this chapter.\u201d Although, as the plaintiff points out, the first part of the sentence refers only to a \u201cperson who is not licensed,\u201d the end of the sentence refers to \u201cpersons <em>duly </em>licensed under this chapter.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a (a). In our view, the entire sentence must be read as a whole. Thus, the reference at the end of subsection (a) to \u201cpersons duly licensed\u201d strongly suggests that the adverb \u201cduly\u201d also applies to the reference at the beginning of subsection (a) to \u201cperson . . . licensed . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a (a). Thus, the language of this section suggests that a licensee may only bring an action for a commission if it is duly licensed.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">This analysis brings us back to \u00a7 20-312 (b). Just as the entire sentence of \u00a7 20-325a (a) must be read as a whole, \u00a7 20-325a (a) must be read together with \u00a7 20-312 (b). Reading the two provisions together, we conclude that their language strongly suggests that a corporate licensed broker, whose president was actively involved in its brokerage business but was not licensed as a broker, was not duly licensed within the meaning of \u00a7 20-325a (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">This conclusion is supported by the legislative history of chapter 392 of the General Statutes. That history indicates that the primary purpose of the legislation was the protection of the public, and that the legislature considered the requirement that all active members of a corporate or partnership licensee be themselves licensed to be central to that purpose, so as to avoid the possibility that persons not licensed as brokers could nonetheless combine in a partnership or corporation that would be so licensed.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>What is now chapter 392 of the General Statutes was first enacted in 1953, as Public Acts 1953, No. 410. It required, for the first time in this state, the licensing of real estate brokers and salespersons. In presenting the bill to the House of Representatives, Representative Norman K. Parsells began by stating that \u201cthe prnpose of this bill is to insure to the public to the extent possible that it is dealing with honest, truthful and competent real estate brokers and salesmen.\u201d 5 H.R. Proc., Pt. 6, 1953 Sess., p. 2381. Representative Parsells further stated: \u201cWe tried to draft a bill which would protect the public but at the same time would not keep any honest and intelligent person out of the real estate business.\u201d Id., p. 2383. Representative Parsells specifically addressed the purpose of what is now \u00a7 20-312 (a) and (b): \u201cSection 3 [of Public Acts 1953, No. 410] requires the people to obtain a license after October 1, 1953. It also requires that all active members of a partnership and officers of a corporation must be licensed, because we wanted to prevent group evasion of this law.\u201d Id., p. 2384.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Finally, it is significant that the real estate commission itself has recognized the importance of the requirements of \u00a7 20-312 (b). In a declaratory ruling issued on July 19, 2002, the real estate commission interpreted that section as follows: \u201cIt is our experience that real estate brokerage firms are managed, directed and controlled by their officers. Accordingly, we apply the unambiguous language of the statute to require that each officer of a brokerage business be individually licensed as a broker, or being the designated broker.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">\u201cWe further require that each owner who actively engages in the management or control of a brokerage business be individually licensed as a broker or being the designated broker. We recognize that some brokerage firms are publicly traded entities. We believe that a passive investment interest of a shareholder is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>the \u2018active participation\u2019 contemplated by the statute.\u201d Connecticut Real Estate Commission, In re: Activities of Real Estate Salespersons, Declaratory Ruling, July 19, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">We are not persuaded by the plaintiffs argument that, because the entire statutory scheme of chapter 392 of the General Statutes grants extensive regulatory powers to the real estate commission, the trial court could not go behind the plaintiffs license so as to deny the plaintiff the right to bring this action. We acknowledge the real estate commission\u2019s extensive powers. That grant of authority, however, does not, in our view, trump the language and purpose of \u00a7\u00a7 20-312 (b) and 20-325a (a), when read together, particularly when \u00a7 20-325a (a) specifically addresses the right to bring an action for compensation for services rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">We conclude, therefore, that but for the possible application of General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 20-325a (c), the plaintiff would be barred from bringing this action. The \u201cbut for,\u201d however, significantly alters the analysis of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 20-325a (c) provides in relevant part: \u201cNothing in subsection (a) of this section . . . shall prevent any licensee from recovering any commission, compensation or other payment in respect to any acts done or services rendered, if . . . it would be inequitable to deny such recovery.\u201d The language of this section squarely applies to subsection (a) of \u00a7 20-325a, which is the provision that bars an action when the licensee was not duly licensed at the time of the rendering of the services. That language provides, in effect, that, despite the fact that a licensee may not have been duly licensed, it may not be denied the right to recover if it would be inequitable to do so. Furthermore, we note that, in contrast to the language of subsection (a) of \u00a7 20-325a, which speaks in terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>the right to <em>\u201ccommence or bring\u201d </em>an action; (emphasis added); subsection (c) of General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 20-325a provides that nothing in subsection (a) \u201cshall prevent any licensee from <em>recovering\u201d </em>its claimed compensation. (Emphasis added.) Both the linguistic reference to equity, and the linguistic distinction between bringing or commencing an action and recovering on such an action, strongly suggest that the right of a plaintiff who is not duly licensed nonetheless to recover must be determined based on all of the facts and circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">This suggestion is buttressed by the legislative history of \u00a7 20-325a (c). That provision was enacted in 1994 by Public Acts 1994, No. 94-240, as part of a legislative proposal drafted by a task force comprised of representatives of the department of consumer protection, the real estate commission and the Connecticut Association of Realtors. Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Insurance and Real Estate, 1994 Sess., p. 90. The legislative history indicates that the proposal was brought forth in response to certain decisions of this court that strictly construed the requirements of \u00a7 20-325a (b), namely, the formal requirements of a listing agreement, and denied brokers the right to recover for failures of strict compliance therewith. See, e.g., <em>M.R. Wachob Co. </em>v. <em>MBM Partnership, </em>232 Conn. 645, 658-62, 656 A. 2d 1036 (1995); Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, supra, p. 91. That history indicates that the task force that drafted the legislation considered that the strict construction of subsection (b) of \u00a7 20-325ahad resulted in some cases of \u201cunjust enrichment.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, supra, p. 91. This history, in turn, also suggests that the question of recovery, despite a failure to comply strictly with subsection (a) of \u00a7 20-325a, must be determined on the basis of all of the facts and circumstances of the case. See, e.g., <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Danforth, </em>222 Conn. 150, 158, 609 A.2d 654 (1992) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>(\u201c[ujnjust enrichment requires a factual examination of the circumstances and of the conduct of the parties\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">It necessarily follows from this discussion that a corporate broker licensee, whose president was not licensed as a broker, may not be denied its right to recover a commission otherwise earned solely because of that licensing failure. Its right to recover must be gauged, instead, under all of the facts and circumstances of the case and whether it would be inequitable, in light of those facts and circumstances, to deny it the right to recover. One of those facts and circumstances is, of course, that the licensee may not have been duly licensed; but that fact alone is not sufficient to deny recovery. It follows, further, that the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in this case was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">In this opinion KATZ, PALMER and VERTEFEUILLE, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-8\"> The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b792-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a Ob) provides: \u201cNo person, licensed under the provisions of this chapter, shall commence or bring any action with respect to any acts done or services rendered after October 1, 1995, as set forth in subsection (a), unless the acts or services were rendered pursuant to a contract or authorization from the person for whom the acts were done or services rendered.

The majority concludes that the plaintiff, Location Realty, Inc., was not duly licensed as a real estate broker and, therefore, would be barred by General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a (a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from bringing its action for a real estate broker\u2019s commission against the defendant, General Financial Services, Inc., but for the provisions of General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 20-325a (c). The majority further concludes that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>under \u00a7 20-325a (c), a licensee who is not \u201cduly licensed\u201d is not barred from recovering a commission if denying such recovery would be inequitable under the facts and circumstances of the case. I agree that the plaintiff was not duly licensed,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but do not agree that \u00a7 20-325a (c) applies to persons or entities that are not duly licensed. Because I would conclude that the plaintiff is barred from bringing this action, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 20-325a (c) provides: \u201cNothing in subsection (a) of this section or subdivisions (2) to (6), inclusive, of subsection (b) of this section shall prevent any licensee from recovering any commission, compensation or other payment in respect to any acts done or services rendered, if such person has substantially complied with subdivisions (2) to (6), inclusive, of subsection (b) of this section and it would be inequitable to deny such recovery.\u201d The majority recognizes that \u00a7 20-325a (a) bars a person who is not \u201clicensed,\u201d i.e., is not duly licensed, from bringing an action for a commission, but argues that a licensee who is not duly licensed may, nevertheless, recover a commission under \u00a7 20-325a (c) if, under the \u201cfacts and circumstances\u201d of the case, it would be inequitable to preclude recovery, because \u00a7 20-325a (c) specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>provides that \u00a7 20-325a (a) will not bar such recovery by a licensee. In my view, however, it is inconsistent for the majority to conclude, on the one hand, that the word licensed, as used in the first clause of \u00a7 20-325a (a), means duly licensed, that is, licensed in accordance with the provisions of chapter 392, and to conclude, on the other hand, that the word licensee, as used in \u00a7 20-325a (c), does not mean a person duly licensed under chapter 392, but means a person who has obtained a license, whether or not in accordance with the governing statutes. Moreover, if the legislature had intended to allow an improperly licensed person to recover a commission when it enacted \u00a7 20-325a (c), it would have specified that such an action would be allowed only if the person had substantially complied with the licensing provisions, just as it specified that such an action is allowed only if a person has substantially complied with \u00a7 20-325a (b). I find it highly unlikely that the legislature intended that a plaintiff who failed to satisfy the technical requirements of \u00a7 20-325a (b) could recover a commission only by establishing <em>both </em>that (1) the listing contract was in substantial compliance with subdivisions (2) through (6) of that provision <em>and </em>(2) it would be inequitable to deny recovery, but that a plaintiff who failed to satisfy the fundamental licensing requirements of chapter 392 could recover a commission simply by establishing that it would be inequitable to deny recoveiy under some unspecified set of facts and circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">I would conclude that, by including the reference to \u00a7 20-325a (a) in \u00a7 20-325a (c), the legislature merely intended to underscore that, by its very terms, \u00a7 20-325a (a) does not bar a licensee, i.e., a person who is duly licensed, from recovering a commission. I recognize that, under this interpretation, the reference to subsection (a) in subsection (c) is gratuitous because nothing in \u00a7 20-325a (a) suggests that a licensee is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>barred from recovering a commission, regardless of whether the licensee has complied with \u00a7 20-325a (b). Nevertheless, confronted with a choice between a reading of \u00a7 20-325a (c) that renders the reference to subsection (a) gratuitous and a reading that both gives less weight to the basic licensing requirements of chapter 392 than to the technical listing agreement requirements of \u00a7 20-325a (b) and imports into subsection (c) a notion that is at odds with the basic statutory scheme, namely, that persons who are not duly licensed may enjoy the privileges granted to duly licensed persons, I would choose the former reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">This conclusion is supported by the legislative history of \u00a7 20-325a (c). During joint committee hearings on the proposed legislation, Larry Hannafin, representing the department of consumer protection and the Connecticut real estate commission, specifically stated that \u201cthe proposed changes expand [\u00a3 <em>20-325a (b)] </em>so that if a broker in a real estate transaction has substantially complied with the provisions of this chapter, or this section, the broker will be permitted to pursue their claims for payment of the licensee[\u2019s] fees in our court system.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Insurance and Real Estate, 1994 Sess., p. 91. Thus, immediately after referring to \u201cthis chapter,\u201d Hannafin corrected himself by saying \u201cor this section\u201d to clarify that the new legislation affected only \u201cthis section,\u201d meaning \u00a7 20-325a (b). He did not suggest that the legislation expanded the right to bring an action when the licensing requirements of chapter 392 had not been met. Hannafin also stated that \u201c[r]ight now under [\u00a7 20-325a (b)], if as much as a date [in] the listing contract or authorization to ask for another is deleted from that listing agreement [the broker is barred] from going to court to seek payment of the commission and often this has resulted in unjust enrichment to various sellers of properties.\u201d Id. In my view, this legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>history clearly indicates that \u00a7 20-325a (c) was intended solely to ameliorate what had been the draconian results of failing to comply strictly with the technical requirements of \u00a7 20-325a (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Indeed, the majority recognizes that \u00a7 20-325a (c) was enacted in response to judicial decisions holding that the failure to comply strictly with \u00a7 20-325a (b) barred the right to recover a commission and that the \u201cthe task force that drafted the legislation considered that the strict construction of [,\u00a7' <em>20-325a (b)] </em>had resulted in some cases of \u2018unjust enrichment.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) It then concludes that this fact \u201csuggests that the question of recovery, despite a failure to comply strictly with <em>subsection (a) </em>of \u00a7 20-325a, must be determined on the basis of all of the facts and circumstances of the case.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The fact that the legislature intended that a person should not automatically be deprived of a commission for failure to comply strictly with the formal requirements for a listing agreement set forth in \u00a7 20-325a (b) does not mean that the legislature intended that a person should not automatically be deprived of a commission for failure to comply with the basic statutory licensing requirements.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">In summary, I do not agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that, under \u00a7 20-325a (c), a person who has failed to comply with the licensing provisions of chapter 392 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>may be permitted to bring an action for the recovery of a commission if, under the facts and circumstances of the case, it would be inequitable to deny recovery. I would conclude that \u00a7 20-325a (a) acts as an absolute bar to the bringing of such an action by a person who is not duly licensed under the provisions of chapter 392 and that \u00a7 20-325a (c) does not apply to such persons. Because the plaintiff was not duly licensed, I believe that this action for a commission is barred. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b805-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a (a) provides: \u201cNo person who is not licensed under the provisions of this chapter, and who was not so licensed at the time the person performed the acts or rendered the services for which recovery is sought, shall commence or bring any action in any court of this state, after October 1, 1971, to recover any commission, compensation or other payment with respect to any act done or service rendered by the person, the doing or rendering of which is prohibited under the provisions of this chapter except by persons duly licensed under this chapter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b806-6\"> I also agree with the majority\u2019s implicit determination that this court has jurisdiction to determine that the plaintiff was not duly licensed for purposes of \u00a7 20-325a (a), even though the real estate commission has original jurisdiction over \u201clicensure and issuance, renewal, suspension or revocation of licenses concerning the real estate business.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 20-311b (b) (2). I do not believe, as the trial court found, that the effect of the court\u2019s determination that the plaintiff was not duly licensed for purposes of \u00a7 20-325a (a) was to void the plaintiffs license for the relevant annual periods. The effect was simply to bar the plaintiff from bringing an action to recover a commission. Any determination that the license was void, which, as the plaintiff points out, would have consequences beyond barring an action for a commission pursuant to \u00a7 20-325a (a); see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 20-325 (engaging in business of real estate broker without license is punishable by fine and imprisonment); must, in my view, be made by the real estate commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b809-7\"> I am peiplexed by the majority\u2019s argument that the linguistic distinction between \u201cbringing or commencing\u201d an action for a commission in \u00a7 20-325a (a) and \u201crecovering\u201d a commission in \u00a7 20-325a (c) \u201cstrongly suggests] that the right of a plaintiff who is not duly licensed nonetheless to recover must be determined based on all of the facts and circumstances of the case.\u201d The recovery allowed by \u00a7 20-325a (c) is clearly recovery in an action commenced or brought in a court of law. While \u00a7 20-325a (a) and (b) bar commencement of such an action and, therefore, recovery, under specified facts and circumstances, \u00a7 20-325a (c) permits recovery and, necessarily, the commencement of an action, under specified facts and circumstances. Thus, I cannot perceive the significance of the linguistic distinction relied on by the majority.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
