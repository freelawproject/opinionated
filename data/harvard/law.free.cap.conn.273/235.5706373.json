They also asked the trial court to enjoin the defendant from requiring a three year time in grade tenure as a prerequi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>site for promotional examination. The plaintiffs appeal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court concluding that the defendant had established a valid civil service examination prerequisite and denying the plaintiffs\u2019 requests for declaratory and injunctive relief. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The record reveals the following stipulated facts. The various plaintiffs hold the positions of uniformed firefighter and fire captain with the city of Bridgeport and at the relevant times herein, have been employed in those capacities for more than one year, but less than three years. The firefighter plaintiffs desired to take an announced promotional examination for the position of pumper engineer. The fire captain plaintiffs desired to take an announced promotional examination for the position of fire assistant chief. The defendant\u2019s personnel director refused to permit the various plaintiffs to take the promotional examinations because they did not meet the announced experience requirement of three years service in their current positions, and the defendant upheld that decision when the plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Section 211 (a) of chapter 17 of the Bridgeport charter provides in relevant part: \u201cThe personnel director shall . . . hold tests for the purpose of establishing employment lists for the various positions in the competitive division of the classified service. . . . <em>Promotion tests shall be public, competitive and free only to all persons . . . who have held a position for one year or more in a class or rank previously declared by the commission to involve the performance of duties which tend to fit the incumbent for the performance of duty in the class or rank for which the promotion test is held. </em>... A person who has served less than one year in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>lower grade shall not be eligible for a promotion test. If fewer than two persons submit themselves for a promotion test, or if, after such test has been held, all applicants shall fail to attain a general average of not less than the minimum standard fixed by the rules of the commission, said director shall forthwith hold an original entrance test and certify from the employment list resulting therefrom. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The Bridgeport charter provision and the defendant\u2019s rules have existed since 1935.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since 1939, notices announcing promotional tests have included a three year time in grade requirement for eligibility to take the examinations for the positions for which the plaintiffs applied. On one occasion, in both 1989 and 1991, however, the city and the firefighters\u2019 union agreed to an exception to the three year requirement because there were no eligible candidates with three years time in grade. The plaintiffs\u2019 argument before the trial court was not that there was a lack of eligible candidates with three years time in grade, but rather that the Bridgeport charter and the defendant\u2019s rules preclude the defendant from requiring that an individual serve more than a one year tenure in a particular grade before becoming eligible for promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The trial court, <em>Dewey, J., </em>reading this court\u2019s decision in <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Jankura, </em>162 Conn. 482, 294 A.2d 536 (1972), as giving the defendant \u201cfull discretion to determine the prerequisite qualifications for promotion,\u201d concluded that the defendant\u2019s three year prerequisite was a valid exercise of its discretion, both under the Bridgeport charter and in light of the defendant\u2019s rule that a candidate serve for \u201c \u2018one year or more\u2019 \u201d in his or her position before becoming eligible for promo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>tion. <em>Mattera </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>49 Conn. Sup. 224, 235, 870 A.2d 483 (2004). The trial court noted that time in grade is a \u201crational standard\u201d and a \u201cbona fide employment criterion . . . [that] provides both a stable work force and fiscal stability.\u201d Id., 237 n.5. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly: (1) disposed of the ultimate issue in the present case by presuming the legality of the three year practice; (2) committed plain error by holding that the three year time in grade requirement comports with the Bridgeport charter; (3) violated the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches of government by allowing the defendant to change the Bridgeport charter unilaterally; and (4) contravened the public policy of this state underlying the merit-based civil service system.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u201cOur examination of the record on appeal, and the briefs and arguments of the parties, persuades us that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. Because the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision fully addresses the arguments raised in the present appeal, we adopt the trial court\u2019s well reasoned decision as a statement of the facts and the applicable law on these issues. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion therein contained.\u201d <em>Stebbins </em>v. <em>Doncasters, Inc., </em>263 Conn. 231, 234-35, 819 A.2d 287 (2003); <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Yale University, </em>268 Conn. 426, 428-29, 844 A.2d 853 (2004); <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mutual Fire Ins.
