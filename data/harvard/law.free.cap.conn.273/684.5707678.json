J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJh\">This appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is brought by Thomas J. Groark, Jr., in his capacity as special counsel appointed by the trial court to investigate, prepare and present legal arguments that the defendant, Michael Ross, is incompetent to waive further postconviction challenges to his sentences of death. After a hearing, the trial court found that the defendant was competent and his waiver was knowing, intelligent and voluntary. Special counsel challenges that finding on appeal. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">The record reveals the following procedural history. More than twenty years ago, the defendant \u201cwas charged in three cases with eight counts of capital felony in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b. The trial court dismissed two counts for lack of territorial jurisdiction and, after a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of four counts of capital felony in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>\u00a7 53a-54b (5) and two counts of capital felony in violation of \u00a7 53a-54b (6).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 188, 194-95, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995) After a separate penalty phase hearing pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 53a-46a, he was sentenced to death. The defendant appealed from the judgments to this court. We affirmed the defendant\u2019s convictions, but determined that certain evidentiary rulings by the trial court in the penalty phase had impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to establish a mitigating factor and, accordingly, we reversed the judgments imposing the death penalty. [Id.], 286. On remand, a second penalty phase hearing was held before a jury, which found an aggravating factor for each capital felony conviction and no mitigating factor. In accordance with the jury\u2019s findings, the court, <em>Miano, J., </em>imposed a death sentence on each count. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>269 Conn. 213, 223-24, 849 A.2d 648 (2004). The defendant again appealed from the judgments to this court, and we affirmed the sentences of death. Id., 392.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>272 Conn. 577, 579-80, 863 A.2d 654 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">\u201cThereafter, on September 21, 2004, T. R. Paulding, Jr., an attorney, entered appearances in the three criminal cases against the defendant. His appearances were in lieu of the appearances by attorneys employed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>the public defender\u2019s office. At the same time, Paulding sent a letter to the trial court, <em>Clifford, J., </em>indicating that the defendant intended to waive any further appeals or collateral attacks on his death sentences and that he wanted the court to set an execution date.\u201d Id., 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The trial court held a hearing at which it canvassed the defendant about his decision to waive further challenges to the death sentences. The court indicated that it saw no evidence that the defendant was not competent and set January 26, 2005, as the execution date. Id., 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Despite the fact that Paulding had appeared for the defendant in lieu of the public defenders, \u201c[o]n December 1, 2004, the [public defender\u2019s office] filed amotion to proceed in forma pauperis and a petition for writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court. The [public defender\u2019s office] represented in the filings that the defendant had refused to sign an affidavit of indigence in support of the motion because he was incompetent. The United States Supreme Court denied the motion on January 10, 2005. [See <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>543 U.S. 1046, 125 S. Ct. 943, 160 L. Ed. 2d 766 (2005).]</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">\u201cAlso on December 1, 2004, the [public defender\u2019s office] filed in the Superior Court a motion for permission to appear as (1) next friend of [the defendant]; and (2) as a party in interest or as an intervener or as amicus curiae. The [public defender\u2019s office] alleged in its motion that it had standing to appear as the defendant\u2019s next friend because the defendant was incompetent when he terminated the [public defenders\u2019] representation of him; because [the defendant] is presently incompetent; and because the [public defender\u2019s office] has had a significant relationship with [the defendant] for some seventeen years .... In addition to the motion for permission to appear, the [public defender\u2019s office] lodged with the court clerk a motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>stay of the defendant\u2019s execution pending a judicial determination as to whether the defendant is competent and a motion for stay of execution pending resolution of the pending consolidated litigation ordered by this court to determine whether Connecticut\u2019s death penalty system is racially discriminatory and therefore violates the state constitution and statutory law (consolidated litigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">\u201cThereafter, the state filed a motion seeking a determination as to whether the defendant was competent to waive his rights to seek postconviction relief and whether his waiver was knowingly and voluntarily made. The court held a competency hearing on December 9, 2004. Because the trial court had not yet ruled on the [public defenders\u2019] motion to appear, the [public defender\u2019s office] attended the hearing only as an observer.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 581-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">At the December 9, 2004 hearing, the court heard testimony from Paulding and the defendant. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court stated that, \u201calthough it would appear to a layperson that the defendant was competent under any standard that would apply, the court required additional information as to whether the defendant had any mental disorder, disease or defect that might affect his decision. Accordingly, the court ordered that the defendant undergo a competency examination by Michael Norko, a psychiatrist, and scheduled a competency hearing for December 28,2004. The court also scheduled a hearing on the [public defenders\u2019] motion to appear on behalf of the defendant for December 15,2004.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 587. After hearing arguments by the parties and the public defender\u2019s office at the December 15, 2004 hearing, the court denied the motion to appear. Id., 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>\u201cThereafter, on December 23, 2004, the [public defender\u2019s office] filed one motion in this court for review of the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion for a stay of the competency hearing and for stay of execution, and a second motion for emergency stay of the competency hearing and of execution. The [public defender\u2019s office] indicated in the motions that it intended to file a writ of error challenging the trial court\u2019s rulings on [its] standing on December 27, 2004. This court dismissed both motions. On December 28,2004, the [public defender\u2019s office] brought [a] writ of error claiming that the trial court improperly had (1) refused to allow the [public defender\u2019s office] to present evidence and to cross-examine witnesses at the December 28,2004 hearing and (2) denied the [public defender\u2019s office\u2019s] request to appear as an amicus curiae.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">At the December 28, 2004 competency hearing, the trial court heard testimony from Norko and the defendant and found that the defendant was competent under the standard set forth in <em>Rees </em>v. <em>Peyton, </em>384 U.S. 312, 314, 86 S. Ct. 1505, 16 L. Ed. 2d 583 (1966) (defendant is competent to waive farther challenges to death sentence when \u201che has [the] capacity to appreciate his position and make a rational choice with respect to continuing or abandoning further litigation\u201d). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">\u201cThereafter, at oral argument before this court on [its] writ of error, the [public defender\u2019s office] represented that it had evidence of the defendant\u2019s incompetence that had never been presented to any court. In light of this representation, and despite the . . . failure [of the public defender\u2019s office] to make an offer of proof to the trial court, this court issued an order authorizing the [public defender\u2019s office] to file with this court a written offer of proof detailing the evidence that it would present at a competency hearing. The [public defender\u2019s office] filed an offer of proof, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>attaching summaries of the proposed testimony of Stuart Grassian, a psychiatrist; Eric Goldsmith, a psychiatrist; five attorneys with the public defender\u2019s office, namely, Barry Butler, [Karen] Goodrow, Paula Montonye, Lauren Weisfeld and John Holdridge; Robert Nave, the state death penalty abolition coordinator for the Connecticut branch of Amnesty International and executive director of the Connecticut Network to Abolish the Death Penalty; and Dan Ross, the defendant\u2019s father. The offer of proof also attached several documents that the [public defender\u2019s office] proposed to introduce as exhibits.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Id., 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Upon review of the evidence presented at the December 28, 2004 hearing and the offer of proof filed by the public defender\u2019s office, this court concluded that the public defender\u2019s office had failed to present \u201cmeaningful evidence\u201d that the defendant was incompetent and, therefore, under the rule set forth in <em>Demosthenes </em>v. Baal, 495 U.S. 731, 736, 110 S. Ct. 2223, 109 L. Ed. 2d 762 (1990), the public defender\u2019s office was not entitled to participate in an evidentiary hearing at which it could attempt to establish the defendant\u2019s incompetence and its standing to appear as the defendant\u2019s next friend.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 611. Accordingly, we affirmed the judgment of the trial court denying the motion of the public defender\u2019s office to appear as the defendant\u2019s next friend. Id., 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">After our ruling, the public defender\u2019s office filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of the defendant in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, again arguing that the defendant was incompetent and that it should therefore be allowed to appear as his next friend. See <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Lantz, </em>United States District Court, Docket No. 3:05CV00116 (D. Conn. January 24, 2005). The District Court, Chatigny, J., held a hearing on the petition and concluded that the public defender\u2019s office had satisfied the requirements for next friend standing. Id. Accordingly, the court ordered that an evidentiary competency hearing be held and stayed the execution of the death sentences pending resolution of the matter. The commissioner of correction appealed from the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and filed a motion to vacate the stay in that court. See <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Lantz, </em>United States Court of Appeals, Docket No. 05-8900 (2d Cir. January 25, 2005). The Court of Appeals concluded that the District Court should not have granted next friend status to the public defender\u2019s office without first holding a competency hearing. Id. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals ordered the District Court to conduct the hearing \u201cas expeditiously as is reasonably practicable,\u201d dismissed the appeal, and denied the motion to vacate the stay. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">The commissioner of correction then filed an application to vacate the stay of execution with the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>States Supreme Court. On January, 27, 2005, the court granted the application. See <em>Lantz </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>543 U.S. 1134, 125 S. Ct. 1117, 160 L. Ed. 2d 1091 (2005). Meanwhile, the commissioner of correction had rescheduled the execution to January 29, 2005, at 1 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">On January 28, 2005, at 3 p.m., the District Court, Chatigny, J., convened a telephone conference call among Paulding; counsel for Dan Ross,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Antonio Ponvert III and James Nugent; three attorneys for the public defender\u2019s office, Hubert J. Santos, Hope C. Seely and Patrick J. Culligan; and three attorneys for the state, Terrence M. O\u2019Neill, Michael E. O\u2019Hare and Susan Quinn Cobb. During the telephone conference, Judge Chatigny indicated that he had received a letter from a prisoner who claimed to have been incarcerated with the defendant that raised new questions about the effect of the defendant\u2019s conditions of confinement on his competence. The court also indicated that the fact that Norko was \u201cadmittedly ignorant\u201d of \u201cdeath row syndrome\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>should cause Paulding \u201ctremendous unease . . . The court stated that if an investigation after the defendant\u2019s death revealed that the defendant was incompetent, the court would \u201chave [Paulding\u2019s] law license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">After the telephone conference ended, Paulding requested that the execution be stayed temporarily so that he could investigate whether, in light of the District Court\u2019s action, he had a conflict of interest that would impinge on his ability to represent the defendant. The state, which had indicated repeatedly throughout the proceedings that any request for a stay made by the defendant would be honored, agreed, and the commissioner of correction stayed the execution until January 31, 2005, at 9 p.m. On January 31, 2005, as the death warrant issued by the trial court was about to expire,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the defendant filed a motion to intervene and for stay of execution in the District Court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>filed a motion for stay of execution in the Superior Court in which he requested that the competency hearing be reopened.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thereafter, this court entered a stay of execution until the expiration of the death warrant at midnight on January 31, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The state then filed a motion in the trial court seeking a determination as to whether the District Court\u2019s action had created a conflict of interest for Paulding. The court held a hearing on the motion on February 3 and February 10, 2005. The state stated at the hearing that the conflict that required resolution was between Paul-ding\u2019s obligation to advocate vigorously for the defendant\u2019s claim that he was competent to waive further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>legal proceedings, and Paulding\u2019s fear of losing his law license if he did so. The defendant stated that both he and Paulding continued to believe that he was competent but that Paulding did not feel that he was in the \u201cframe of mind\u201d to advise the defendant and go forward with the execution under the circumstances. The defendant further stated that the only reason that he would agree to another competency hearing was to protect Paulding\u2019s license. The court concluded that, in order to address Paulding\u2019s potential conflict of interest, it would appoint Groark as special counsel to investigate and present evidence that the defendant was incompetent. The state indicated that it did not believe that there was any \u201cnew and meaningful information\u201d to justify another competency hearing, but agreed that the appointment of special counsel was \u201cthe best way to resolve [Paulding\u2019s] dilemma . . . .\u2019\u2019At the conclusion of the February 10, 2005 hearing, the court set a new execution date of May 11, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The trial court held a competency hearing on April 7, 8, 11, 12, 13 and 14, 2005. Dan Ross, the defendant, Norko, Grassian, Goldsmith, Suzanne Gentile, who is a psychiatrist retained by Paulding on behalf of the defendant, Holdridge and John F. Tokarz, a former employee of the department of correction, testified at the hearing. The depositions of Martha Elliot, a journalist and friend, and Susan P., the defendant\u2019s girlfriend, were read into the record. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court noted that Dan Ross, Elliot and Susan P. all claimed that the defendant\u2019s stated motivations for waiving further legal proceedings were false. The court also noted that these witnesses were \u201copposed to the death penalty in general, are close friends or family of [the defendant], and do not personally support his decision to die\u201d and, therefore, were not \u201cunbiased witnesses . . . .\u201d With respect to the psychiatric testimony, the court concluded that all four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>psychiatrists agreed that the defendant suffered from sexual sadism, anxiety disorder and depression or mood disorder, all of which had been successfully controlled with medication, and personality disorder with narcissistic, borderline and antisocial traits. The court also noted that the psychiatrists had drawn conflicting conclusions about the effect of the defendant\u2019s personality disorder on his ability to make decisions. Norko and Gentile testified that his narcissism had no substantial effect on his ability to make rational choices. Grassian and Goldsmith testified that the defendant\u2019s narcissistic traits, including his grandiosity, inability to empathize, self-centeredness and arrogance, compelled him to posture as a good and noble person by claiming that his decision to waive further legal proceedings was driven by a desire to spare further pain to the families of his victims, despite his complete lack of empathy for the families. They further testified that the defendant\u2019s narcissism made it impossible for him to bear the perceived humiliation of backing down from the decision. Accordingly, they testified that the defendant was not competent and his decision was not voluntary. The court found that the testimony of Norko and Gentile was more credible than the testimony of Grassian and Goldsmith and found by a preponderance of the evidence that, although the defendant suffered from a variety of mental disorders, \u201cthose disorders taken individually or together do not substantially affect his understanding of his legal position and the options available to him . . . [or] his ability to make a rational choice among his options.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Special counsel claims on appeal that the trial court improperly determined that the state had satisfied its burden of proving that the defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to seek postconviction relief was voluntary. The state counters that: (1) this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal because special counsel is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>a nonparty and is not aggrieved by the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant is competent; and (2) if this court determines that it has jurisdiction over the appeal, the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant was competent is not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We conclude that we have jurisdiction to hear special counsel\u2019s appeal. We further conclude that special counsel\u2019s claim that the defendant\u2019s waiver of further challenges to his death sentences was \u201cinvoluntary,\u201d dependent as it is on challenging facts found by the trial court, must be construed as a claim that the defendant was not competent because his volitional capacity was impaired. Finally, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant was competent was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Before addressing the merits of special counsel\u2019s claims on appeal, we must address the state\u2019s claim that this court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the appeal. See <em>Esposito </em>v. <em>Specyalski, </em>268 Conn. 336, 348, 844 A.2d 211 (2004). \u201cA determination regarding . . . subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>Sweeney, </em>271 Conn. 193, 207, 856 A.2d 997 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">\u201c[T]he right of appeal is purely statutory. It is accorded only if the conditions fixed by statute and the rules of court for taking and prosecuting the appeal are met.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hartford </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number><em>Steam, Boiler Inspection &amp; Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s &amp; Cos. Collective, </em>271 Conn. 474, 495, 857 A.2d 893 (2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 974, 125 S. Ct. 1826, 161 L. Ed. 2d 723 (2005). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Salmon, </em>250 Conn. 147, 162-63, 735 A.2d 333 (1999), we held that, in order to establish a right of appellate review pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-263,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the appellant must establish that: \u201c(1) it was a party to the underlying action; (2) it was aggrieved by the trial court decision; and (3) the appeal is from a final judgment.\u201d We held in <em>Salmon </em>that the word \u201cparty\u201d as used in \u00a7 52-263 meant \u201cthose by or against whom a legal suit is brought . . . the party plaintiff or defendant, whether composed of one or more individuals and whether natural or legal persons.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 154. We further noted that \u201c[t]he test for determining aggrievement encompasses a . . . twofold determination: first, the party claiming aggrievement must demonstrate a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision, as distinguished from a general interest shared by the community as a whole; second, the party claiming aggrievement must establish that this specific personal and legal interest has been specifically and injuriously affected by the decision.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 163 n.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The state claims that special counsel does not meet either the test for establishing that he is a party or the test for establishing that he is aggrieved. In support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>of this claim, the state essentially argues that special counsel was appointed as an amicus curiae and, as such, had no \u201cspecific personal and legal interest [that] has been specifically and injuriously affected by the decision\u201d that would confer standing to appeal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Special counsel was appointed to advocate the position that the defendant is incompetent, however, because both the state and the defendant agreed that, under the unique circumstances of this case, Paulding was no longer capable of representing the defendant in a completely disinterested manner. They further agreed that the fairest way to resolve Paulding\u2019s \u201cdilemma\u201d was to assume that a sufficient showing of incompetence had been made to require a full-blown, adversarial competency hearing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Special counsel\u2019s role at the hearing was not to assist the trial court in an impartial manner; it was to <em>advocate </em>the position that the defendant was incompetent and, therefore, to allow him to waive further legal proceedings would violate his due process rights. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 270 (conviction of defendant who is not competent to stand trial violates due process). Thus, the trial court effectively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>severed the defendant\u2019s autonomy interest in waiving further legal proceedings, which Paulding has continuously represented to the courts, from his interest in ensuring that his due process rights were protected, and appointed special counsel for the limited purpose of representing the latter interest.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that, under the unique circumstances of this case, special counsel was acting as counsel for the defendant\u2019s interest for that limited purpose and that he was required to do so as a result of the District Court\u2019s action. We conclude, therefore, that he was an aggrieved party under \u00a7 52-263 and has standing to appeal from the trial court\u2019s determination that the defendant was competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">We emphasize that our conclusion that special counsel had standing to advocate the position that the defendant was incompetent to the trial court and to bring this appeal is limited to the specific circumstances of this case. This case is sui generis and was precipitated by Judge Chatigny\u2019s action. We do not intend to suggest that counsel representing a defendant who desires to waive further proceedings in a capital case has an inherent conflict of interest requiring the appointment of separate counsel to advocate for incompetence. As long as counsel is qualified and competent and, in the exercise of his or her independent professional judgment, believes that his or her client meets the legal standard for competence, no conflict arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">We next address the substance of special counsel\u2019s claims on appeal. At the outset, we set forth the appropriate standard of review. Special counsel argues that a determination as to the voluntariness of a waiver of constitutional rights is subject to de novo review. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>251 Conn. 285, 358-59, 743 A.2d 1 (1999), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 841, 121 S. Ct. 106, 148 L. Ed. 2d 64 (2000). The state counters that, because the trial court\u2019s competency determination was a finding of fact, it is subject to a clearly erroneous standard of review. See <em>Demosthenes </em>v. <em>Baal, </em>495 U.S. 731, 735, 110 S. Ct. 2223, 109 L. Ed. 2d 762 (1990) (state court\u2019s conclusion regarding defendant\u2019s competency to waive further challenges to death sentence is finding of fact entitled to presumption of correctness); <em>Rumbaugh </em>v. <em>Procunier, </em>753 F.2d 395, 399 (5th Cir.) (determination as to whether defendant suffers from mental disease that impairs ability to make rational decision to waive further challenges to death sentence must be accepted unless clearly erroneous), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Rumbaugh </em>v. <em>McCotter, </em>473 U.S. 919, 105 S. Ct. 3544, 87 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1985). The state further contends that because the defendant was not subject to any external coercion in reaching his decision to waive further appeals, the voluntariness of his waiver, as that concept is typically understood in connection with claims that a waiver of a constitutional right was not voluntary, is not in issue. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">It is well established that a waiver of constitutional rights must be voluntary. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Whitaker, </em>215 Conn. 739, 753, 578 A.2d 1031 (1990). In making that determination, courts look to the totality of circumstances. Id., 753-54. \u201cThose potential circumstances include . . . the <em>crucial element </em>of police coercion . . . the defendant\u2019s maturity . . . education . . . physical condition . . . and mental health . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>(Citations omitted; emphasis added.) <em>Withrow </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>507 U.S. 680, 693, 113 S. Ct. 1745, 123 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993); see also <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 165, 107 S. Ct. 515, 93 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1986) (claim that confession was involuntary requires showing of state action); <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>supra, 165-66 (rejecting claim that determining voluntariness of confession requires court to \u201cdivine a defendant\u2019s motivation for speaking or acting as he did even though there be no claim that governmental conduct coerced his decision\u201d). These cases establish that, although a defendant\u2019s mental condition is to be considered in determining whether he has voluntarily waived a constitutional right, a showing of governmental coercion is an essential factual predicate to a finding that the waiver was involuntary.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> They further establish that, although a defendant\u2019s mental condition must be considered in this context <em>to determine the extent to which it rendered him susceptible to governmental coercion, </em>the broader issue of competence is not relevant to whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>the waiver was voluntary. For example, a defendant with substantial mental disabilities voluntarily can waive the right to keep silent and such a waiver is valid regardless of whether the defendant was competent. See <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>supra, 161, 166 (confession of schizophrenic defendant who was following \u201cvoice of God\u201d was voluntary).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Some waivers require a determination that the defendant was competent, however, <em>in addition </em>to a determination that the waiver was voluntary. It is undisputed in the present case, for example, that a defendant who is shown to be incompetent cannot validly waive post-conviction challenges to a death sentence. In <em>Rees </em>v. <em>Peyton, </em>384 U.S. 312, 314, 86 S. Ct. 1505, 16 L. Ed. 2d 583 (1966), the United States Supreme Court held that the standard for competency in this context is whether the defendant \u201chas [the] capacity to appreciate his position and make a rational choice with respect to continuing or abandoning further litigation or on the other hand whether he is suffering from a mental disease, disorder, or defect which may substantially affect his capacity in the premises.\u201d At least one court has suggested that the <em>Rees </em>competency standard may have a volitional component as well as cognitive component so that a defendant who is capable of rationally understanding and evaluating his options may, nevertheless, be incompetent if he has a mental condition that substantially affects his ability to make or follow through on a rational decision. See <em>Rumbaugh </em>v. <em>Procunier, </em>supra, 753 F.2d 399.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In <em>Rumbaugh, </em>the defendant sought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>end postconviction proceedings challenging his death sentence and his parents sought standing as next friends to continue the proceedings. Id., 396. Upon finding that the defendant was competent, the District Court dismissed the next friend petition and the parents appealed. Id. On appeal, the Court of Appeals reviewed psychiatric testimony that the defendant was able to appreciate his position and that his choice to decline further challenges to his death sentence was rational; id., 399; but that he had a mental disorder, depression, that acted as a \u201ccoercive force that influence [d] him not to want to . . . exhaust his further appeals . . . .\u201d Id., 400. The court noted that the parents\u2019 claim required it to consider for the first time \u201chow a court should treat a mental disease which does not impair the cognitive function but impacts only on the volitional, the person\u2019s ability to make a rational choice among available options.\u201d Id., 399. The court ultimately rejected the claim that the defendant was incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Thus, although a voluntariness determination has a mental state component involving the defendant\u2019s susceptibility to government coercion, and although some courts have suggested that a competence determination has a volitional component, it is clear that voluntariness and volitional capacity are entirely separate legal concepts and are subject to entirely different inquiries. Whether a waiver was voluntary is determined on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>totality of the circumstances, and a showing of governmental coercion is a necessary factual predicate for a finding of involuntarmess.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Whether the defendant\u2019s volitional capacity was impaired is a component of a competency determination and requires the court to determine whether the defendant had a mental disease or defect that substantially affected his ability to make a rational choice among his options. See footnote 17 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">There is no claim of governmental coercion in this case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Accordingly, special counsel's claim that the defendant\u2019s conduct was involuntary must be construed as a claim that the defendant was incompetent because his volitional capacity was impaired. Because the ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>tion of whether the defendant\u2019s mental illness impaired his volitional capacity, i.e., whether it substantially affected his ability to make a free choice among his options, is a question of competency, it is a question of fact, not of law. See <em>Demosthenes </em>v. <em>Baal, </em>supra, 495 U.S. 735; <em>Rumbaugh </em>v. <em>Procunier, </em>supra, 753 F.2d 399. Accordingly, we must determine whether the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant was competent to waive further challenges to his death sentences was clearly erroneous. See <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>272 Conn. 722, 728, 865 A.2d 1129 (2005) (trial court\u2019s factual finding is reversible only if clearly erroneous).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">\u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it . . . or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 728-29. The general rule is that a finder of fact \u201cis free either to accept or reject, in whole or in part, the evidence presented by the .... witnesses .... [T]he credibility of the . . . expert and lay witnesses, and the weight to be given to their testimony ... is a matter committed to the sound judgment and common sense of the trier of fact.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">With respect to the burden of proof, the trial court relied on a number of federal courts that have held that, in determining whether a defendant is competent to waive further legal proceedings in a capital case, \u201c [initially sufficient evidence must be presented to cause the court to conduct an inquiry. After that point, it . . . is for the court to determine by a preponderance of the evidence whether the petitioner is mentally competent to withdraw his petition. ... [A] presumption of competency does not apply .... Instead, the question is whether, giving full and fair consideration to all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>evidence, does it establish by a preponderance that [the defendant] is competent to . . . waive further legal review of his convictions and sentences.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Comer </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>230 F. Sup. 2d 1016, 1037-38 (D. Ariz. 2002), quoting <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>5 F.3d 1220, 1225 (9th Cir. 1993).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The state argues to the contrary that there is a presumption of competence until the defendant is executed, regardless of whether a threshold showing of incompetence has been made. Cf. <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 399, 426, 106 S. Ct. 2595, 91L. Ed. 2d 335 (1986) (presumption of sanity applies until defendant is executed in death penalty case). Because we conclude in this case that the trial court\u2019s determination that the preponderance of the evidence established that the defendant\u2019s mental disorder did not substantially affect his volitional capacity so as to render him incompetent was not clearly erroneous, we need not decide whether the court should have placed the burden of proof on special counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">We now turn to a review of the trial court\u2019s analysis of the evidence. The trial court found that all four testifying psychiatrists agreed that the defendant suffered from sexual sadism, depression or mood disorder, personality disorder with narcissistic, borderline and antisocial traits and anxiety disorder. Although the experts disagreed about the precise degree of the severity of the defendant\u2019s narcissistic disorder, their disagreement on that issue was not substantial. The experts also agreed that the defendant\u2019s cognitive ability was not impaired. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>The major area of disagreement was whether the defendant\u2019s narcissistic traits, including his grandiosity, inability to empathize, self-centeredness and arrogance, substantially affected his ability to act on a rational decision whether to waive further legal proceedings. Grassian testified that, on the basis of his investigation,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> it was his opinion that the defendant\u2019s narcissism made it impossible for him to back down from his decision to waive further legal proceedings even though the conditions of his life have improved since the time that he made his decision and he now would like to live.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Specifically, Grassian believed that the defendant\u2019s grandiosity required him to take a stand that would be perceived as moral and noble, even though, in fact, he had absolutely no empathy for the families of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>victims.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> He further testified that the defendant\u2019s narcissism made it impossible for him to bear the public humiliation of reneging on his decision.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Goldsmith\u2019s testimony was substantially consistent with Grassian\u2019s testimony. Both Grassian and Goldsmith concluded that the defendant\u2019s decision was \u201cnot voluntary\u201d as a result of his narcissistic disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Norko, who has been involved in this case since 1995; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 588-90 (discussing Norko\u2019s prior involvement in this case); and Gentile also testified that the defendant\u2019s narcissism impairs his ability to empathize and that he is concerned about how he is perceived by others. They did not believe, however, that his narcissism rendered him incapable of empathy or of making a moral decision based on genuine spiritual and religious beliefs. Both Norko and Gentile identified several reasons given by the defendant for wanting to waive further legal proceedings, including his desire to do the morally right thing, to spare further pain to the families of the victims, to avoid another public airing of the horrific details of the crimes, to avoid growing old in prison, and to accept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>the inevitability of the death penalty. They acknowledged that the defendant occasionally expressed ambivalence about his decision, but concluded that that was normal and supported the conclusion that his decision was logical and rational, and not driven by an irrational compulsion. Norko believed that when the defendant stated that he had no choice but to accept the imposition of the death penalty, he meant only that it was his moral obligation to end the legal proceedings. Both Norko and Gentile concluded that the defendant\u2019s narcissism did not have a substantial effect on his ability to make and follow through on rational choices.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The trial court also took note of the voluminous writings by the defendant that were placed into evidence. At certain times during his incarceration, the defendant wrote monthly letters, entitled \u201cWalking with Michael,\u201d in which he reported developments in this case and in his life, expressed his feelings about his situation and set forth religious thoughts and quotes. The defendant would send the letters to a friend who would then distribute them to up to 150 friends and supporters. In his writings, the defendant consistently expressed his desire to spare the families of his victims the pain of another penalty hearing. Grassian and Goldsmith saw these writings as evidence of the defendant\u2019s inability to empathize, while Norko and Gentile saw them as evidence of the defendant\u2019s genuine feelings.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Finally, the trial court noted that Dan Ross, Elliot and Susan P. all believed that the defendant\u2019s stated motivations for ending legal proceedings were false. Because these witnesses were opposed to the death penalty and were friends or family of the defendant, the trial court concluded that \u201c[t]hey do not present as unbiased witnesses to this court.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>The trial court concluded that the testimony of Norko and Gentile was more persuasive than the testimony of Grassian and Goldsmith and found by a preponderance of the evidence that, although the defendant suffers from mental disorders, none of the disorders, taken individually or together, substantially affected his understanding of his legal position and the options available to him or substantially affected his ability to make a rational choice among his options. It further concluded that the defendant\u2019s decision was \u201cthe product of a rational intellect and an unconstrained will .... [His] mental condition is not coloring his free will and dictating the outcome.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Upon careful review of the transcripts and exhibits, we conclude that the trial court reasonably could have determined that the testimony of Grassian and Goldsmith that the defendant had absolutely no ability to empathize with the families of the victims and that his stated moral and religious beliefs were entirely fraudulent was not as persuasive as the testimony of Norko and Gentile that the defendant\u2019s moral and religious sensibilities have developed over time and, although his ability to empathize is limited, it is not entirely lacking. The defendant personally testified before the trial court, which had the opportunity to gauge his appearance, demeanor, emotional affect and vocal inflections and to determine whether they were consistent with the conclusions drawn by Norko and Gentile. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Moreover, the record as a whole tended to show that the defendant has been able to develop numerous long-term friendships with people who care deeply about him and to maintain at least some contact with his family, which the trial court reasonably could have concluded would be inconsistent with a complete lack of empathy or moral sense. Accordingly, the trial court reasonably could have credited the defendant\u2019s repeated statements that his decision was driven in part by a moral desire to spare further pain to the families of his victims. None of the experts suggested that an immutable moral stance would constitute a mental disorder impairing the defendant\u2019s volitional capacity. Moreover, all of the experts agreed that the defendant\u2019s decision was driven at least in part by his own desires to appear noble and to avoid the mental pain and humiliation of permanent confinement and the possibility of yet another confrontation with the families for yet another public airing of the details of his horrendous crimes. The trial court was not compelled to conclude that these reasons were irrational or that, in the absence of a volitional impairment, they would necessarily be overridden by the defendant\u2019s conflicting desires to live and to indulge the wishes of his friends and family to remain among them. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination that the preponderance of the evidence established that the defendant\u2019s mental disorder did not substantially affect his capacity to make and act on a rational decision so as to render him incompetent was supported by the evidence and was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">In this opinion VERTEFEUILLE, ZARELLA, LAVERY and FLYNN, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-9\"> Because special counsel was uncertain whether his status as appointed special counsel would allow him to bring this appeal, he filed a writ of error raising identical issues at the same time that he filed this appeal.

Cf. <em>Bunkley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>222 Conn. 444, 459, 610 A.2d 598 (1992) (trial and ensuing appeal are not separate and distinct proceeding but part of continuum of process of adjudication).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b711-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of a capital felony who is convicted of any of the following ...

The public defender\u2019s office did not make any claim that the defendant was incompetent to waive further legal proceedings, however, until it filed the petition for certiorari in the United States Supreme Court in December, 2004, and, despite the trial court\u2019s instructions that it should provide any evidence of the defendant\u2019s incompetence to counsel for the defendant; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 588; did not produce any such evidence in any forum (with the minor exception of certain personal observations by various public defenders) until ordered by this court to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b715-8\"> We note that at the same time that the public defender\u2019s office was seeking to be appointed as the defendant\u2019s next friend in this court, Dan Ross was seeking to be appointed as his next friend in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut.

Dan Ross requested that the court enter a temporary restraining order prohibiting the defendant\u2019s execution until his competency and the constitutionality of this state\u2019s death penalty scheme were determined. On January 26,2005, the District Court, Chatigny, J., held a hearing on the petition by telephone and granted the request for a temporary restraining order. See <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Rell, </em>United States District Court, Docket No. 03:05CV00130 (D. Conn. January 26, 2003). The commissioner of correction filed an application to vacate the temporary restraining order with the United States Court, of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Court of Appeals granted the application, but stayed its order until January 30, 2005, at 12:01 a.m. See <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Lantz, </em>United States Court of Appeals, Docket No. 05-8901 (2d Cir. January 28, 2005). Dan Ross then filed an application to stay the execution and for a temporary restraining order in the United States Supreme Court. On January 28, 2005, the Supreme Court denied the application and vacated the temporary stay entered by the Court of Appeals. See <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Rell, </em>543 U.S. 1134, 125 S.

To the extent that the state claims that our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 611, required the trial court to hold special counsel to a heightened standard, we conclude for reasons set forth later in this opinion that we need not decide whether the trial court applied the proper standard of review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b723-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-263 provides: \u201cUpon the trial of all matters of fact in any cause or action in the Superior Court, whether to the court or jury, or before any judge thereof when the jurisdiction of any action or proceeding is vested in him, if either party is aggrieved by the decision of the court or judge upon any question or questions of law arising in the trial, including the denial of a motion to set aside a verdict, he may appeal to the court having jurisdiction from the final judgment of the court or of such judge, or from the decision of the court granting a motion to set aside a verdict, except in small claims cases, which shall not be appealable, and appeals as provided in sections 8-8 and 8-9.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b724-6\"> \u201cHistorically, amicus curiae was defined as one who interposes in a judicial proceeding to assist the court by giving information, or otherwise, or who conduces] an investigation or other proceeding on request or appointment therefor by the court. ...

For the reasons set forth more fully in the body of this opinion, we conclude that the court in <em>Wilkins </em>improperly conflated the issue of voluntariness, as that concept typically is understood in the context of waiver of constitutional rights, with the issue of whether the defendant was capable not only of reaching a rational decision, but also of exercising his volition in accordance with his decision, which is a question of competence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b728-7\"> In <em>Rumbaugh, </em>the court stated that the <em>Rees </em>test \u201crequires the answer to three questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">\u201c(1) Is the person suffering from a mental disease or defect?</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">\u201c(2) If the person is suffering from a mental disease or defect, does that disease or defect prevent him from understanding his legal position and the options available to him?</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">\u201c(3) If the person is suffering from a mental disease or defect which does not prevent him from understanding his legal position and the options available to him, does that disease or defect, nevertheless, prevent him from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>making a rational choice among his options?\u201d <em>Rumbaugh </em>v. <em>Procunier, </em>supra, 753 F.2d 398.

Cf. <em>Rees </em>v. <em>Peyton, </em>supra, 384 U.S. 314 (defendant is incompetent if mental disorder <em>substantially affects </em>ability to understand options and make decision). As the state also points out, the trial court in the present case applied the three prong <em>Rumbaugh </em>standard, but modified it to conform to <em>Rees.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b730-7\"> In her concurring opinion, Judge Dranginis argues that we need not decide this question in the present case. She would conclude, however, that a defendant\u2019s volitional capacity can be a dispositive factor in determining whether a waiver of constitutional rights was voluntary. Thus, she would conclude that state coercion is <em>not </em>an essential factual predicate to a finding of involuntariness. In other words, she decides the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">Judge Dranginis also argues that our decision is flawed because there is no volitional component to the competency requirement for waiving certain rights. She suggests, for example, that, under our decision, \u201c[u]nless the state has taken affirmative action to force the defendant\u2019s hand in waiving his right to counsel, it is of no significance that the defendant is incapable of exercising free will.\u201d We agree that the defendant\u2019s volitional incapacity would have no effect on a finding of <em>voluntariness </em>under that scenario. In our view, however, our decision leaves open the question of whether in another case a defendant would be able to \u201cassist in his own defense\u201d; see General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (a); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 271 (\u00a7 54-56d [a] mirrors competency standard set forth in <em>Dusky </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 80 S.

The defendant wrote a letter dated March 7, 2005, to Susan P., in which he stated: \u201cI want so badly to stay here with you. ... I want to see if you will stick around this time. But I cannot have what I want, unless I hurt someone else.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b734-7\"> Grassian testified that his belief that the defendant was incapable of empathy was based on the facts that the defendant was a serial rapist and murderer, that he had never admitted that he committed a crime or \u201ccome to grips\u201d with his own failings, and that he had continued to publish articles and grant television interviews despite the fact that he had been told that he was hurting both the families of the victims and his own family. Grassian further testified that he believed that the defendant\u2019s desire to avoid another death penalty hearing was not, as he professed, driven by concern for the families but was driven by his desire to avoid being publicly humiliated and vilified again.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b734-8\"> The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Ed. 1994) \u00a7 301.81, p. 659, published by the American Psychiatric Association, provides: \u201cVulnerability in self-esteem makes individuals with Narcissistic Personality Disorder very sensitive to \u2018injury\u2019 from criticism or defeat. Although they may not show it outwardly, criticism may haunt these individuals and may leave them feeling humiliated, degraded, hollow, and empty.

Special counsel does not identify any portions of their testimony, however, that he believes would have changed the trial court\u2019s determination that the defendant was competent if the court had given the testimony greater weight. Our review of the testimony of these lay witnesses reveals that it was consistent with the testimony of Norko and Gentile that, on the one hand, the defendant can be self-centered and lacking in empathy and is ambivalent about the consequences of waiving further challenges to his death sentences, but that, on the other hand, he also is capable of expressing care and concern for others and believes that his decision is a moral one.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b737-8\">DRANGINIS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ARhm\">concurring in the judgment. In concurring in today\u2019s judgment, I in no way am abandoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>my belief, or the reasoning underlying it, that our statutory scheme does not permit a death sentenced defendant to waive the benefit that could result from the consolidated habeas litigation, ordered by this court, challenging the constitutionality of the administration of Connecticut\u2019s death penalty system. See <em>In re Application for Writ of Habeas Corpus by Dan Ross, </em>272 Conn. 676, 717, 866 A.2d 554 (2005) <em>(Lavery </em>and <em>Dranginis, Js., </em>dissenting). Nonetheless, because that issue presently is not before the court, I do not base my decision today on that issue. Rather, I address solely the issues with which we are confronted and those that are necessary to our resolution of the claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The court today develops a new rule limiting the ability of a defendant to challenge as involuntary any waiver of a constitutional right. Because I believe that it is unnecessary for this court to decide the issue and because I believe that such a general rule is unwise, I decline to join in the court\u2019s opinion. In so far as the court has concluded that special counsel has standing to appeal the trial court\u2019s ruling, I join with the court. I also adopt, for purposes of this opinion, the majority\u2019s recitation of the facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">I agree with the majority that, although special counsel has framed the issue as one of voluntariness, the arguments made by special counsel are dependent on challenging the subsidiary facts found by the trial court that underlie its determination that the defendant\u2019s mental disorders, taken separately or together, do not affect substantially his ability to make rational choices. This argument challenges the factual determination of the defendant\u2019s volitional capacity as it relates to his competence, not whether, as a matter of law, his waiver was voluntary. See <em>Rumbaugh </em>v. <em>Procunier, </em>753 F.2d 395, 399 (5th Cir.) (determination as to whether defendant suffers from mental disease that impairs his ability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>to make rational decision to waive further challenges to death sentence must be accepted unless clearly erroneous), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Rumbaugh </em>v. <em>McCotter, </em>473 U.S. 919, 105 S. Ct. 3544, 87 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1985). As the majority has noted, our standard of review, therefore, on the issue of volitional capacity as it relates to the defendant\u2019s competence is whether the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant has volitional capacity was clearly erroneous. Id.; see also <em>Demosthenes </em>v. <em>Baal, </em>495 U.S. 731, 735, 110 S. Ct. 2223, 109 L. Ed. 2d 762 (1990) (state court\u2019s conclusion regarding defendant\u2019s competency to waive further challenges to death sentence is finding of fact entitled to presumption of correctness). Only after the court concludes that the defendant is competent because he possesses volitional capacity, do we review the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s waiver was voluntary under a de novo standard of review. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb </em>251 Conn. 285, 358-59, 743 A.2d 1 (1999), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 841, 121 S. Ct. 106, 148 L. Ed. 2d 64 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">The majority has concluded that the defendant is competent and his waiver was voluntary. While I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s waiver was voluntary, I disagree with the reasoning it employs in order to reach that end.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Generally, a finding of competency and a determination of whether waiver of a constitutional right was knowing, intelligent and voluntary, is a two step process, with the competency determination being a separate and distinct inquiry. <em>Godinez </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>509 U.S. 389, 400-401, 113 S. Ct. 2680, 125 L. Ed. 2d 321 (1993) (standard of competency to waive right to counsel). This is because, in most circumstances, the level of competency required to waive a constitutional right is the same competency required to stand trial. Id., 398. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>To be competent, therefore, a defendant merely must have \u201csufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding . . . and . . . [have] a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dusky </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 80 S. Ct. 788, 4 L. Ed. 2d 824 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Although never specifically addressed, the degree of competency an individual must possess in order to waive remaining challenges to his death sentence has evolved into a somewhat different if not a somewhat higher standard. In <em>Rees </em>v. <em>Peyton, </em>384 U.S. 312, 314, 86 S. Ct. 1505, 16 L. Ed. 2d 583 (1966), the United States Supreme Court stated that the question of the defendant\u2019s competence was \u201cwhether he has [the] capacity to appreciate his position and make a rational choice with respect to continuing or abandoning further litigation or on the other hand whether he is suffering from a mental disease, disorder, or defect which may substantially affect his capacity in the premises.\u201d Several Courts of Appeal have adopted a three part inquiry to determine whether any individual defendant meets this standard of competence. This three part inquiry, first developed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, asks:</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">\u201c(1) Is the person suffering from a mental disease or defect?</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">\u201c(2) If the person is suffering from a mental disease or defect, does that disease or defect prevent him from understanding his legal position and the options available to him?</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">\u201c(3) If the person is suffering from a mental disease or defect which does not prevent him from understanding his legal position and the options available to him, does that disease or defect, nevertheless, prevent him from making a rational choice among his options?\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number><em>Rumbaugh </em>v. <em>Procunier, </em>supra, 753 F.2d 398.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court in <em>Rumbaugh </em>concluded that the third prong of this inquiry contained a volitional component; id.; a component not readily contained in the <em>Dusky </em>standard of competency. This third prong of the <em>Rumbaugh </em>competency inquiry, whether by design or consequence, lays the factual predicate necessary to determine whether, as a matter of law, a defendant\u2019s waiver of further challenges to his death sentence is voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">In the present case, because the majority concludes that the trial court reasonably could have found that the defendant possesses the volitional capacity necessary for competency under Rumbaugh's third factor, it also concludes that the defendant\u2019s waiver must have been voluntary unless evidence of external coercion existed. Under a competency standard where volition is considered and given great weight, this conclusion is logical. After all, if the defendant has the volitional capacity to make a reasoned choice, he also must have the volitional capacity to effect a voluntary waiver. The majority\u2019s conclusion, therefore, that external coercion is a necessary factual predicate to a determination of involuntary waiver, is of little significance until one realizes that the majority\u2019s conclusion applies to <em>all </em>waivers of constitutional rights, not only to the waiver of further challenges to sentences of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">To see that this is the effect of the majority\u2019s conclusion, one need only look so far as the cases to which they cite for the proposition that external coercion is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>a necessary predicate finding to a determination of involuntary waiver. The case on which the majority relies is <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 167, 107 S. Ct. 515, 93 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1986), which held that government coercion or state action was necessary for a determination that a <em>confession or waiver of Miranda rights </em>was involuntary under federal constitutional law. The <em>Connelly </em>court explained that because the main threat in the area of involuntary confessions is police overreaching, it logically follows that where no police coercion exists, a confession cannot be involuntary. Id., 164. This, however, is not the case in all situations where waiver is necessary. For example, a threat of government coercion rarely exists where a defendant wishes to waive his right to counsel. Such a waiver, nonetheless, must be knowing, intelligent and <em>voluntary. </em>See <em>Godinez </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>supra, 509 U.S. 402. The defendant desiring to waive counsel, however, need not show volitional capacity, for the competency standard by which he is evaluated is the <em>Dusky </em>standard, not the <em>Rumbaugh </em>standard. Such an individual may have a mental disease or defect that does not impair his ability to develop a basic understanding of the proceedings in which he is involved; <em>Dusky </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 362 U.S. 402; yet that same disease or defect may affect substantially his volitional capacity. Because volitional capacity is not at issue in the determination of his competency, this impairment can be addressed solely through a determination that his waiver of his right to counsel is not voluntary. Under the new rule adopted by the majority, however, this impairment is of no consequence. Unless the state has taken affirmative action to force the defendant\u2019s hand in waiving his right to counsel, it is of no significance that the defendant is incapable of exercising free will. I cannot agree with such a formulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">In setting forth this new rule, the majority is writing on a blank page of federal law. The United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Supreme Court has not extended <em>Connelly </em>to this extent, nor has any Circuit Court of Appeals. In making this ruling, the majority also is doing as a matter of federal law what this court has been loathe to do as a matter of state law. To date, this court has not adopted the <em>Connelly </em>limitations on voluntariness, even in the area of confessions, as a matter of state law. Each time it has been faced with the question, it has declined to rule one way or the other. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Roseboro, </em>221 Conn. 430, 443-44, 604 A.2d 1286 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Northrop, </em>213 Conn. 405, 419-20, 568 A.2d 439 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>206 Conn. 213, 222, 537 A.2d 460 (1988). Furthermore, there is no need to develop this new requirement. In ruling that the defendant\u2019s waiver was voluntary, the trial court did not depend on the nonexistence of external factors, nor is this conclusion necessary to a determination that the defendant\u2019s waiver was voluntary. Rather, as indicated previously, it is enough to recognize that in a death penalty situation, where a more rigorous standard of competency is utilized, the predicate facts supporting a finding that the defendant has the volitional capacity necessary for competence also support the ultimate conclusion that the defendant is able to effect a voluntary waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion, and the reasoning it employs, that the trial court\u2019s determination that the defendant is competent was not clearly erroneous. Because I disagree with the majority that a waiver is voluntary absent state coercion, I also reach the question of whether, as a matter of law, the defendant\u2019s waiver was voluntary. I conclude that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">\u201cThe standard for an effective waiver ... is that it must be knowing and intelligent, as well as voluntary. . . . Relying on the standard articulated in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>(1938), we have adopted the definition of a valid waiver ... as the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right. ... In determining whether this strict standard has been met, a court must inquire into the totality of the circumstances of each case.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Ouellette, 271 Conn. 740, 752, 859 A.2d 907 (2004). Some of the factors that comprise the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d include but are not limited to: (1) the defendant\u2019s experience and familiarity with the legal system; (2) the defendant\u2019s level of intelligence, including his IQ; (3) his age; (4) his level of education; (5) his emotional state; and (6) the existence of any mental disease, disorder or defect. <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>198 Conn. 573, 580-81, 504 A.2d 1036 (1986). In evaluating whether, as a matter of law, the state has proved waiver by a preponderance of the evidence, we defer to the trial court\u2019s findings on subsidiary factual questions, such as those that laid the foundation for the court\u2019s determination that the defendant possesses volitional capacity. See <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>supra, 479 U.S. 168; <em>State </em>v. <em>Whitaker, </em>215 Conn. 739, 753, 578 A.2d 1031 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Reviewing the record in light of these factors, I conclude that the state has met its burden of proving that the defendant\u2019s waiver was voluntary by a preponderance of the evidence. Although not at issue in this appeal, it is clear from the defendant\u2019s own testimony, as well as the testimony of all four psychiatrists, that the defendant can effect a knowing and intelligent waiver, as he has a thorough understanding of all his legal options and the consequences of exercising or not exercising any one of those options. Furthermore, the subsidiary facts that provided the bases for the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant has the necessary volitional capacity to be competent to waive further appeals and collateral challenges to his sentences of death, as well as the lack of any evidence of death row <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>syndrome or segregated housing unit syndrome, leads me to conclude that, as a matter of law, his waiver of further challenges is a voluntary one that meets the standards of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>supra, 304 U.S. 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">I, therefore, concur in the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b741-8\"> Both the Second Circuit and this court have neither adopted nor rejected the <em>Rumbaugh </em>three part inquiry. The only other circuit to have addressed the adoption or rejection of the <em>Rumbaugh </em>analysis explicitly is the Eleventh Circuit, which has adopted it. See <em>Lonchar </em>v. <em>Zant, </em>978 F.2d 637, 641-42 (11th Cir. 1992). The Ninth Circuit has neither adopted nor rejected the <em>Rumbaugh </em>formulation, though, like this court, it used the three part test when that test was used by a District Court considering a death sentenced defendant\u2019s competency.

My position on the death penalty should be of no surprise even to the most casual reader of the Connecticut Reports because, in my nearly thirteen years as a member of this court, I have written exhaustively of my \u201clongstanding belief that the death penalty has no place whatsoever in a civilized and rational criminal justice system . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>272 Conn. 577, 613, 863 A.2d 654 (2005) <em>(Norcott, J., </em>concurring). I agree with the majority\u2019s well reasoned resolution of the jurisdictional and competency issues that this case presents us with, despite the ineluctable fact that this court\u2019s decision in the present case clears one of the last remaining obstacles to Connecticut\u2019s first execution in nearly forty-five years. I write separately not to repeat any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>arguments that I previously have made in other opinions, but only to state that the present case is a paradigmatic illustration of how the death penalty is an \u201cincredibly costly, frustratingly lengthy and emotionally draining part of our criminal jurisprudence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>269 Conn. 213, 394, 849 A.2d 648 (2004) <em>(Norcott, J., </em>dissenting). Accordingly, I dissent from the result of the majority decision, because it will lead to the execution of a human being at the hands of the state of Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">In most ordinary litigation, civil or criminal, a party\u2019s decision to accept or to stipulate to a certain result either simplifies greatly or resolves finally the proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant, Michael Ross, is, however, no ordinary defendant, and this is no ordinary case. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Rizzo, </em>266 Conn. 171, 226, 833 A.2d 363 (2003) (\u201c[d]eath is different\u201d). This case illustrates, however, the sheer irrationality of the capital punishment system because this defendant\u2019s election to forgo further appeals or collateral relief, a decision that in any other context would lend some economy to the proceedings, has in fact spawned seemingly endless litigation over his fate. This defendant\u2019s choice has led to: (1) competency hearings before the trial court in October and December, 2004, which were reviewed by this court following the filing of a writ of error by the office of the chief public defender, who had sought to enter the case as the defendant\u2019s next friend;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) separate state habeas corpus proceedings brought by the office of the chief public defender and the defendant\u2019s father, both of which subsequently were reviewed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>this court following writs of error;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (3) a separate proceeding brought against the board of pardons and paroles;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (4) the most recent six day competency hearing, presently under review in this appeal; and (5) a variety of collateral proceedings in the federal courts, from the local District Court through to the United States Supreme Court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> I do not dispute the need for an abundance of caution given the tremendous stakes of this case; indeed, after the execution has taken place, no court will have the option of reconsideration. These proceedings have, however, been cruel and traumatic for the victims\u2019 families and a significant part of the punishment for the defendant himself, and also have come at great financial cost for all parties involved, as well as the courts. And yet, at the end of the day, the question remains: After the execution, what will the state of Connecticut have gained from all of this? The answer seems to be that, minimally, the state has secured the proverbial pound of flesh for the crimes of this one outrageously cruel man. But now, what is to be? Has our thirst for this ultimate penalty now been slaked, or do we, the people of Connecticut, continue down this increasingly lonesome road?</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">I opened this opinion by mentioning that my opposition to the death penalty has often been set forth in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Connecticut Reports. I close with my belief that the totality of the costs that are attendant to capital punishment vastly outweigh its marginal benefits. Hopefully, the death penalty jurisprudence reported in those volumes soon will become nothing more than legal artifacts of interest and import not to the active bench and bar, but only to historians. Until such time, however, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-8\"> See <em>In re Application for Writ of Habeas Corpus by Dan Ross, </em>272 Conn. 676, 690-716, 866 A.2d 554 (2005) <em>(Norcott, J., </em>dissenting from order); <em>State </em>v. <em>Peeler, </em>271 Conn. 338, 464, 857 A.2d 808 (2004) <em>(Katz, J., </em>with whom <em>Norcott, J., </em>joins, dissenting); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>269 Conn. 213, 392-93, 849 A.2d 648 (2004) <em>(Norcott, J,, </em>dissenting); <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>264 Conn. 327, 446-49, 824 A.2d 778 <em>(Norcott, J., </em>dissenting), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1055, 124 S.
