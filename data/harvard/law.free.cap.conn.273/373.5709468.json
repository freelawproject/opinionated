The trial court granted the motions of the defendants Savin Rock Condominium Association, Inc. (Savin Rock), and Group Concepts Management, Inc. (Group Concepts),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to dismiss the complaints due to the commission\u2019s lack of jurisdiction and rendered judgment thereon. We conclude that the commission\u2019s failure to adhere to the time limitations imposed by \u00a7 46a-64c (f) does not serve as a jurisdictional bar and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The record discloses the following undisputed facts. On September 6, 2000, Patricia Wright-Khan filed two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>complaints with the commission,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> alleging that she had been discriminated against by Savin Rock and Group Concepts because of her race, color and disabilities in violation of \u00a7 46a-64c when she was denied equal services associated with her housing ownership. Specifically, Wright-Kahn alleged that Savin Rock and Group Concepts had failed to make certain repairs to her condominium unit and had performed other repairs inadequately, had failed to protect her from her neighbors\u2019 discriminatory harassment, and had failed to accommodate reasonably her disabilities. On September 4, 2001, she amended her complaints to assert claims on behalf of her minor son, Robert McCormack. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaints, asserting that the commission had divested itself of jurisdiction by failing to complete a timely investigation and disposition of the complaints pursuant to \u00a7 46a-64c (f). On March 28, 2002, the commission sent notice to the parties, pursuant to \u00a7 46a-64c (f), informing them that it was unable to complete its investigation within the statutory time frame. The defendants objected to the commission\u2019s late notice and filed a request for a hearing on their motions to dismiss. The commission did not hold a hearing, and it denied the motions by way of a letter dated April 2, 2002. The commission thereafter denied the defendants\u2019 motions for reconsideration. On September 27, 2002, following an investigation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46a-83 (d),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6the commission issued a finding of reasonable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>On October 4,2002, the defendants elected to proceed in a civil action in lieu of an administrative appeal, pursuant to \u00a7 46a-83 (d). See footnote 5 of this opinion. In response to the defendants\u2019 notice of election, the commission filed two civil complaints dated November 12, 2002, on behalf of Wright-Kahn, McCormack and commissioner Andrew M. Norton. See footnotes 2 and 4 of this opinion. On January 27, 2003, the defendants moved to dismiss the action, claiming that the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction because the commission had not conducted a timely investigation and had not issued a timely final administrative disposition as required under \u00a7 46a-64c (f). Additionally, the defendants claimed that the commission\u2019s failure to notify them of its intent to pursue the investigation until well after the statutory deadlines had lapsed deprived them of their rights to due process. The commission filed a memorandum of law in opposition to the motions to dismiss asserting that it had complied with \u00a7 46a-64c (f) by sending notice to the parties that the commission had found it impracticable to complete the investigation within the time periods set forth in the statute. Additionally, the commission contended that its failure to meet the time deadlines did not cause it, or concomi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>tantly the trial court, to lose jurisdiction over the complaints. The trial court concluded that the deadlines were mandatory and, therefore, the commission\u2019s failure to meet them divested the commission of jurisdiction. Accordingly, the trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the complaints and thereafter denied the commission\u2019s motion for reargument. The commission then filed the present appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The commission claims that its failure to comply with \u00a7 46a-64c (f) did not divest it of jurisdiction over the complaint. Specifically, it contends that the trial court improperly dismissed the action because, even if the commission had not investigated and made a final disposition of the complaints within the time periods prescribed by \u00a7 46a-64c (f), these facts did not deprive the commission, and concomitantly the trial court, of subject matter jurisdiction. The defendants assert in response that the mandatory time requirements of \u00a7 46a-64c (f) are a prerequisite to jurisdiction because the legislature imposed the deadlines solely to ensure speedy resolution of discrimination claims, and this result can be achieved only through strict enforcement of the deadlines. Alternatively, the defendants contend that, even if we disagree with their jurisdictional claim, we nevertheless should affirm the judgment of the trial court because the commission\u2019s notification to the parties that it could not complete its investigation in the time prescribed by statute was so untimely that they were denied their rights to due process. We agree with the commission and reject the defendants\u2019 alternate ground for affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The principal issue involves the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the time requirements of \u00a7 46a-64c (f). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>begin with our well established principles of statutory interpretation in analyzing the commission\u2019s claim. Our legislature recently has enacted General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z, which provides: \u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extra-textual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d The present case involves not merely the meaning of the words outlining the time requirements, but, rather, requires an analysis of what jurisdictional significance, if any, the legislature intended to attach to those requirements. We do not write on a clean slate.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">In <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; </em>Opportunities, 257 Conn. 258, 266-69, 777 A.2d 645 (2001), this court, before deciding that the 180 day filing requirement for discrimination complaints under General Statutes \u00a7 46a-82 (e) is not subject matter jurisdictional, clarified the analysis for deciding whether a time limit is subject matter jurisdictional. \u201cA conclusion that a time limit is subject matter jurisdictional has very serious and final consequences. It means that, except in very rare circumstances ... a subject matter jurisdictional defect may not be waived . . . [and] may be raised at any time, even on appeal . . . and that subject matter jurisdiction, if lacking, may not be conferred by the parties, explicitly or implicitly. . . . Therefore, we have stated many times that there is a presumption in favor of subject matter jurisdiction, and we require a strong showing of legislative intent that such a time limit is jurisdictional.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 266. We recognized our inconsistent approaches in determining whether a time limitation is jurisdictional, one line of cases focusing \u201con whether the legislature intended the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>time limitation to be subject matter jurisdictional, and a second line of cases . . . focus [ing] on whether the statutory provision is mandatory or directory.\u201d Id., 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">We concluded in <em>Williams </em>that a determination that a time limit is mandatory does not necessarily mean that it also is subject matter jurisdictional. Id., 269-70. \u201cAlthough we acknowledge that mandatory language may be an indication that the legislature intended a time requirement to be jurisdictional, such language alone does not overcome the strong presumption of jurisdiction, nor does such language alone prove strong legislative intent to create a jurisdictional bar. In the absence of such a showing, mandatory time limitations must be complied with absent an equitable reason for excusing compliance, including waiver or consent by the parties. Such time limitations do not, however, implicate the subject matter jurisdiction of the agency or the court.\u201d Id. Therefore, in deciding whether the filing requirement of \u00a7 46a-82 (e) implicates the commission\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, we examined in <em>Williams </em>whether the legislature, in imposing the time limitation, intended to impose a subject matter jurisdictional requirement and concluded that, despite statutory language that appeared mandatory, the genealogy and legislative history of the statute, as well as our case law addressing the policy underlying the statute, reflected a legislative intent not to impose a jurisdictional bar to complaints filed after the prescribed period. Id., 270-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">We therefore turn to the question in the present case of whether the legislature, in imposing the time limitation in \u00a7 46a-64c (f), intended to impose a subject matter jurisdictional requirement. Section 46a-64c (f) provides in relevant part that \u201ccomplaints alleging a violation of this section shall be investigated within one hundred days of filing and a final administrative disposition shall be made within one year of filing unless it is impractica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>ble to do so. If the [commission] is unable to complete its investigation or make a final administrative determination within such time frames, it shall notify the complainant and the respondent in writing of the reasons for not doing so.\u201d Although the word \u201cshall\u201d certainly reflects the legislature\u2019s intent to have the commission fulfill its obligation to investigate and issue a final determination on a complaint within the time limitations set forth in the statute, that obligation must be read in conjunction with the language that follows the limitations period\u2014\u201cunless it is impracticable to do so\u201d\u2014 expressly excusing the commission\u2019s noncompliance. That statutory proviso, in conjunction with the notice requirement that follows, indicates the legislature\u2019s recognition that there may be instances in which it is not practicable to conduct a full investigation and issue a final decision within the time limitations and, thus, its intention to provide a condition under which the commission\u2019s noncompliance is excused. Indeed, to construe the statute as reflecting an intent to divest the commission of jurisdiction over the complaint would render the notice requirement essentially meaningless. In other words, the presumption in favor of jurisdiction is reinforced, not undermined, by the statute\u2019s plain language.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Reference to General Statutes \u00a7 46a-82e, a statute setting forth remedies for the commission\u2019s failure to adhere to certain time limitations applicable to discrimination claims other than housing claims, reinforces that assessment. See <em>Cagiva North America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schenk, </em>239 Conn. 1, 12, 680 A.2d 964 (1996) (\u201c[w]hen construing a statute, we may look for guidance to other statutes relating to the same general subject matter, as the legislature is presumed to have created a consistent body of law\u201d). Section 46a-82e (a) provides: \u201cNotwithstanding the failure of the [commission] to comply with the time requirements of [General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7] 46a-83 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>46a-84 with respect to a complaint before the commission, the jurisdiction of the commission over any such complaint shall be retained.\u201d The legislature enacted \u00a7 46a-82e in response to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Angelsea Productions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>236 Conn. 681, 700, 674 A.2d 1300 (1996), wherein we held that the commission\u2019s failure to comply with statutory timelines under \u00a7 46a-83 or \u00a7 46a-84 for investigating a complaint deprived the commission of jurisdiction to adjudicate complaints pending before it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 281 (noting that legislature\u2019s enactment of Public Acts 1996, No. 96-241, and Public Acts 1998, No. 98-245, \u201csignaled its disapproval of <em>Angelsea Productions, Inc.\u201d). </em>In the absence of flexible language in either \u00a7 46a-83 or \u00a7 46a-84, such as that set forth in the statute at issue here, the saving provision in \u00a7 46a-82e was necessary to save the complaints over which the commission could lose jurisdiction. Having saved expressly from the jaws of subject matter jurisdiction claims of employment discrimination, which account for a broad category of discrimination claims, it runs counter to reason to ascribe a different and indeed harsher legislative intent with regard to claims of housing discrimination. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirk R., </em>271 Conn. 499, 525, 857 A.2d 908 (2004) (It is well established \u201cthat the legislature is always presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law .... [T]his tenet of statutory construc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>tion . . . requires [this court] to read statutes together when they relate to the same subject matter .... Accordingly, [i]n determining the meaning of a statute ... we look not only at the provision at issue, but also to the broader statutory scheme to ensure the coherency of our construction.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]). Indeed, ascribing such an intent would seem particularly incongruous in light of the fact that the legislature imposed shorter time limitations for the adjudication of housing discrimination claims than for other types of discrimination claims. Compare General Statutes \u00a7 46a-64c (f) (prescribing one year limitation period for final disposition of housing discrimination claim) with General Statutes \u00a7 46a-82e (d) (1) (prescribing procedure for compelling finding of reasonable cause in other discrimination cases when complaint has been pending for more than two years).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">We further note that, not only would the imposition of a jurisdictional bar in \u00a7 46a-64c (f) create an inconsistency in the treatment of housing and nonhousing discrimination cases, it also would create an internally inconsistent reading of the time periods governing housing discrimination complaints themselves. Section 46a-64c (f) controls only the relevant time period for investigation, whereas \u00a7 46a-83 (d) controls the time period for the investigator\u2019s finding of reasonable cause, which triggers the right to a hearing. The latter statute applies to any discrimination complaint and, as we just have noted, is subject to the relaxed standard of \u00a7 46a-82e (a); thus that time period is nonjurisdictional. A construction of \u00a7 46a-64c that, because of a failure to investigate timely, would bar an administrative hearing over a claim of housing discrimination while allowing a potentially indefinite period for a determination of reasonable cause, creates an internal inconsistency that suggests an unintended result in view of the remedial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>purpose of our laws prohibiting discrimination.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Thames Talent, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>265 Conn. 127, 138, 827 A.2d 659 (2003) (noting rule of construction that we do not interpret statutes to reach bizarre or absurd results).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Our construction of \u00a7 46a-64c (f) is consistent with the federal courts\u2019 interpretation of the analogous provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601 et seq. The genesis of and purpose behind Connecticut\u2019s current fair housing statute are reflected in the title of the enacting legislation, \u201cAn Act Adopting the Comprehensive Connecticut Fair Housing Statute Conforming to the Federal Fair Housing Act\u201d; Public Acts 1990, No. 90-246 (P.A. 90-246); which was codified as \u00a7 46a-64c.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As then Senator Richard Blumenthal remarked at the adoption of the legislation, \u201c[t]his is landmark legislation . . . that sets out a separate fair housing act with all the standards and assurances that exist under Federal law. Indeed, it incorporates the federal standards into our state statute . . . .\u201d33 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>S. Proc., Pt. 11, 1990 Sess, p. 3494.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> With the intent of creating a state antidiscrimination housing statute consistent with its federal counterpart, the legislature adopted \u00a7 46a-64c and related provisions. The notice provision in \u00a7 46a-64c (f) conforms the state\u2019s time limitations to those of its federal counterpart, specifically, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3610 (a) (1), which provides in relevant part: \u201c(B) Upon the filing of [a housing discrimination] complaint . . . (iv) the Secretary [of the Department of Housing and Urban Development] shall make an investigation of the alleged discriminatory housing practice and complete such investigation within 100 days after the filing of the complaint . . . unless it is impracticable to do so. (C) If the Secretary is unable to complete the investigation of the complaint within 100 days after the filing of the complaint . . . the Secretary shall notify the complainant and respondent in writing of the reasons for not doing so.\u201d Furthermore, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3610 (g) (1) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe Secretary shall, within 100 days after the filing of the complaint . . . determine based on the facts whether reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, unless it is impracticable to do so .... If the Secretary is unable to make the determination within 100 days after the filing of the complaint . . . the Secretary shall notify the complainant and respondent in writing of the reasons for not doing so.\u201d As is immediately apparent, the 100 day time period in \u00a7 46a-64c (f) mir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>rors the federal provisions, sharing the same \u201cunless it is impracticable to do so\u201d language.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">In construing a Connecticut statute that is similar to federal law, we often turn to decisions construing the federal law for guidance. <em>Nussbaum </em>v. <em>Kimberly Timbers, Ltd., </em>271 Conn. 65, 73 n.6, 856 A.2d 364 (2004) (\u201c[i]n construing a Connecticut statute that is similar to federal law, we are guided by federal case law\u201d). We previously have applied this principle in the context of discrimination claims. See, e.g., <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>236 Conn. 96, 103, 671 A.2d 349 (1996) (\u201cwe review federal precedent concerning employment discrimination for guidance in enforcing our own antidiscrimination statutes\u201d). Indeed, when the overlap between state and federal law is deliberate, as in this case, federal decisions are particularly persuasive. <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>232 Conn. 91, 108, 653 A.2d 782 (1995).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">A review of federal case law on the question of the jurisdictional nature of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3610 (a) (1) (B) (iv) and (C) and (g) (1) overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the 100 day time limit is not jurisdictional. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Salvation Army, </em>United States District Court, Docket No. 96CV2415, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 882 (S.D.N.Y. January 30, 1997), the court held that the failure of the federal Department of Housing and Urban <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Development (department) to notify a housing owner that the department was unable to complete its investigation within 100 days did not require the dismissal of the discrimination complaint. The facts of that case reflect that the department had not made a determination more than three years after the filing of the complaint, and it had not notified the property owner that it would be unable to complete the investigation within 100 days. Id., 3. The court reasoned: \u201cIn interpreting similar statutory language under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq.], the [United States Court of Appeals for the] Second Circuit held that a statutory time period is not mandatory unless it both expressly requires an agency . . . to act within a particular time period and specifies a consequence for failure to comply with the provision. <em>St. Regis Mohawk Tribe, New York </em>v. <em>Brock, </em>769 F.2d 37, 41-42 (2d Cir. 1985) (citing cases) [cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1140, 106 S. Ct. 2245, 90 L. Ed. 2d 692 (1986)]. When Congress does not specify a penalty for failure to meet a specific deadline, this Court declines to create one by dismissing the complaint. Such a result penalizes the private citizen who is not responsible for the Government\u2019s failure to meet the deadline. See <em>Brock </em>v. <em>Pierce County, </em>476 U.S. 253, 261-62, 106 S. Ct. 1834, [90 L. Ed. 2d 248] (1986).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Salvation Army, </em>supra, 3-4. Thereafter, the District Court concluded that, although it was not required to dismiss the complaint for lack of compliance with the statute on jurisdictional grounds, it nevertheless could dismiss the complaint based on the defense of laches. Id., 5-7 (concluding that limited admission of certain evidence was more appropriate remedy for government\u2019s delay than dismissal).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Several other federal courts similarly have determined that the time frames contained in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3610 do not serve as a jurisdictional bar. See <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>v. <em>Sea Winds of Marco, Inc., </em>893 F. Sup. 1051, 1055 (M.D. Fla. 1995) (procedural violations under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3610 do not raise jurisdictional issues); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nally, </em>867 F. Sup. 1446, 1451-52 (N.D. Cal. 1994) (concluding that impracticability exception contained in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3610 evidences Congress\u2019 anticipation that there would be times where 100 day deadline could not be met and thus deadline is not mandatory); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gorman Towers Apartments, </em>857 F. Sup. 1335, 1340 (W.D. Ark. 1994) (holding that 100 day time limit does not operate as jurisdictional bar); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Beethoven Associates Ltd. Partnership, </em>843 F. Sup. 1257, 1264 (N.D. Ill. 1994) (100 day period is neither jurisdictional bar nor statute of limitations); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Curlee, </em>792 F. Sup. 699, 700 (C.D. Cal. 1992) (100 day period not mandatory and does not raise jurisdictional issue). Most telling is the District Court\u2019s observation in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Beethoven Associates Ltd. Partnership, </em>supra, 1262, that \u201c[i]f the 100-day limit is construed as a jurisdictional provision, the effect of that construction will be to bar those with potentially valid claims from recovery because of [the department\u2019s] delays. Such a result is patently inconsistent with the intent of the Fair Housing Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Therefore, the federal courts have concluded that the 100 day period cannot be jurisdictional because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3610 (g) \u201ccontains the \u2018impracticability\u2019 qualification and fails to specify the consequences of [the department\u2019s] noncompliance . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>788 F. Sup. 1555, 1559 (D. Kan. 1992); accord <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Secretary, United States Dept. of Housing &amp; Urban Development, </em>3 F.3d 951, 956 (6th Cir. 1993); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Taigen &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>303 F. Sup. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>1129, 1147 (D. Idaho 2003); <em>United States v. Forest Dale, Inc., </em>818 F. Sup. 954, 966 (N.D. Tex. 1993). While not enamored with the delay experienced by complainants, courts agree with the sentiment expressed in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nally, </em>supra, 867 F. Sup. 1451-52, that \u201cthe purpose and policy behind the Fair Housing Act is to vindicate the civil rights of complainants who are subject to housing discrimination. ... In 1988, Congress enacted the 100-day provisions to hasten, not foreclose, complainants\u2019 access to a forum. ... If the courts were to construe the 100-day limit as a jurisdictional requirement, many potential claimants would be deprived of recovery under the [Fair Housing] Act solely because of [the department\u2019s] delays. . . . Such a result would be inconsistent with [that act\u2019s] purpose, especially in consideration of the great principle of public policy, applicable to all governments alike, which forbids that the public interests should be prejudiced by the negligence of the officers or agents to whose care they are confided.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Although we are not bound to follow the federal courts\u2019 construction of the federal counterpart to our statute, we find the courts\u2019 reasoning persuasive. Indeed, if we were to adopt the defendants\u2019 view, meritorious discrimination claims could be barred even when circumstances beyond the control of the commission or the complainant preclude adherence to the statutory deadlines. In our view, there is no evidence that the legislature intended for the time limitation to serve as a jurisdictional bar. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">As an alternate ground for affirmance, the defendants claim that the commission, by notifying the defendants 568 days after the complaint had been filed of its inability to complete its investigation, violated their rights to due process.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The commission raises a number of procedural defects that it contends should bar our review of this claim.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The commission also contends that we should not consider this claim because the defendants presented no evidence at trial on the issue of prejudice. Although we do not countenance the delay that occurred in the present case, we agree that the defendants have failed to establish prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">In the present case, the delay apparently stemmed, in whole or in part, from a dispute as to whether the defendants were required to produce, in the absence of a subpoena, certain documents the commission requested pursuant to its investigation of Wright-Khan\u2019s complaint. The commission never indicated to the defendants that their failure to produce the document would delay its investigation. Indeed, the defendants contend that the commission indicated that it would decide the case on the evidence before it if the documents were not produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Other than the passage of time itself, however, the defendants failed to present to the trial court <em>any </em>factual basis to support its position that they in fact had been prejudiced by the delay. On the contrary, the defendants asserted in their memorandum of law in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>support of the motions to dismiss that no evidence was necessary, and they made no further attempt to show any prejudice to them as a result of the time delay.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, even if we were to overlook the defendants\u2019 procedural defects in raising this claim; see footnote 15 of this opinion; in the absence of any showing of harm at trial, this court reasonably cannot evaluate the defendants\u2019 due process claim. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Forest Dale, Inc., </em>supra, 818 F. Sup. 966 (examining facts of case and concluding that respondents failed to prove prejudice despite department\u2019s failure to issue discrimination charge until 582 days after complainant filed first complaint). \u201cDue process is inherently fact-bound because due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands. . . . The constitutional requirement of procedural due process thus invokes a balancing process that cannot take place in a factual vacuum.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Thalheim v. Greenwich, </em>256 Conn. 628, 648, 775 A.2d 947 (2001); see also <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>189 Conn. 471, 476, 457 A.2d 290 (noting that due process \u201cis not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), appeal dismissed, 464 U.S. 801, 104 S. Ct. 46, 78 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">We note, however, that our decision should not be construed by the commission to countenance such an extensive delay beyond the statutorily prescribed deadlines absent extraordinary circumstances, which clearly did not arise in the present case. Indeed, even if we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>were to assume that the defendants\u2019 failure to produce the documents delayed the investigation, we can glean no explanation in the record for the commission\u2019s failure to provide timely notice to both parties that this failure could result in such a delay nor for the commission\u2019s delay in proceeding once it should have become clear that the defendants did not intend to produce the documents in the absence of a subpoena. Delays of this magnitude are contrary to the interests of both complainants and respondents and contravenes the commission\u2019s mandate to ensure prompt resolution of discrimination complaints. See <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Secretary, United States Dept. of Housing &amp; Urban Development, </em>supra, 3 F.3d 957 (Stating in the context of delayed processing of housing complaints that \u201cthe principal purpose of both the [Fair Housing Act and the Fair Housing Amendments Act] is to vindicate the rights of persons who suffer discrimination in housing. Nevertheless, those against whom complaints are made are entitled to fair treatment as well.\u201d). We caution the commission that our conclusion that the defendants failed to establish a due process violation in the present case does not mean that we will not recognize one in an appropriate case in the future. See, e.g., <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em>592 F.2d 484, 485-87 (8th Cir. 1979) (reversing in part and affirming in part trial court\u2019s summary judgment rendered in favor of respondent due to Equal Employment Opportunities Commission\u2019s delay in bringing Title VII action for racial discrimination); see also <em>Baumgardner </em>v. <em>Secretary, United States Dept. of Housing &amp; Urban Development, </em>960 F.2d 572, 579 (6th Cir. 1992) (recognizing due process claim in context of defendant department\u2019s delays in carrying out statutory procedures and concluding that while there was no denial of due process, \u201cdeficiencies [had] adverse effect with regard to ascertaining fair and reasonable damages\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to deny the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss and for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b399-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46a-64c (f) provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, complaints alleging a violation of this section shall be investigated within one hundred days of filing and a final administrative disposition shall be made within one year of filing unless it is impracticable to do so.

See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-82c and 46a-82d (addressing complaints filed after January 1, 1996). The legislature thereafter enacted Public Acts 1998, No. 98-245, to clarify its intent that the commission retain jurisdiction over <em>future </em>complaints in the event that the commission should fail to comply with the time limitations. See General Statutes \u00a7 46a-82e (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b408-6\"> Indeed, the defendants\u2019 construction of \u00a7 46a-64c would lead to a further inconsistency.

See Public Acts 1959, No. 113. Thereafter, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which provided greater specificity and protection against discrimination than Connecticut\u2019s fair housing laws. See Civil Rights Act of 1968, Pub. L. No. 90-284, tit. VHI, \u00a7\u00a7 801 through 819, 82 Stat. 73, 81-89. The federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 then threw state and federal law further out of alignment. See Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-430, \u00a7 5, 102 Stat. 1619 (codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3062 [k]). It was to bridge these gaps that Connecticut\u2019s legislature enacted P.A. 90-246. See footnote 10 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b409-5\"> Then Attorney General Clarine Nardi Riddle testified before the judiciary committee in support of the bill underlying P.A. 90-246 that, \u201c[i]n 1988 Congress passed federal fair housing amendments which mandate that states must have fair housing laws that are substantially equivalent to the federal fair housing laws as specified by the regulations of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Failure to obtain this equivalency will result in the loss of federal reimbursement funding. This [bill] accomplishes the requirements through technical and substantive amendments to our current laws to make it conform with the federal law.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 3, 1990 Sess., pp. 1000-1001.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b410-7\"> This court also has recognized, however, that \u201cunder certain circumstances, federal law defines \u2018the beginning and not' the end of our approach to the subject.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>211 Conn. 464, 470, 559 A.2d 1120 (1989), quoting <em>Evening Sentinel </em>v. <em>National Organization for Women, </em>168 Conn. 26, 34-35 n.5, 357 A.2d 498 (1975). Consequently, on occasion, we have interpreted our statutes even more broadly than their federal counterparts, to provide <em>greater </em>protections to our citizens, especially in the area of civil rights. The defendants\u2019 proposed interpretation, which would result in the dismissal of discrimination complaints, leads to the opposite result and thus does not support diverting from the federal courts\u2019 construction of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b412-6\"> Although, the defendants argue that the inclusion of the terms \u201cfinal,\u201d \u201cwithin,\u201d \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cdisposition\u201d in \u00a7 46a-64c provides a strong indication of the legislature\u2019s intent to impose jurisdictional requirements, we note that those same terms are all derived from the federal statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b413-6\"> Thus, we disagree with the defendants\u2019 claim that, because our legislature imposed a deadline to ensure speedy resolution of discrimination claims, it decided to do so even at the cost of the dismissal of untimely resolved, but meritorious, claims when the commission has given notice to the parties of the impracticability of its adherence to the deadlines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b414-8\"> The period cited by the defendants reflects the lapse of time following Wright-Kahn\u2019s filing of her original complaint. The commission\u2019s notice was issued approximately seven months after she filed her amended complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b414-9\"> The commission contends, inter alia, that the defendants\u2019 violation of Practice Book \u00a7 63-4 (a) (1) (A) by failing to file a statement of alternate grounds upon which the judgment can be affirmed and their failure to seek an articulation from the trial court regarding its due process claim deprives the defendants of the ability to raise this issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b415-7\"> The defendants asserted in their memorandum of law in support of their motions to dismiss that, had the commission issued a subpoena to compel them to produce the documents, they could have filed a motion to quash, which in turn would have given both the defendants and the commission an opportunity to weigh the delay in contesting or seeking the documents against the value of the documents. Although we agree with the underlying argument, this contention does not evidence prejudice resulting from the delay as would, for example, an inability to produce witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
