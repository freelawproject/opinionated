The Appellate Court concluded that it could do so. <em>Piersa </em>v. <em>Phoenix Ins. Co., </em>82 Conn. App. 752, 753, 848 A.2d 485 (2004). We disagree with that conclusion and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The plaintiff, Stephen Piersa, brought this action against the defendant city of Hartford<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for uninsured motorist benefits. The defendant moved for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. The court then rendered judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. This certified appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">The facts and procedural history are undisputed, as stated by the Appellate Court. \u201cOn January 15, 1997, the plaintiff was employed by the defendant as a police officer. On that date, while responding to a call for assistance, the plaintiff sustained personal injuries when an uninsured motor vehicle collided with his police cruiser. As a result of the injuries he sustained, the plaintiff incurred medical expenses and lost time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>from his employment. The defendant paid him $42,261.69 in compensation benefits due to his injuries and financial loss. At the time of the accident, the defendant was a self-insured municipality with uninsured motorist coverage limits of $20,000 per person and $40,000 per occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\u201cThe plaintiff commenced this action, seeking uninsured motorist benefits from his own insurance carrier, Phoenix Insurance Company, and the defendant. Only his claim against the defendant is at issue in this appeal. In his amended complaint, the plaintiff alleged the facts concerning his employment and the subject collision. He also alleged that the police cruiser was a self-insured motor vehicle and that the defendant had breached its statutory duty to provide him with uninsured motorist benefits. In response, the defendant denied that it was in breach and alleged four special defenses, including one that \u2018[t]he insurance coverage on the police vehicle is offset by [workers\u2019 [compensation benefits received by [the] plaintiff. \u2019 After the plaintiff filed a single general denial of the defendant\u2019s several special defenses, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment.\u201d Id., 753-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">It is also undisputed that the only writing created by the defendant regarding the limits of its self-insured motorist coverage was its letter to the state insurance department, dated August 21, 1996, stating in relevant part as follows: \u201cThe City of Hartford will continue to be self insured for Automobile Liability, up to $500,000 per occurrence. The required Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist coverages will be self insured with limits of 20/40. ...\u201d Thus, this writing did not specifically invoke any reductions in limits on the uninsured motorist coverage permitted by statute and regulation, such as the one involved in this case, namely, the reduction for workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid. The Appellate Court concluded that \u201cthe defendant was not required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>to create a writing to reduce its uninsured motorist coverage by the amount of the compensation benefits that were paid to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Piersa </em>v. <em>Phoenix Ins. Co., </em>supra, 82 Conn. App. 768. Accordingly, the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Id. The plaintiff claims that the Appellate Court improperly so concluded. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">We begin with the common ground between the parties and certain undisputed legal propositions. Because the defendant was the owner of the police cruiser in question, a private passenger motor vehicle, it was obligated to provide insurance with respect to that vehicle in accordance with the applicable statutes: General Statutes \u00a7 38a-363 (d) (definition of \u201c \u2018[o]wner\u2019 \u201d) and (e) (definition of \u201c \u2018[p]rivate passenger motor vehicle\u2019 \u201d); and General Statutes \u00a7 38a-371 (a) (requirement that owner of private passenger motor vehicle provide security in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 38a-334 through 38a-343). That obligation required the defendant, as a self-insured municipality, \u201cto provide uninsured motorist coverage on its vehicles\u201d pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336. <em>Conzo </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>243 Conn. 677, 683 n.9, 705 A.2d 1020 (1998). Although that obligation may be discharged by virtue of an insurance policy or through self-insurance; General Statutes \u00a7 38a-371 (b) and (c); the funding mechanism for meeting that requirement is irrelevant to the defendant\u2019s obligation to comply with its obligation, because \u201cself-insurance is the functional equivalent of commercial insurance.\u201d <em>Hertz Corp. </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co., </em>245 Conn. 374, 378 n.4, 713 A.2d 820 (1998); see also General Statutes \u00a7 38a-363 (b) (terms \u201c \u2018[i]nsurer\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018insurance company\u2019 \u201d include self-insurer). There is no bar on an insurer, and therefore a self-insurer, from providing broader coverage than the minimum required by law. General Statutes \u00a7 38a-334 (b); <em>Willoughby </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>254 Conn. 404, 437 n.27, 757 A.2d 1083 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Moreover, the defendant explicitly agrees with the plaintiff that \u201c[t]he rules, exclusions and reductions that may be applicable to uninsured motorist protection are applicable whether [the] uninsured motorist protection is provided by commercial insurance or self-insurance.\u201d Those rules, exclusions and reductions are governed, not specifically by statute, but by the regulations of the insurance commissioner (commissioner) promulgated pursuant to \u00a7 38a-334 (a), which requires the commissioner to adopt such regulations \u201cwith respect to minimum provisions to be included in automobile liability insurance policies,\u201d and which provides that such regulations \u201cshall relate to the insuring agreements, exclusions, conditions and other terms applicable to . . . the uninsured motorists coverages under such policies . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The regulation of the commissioner that is applicable to this case and the meaning of which is at issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>is \u00a7 38a-334-6 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> entitled \u201cMinimum provisions for protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>against uninsured or underinsured motorists,\u201d and more specifically, subsection (d) (1) (B) thereof, which provides as follows: \u201cLimits of liability. (1) The limit of the insurer\u2019s liability may not be less than the applicable limits for bodily injury liability specified in subsection (a) of section 14-112 of the general statutes, except that the policy may provide for the reduction of limits to the extent that damages have been . . . (B) paid or are payable under any workers\u2019 compensation law . . . .\u201d See footnote 4 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">There is no dispute that the minimum applicable limits specified in General Statutes \u00a7 14-112 are $20,000 per person and $40,000 per accident, and that the defendant\u2019s letter to the commissioner specified those minimum amounts. Thus, the defendant, in its notice of self-insurance to the commissioner, specifically stated that it was opting for the minimum coverage. The letter was silent, however, regarding whether that minimum coverage would be further reduced by the reductions in limits specifically permitted by the regulation, including the reduction in limits at issue in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Consequently, the dispute centers around the meaning and effect of the following language of \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d) (1) (B) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies: \u201cexcept that the <em>policy </em>may provide for the reduction of limits\u201d to the extent of workers\u2019 compensation payments. (Emphasis added.) The dispute arises because the word \u201cpolicy\u201d is specifically defined by statute in such a way that it does not comfortably fit within a scheme of self-insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 38a-l (15) provides as follows: \u201c \u2018Policy\u2019 means any document, including attached endorsements and riders, puiporting to be an enforceable contract, which memorializes in writing some or all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>of the terms of an insurance contract.\u201d This definition applies to this case, and to \u00a7 38a-334-6 of the regulations, because the opening clause of \u00a7 38a-l provides: \u201cTerms used in this title, unless it appears from the context to the contrary, shall have a scope and meaning as set forth in this section.\u201d This definition invokes the traditionally understood insurance policy, with the characteristics of an enforceable written contract between insurer and insured, memorializing the terms of that contract. That definition does not fit comfortably within a self-insurance context because in such a context the insurer and insured are one and the same, and there is no enforceable contract between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The question presented by this case, therefore, becomes: how should we interpret the language of \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d) (1) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, \u201cexcept that the <em>policy </em>may provide for the reduction of limits,\u201d when there is no such policy within the statutory definition because the insured has chosen to be self-insured? (Emphasis added.) The parties differ on how to answer this conundrum. The plaintiff contends that the self-insured defendant must create some written document specifying, either in specific terms or by reference to the regulation, the reduction of limits that it wishes to invoke. The defendant contends that there is no statutory obligation to do so and that, by electing to be self-insured and notifying the commissioner of that election, it necessarily and as a matter of law provided for all reduction of limits that are permitted by the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">We agree with the plaintiff. We conclude that the language of the regulation must be interpreted so as to require a municipal self-insurer that wishes to impose permitted limits on its obligations as such to do so by a written document that appropriately provides for reduction of limits. We do so for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>The first reason stems from two closely related notions regarding the relationship between commercial insurers and self-insurers. One is that, by electing to become a self-insurer for its uninsured motorist coverage, pursuant to \u00a7 38a-371 (c), the defendant became the functional equivalent of both an insurer and a named insured under \u00a7 38a-336 (f). <em>Hertz Corp. </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co., </em>supra, 245 Conn. 378 n.4; <em>Conzo </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>supra, 243 Conn. 682-83. It follows from this dual role of insurer and insured that the defendant assumed the obligations of an insurer and the rights of an insured. One of its obligations as an insurer is that it \u201cprovide \u2018assurance for payment of all obligations imposed by [\u00a7 38a-371 (c)] substantially equivalent to those afforded by a policy of insurance that would comply with [that] section.\u2019 \u201d <em>Conzo </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>supra, 682-83. The second notion is that the \u201clegislature intended to create a uniform scheme of uninsured motorist insurance coverage applicable to self-insurers as well as commercial insurance carriers . . . and . . . that self-insurers have the same obligation as commercial insurers with respect to uninsured motorist laws . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 686. It would be consistent with the defendant\u2019s obligations as an insurer under \u00a7 38a-371 (c) and with that uniform legislative scheme to require the defendant to create a written document specifying its selected reductions in limits, because a commercial insurer must specify those reductions in limits in its written insurance policy in order to take advantage of them. Similarly, it would be inconsistent with those obligations and that scheme to permit the defendant to take advantage of all of those limits by remaining silent with respect to them, because a commercial insurer would not be able to do so in that fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The second reason is closely related to the first. We have consistently held that, with respect to a commer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>cial insurer, \u201c[w]hen an insurer seeks to limit its liability for uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage based on the regulation issued pursuant to [\u00a7 38a-336],<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it may do so only to the extent that the regulation expressly authorizes.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>218 Conn. 646, 674, 591 A.2d 101 (1991). \u201cIn order for a policy exclusion to be expressly authorized by [a] statute [or regulation], there must be substantial congruence between the statutory [or regulatory] provision and the policy provision. . . . <em>Lowrey </em>v. <em>Valley Forge Ins. Co., </em>224 Conn. 152, 156, 617 A.2d 454 (1992).\u201d <em>Vitti v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>245 Conn. 169, 176, 713 A.2d 1269 (1998); see also <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 674. Indeed, in <em>Chmielewski, </em>we refused to recognize such a substantial congruence because, although there were substantial similarities between the policy language and the regulation, there were also substantial dissimilarities. <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">It would be anomalous to require a commercial insurer to use policy language substantially congruent to the limits specified in the regulation in order for it to take advantage of those limits, but to permit a self-insurer to take advantage of those limits by using no language at all\u2014to do so by silence, as the defendant urges. To do so would not be to create a uniform scheme governing commercial and self-insurers; it would, instead, be to create a scheme that gave self-insurers vastly more leeway to reduce their limits than their commercial insurer counterparts. Put another way, under such a scheme, self-insurers would not be the functional equivalent of commercial insurers; they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>would, instead, be the functional superiors of commercial insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Furthermore, the defendant conceded at oral argument before this court that, under its theory of interpretation of \u00a7 38a-334-6 of the regulations, by merely notifying the commissioner of its election to be self-insured, it automatically and as a matter of law must be deemed to have selected both the minimum coverage and all permitted reductions in limits. Thus, the defendant maintains that, although in its letter to the commissioner the defendant specifically selected the minimum coverage of $20,000 per person and $40,000 per accident, it was not necessary for it to specify those minimum limits in order to select the minimum coverage; by simply notifying the commissioner that it was electing to be self-insured, its coverage automatically would be the minimum along with all permitted reductions in limits. We are not persuaded that this is so. Given that a self-insurer may elect to maintain coverage that is more than the minimum required by statute, we do not see why its notice to the commissioner of self-insurance necessarily means that it is selecting the minimum coverage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although the minimum coverage would be less expensive to a self-insured employer, such as the defendant in the present case, it certainly would be within the realm of reason for such an employer nonetheless to elect more than the minimum coverage so as to provide greater protection to its employees who are injured by uninsured motorists. Those who elect to be covered by commercial insurance often elect greater coverage than the minimum; we see no reason for the law to attribute to a self-insurer a presumption that its silence necessarily means an election of only the minimum coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>We emphasize that there is no particular form that a self-insured entity must use in order to take advantage of the permitted reductions in limits. The required written document may be part of its written notice to the commissioner of its election to be self-insured, pursuant to \u00a7 38a-371 (c), as the defendant in the present case did with respect to its election of the minimum coverage of $20,000 per person and $40,000 per accident. Or, as our discussion of \u00a7 38a-371 (c) in this opinion indicates, it may be as part of a written document that the self-insured entity maintains in its files. Nor is it necessary for the document to repeat verbatim the language of the regulation that the defendant intends to adopt as limits on its coverage. As the plaintiff suggested at oral argument before this court, the defendant could adopt those limits by appropriate language indicating incoiporation by reference. The purpose of the document is to require the self-insured entity to fulfill its obligation as insurer by providing a kind of rough equivalence to the obligation of a commercial insurer to limit its coverage by appropriate language in its policy of insurance. Any document that reasonably fulfills that purpose will suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The defendant contends, nonetheless, that it was not required to create such a written document in order to avail itself of the reductions in limits permitted by the regulation. The defendant offers four reasons for this contention: (1) the word \u201cpolicy\u201d in the regulation does not have its statutory meaning; (2) pursuant to \u00a7 38a-371 (c), the only obligation of a municipal self-insurer is to file a notice of self-insurance with the commissioner; (3) case law has not required such a document from municipal employers; and (4) uninsured motorist coverage requirements are construed from the perspective of the municipal self-insurer, rather than from the perspective of the claimant. We disagree with each contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>The defendant first argues that, although the word \u201cpolicy\u201d in \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d) (1) of the regulations ordinarily means a written contract of insurance between a commercial insurer and an insured; see General Statutes \u00a7 38a-l (15); that definition only applies \u201cunless it appears from the context to the contrary . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 38a-l. Thus, the defendant argues that, in the context of self-insurance, the usual definition does not apply and, instead, the word \u201cpolicy\u201d has the broader meaning, as used in other contexts, of \u201ca definite course or method of action selected from among alternatives and in light of given conditions to guide and determine present and future decisions.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Giving the word that meaning, however, would be to give it a meaning entirely different from its statutory definition. It is obvious that, when the commissioner promulgated the regulation, she did not contemplate its use in the self-insurance context. It is up to the court, therefore, to fill that gap by interpreting it, recognizing that its statutory definition does not fit strictly within that context. Given a choice between interpreting the word in such a way as to be consistent with the statutory definition and interpreting it in such a way as to be completely different from that definition, we prefer to follow the former course of interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The defendant also argues that, under \u00a7 38a-371 (c),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a municipal self-insurer, unlike other self-insurers, need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>only file with the commissioner \u201ca notice that it is a self-insurer.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 38a-371 (c). From this, the defendant contends that \u201cthe legislature presumes [that] a municipality has the financial solvency to meet its obligations; it presumes that the municipality itself is the only entity that need have \u2018evidence\u2019 of its terms and obligations; and/or it evidences the legislature\u2019s attempt to lessen the paperwork that usually evidences all of the provisions of insurance.\u201d We disagree that this single sentence of \u00a7 38a-371 (c) has the meaning that the defendant attributes to it, namely, that by filing such a notice with the commissioner a municipal self-insurer necessarily and as a matter of law invokes the minimum coverage permitted by law and all of the permitted further limits on that coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Section 38a-371 (a) (l)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> provides, in general terms, that an owner of a private passenger motor vehicle must maintain the \u201csecurity in accordance with sections 38a-334 to 38a-343, inclusive.\u201d This includes the uninsured motorist coverage required by \u00a7 38a-336.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Subsection (c) of \u00a7 38a-371; see footnote 8 of this opinion; addresses the issue of self-insurance. It provides that, subject to the approval of the commissioner, the security \u201cmay be provided by self-insurance\u201d by the owner\u2019s filing with the commissioner documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>indicating three essential things: (1) a \u201ccontinuing undertaking by the owner\u201d to perform all of the obligations imposed by \u00a7 38a-371; (2) evidence of the prompt and efficient administration of claims, benefits and obligations provided by the section; and (3) evidence of sufficient financial responsibility \u201csubstantially equivalent to those afforded by a policy of insurance that would comply with\u201d the section\u2019s obligations. General Statutes \u00a7 38a-371 (c). The penultimate sentence of subsection (c) of \u00a7 38a-371 provides: \u201cA person who provides security under this subsection is a self-insurer. . . .\u201d The last sentence, upon which the defendant relies, provides: \u201cA municipality may provide the security required under this section by filing with the commissioner a notice that it is a self-insurer.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 38a-371 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">This last sentence was enacted by the legislature as No. 82-145 of the 1982 Public Acts, entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning The Exemption Of Municipalities From The Self-Insurance Certificate Filing Requirement.\u201d The legislative history of the act indicates that it was intended to relieve self-insuring municipalities from the same filing requirements imposed on other self-insurers, and, correspondingly, to relieve the insurance department from maintaining the same records regarding such municipalities as it does regarding other self-insurers. That same legislative history, however, also indicates that the legislature viewed this as a measure designed to simplify filing requirements, but also contemplated that the municipality nonetheless would be the repository of at least some other necessary information.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>There is nothing in either the language of the act or its purpose to suggest that it was designed to create a presumption that silence by a municipality in this filing regarding the scope of coverage would mean that the minimum coverage and all permitted reductions in limits were applicable as a matter of law. Put another way, this sentence simply cannot carry the weight that the defendant attributes to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The defendant next argues that case law has not required a written document from municipal self-insurers in order for them to be obligated for only the minimum coverage for uninsured motorist benefits. In this connection, the defendant relies principally on two decisions of the Appellate Court, namely, <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>63 Conn. App. 815, 779 A.2d 186, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 905, 782 A.2d 136 (2001), and <em>Serra </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>77 Conn. App. 267, 822 A.2d 1018 (2003). We, of course, are not bound by decisions of the Appellate Court. Irrespective of that consideration, however, we disagree that those decisions persuasively support the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the regulation at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number><em>In Boynton, </em>the plaintiff police officer, who had been injured by an underinsured motorist, sought to recover the unpaid portion of his damages from the defendant city, which was self-insured. The city had given notice of its self-insured status to the commissioner but, as of the date of the plaintiffs injuries, had not put any limits on its coverage in any written document, including its notice to the commissioner. <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 63 Conn. App. 819-20. The plaintiff argued that: (1) under the principle of parity between liability and underinsured motorist coverage, because the city\u2019s liability was unlimited, its underinsured motorist coverage was also unlimited; and (2) the city could not invoke minimum coverage without some kind of written waiver or notice. Id., 826. The Appellate Court disagreed with both arguments. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">With respect to the first argument, the court concluded that the principle of parity did not require the city to provide unlimited underinsured motorist coverage because, in the court\u2019s view, that proposition was based on (1) General Statutes \u00a7 14-129, a linkage that this court specifically had ruled against in <em>Willoughby </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 434, and (2) the text of \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (2), which, although it does require such parity, the court concluded that it did not require unlimited coverage because the exposure of commercial insurers was not unlimited. <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 63 Conn. App. 826-27. We are not persuaded by this reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">In <em>Boynton, </em>the Appellate Court dismissed, in a footnote, a different argument of the plaintiff for parity, based on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Malec, </em>215 Conn. 399, 402, 576 A.2d 485 (1990). <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 63 Conn. App. 826 n.20. We conclude, however, that the Appellate Court\u2019s treatment of that claim of the plaintiff in <em>Boynton </em>was misguided.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>In <em>Malec, </em>this court, in reviewing an underinsured motorist arbitration award, noted that our statutory uninsured and underinsured motorist scheme was designed to require parity between an insured\u2019s liability and uninsured motorist coverage. We stated: \u201cPrior to the enactment of [General Statutes] \u00a7 38-175c [now \u00a7 38a-336]; see Public Acts 1967, No. 510; [uninsured motorist] coverage, although available, was not required. Coverage was limited to the amount requested by the insured. In 1969, \u00a7 38-175c was amended to require parity of [uninsured motorist] coverage with the <em>minimum limits </em>of liability coverage required by General Statutes \u00a7 14-112 (a). See Public Acts 1969, No. 202. In 1983, \u00a7 38-175c was again amended now to require parity of [uninsured motorist] coverage with the <em>amount of liability coverage purchased by the insured </em>unless the insured specifically requested a lesser amount. See Public Acts 1983, No. 83-461.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Malec, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 402-403. The Appellate Court in <em>Boynton </em>rejected this statement as \u201cnot helpful because it arose in the context of an arbitration award. In light of the limited scope of judicial review of arbitration awards; <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 185, 530 A.2d 171 (1987); the court\u2019s analysis of the legislative history is dictum.\u201d <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 63 Conn. App. 826 n.20. The flaw in this reasoning of the Appellate Court is that the scope of judicial review of legal issues arising in the course of uninsured motorist arbitral awards is not limited, as in the usual case of arbitral awards, but is plenary because the arbitration is considered to be compulsory, rather than voluntary. <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 218 Conn. 658-59. Thus, in <em>Malec, </em>this court correctly stated the law regarding the relationship of parity between liability and uninsured motorist coverage in the course of de novo review of legal issues, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>contrary to the Appellate Court\u2019s characterization of that discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">In this connection, we acknowledge the conclusion of the Appellate Court in <em>Boynton </em>that the city was not required to document in writing its intent to avail itself of the statutory minimum of uninsured motorist coverage, because that \u201cwould have required the city, wearing its hat as insured, to file a written request with itself, wearing its hat as insurer,\u201d a requirement that the court considered to be \u201cuntenable.\u201d <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 63 Conn. App. 828. We disagree, however, that that conclusion controls the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">In that passage, the court was referring to the provisions of \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (2),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and not the provision at issue in the present case, namely, \u00a7 38a-334-6 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. Section 38a-336 (a) (2) provides that, despite the general require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>ment of parity between liability and uninsured motorist coverage, an insurer could provide less uninsured motorist coverage if \u201cany named insured requests in writing a lesser amount, but not less than the limits specified in subsection (a) of section 14-112. . . .\u201d We do not disagree with the Appellate Court that applying that provision literally in the self-insurance context would be counterintuitive, because that provision is a notice provision requiring informed consent by the insured. Section 38a-334-6 of the regulations, however, is not such a notice provision; it is a provision that specifies the basic requirement of how an insurer\u2014 self or commercial\u2014may limit its liability. It is neither untenable nor counterintuitive to require a self-insurer to file a written document to accomplish that purpose so as to achieve a rough equivalence to a commercial insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">We are also not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Serra </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>supra, 77 Conn. App. 267, because that decision relied principally on <em>Boynton. </em>In <em>Serra, </em>the plaintiff, again a police officer injured by an underinsured motorist, claimed that the self-insured defendant city had elected more than the minimum required coverage because it had purchased an excess liability policy with a self-insured retention of $50,000. Id., 269-70. The Appellate Court rejected this claim based on its prior decision in <em>Boynton. </em>The court stated: \u201cAlthough the present case is distinguishable because West Haven is not a fully self-insured municipality and, therefore, its liability would not be unlimited, we conclude that this difference is not controlling and the reasoning of <em>Boynton </em>applies. The fact that West Haven has a $50,000 self-insured retention policy does not remove the presumption that a self-insured municipality elects the statutory minimum amount of coverage in the absence of a writing to the commissioner stating otherwise.\u201d Id., 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>The defendant\u2019s final argument is that uninsured motorist requirements are construed from the perspective of municipal self-insurers rather than from the perspective of the claimant. Therefore, the defendant contends, because the expectations of an injured employee of a municipal or commercial employer that has a fleet policy are different from those of an individual insured and, therefore, do not contemplate stacking of coverage; see, e.g., <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>213 Conn. 532, 569 A.2d 40, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 814, 111 S. Ct. 52, 112 L. Ed. 2d 28 (1990), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1005, 112 S. Ct. 640, 116 L. Ed. 2d 658 (1991); <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>213 Conn. 525, 569 A.2d 541 (1990); see also <em>Frantz </em>v. <em>United States Fleet Leasing, Inc., </em>245 Conn. 727, 714 A.2d 1222 (1998) (requirement of General Statutes [Rev. to 1991] \u00a7 38a-336 [a] [2] of written election of reduced uninsured motorist coverage by all insureds does not apply in context of commercial fleet insurance); the same considerations should apply to relieve the defendant in the present case of any obligation to limit its coverage by a written document. We are not persuaded. First, none of those cases involved the regulation at issue in the present case. Second, however sensible those considerations may be in the context of those cases, we are not persuaded that they trump the considerations of the language of the regulation, and the underlying policies of functional equivalence of commercial and self-insurance that we previously have outlined in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to reverse the judgment of the trial court, and to remand the case to that court for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-10\"> We granted the plaintiffs petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that a self-insured municipal employer may reduce the limits of its uninsured motorist coverage by the amount of compensation benefits paid without reducing it to writing?\u201d <em>Piersa </em>v. <em>Phoenix Ins. Co., </em>269 Conn. 916, 852 A.2d 744 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b545-11\"> The plaintiffs own insurance carrier, Phoenix Insurance Company, was also a defendant in the trial court.
