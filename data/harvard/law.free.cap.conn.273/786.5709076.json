The plaintiffs, Miller\u2019s Pond Company, LLC (Miller\u2019s Pond Company), Gary Saunders and Thomas Schacht,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appeal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court following its grant of the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. They contend that the trial court improperly: (1) applied \u00a7 35-31 (b), which exempts certain activities from the Connecticut Antitrust Act, General Statutes \u00a7 35-24 et seq., when those activities are \u201cspecifically directed or required by a statute of this state, or of the United States,\u201d to the facts of the present case; and (2) granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment because there are unresolved factual issues about the definition of the relevant market. As an alternate ground for affirming the trial court\u2019s decision, the defendants con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>tend that General Statutes \u00a7 35-44b<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> requires us to apply the broader federal case law principles governing state action antitrust immunity that have evolved from the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>317 U.S. 341, 350-51, 63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315 (1943). We reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The record reveals the following facts and procedural history.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendants own water sources and water treatment, transmission and distribution facilities that serve the city, Waterford and other parts of southeastern Connecticut; the New London water authority and the Waterford water authority are the \u201ctwo dominant water utilities\u201d in southeastern Connecticut. The defendants own every source of freshwater and all related supply facilities that are located within their municipal borders and \u201ccapable of serving the [r]egion,\u201d except for Miller\u2019s Pond (pond), an approximately seventy-seven acre man-made lake located in the northeastern comer of Waterford. Miller\u2019s Pond Company owns and has exclusive riparian rights to the pond, which is served by several tributaries and receives water from a 9.83 square mile watershed, making it \u201cthe only signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>cant untapped surface fresh water reservoir capable of supplying the relevant geographic market served by the defendants.\u201d That relevant market consists of the city, Waterford and portions of Montville and East Lyme, and may be expanded to include Groton, Ledyard, Preston and Norwich upon completion of a planned water interconnection loop.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Since 1988, the plaintiffs have been seeking to sell or develop the pond as a water source for utilities in the region or as a private water supply for industrial or recreational facilities. Indeed, in 1998, Miller\u2019s Pond Company entered into an agreement with the Connecticut Water Company to develop the sale and distribution of either raw or treated water from the pond in the New London region. The potential market in the region is controlled, however, by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">The city previously had supplied water to Waterford from sources owned and controlled by the city until December, 1986, when the long-term supply contract expired. During renegotiations of that agreement, Waterford informed the city that it intended to develop its own water supply system using the pond as the primary water source. The city opposed this plan, and in April, 1988, it imposed a moratorium on new water connections in Waterford, which was to remain in place until Waterford signed a new water service agreement with the city. Thereafter, Waterford abandoned its efforts to supply its water independently and, in October, 1988, it signed a new agreement for a term of forty-eight years (1988 agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">The 1988 agreement defined the water supply relationship between the city and Waterford. Its stated purpose is \u201cto provide the terms and conditions pursuant to which (1) the [c]ity will supply water to water consumers in [Waterford]; (2) other municipalities in New London County may have the opportunity to receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>water from the [c]ity through the [sjupply [facilities, [transmission [facilities and [distribution [facilities in [Waterford] and the [c]ity; and (3) the [c]ity and [Waterford] will negotiate in good faith toward the goal of a [Regional [w]ater and/or [s]ewer [s]ystem. This [a]greement provides for the use of the [distribution [facilities in [Waterford] and for the use of the [sjupply [facilities and [transmission [facilities owned or controlled by the [c] ity to provide water to water consumers in [Waterford].\u201d The agreement also states that \u201c[t]he [c]ity and [Waterford] will use their best efforts to deter the construction and operation of new [independent [w]ater [s]ystems in the [c]ity and [Waterford] respectively.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The 1988 agreement defines an \u201c \u2018[independent [w]ater [s]ystem\u2019 \u201d as \u201cany private water company or system, private community water system, or private community well serving more than one water consumer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The city also has an agreement to supply water to portions of the town of Montville. By its terms, the agreement required Montville to enter into a separate agreement with Waterford for the use of Waterford supply facilities needed for the city to deliver water to Montville.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Waterford and Montville entered into this agreement in April, 1990 (1990 agreement). The 1990 agreement has several conditions that, inter alia, permit Montville to develop its own water sources only if that \u201cdevelopment or purchase does not result in material depletion of any water resources of Waterford [or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>city] which are presently planned or existing; and . . . does not result in material depletion of any water resources of Waterford or [the city] which come into existence in the future and are located outside of Mont-ville.\u201d The pond is the only property not already owned by the defendants that is subject to the restriction in the 1990 agreement, and the plaintiffs claim that the conditions in the 1990 agreement restrict their ability to market the pond to Montville as a regular or emergency water supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">In regulatory submissions to the department of public health addressing planning matters, both Waterford and the city have recognized the pond as an existing or future component of their water supply systems. The city included the pond in its plan in 1988 as a direct response to a notice from a realtor that the pond might be offered for sale on the open market.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">As previously noted, the plaintiffs have been attempting to develop the pond either as a water source for the region or as a private supply for industrial or recreational facilities since 1988. They allege, however, that the defendants have, in accordance with the \u201cbest efforts to deter the construction and operation of new [independent [w]ater [s]ystems\u201d clause in the 1988 agreement, interfered with their development efforts in a variety of ways. For example, in December, 1998, the plaintiffs and representatives from the Connecticut Water Company met with the New London water authority and offered to enter into an agreement to sell water to the city. The city rejected this offer and refused to deal; in February, 1999, the chief administrator of the New London water authority threatened to use eminent domain proceedings if the plaintiffs did not sell the pond to the city.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In April, 2000, Waterford, in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>its officials\u2019 understanding of the \u201cbest efforts\u201d clause in the agreement, similarly refused to deal with the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">In February, 1998, the city filed an application with the department of environmental protection to divert waters from Hunts Brook, which is located upstream from the pond. Had that department granted this application, it would have reduced the flow of water into the pond by approximately 8 million gallons per day, and reduced the safe yield of the pond by one third. In May, 1998, the plaintiffs announced their intention to develop the pond similarly, and subsequently, in November, 1998, they filed their own application with the department of environmental protection to develop the pond as a regional water supply source and to dredge the valuable sand and gravel deposits from the basin. The department of environmental protection rejected this application without prejudice in October, 1999, because neither the city nor Waterford, as potential users of the water, had agreed to endorse the plaintiffs\u2019 application or join it.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">In December, 1998, the department of environmental protection informed the city that its diversion application was incomplete, and instructed it to report on alternatives to the diversion of Hunts Brook, including obtaining water from the pond as well as from other nearby towns such as Groton and Norwich.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Consistent with the 1988 agreement, the city has continued to refuse to discuss obtaining water from the pond, the plaintiffs or the Connecticut Water Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">In January, 1999, the plaintiffs attended a public information meeting at Waterford town hall that was held in conjunction with the department of environmental protection permitting process. The day after that meet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>ing, the plaintiffs met with Waterford\u2019s first selectman, Thomas Sheridan, who informed them of Waterford\u2019s desire to purchase the pond. Sheridan told the plaintiffs of Waterford\u2019s continued opposition to the development of the pond as an independent water supply. He likewise informed them that they would never be allowed to develop a water business and that \u201che had the power to put [the] plaintiffs\u2019 project \u2018on hold for two years\u2019 with a telephone call to Hartford.\u201d Shortly thereafter, in February, 1999, a meeting was held at the department of environmental protection offices in Hartford, attended by department personnel, New London water authority administrator Thomas Bowen, and counsel. Notes from that meeting indicate that Bowen told the department of environmental protection that the city was considering taking the pond by eminent domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">On February 9,1999, Bowen wrote on the city\u2019s behalf to the Southeast Water Utility Coordinating Committee. He advised the committee of the city\u2019s immediate need for water from the pond, as well as the city\u2019s and Waterford\u2019s interests in purchasing the pond. Bowen mentioned assurances of future supply that the city had made to Montville, as well the defendants\u2019 opposition to the existence of another water company, like the plaintiffs\u2019 business, in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Several days later, the city and Waterford executed a memorandum of understanding to develop new water sources (memorandum). The memorandum was negotiated through several secret meetings that were held at locations other than regular public facilities, including the dry-cleaning business of the chairman of the New London water authority. This memorandum, drafted in furtherance of the 1988 agreement, states that Waterford \u201cand the [c]ity desire to act in a joint and coordinated manner to pursue the acquisition, development, and management of additional new water supply resources,\u201d through either direct purchase or the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>of eminent domain. Early drafts of the memorandum referred specifically to the pond. Subsequent submissions by the city and Waterford to the department of public health continued to refer to the pond as a component of their water systems, but without the plaintiffs\u2019 consent. The inclusion of the pond in these supply plans triggers the anticompetitive provision of the Montville agreement, which prevents Montville from doing business with the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Thereafter, in May, 2000, the plaintiffs met again with the New London water authority to discuss the city\u2019s expressed intention to acquire the pond. The city again declined the plaintiffs\u2019 offer to conduct business respecting the pond\u2019s water, and Bowen again reiterated the city\u2019s plan to use the power of eminent domain to take the pond if the plaintiffs did not abandon their water business and sell the pond to the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The plaintiffs also state that the city has manipulated market conditions by inflating the available safe yield of water. This market manipulation was done in accordance with the terms of the 1988 agreement that restricted Waterford\u2019s ability to seek water source supplies beyond those provided by the city, particularly by conditioning that ability on the city\u2019s unilateral declaration of a supply shortage. See footnote 6 of this opinion. Shortly after the execution of the 1988 agreement, the city increased its declared figure for safely available water by 30 percent, from 5.4 million gallons per day to 7 million gallons per day. Both the department of environmental protection and the department of public health have challenged the accuracy of this figure, and an independent department of environmental protection study conducted in April, 1991, calculated that only 5.1 million gallons per day were available as a safe yield. Engineering standards at that time would have justified the declaration of a supply emergency, thus opening up a supply market into which the plaintiffs could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>competed. The department of public health ordered the city to conduct additional studies, which it did not commence until 1999 under the terms of a consent order. In October, 1999, the city reported that 5.7 million gallons of water per day were available, which was \u201cperilously close\u201d to the actual usage of 5.6 million gallons per day. The city did not, however, report this figure to the state because it could have resulted in a moratorium on new water connections and created a market for additional supply. Rather, the city reported another inflated figure of 6.4 million gallons to the department of public health, which remains under continued study.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">In August, 2000, the plaintiffs brought this action for damages and injunctive relief, claiming that the defendants\u2019 conduct constituted: (1) restraint of trade in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 35-26;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (2) monopolization in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 35-27;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (3) \u201cper se\u201d unlawful acts in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 35-28;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and (4) illegal tying arrangements in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 35-29<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> with respect to the 1988 and 1990 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>agreements. The defendants subsequently moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The trial court, taking as undisputed the facts alleged in the pleadings; see footnote 5 of this opinion; concluded that the defendants were immune from antitrust liability because their activities constituted state action under \u00a7 35-31 (b). The trial court relied on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Mazzola </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>169 Conn. 344, 359, 363 A.2d 170 (1975),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which explained \u00a7 35-31 (b) as a narrower version of the similar doctrine providing immunity from federal antitrust liability first articulated in <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 317 U.S. 350-51. The trial court found the requisite state action in the statutory scheme that required the municipalities to provide a safe water supply, particularly General Statutes \u00a7 25-33c.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court concluded that the city opted to be directed by the state statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>and regulations when it satisfied the statutory mandate by creating a municipal water system rather than contracting privately for water service. Accordingly, the trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment because: (1) a genuine issue of material fact exists as the trial court failed to consider the existence of the relevant wholesale water market and conducted its analysis in the context of the irrelevant, heavily regulated, retail market; and (2) under <em>Mazzola </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>supra, 169 Conn. 344, the defendants are not entitled to state action immunity under \u00a7 35-31 (b) because their conduct was merely approved or acquiesced in by state regulatory agencies, and not \u201cspecifically directed or required\u201d by state or federal statutes. The defendants contend otherwise, and they also claim that \u00a7 35-44b, as construed in <em>Vacco </em>v. <em>Microsoft Corp., </em>260 Conn. 59, 793 A.2d 1048 (2002), now requires this court to apply the federal case law principles governing state action immunity that have emerged following <em>Parker, </em>which provide for immunity if the municipalities\u2019 alleged anticompetitive conduct is a \u201c \u2018foreseeable result\u2019 \u201d of state legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Before we turn to the parties\u2019 specific claims, we set forth the proper standard of review. We will engage in plenary review of all issues raised in this appeal, particularly because the extent to which anticompetitive conduct is \u201c \u2018specifically directed or required\u2019 by the government is a mixed question of fact and law . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westport Transit District, </em>235 Conn. 1, 26, 664 A. 2d 719 (1995); id., 25-26 (declining to review transit district\u2019s \u00a7 35-31 [b] state action defense to antitrust action because it was not raised in trial court and record was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>insufficient for plain error review); <em>see Bortner v.

Indeed, the defendants argue in support of the application of the federal standards that have evolved from the Supreme Court\u2019s seminal decision in <em>Parker, </em>as an alternate ground for affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> They contend that \u00a7 35-44b requires us to construe and apply \u00a7 35-31 (b) in accordance with the federal case law following <em>Parker, </em>rather than under the more restrictive interpretations given it by Connecticut case law and applied by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>The defendants\u2019 arguments with respect to \u00a7 35-44b present an issue of statutory construction. \u201cIt is well settled that in construing statutes, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Manifold </em>v. <em>Ragaglia, </em>272 Conn. 410, 419, 862 A.2d 292 (2004). \u201c[W]e seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply.

Addressing the Sherman Act claims, the Supreme Court assumed without deciding that the marketing act would violate the antitrust statutes. Id., 350. Noting federalism concerns, however, the court concluded that the marketing program \u201cderived its authority and its efficacy from the legislative command of the state and was not intended to operate or become effective without that command,\u201d and that the Sherman Act \u201cgives no hint that it was intended to restrain state action or official action directed by a state.\u201d Id., 350-51.

(Citations omitted.) Ultimately, the court concluded that \u201c[t]he state in adopting and enforcing the [marketing] program made no contract or agreement and entered into no conspiracy in restraint of trade or to establish monopoly but, as sovereign, imposed the restraint as an act of government which the Sherman Act did not undertake to prohibit.\u201d Id., 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">With respect to the application of state action immunity to municipalities, subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court have held that <em>\u201cParker </em>immunity does not apply directly to local governments . . . have recognized . . . that a municipality\u2019s restriction of compe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>tition may sometimes be an authorized implementation of state policy, and have accorded <em>Parker </em>immunity where that is the case.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Columbia </em>v. <em>Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., </em>499 U.S. 365, 370, 111 S.

Section 35-31 (b) provides: \u201cNothing contained in this chapter shall apply to those activities of any person when said activity is specifically directed or required by a statute of this state, or of the United States.\u201d This statute was first explained by this court in <em>Mazzola </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone </em>Co., supra, 169 Conn. 353-54, wherein the plaintiff brought an action against the telephone company, claiming antitrust violations resulting from the telephone company\u2019s practices with respect to answering machines and message-taking devices. Specifically, the plaintiff challenged the requirement that individuals obtaining such services from sources other than the telephone company were required to purchase or lease \u201cprotective link apparatus from the [telephone company] at a monthly charge fixed by the [telephone company].\u201d Id., 353. In <em>Mazzola, </em>this court addressed the telephone company\u2019s argument that \u00a7 35-31 (b) rendered it immune from antitrust liability because its activities had been approved by the public utilities commission in accordance with the rate-setting procedure prescribed by General Statutes \u00a7 16-19. Id., 357-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">The court began the decision in <em>Mazzola </em>by reviewing the origins of the Connecticut antitrust act, noting that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>\u201c[e]nacted in 1971, the act incorporates, in modified form, and with notable exceptions, various provisions of such federal antitrust laws as, for example, the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, the Antitrust Civil Process Act, and of such state antitrust laws as the provisions embodied in the proposed Uniform State Antitrust Act. . . . Under these circumstances, reference to opinions of courts in other jurisdictions, federal and state, on pertinent antitrust law issues, where appropriate, are an aid to our interpretation of certain questions arising under the present Connecticut statute.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 347-48. After first concluding that the Superior Court, rather than the public utilities commission that regulated the telephone company, had primary jurisdiction over the antitrust claims in the case; id., 349-52; the court turned to the telephone company\u2019s state action arguments premised on \u00a7 35-31 (b). Contrasting \u00a7 35-31 (b) with other statutory antitrust exceptions, the court noted that \u00a7 35-31 (b) \u201chas no parallel in the federal antitrust statutes,\u201d and that \u201cin enacting this provision the Connecticut legislature also did not choose to follow the example set by several other states of specifically and unqualifiedly exempting from antitrust liability the activities of industries and other organizations subject to the supervision of the state regulatory agency equivalent to our public utilities commission.\u201d Id., 359. This court stated that \u201cthe exception authorized by \u00a7 35-31 (b) represents a narrowly drawn version of the doctrine of \u2018state action\u2019 immunity from antitrust liability articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>[supra, 317 U.S. 350-51]. The court in that case carved out an exemption from Sherman Act liability for activities \u2018commanded\u2019 or \u2018directed\u2019 by a state legislature. . . . Section 35-31 (b) limits that holding by purporting to immunize only activities which are \u2018specifically\u2019 required or directed by state or federal statutes.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Mazzola </em>v. <em>Southern New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number><em>England Telephone Co., </em>supra, 169 Conn. 359. After reviewing the facts of <em>Parker, </em>this court stated that the <em>\u201cParker </em>doctrine draws a firm line, in short, between activities actually commanded by the state, which are immune from antitrust liability and action merely approved or tolerated.\u201d Id., 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The court then reviewed the public utility rate-setting process of \u00a7 16-19, and concluded that \u201c[u]nder these circumstances, the role that is statutorily assigned to the [public utilities commission] in rendering effective tariffs proposed by companies such as the defendant amounts to little more than acquiescence in a program originated by the defendant. In no sense, then, can activities of the defendant such as the kind of activities challenged by the plaintiff, purportedly authorized by a tariff filed with and approved by the [public utilities commission], be characterized as \u2018compelled by direction of the [s]tate acting as a sovereign\u2019 under the <em>Parker </em>doctrine as it has been judicially interpreted. . . . <em>Nor can such activities consequently be comprehended within the more stringent standards applicable to exemptions from antitrust liability established by [\u00a735-31 (b)].\u201d </em>(Citation omitted; emphasis added.) Id., 365-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">This court next mentioned \u00a7 35-31 (b) immunity in the 1995 decision in <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westport Transit District, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 23-27. Although this court concluded that the issue was not reviewable because it had not been properly raised as a special defense at trial, and the record was not plain error, the court nevertheless briefly discussed in dicta the proper standards for that inquiry. Id., 23-25. The court cited <em>Mazzola, </em>acknowledging that it had interpreted \u00a7 35-31 (b) as more stringent than the federal law, and stated that under the statute, \u201c[i]n order to be shielded by qualified state action immunity, the defendant must show that its anti-competitive conduct was \u2018specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>directed or required\u2019 by the government . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Whether \u00a7 35-44b Requires Incorporation of the Federal Immunity Standards into a \u00a7 35-31 (b) Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">This court decided <em>Westport Tax Service, Inc., </em>in 1995, three years after the enactment of \u00a7 35-44b, which was cited therein in further support of the proposition that, because \u201c[t]he legislative history of the act clearly establishes that it was intentionally patterned after the antitrust law of the federal government. . . . [0]ur construction of the Connecticut Anti-Trust Act is aided by reference to judicial opinions interpreting the federal antitrust statutes. . . . <em>Accordingly, we follow federal precedent when we interpret the act unless the text of our antitrust statutes, or other pertinent state law, requires us to interpret it </em>differently.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 15-16; see also id., 15 n.17 (\u201c[w]e note that in 1992, the legislature explicitly incorporated into law its intent that the judiciary be guided by interpretations of federal antitrust statutes when it enacted ... \u00a7 35-44b\u201d). The text of \u00a7 35-44b provides: \u201cIt is the intent of the General Assembly that in construing sections 35-24 to 35-46, inclusive, the courts of this state shall be guided by interpretations given by the federal courts to federal antitrust statutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">This court explained \u00a7 35-44b in detail in <em>Vacco </em>v. <em>Microsoft Corp., </em>supra, 260 Conn. 60-61, wherein the plaintiff brought an action under the Connecticut Antitrust Act against the defendant, Microsoft Corporation. We concluded that the plaintiff, as an end user licensee of the operating system software manufactured by the defendant, could not maintain a state antitrust action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>under General Statutes \u00a7 35-35<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> because he was not the direct purchaser of the software. Id., 62-64. In so concluding, we noted that \u00a7 35-35 was modeled after the relevant section of the federal Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and that the federal courts have interpreted that statute \u201cas precluding an indirect purchaser of goods or services from bringing a private action against the seller who engages in anticompetitive practices in the sale of those goods or services.\u201d Id., 66; see also id., 69 (discussing <em>Illinois Brick Co. </em>v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 [1977], which \u201cheld that an indirect purchaser could not bring an antitrust action and offensively use the pass on theory to recover under . . . the Clayton Act\u201d). We then relied on the legislative history of the Antitrust Act, and specifically the history and text of \u00a7 35-44b, which \u201cmake explicit [the legislature\u2019s] intent that the judiciary shall interpret the Antitrust Act in accordance with the federal courts\u2019 interpretation of federal antitrust law.\u201d <em>Vacco </em>v. <em>Microsoft Corp., </em>supra, 72-73. We rejected the plaintiffs claim that the adoption of the indirect purchaser rule would render superfluous the text of \u00a7 35-35, because that statute, unlike the parallel provision of the federal Clayton Act, explicitly provides \u201cconsumers\u201d with a right of action under the Antitrust Act. Id., 74-76. We noted that the federal precedent with respect to indirect pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>chasers remained persuasive as applied to the plaintiff in <em>Vacco </em>because of other well established federal case law allowing consumers to bring claims under the Clayton Act. Id., 76, citing <em>Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., </em>442 U.S. 330, 338-42, 99 S. Ct. 2326, 60 L. Ed. 2d 931 (1979). We then concluded that \u201callowing only those consumers who purchase directly from the antitrust defendant to bring suit under our state antitrust law ensures that the Antitrust Act remains harmonious with federal antitrust statutes.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Vacco </em>v. <em>Microsoft Corp., </em>supra, 76-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">We conclude that \u00a7 35-44b does not require us to incorporate the federal case law defining state action immunity into our construction of \u00a7 35-31 (b). The applicability of \u00a7 35-44b to the facts and legal landscape of the present case is questionable, at best. First and foremost, state action immunity under the Connecticut Antitrust Act is based on a standard set forth in a specific statutory provision, namely, \u00a7 35-31 (b), while that same immunity under federal law has its origins in case law construing the more generalized provision of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1. See, e.g., <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 317 U.S. 348-49; <em>Electrical Inspectors, Inc. </em>v. <em>East Hills, </em>supra, 320 F.3d 118; see footnote 17 of this opinion for the text of the Sherman Act. Indeed, we have recognized that \u00a7 35-31 (b) \u201chas no parallel in the federal antitrust statutes.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Mazzola </em>v. <em>Southern New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number><em>England Telephone Co., </em>supra, 169 Conn. 359. It is well settled that \u201c[w]here statutes contain specific and general references covering the same subject matter, the specific references prevail over the general.\u201d <em>Galvin </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>201 Conn. 448, 456, 518 A.2d 64 (1986). Moreover, although there is legislative history supporting the defendants\u2019 argument that \u00a7 35-44b was intended to \u201ccreate one, national body of law,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> neither that history nor the language of the statute as enacted requires: (1) the repeal of antitrust statutes unique to our state, without a parallel provision in the federal scheme; or (2) the overruling of state case law interpreting those statutes that are specific to Connecticut.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Accordingly, we must conclude that \u00a7 35-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>44b merely gave legislative imprimatur to what this court had been doing long before its enactment, namely, looking to case law construing relevant federal statutes as persuasive authority. See, e.g., <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westport Transit District, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 15, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Hossan-Maxwell, Inc., </em>181 Conn. 655, 660, 436 A.2d 284 (1980) (\u201c[o]ur construction of the Connecticut Antitrust Act is aided by reference to judicial opinions interpreting the federal antitrust statutes\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); see <em>Elida, Inc. </em>v. <em>Harmor Realty Corp., </em>177 Conn. 218, 226-27, 413 A.2d 1226 (1979); <em>Mazzola </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>supra, 348. Indeed, in <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc., </em>a case decided after the enactment of \u00a7 35-44b, and citing that statute, this court emphasized that \u201cwe follow federal precedent when we interpret the act unless the text of our antitrust statutes, or other pertinent state law, requires us to interpret it differently.\u201d <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westport Transit District, </em>supra, 15-16; see also id., 39-45 (concluding that interpretation of text of Connecticut Antitrust Act as precluding awards of prejudgment interest is consis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>tent with relevant federal precedent). Accordingly, \u00a7 35-44b simply is inapplicable in the present case, which concerns a state antitrust statute without federal parallel.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>Moreover, the \u201c[t]he General Assembly is always presumed to know all the existing statutes and the effect that its action or non-action will have upon any one of them\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Hatt </em>v. <em>Burlington Coat Factory, </em>263 Conn. 279, 310, 819 A.2d 260 (2003); as well as \u201cthe interpretation which the courts have placed upon one of its legislative enactments and of the effect that its own nonaction, thereafter may have.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v.

Accordingly, we will not torture the language of \u00a7 35-44b to reach the results, disfavored in our jurisprudence, of overruling past decisions construing \u00a7 35-31 (b), or impliedly repealing that same statute.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>260 Conn. 506, 538, 800 A.2d 1102 (2002) (\u201c[T]he doctrine of stare decisis counsels that a court should not overrule its earlier decisions unless the most cogent reasons and inescapable logic require it. ...

We, therefore, reaffirm the continuing vitality of <em>Mazzola </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>supra, 169 Conn. 365-66, as the controlling interpretation of a state antitrust statute without a federal parallel, and we decline to consider the evolved state action doctrine of <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 317 U.S. 341, as either mandatory or persuasive in the construction and application of \u00a7 35-31 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY CONCLUDED THAT THE STATUTORY SCHEME \u201cSPECIFICALLY DIRECTED OR REQUIRED\u201d THE DEFENDANTS\u2019 ACTIVITIES</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Plaving concluded that \u00a7 35-31 (b), as explained by <em>Mazzola </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>supra, 169 Conn. 361, provides the governing standard to apply in the present case, we now consider whether the trial court applied it properly to the facts pleaded by the plaintiffs when viewed in light of the statutes and regulations governing the activities of municipal water companies. The plaintiffs claim that the defendants are not entitled to immunity under \u00a7 35-31 (b) because their conduct with respect to the wholesale water market was not \u201cspecifically directed or required\u201d as: (1) they voluntarily subjected themselves to the comprehensive statutoiy and regulatory scheme governing water companies; (2) regulatory approval or acceptance of water supply contracts and plans by state agencies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>that are not charged with antitrust enforcement does not constitute the required specific statutory command or direction; and (3) the statutory mandate of a \u201csafe and adequate supply of water\u201d under \u00a7 25-33c does not satisfy the specificity requirement of \u00a7 35-31 (b). The defendants, citing the plethora of statutes and regulations, including \u00a7 25-33c, that govern the activities of water companies, contend in response that their allegedly anticompetitive actions were required by the \u201ctotality of [that] mandate . . . .\u201d We agree with the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Definition of the Relevant Market</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">We note at the outset that proper analysis in an antitrust case first requires determination of the \u201crelevant market . . . .\u201d <em>AD/SAT </em>v. <em>Associated Press, </em>181 F.3d 216, 225 (2d Cir. 1999); id.

The plaintiffs argue that, at the very least, a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the relevant market exists, thereby precluding summary judgment.

Moreover, the difference between the wholesale and retail markets was explained by Schacht in an affidavit submitted to the trial court in connection with the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. In that affidavit, Schacht stated that retail customers are individuals or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>businesses that purchase water from individual utility companies through \u201cservice connections\u201d to water mains. Wholesale water customers, by contrast, are utility companies themselves, which purchase water in bulk for resale to retail customers. Schacht noted that the retail relationships are compulsoiy and not subject to competitive market factors because the department of public health designates exclusive service areas, wherein one utility is assigned responsibility for providing retail water service. See also General Statutes \u00a7 25-33d (c) (defining \u201c \u2018[ejxclusive service area\u2019 \u201d as \u201can area where public water is supplied by one system\u201d). Schacht averred that, in contrast, the wholesale market is voluntary and independent of the exclusive service area system. Accordingly, viewing the relevant market in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs; see, e.g., <em>Zhang </em>v. <em>Omnipoint Communications Enterprises, Inc., </em>272 Conn. 627, 633, 866 A.2d 588 (2005); we conclude that our analysis of the relevant statutes and regulations must take place in the context of the wholesale water market.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The Statutory Scheme Relevant to the Defendants\u2019 Activities</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Municipalities and other entities in the water business, especially at the retail level, unquestionably are subject to a vast array of statutes and regulations.

Under General Statutes \u00a7 25-32d (a),<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> water companies are required to submit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>a water supply plan to the department of public health for approval \u201cwith the concurrence of the Commissioner of Environmental Protection.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> A water supply plan is required to \u201cevaluate the water supply needs in the service area of the water company submitting the plan and propose a strategy to meet such needs.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 25-32d (b). The plan must \u201cinclude: (1) A description of existing water supply systems; (2) an analysis of future water supply demands; (3) an assessment of alternative water supply sources which may include sources receiving sewage and sources located on state land; (4) contingency procedures for public drinking water supply emergencies, including emergencies concerning the contamination of water, the failure of a water supply system or the shortage of water; (5) a recommendation for new water system development; (6) a forecast of any future land sales, an identification which includes the acreage and location of any land proposed to be sold, sources of public water supply to be abandoned and any land owned by the company which it has designated, or plans to designate, as class III land; (7) provisions for strategic groundwater monitoring; (8) an analysis of the impact of water conservation practices and a strategy for implementing supply and demand management measures; and (9) on and after January 1, 2004, an evaluation of source water protection measures for all sources of the water supply, based on the identification of critical lands to be protected and incompatible land use activities with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>potential to contaminate a public drinking water source.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 25-32d Ob).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Similar planning occurs on the level of the water utility coordinating committees, who are required to conduct preliminary assessments, in consultation with the department of environmental protection and the department of public health, of water supply conditions and problems in their areas. See General Statutes \u00a7 25-33g (a). As part of this process, the water utility coordinating committees \u201cshall establish preliminary exclusive service area boundaries, based on the final assessment, for each public water system within the management area, and may change such boundaries. ... If there is no agreement by the committee on such boundaries, or on a change to such boundaries, the committee shall consult with the Department of Public Utility Control. If there is no agreement by the committee after such consultation, the Commissioner of Public Health shall establish or may change such exclusive service area boundaries taking into consideration any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>water company rights established by statute, special act or administrative decisions. In establishing such boundaries the commissioner shall maintain existing service areas and consider the orderly and efficient development of public water supplies. In considering any change to exclusive service area boundaries, the commissioner shall maintain existing service areas, consider established exclusive service areas, and consider the orderly and efficient development of public water supplies.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 25-33g (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Indeed, \u201c[e]ach water utility coordinating committee shall prepare a coordinated water system plan in the public water supply management area. Such plan shall be submitted to the Commissioner of Public Health for his approval not more than two years after the first meeting of the committee. The plan shall promote cooperation among public water systems and include, but not be limited to, provisions for (1) integration of public water systems, consistent with the protection and enhancement of public health and well-being; (2) integration of water company plans; (3) exclusive service areas; (4) joint management or ownership of services; (5) satellite management services; (6) interconnections between public water systems; (7) integration of land use and water system plans; (8) minimum design standards; (9) water conservation; (10) the impact on other uses of water resources; and (11) acquisition of land surrounding wells proposed to be located in stratified drifts.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 25-33h (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>Moreover, the department of public health permits may only be issued in accordance with the coordinated plans adopted pursuant to \u00a7 25-33h; see General Statutes \u00a7 25-33\u00cd (a); \u201c[n]o public water supply system may be approved within a public water supply management area after the Commissioner of Public Health has convened a water utility coordinating committee unless (1) an existing public water supply system is unable to provide water service or (2) the committee recommends such approval.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 25-33\u00cd (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Application of \u00a7 35-31 (b) to the Water Company and Supply Statutes</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">The defendants argue that these statutes and regulations \u201cseek to promote the cooperation and intercon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>nection of water companies, and, by contrast, do not seek to promote the creation of new, independent owners of water sources.\u201d They claim that \u201cit is simply inaccurate to state as do the plaintiffs that there exists in Connecticut a wholly unregulated wholesale market for water. The comprehensive scheme of regulation in place in Connecticut regulates all activities of Connecticut water companies and it is at the very least reasonably foreseeable that \u2018virtual monopolies\u2019 might result in some areas with regard to the purchase and sale of bulk water. The creation of exclusive service areas requires and entails marshalling, allocation, and protection of water sources, including interconnection, hence [it] regulates all aspects of the defendants\u2019 operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">We note, at the outset, that we need not determine whether a monopoly is the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d result of this statutory scheme. That inquiry would have its basis in the broader state action standards found under federal case law following <em>Parker, </em>and is, therefore, incompatible with the narrower analysis demanded by \u00a7 35-31 (b). See part I A of this opinion. As discussed previously in part I C of this opinion, this court\u2019s decision in <em>Mazzola </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>supra, 169 Conn. 344, remains the controlling construction of \u00a7 35-31 (b). Case law following <em>Mazzola </em>that applied \u00a7 35-31 (b) demonstrates that the Connecticut immunity statute, which requires that the challenged activities be \u201cspecifically directed or required by a statute,\u201d demands a more exacting analysis. Put differently, the cases demonstrate that \u00a7 35-31 (b) immunity from antitrust liability will attach only if the statute under which protection is sought speaks directly to the challenged conduct. Generalized statements of policy or implications from the sheer pervasiveness of a regulatory scheme as a whole, therefore, simply do not have the requisite specificity under \u00a7 35-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>31 (b).<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Indeed, this is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the word \u201cspecific\u201d used in the statute. The American Heritage College Dictionary (4th Ed. 2002) defines \u201cspecific\u201d in relevant part as: \u201c1. Explicitly set forth; definite. ... 4a. Intended for, applying to, or acting on a particular thing . . . .\u201d Accordingly, we emphasize that mere approval or acquiescence by a regulatory agency will not cloak an entity with antitrust immunity pursuant to \u00a7 35-31 (b). See <em>Mazzola v. Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>supra, 357-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Apart from this court\u2019s leading decision in <em>Mazzola, </em>the case law applying \u00a7 35-31 (b) is entirely contained in state and federal trial court decisions.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In <em>Mazzola </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>supra, 169 Conn. 353, which was discussed in part I B of this opinion, the plaintiff brought an action against the telephone company, claiming antitrust violations resulting from the company\u2019s practices with respect to answering machines and message-taking devices, specifically the requirement that individuals obtaining such services from sources other than the telephone company were required to purchase or lease linking apparatus from the company. This court concluded that the telephone company was not immune from antitrust liability under \u00a7 35-31 (b), rejecting its argument that its activities had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>been approved by the public utilities commission in accordance with the rate-setting procedure prescribed by \u00a7 16-19. Id., 357-58. The court concluded that \u00a7 35-31 (b) \u201chas no parallel in the federal antitrust statutes,\u201d and that \u201cin enacting this provision the Connecticut legislature also did not choose to follow the example set by several other states of specifically and unqualifiedly exempting from antitrust liability the activities of industries and other organizations subject to the supervision of the state regulatory agency equivalent to our public utilities commission.\u201d Id., 359. This court emphasized that \u00a7 35-31 (b) was narrower than the holding of <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 317 U.S. 350-51, and concluded that the telephone company\u2019s activities satisfied neither standard because under the public utility rate-setting process of \u00a7 16-19, \u201cthe role that is statutorily assigned to the [public utility commission] in rendering effective tariffs proposed by companies such as the defendant amounts to little more than acquiescence in a program originated by the defendant. In no sense, then, can activities of the defendant such as the kind of activities challenged by the plaintiff, purportedly authorized by a tariff filed with and approved by the [public utility commission], be characterized as \u2018compelled by direction of the [s]tate acting as a sovereign\u2019 under the <em>Parker </em>doctrine as it has been judicially interpreted.\u201d Id., 365-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">In <em>Professional Ambulance Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Blackstone, </em>35 Conn. Sup. 136, 137, 400 A.2d 1031 (1978), the plaintiff was a private ambulance company who, along with two other private ambulance companies, previously had been dispatched by the East Hartford police department on a rotating basis to provide emergency medical services to the town. The defendant mayor of East Hartford subsequently notified the plaintiff that the state office of emergency medical services and the North Central Emergency Medical Services Council had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>designated another ambulance company, the Ambulance Service of Manchester, Inc., as the \u201c \u2018R-2 service company for East Hartford,\u2019 \u201d which meant that only it could provide emergency ambulance service in the town. Id., 138. The mayor then issued to the police department a directive to that effect, and the police thereafter notified only Ambulance Service of Manchester, Inc., when ambulance service was needed. Id. The town also \u201cpassed an ordinance prohibiting ambulance companies from advertising their services as \u2018emergency services\u2019 or \u2018emergency personnel.\u2019 As a result, the plaintiff . . . noted a significant reduction in the number of its calls for emergency ambulance services with a corresponding loss in revenues.\u201d Id. The plaintiff then brought a state antitrust action, claiming that \u201cthe designation of Ambulance Service of Manchester, Inc., as the single R2 responder for the East Hartford primary service area and the prohibition against advertising have had the effect of creating a monopoly and are in violation of these antitrust statutes.\u201d Id., 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">The trial court, <em>Covello, J., </em>relied on Mazzola, and concluded that, \u201cthe parties sought to be enjoined from alleged antitrust activities are not the officers of a private company regulated by a state agency, but are the officials of the state and municipal agencies themselves, pursuing emergency medical service functions directed by the statutes.\u201d Id., 142. The court stated that the ambulance service regulations at issue were promulgated pursuant to the \u201ctotality of the mandate set out\u201d in the emergency medical services statutes. Id., 143. It concluded that the mayor\u2019s activities \u201crepresent the product of specifically directed state action,\u201d namely, regulations restricting ambulance advertising and ambulance primary service areas.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>We next consider the more recent federal District Court decision, also authored by Judge Covello, in <em>Wheelabrator Environmental Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Galante, </em>United States District Court, Docket No. 3:97CV01040, 2000 WL 863029 (D. Conn. March 31,2000). The plaintiff and the defendants in that case were waste management companies, and the plaintiff had entered into an agreement with the Housatonic Resources Recovery Authority (recovery authority), an organization with eleven member municipalities that had \u201cjoined together to arrange for the orderly disposal of municipal solid waste ... in accordance with state and regional solid waste plans.\u201d Id., *1. The defendants provided waste management services to some of the recovery authority municipalities by processing the waste and delivering it to the plaintiffs facilities to be burned and to generate electricity. Id., *2. The plaintiff brought a breach of contract action against the defendants, claiming that they failed to deliver waste to the plaintiffs management facility as was required by their contract. Id. The defendants counterclaimed against the plaintiff, arguing that it violated the Connecticut Antitrust Act and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>federal Sherman Act in its attempts to preserve its monopoly over trash disposal services in the recovery authority market. Id., *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">In addressing the plaintiffs argument that the state antitrust counterclaims should be dismissed under \u00a7 35-31 (b), the court relied on <em>Mazzola </em>and <em>Professional Ambulance Service, Inc</em><footnotemark><em>41</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Id., *6. The court noted that the \u201callegedly anticompetitive conduct . . . arises solely from the [plaintiffs] waste agreement with the [recovery authority].\u201d Id. It found the \u201cspecific authorization\u201d required under the statute in \u201cthe totality of the mandate\u201d of the waste management statutes that: (1) required municipalities to \u201cmake provisions for the safe and sanitary disposal of all solid wastes which are generated within [their] boundaries\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 22a-220 (a); and (2) authorized the municipalities to enter into long-term contracts for waste management. General Statutes \u00a7 7-273bb (b);<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> see also General Statutes \u00a7 22a-221 (a) (\u201c[t]he state, any municipality or any municipal or regional authority may make contracts for the exercise of its corporate or municipal powers with respect to the collection, transportation, separation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>volume reduction, processing, storage and disposal of its solid wastes for a period not exceeding thirty years and may pledge its full faith and credit for the payment of obligations under such contracts\u201d).<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">We conclude that the present case is readily distinguishable from <em>Professional Ambulance Service, Inc., </em>and <em>Wheelabrator Environmental Systems, Inc., </em>because, in those cases, the applicable statutes and regulations spoke directly to all of the challenged conduct. In <em>Professional Ambulance Service, Inc., </em>the applicable regulations gave the town no choice except to designate one emergency ambulance service provider, and the advertising ordinance was authorized by a regulation directly on point. Similarly, in <em>Wheelabrator Environmental Systems, Inc., </em>it was the very existence of the waste manager\u2019s contract with the municipality that was the sole challenged conduct, which was plainly and specifically authorized by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">In contrast, the plaintiffs in the present case have alleged sufficient facts, viewed in the context of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>statutory and regulatory scheme, to render improper the trial court\u2019s grant of the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion. Although the statutes plainly envision <em>retail </em>monopolies through the designation of exclusive service areas, and some of the defendants\u2019 conduct was in fact mandated, namely, the inclusion of the pond in their water supply plans; see General Statutes \u00a7 25-32d (b) (3); Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 25-33h-l (d) (2) (A) (ii); the remainder of the facts allege anticompetitive conduct well beyond the pale of the statutes, and therefore, not immune under \u00a7 35-31 (b). Our reading of the statutes, which are quite comprehensive, reveals no mention of, for example: (1) authorization for contract clauses requiring water company parties to \u201cuse their best efforts to deter the construction and operation of new independent water systems\u201d; and (2) manipulation of water supply figures in order to avert the declaration of a supply emergency, thus opening a previously closed market for additional water sources. Accordingly, action by state regulatory authorities in this case was limited to <em>acquiescence </em>to the defendants\u2019 anticompetitive activities with respect to the relevant wholesale water market, which, like the telephone rate approval process considered in <em>Mazzola </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>supra, 169 Conn. 344, does not supply the state direction required for immunity under \u00a7 35-31 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to deny the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">In this opinion BORDEN, PALMER and VERTE-FEUILLE, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b812-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 35-31 (b) provides: \u201cNothing contained in this chapter shall apply to those activities of any person when said activity is specifically directed or required by a statute of this state, or of the United States.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b812-8\"> Saunders is a founding member of Miller\u2019s Pond Company, LLC, and Schacht is a managing member of that company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b812-9\"> The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and upon the unopposed motion of the defendants, we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b813-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 35-44b provides: \u201cIt is the intent of the General Assembly that in construing sections 35-24 to 35-46, inclusive, the courts of this state shall be guided by interpretations given by the federal courts to federal antitrust statutes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b813-7\"> For purposes of their motion for summary judgment, the defendants admitted all of the factual allegations in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.

App. 1996) (\u201cany person exempt or immune under federal antitrust law is exempt from the Colorado Antitrust Act of 1992\u201d). Moreover, statutes such as \u00a7 35-44b do not necessarily counsel blind adherence to all things federal. See <em>Fine Airport Parking, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tulsa, </em>71 P.3d 5, 10-11 (Okla. 2003) (acknowledging statute requiring state antitrust law to \u201cbe interpreted and applied consistent with federal antitrust law,\u201d but stating that \u201c[t]he principles of federalism supporting the <em>Parker </em>doctrine are meaningless in an analysis of municipal liability under [state antitrust statutes]\u201d because \u201cthe state is the sovereign and the municipality is a political subdivision of the state\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b835-5\"> The concurring opinion concludes that \u201c[bjecause \u00a7 35-31 (b) is more specific than \u00a7 35-44b, its terms should prevail in this case. Thus, there is no need to go beyond the plain and unambiguous language of the statute.\u201d The concurrence further states that it \u201csee[s] no need\u201d for much of the analysis herein, including our \u201clengthy\u201d explanation of how federal antitrust state action immunity relates to Connecticut\u2019s antitrust state action immunity. We take this opportunity to express briefly our respectful disagreement with much of the concurrence\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">We first note that the concurring opinion, while professing to follow strictly \u00a7 l-2z, in fact departs from the analysis directed by that statute by invoking the canon of statutory construction that provides, \u201c [w]here statutes contain specific and general references covering the same subject matter, the specific references prevail over the general.\u201d <em>Galvin </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 201 Conn. 456. If the statutes at issue were in fact as plain and unambiguous as the concurrence states, resort to this canon, which is itself a form of \u201cextratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z; simply would be unnecessary. Moreover, while canons certainly do have their place in the construction of statutes, it strikes us as unwise to elevate them over all other forms of \u201cextratextual evidence\u201d because, for almost every maxim found in the \u201cgrab bag\u201d of canons, an equal and opposite proposition may be found. We have stated: \u201cAlthough the so-called canons of statutory construction may at times serve as useful tools in deciphering legislative meaning, to rely on any one of them as a compelling factor in the interpretive process is problematic, because as Professor Karl Llewellyn persuasively has demonstrated, \u2018there are two opposing canons on almost every point.\u2019 K. Llewellyn, \u2018Remarles on the Theory of Appellate Decision and the Rules or Canons About How Statutes Are to Be Construed,\u2019 3 Vand. L. Rev. 395, 401 (1950). The so-called \u2018canons\u2019 are not that, at least in the sense that any one of them reliably can be determined to apply or not to apply in any given case. They are, instead, merely guides drawn from experience, to be employed or not to be employed carefully and judiciously, depending on the circumstances. See F. Frankfurter, \u2018Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes,\u2019 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 544-45 (1947); see also <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>240 Conn. 422, 455, 692 A.2d 742 (1997). \u2018To permit them to displace the conclusions that careful inteipretation yields . . . would be a disservice to the legislative process, as well as to the judicial exercise of interpreting legislative language based upon the premise that the legislature intends to enact reasonable public policies.\u2019 <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 455.\u201d <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Fleet National Bank, </em>252 Conn. 1, 23-24, 742 A.2d 293 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">We also disagree with the analysis contained in footnote 3 of the concurring opinion, namely, that \u201c[fjederal antitrust law pertaining to state action immunity is more lenient than \u00a7 35-31 (b), but is just as specific. The reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>that we should not follow federal law in this case is that the provisions of \u00a7 35-31 (b) are more specific than the provisions of \u00a7 35-44b and, therefore, to the extent that there is a patent inconsistency between the plain language of \u00a7 35-31 (b) and the federal law, the provisions of \u00a7 35-44b requiring us to follow federal law do not apply.\u201d We do not perceive the resolution of this case as turning on whether \u00a7 35-31 (b) is more specific than \u00a7 35-44b, because the statutes fundamentally are different. Section 35-31 (b) is a substantive rule of law pertaining directly to the parties\u2019 conduct while, in contrast, \u00a7 35-44b evinces the legislature\u2019s intent with respect to the interpretation of substantive antitrust statutes like \u00a7 35-31 (b). The concurrence\u2019s analysis misstates the central issue herein, which is the applicability of \u00a7 35-44b, and to resolve that question, we necessarily must compare \u00a7 35-31 (b) and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, to ascertain the relevant similarities and differences between the state and federal enactments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"AiXj\"> We also note that adoption of the federal standard would diminish the strict construction that we give to the exceptions under \u00a7 35-31, including \u00a7 35-31 (b). <em>Cheryl Terry Enterprises, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>270 Conn. 619, 628, 854 A.2d 1066 (2004), citing <em>Mazzola </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>supra, 169 Conn. 355.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b839-6\"> We note that further explication on this point by the trial court would have greatly aided our review of the market definition issue, and that the better practice would have been for the plaintiffs, who as the appellants bear responsibility for providing an adequate record for review, to move for an articulation pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 66-5. Nevertheless, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim remains reviewable because: (1) the underlying facts are undisputed in light of the trial court\u2019s decision to treat the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion as one of judgment on the pleadings; see footnote 5 of this opinion; (2) whether the trial court properly granted a motion for summary judgment is a question of law subject to de novo review; and (3) the relevant documents are part of the record on appeal.

See Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Acts 1967, No. 381. The plaintiffs rely on language in the special act that expressly mentions the authority of the Southeastern Connecticut Water Authority to obtain and sell water at wholesale to water utilities. See Special Acts 1967, No. 381, \u00a7 14 (h). The defendants, in contrast, rely on the Southeastern Connecticut Water Authority\u2019s eminent domain power, which it received despite concerns of investor-owned water utilities that were expressed in committee hearings. See Special Acts 1967, No. 381, \u00a7 14 (c). We conclude that, although this special act supports the plaintiffs\u2019 contentions with respect to the distinction between wholesale and retail water markets; see part K A of this opinion; it is otherwise tangential to the present case because it does not provide water companies or municipalities with any relevant powers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"AMe\"> We note that the trial court\u2019s decision in the present case cited and quoted only \u00a7 25-33c in discussing the statutory and regulatory scheme, but acknowledged that the defendants provided it with a comprehensive synopsis of the entire scheme.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"AVY\"> Accordingly, the legislature also gives the department of public health jurisdiction over \u201cail matters concerning the purity and adequacy of any water supply source used by any municipality, public institution or water company for obtaining water, the safety of any distributing plant and system for public health purposes, the adequacy of methods used to assure water purity, and such other matters relating to the construction and operation of such distributing plant and system as may affect public health.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 25-32 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"AkG\">By way of illustration, the defendants cite several examples of the department of public health\u2019s extensive jurisdiction over water companies and their properties, such as the requirement of a written permit for the transfer, lease, assignment or change in the use of watershed lands.

I agree with the result reached by the majority, but disagree with its method <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>of statutory analysis. This case requires us to resolve an apparent inconsistency in the antitrust statutes. While General Statutes \u00a7 35-31 (b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides that the antitrust provisions of chapter 624 do not apply to activities that are \u201cspecifically directed or required by a statute of this state, or of the United States,\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 35-44b<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides that, in interpreting the antitrust provisions, \u201cthe courts of this state shall be guided by interpretations given by the federal courts to federal antitrust statutes.\u201d As the defendants, the city of New London, the town of Waterford and their respective water pollution control authorities, point out, federal courts have concluded that the state action exemption applies to municipal activities that are the \u201c \u2018foreseeable result\u2019 of what the statute authorizes.\u201d <em>Electrical Inspectors, Inc. </em>v. <em>East Hills, </em>320 F.3d 110, 119 (2d Cir. 2003). The statutory authorization need not be explicit. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The defendants argue, in effect, that the plain and unambiguous language of both statutes cannot be given effect and, therefore, federal state action immunity standards should be read into \u00a7 35-31 (b), contrary to the plain language of that statute. The apparent inconsistency between these statutes can be reconciled, however, by application of the principle that \u201c[w]here statutes contain specific and general references covering the same subject matter, the specific references prevail over the general.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Galvin </em>v. <em>Freedom of lnfor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number><em>motion Commission, </em>201 Conn. 448, 456, 518 A.2d 64 (1986). Because \u00a7 35-31 (b) is more specific than \u00a7 35-44b, its terms should prevail in this case. Thus, there is no need to go beyond the plain and unambiguous language of the statute. See General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z (\u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d). Accordingly, I believe that the statutory analysis should begin and end with the application of \u00a7 l-2z. I see no need for the majority\u2019s lengthy \u201cexamination of the interplay . . . between federal case law . . . governing state action immunity, and the statutory state action immunity standard set forth by \u00a7 35-31 (b)\u201d or its application of the standards set forth in <em>Manifold </em>v. <em>Ragaglia, </em>272 Conn. 410, 419, 862 A.2d 292 (2004) (this court\u2019s \u201cfundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the <em>apparent intent </em>of the legislature\u201d [emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted]) and <em>Jagger </em>v. <em>Mohawk Mountain Ski Area, Inc., </em>269 Conn. 672, 679, 849 A.2d 813 (2004) (court looks to \u201cwords of the statute itself, to the legislative histoiy and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b857-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 35-31 (b) provides: \u201cNothing contained in this chapter shall apply to those activities of any person when said activity is specifically directed or required by a statute of this state, or of the United States.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b857-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 35-44b provides: \u201cIt is the intent of the General Assembly that in construing sections 35-24 to 35-46, inclusive, the courts of this state shall be guided by interpretations given by the federal courts to federal antitrust statutes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b857-8\"> The majority applies this principle to conclude that \u00a7 35-31 (b) should apply over the more general provisions of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, as construed by the federal courts. I disagree. Federal antitrust law pertaining to state action immunity is more lenient than \u00a7 35-31 (b), but is just as specific. The reason that we should not follow federal law in this case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>that the provisions of \u00a7 35-31 (b) are more specific than the provisions of \u00a7 35-44b and, therefore, to the extent that there is a patent inconsistency between the plain language of \u00a7 35-31 (b) and the federal law, the provisions of \u00a7 35-44b requiring us to follow federal law do not apply. I recognize that \u00a7 35-44b requires us, as a threshold matter, to compare the plain language of \u00a7 35-31 (b) with the relevant federal law to determine whether such an inconsistency exists in the first instance. Once it has been determined that such an inconsistency exists, however, we are no longer bound by \u00a7 35-44b in construing the meaning of \u00a7 35-31 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"ASQE\">The majority argues that my analysis is internally inconsistent because the canon of statutory construction providing that specific statutes prevail over more general statutes is, itself, a form of \u201c \u2018extratextual evidence ....\u2019\u201d See footnote 25 of the majority opinion. I disagree. I believe that \u201cwe may apply the ordinary canons of judicial construction in <em>seeking </em>the plain meaning\u201d of the statutory scheme. (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 634, 816 A.2d 562 (2003) <em>(Zaretta, J., </em>dissenting, joined by <em>Sullivan, C. J.). </em>Thus, this canon informs us, before we ever look to federal law, that if there is an inconsistency between federal law and \u00a7 35-31 (b), \u00a7 35-31 (b) prevails over \u00a7 35-44b.</p>\n<p id=\"AfR9\">Finally, the majority argues that the canon providing that the specific prevails over the general does not apply because \u00a7 35-31 (b) and \u00a7 35-44b are fundamentally different. At the heart of the majority\u2019s analysis, however, is its recognition that the general rule that we follow federal precedent when interpreting the Connecticut Antitrust Act does not apply when the specific text of our antitrust statutes requires us to do otherwise. See <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westport Transit District, </em>235 Conn. 1, 15-16, 664 A.2d 719 (1995). This is an application of the very canon that the majority purports to reject. Thus, my disagreement with the majority is not with its general approach to the issue or its conclusion, but with its apparent unwillingness to state simply and explicitly that, because the language of \u00a7 35-31 (b) is plain and unambiguous, we are bound by that language and, because \u00a7 35-31 (b) is more specific than \u00a7 35-44b, we are not bound by \u00a7 35-44b.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
