On appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the plaintiff contends that the trial court improperly concluded that the state was entitled, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17b-93<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 17b-94,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to the full amount of its statutory lien for medicaid and public assistance reimbursement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>from the proceeds of the settlement of a personal injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>action without a pro rata reduction for the attorney\u2019s fees that had been incurred by the plaintiff in connection therewith. We conclude that although the trial court properly dismissed the plaintiffs administrative appeal, it should have been dismissed on different grounds. We conclude that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs administrative appeal pursuant to the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq., because the administrative appeal did not relate to a \u201c \u2018[contested case\u2019 \u201d as that term is defined by General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We, therefore, reverse the judgment and remand the case to the trial court with direction to dismiss the plaintiffs administrative appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. The plaintiff was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident. Having incurred medical bills in the amount of $280,000, the plaintiff received, from the state, medicaid assistance in the amount of $62,890.72 and general cash assistance in the amount of $7700. The plaintiff thereafter obtained an arbitration award in the amount of $747,500, reduced to $526,298.33 after deducting attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Administrative services subsequently notified the plaintiff that it was placing a lien on the proceeds of his personal injury case for reimbursement of the medicaid assistance and general cash assistance the state had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>provided, for a total lien amount of $70,590.72.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter, the plaintiffs attorney sent a letter to the department\u2019s office of legal counsel requesting a hearing to challenge the amount of the lien, and stating his position that the lien should be reduced by one third for \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees incurred in the resolution of this matter</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Subsequently, the department held a hearing, which the notice of decision stated was conducted in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17b-60<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 17b-61,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as well as the UAPA. The hearing officer rejected the plaintiffs contention that \u201cthe amount of the [s]tate\u2019s lien for accident related medical assistance [should] be reduced by [attorney's fees and costs pro rata by one third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>because the [s]tate had the opportunity to sue and it [did not] and saved that cost.\u201d The hearing officer also concluded that the amount of the lien as calculated by administrative services was correct. Accordingly, the hearing officer dismissed the plaintiffs claim and ruled that the state could recover from the plaintiffs arbitration award the assistance payments in the total amount of $70,590.72.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The plaintiff then appealed from the department\u2019s administrative decision to the trial court. The trial court concluded that, although federal medicaid statutes require that the states have a policy for recovering assistance moneys from third parties, neither federal nor Connecticut law require the state to \u201cpursue third parties on its own.\u201d The trial com\u00ed also determined that neither Connecticut nor federal law provides for pro rata reductions in medicaid hen amounts for \u201ccosts incurred in procuring recovery from third parties.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment dismissing the plaintiffs appeal. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff, relying primarily on <em>Norwest Bank of North Dakota, N.A. </em>v. <em>Doth, </em>159 F.3d 328, 334-36 (8th Cir. 1998) (Heaney, J., concurring), and <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>State, </em>142 Wash. 2d 40, 49-50, 10 P.3d 1061 (2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 1020, 121 S. Ct. 1959, 149 L. Ed. 2d 755 (2001), claims that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>improperly concluded that the state was entitled to the full statutory lien without a pro rata reduction for his attorney\u2019s fees. The department contends otherwise in response, and also claims that both the trial court and this court lack subject matter jurisdiction under the UAPA to hear the plaintiffs appeal because there is no \u201c \u2018[contested case\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7 4-166 (2) as the hearing was not required by state statute, but rather, pursuant to the settlement in <em>DelVecchio </em>v. <em>Freedman, </em>United States District Court, Docket No. N-86-136 (D. Conn. March 23, 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">We begin our analysis with the subject matter jurisdiction claim and the applicable standard of review. \u201cWe have long held that because [a] determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, our review is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Nine State Street, LLC </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>270 <em>Conn. </em>42, 45, 850 A.2d 1032 (2004). Moreover, \u201c[i]t is a fundamental rule that a court may raise and review the issue of subject matter jurisdiction at any time. . . . Subject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of the court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it. . . . [A] court lacks discretion to consider the merits of a case over which it is without jurisdiction . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Gaming Policy Board, </em>224 Conn. 693, 698, 620 A.2d 780 (1993); id., 699 (law of case doctrine did not preclude one trial judge from reexamining previous determination by another trial judge that subject matter jurisdiction existed). The subject matter jurisdiction requirement may not be waived by any party, and also may be raised by a party, or by the court sua sponte, at any stage of the proceedings, including on appeal. Id., 698-99; see also, e.g., <em>Webster Bank </em>v. <em>Zak, </em>259 Conn. 766, 774, 792 A.2d 66 (2002) (\u201c[t]his court has often stated that the question of subject matter jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>tion, because it addresses the basic competency of the court, can be raised by any of the parties, or by the court sua sponte, at any time\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\u201cThere is no absolute right of appeal to the courts from a decision of an administrative agency. . . . The UAPA grants the Superior Court jurisdiction over appeals of agency decisions only in certain limited and well delineated circumstances. . . . Judicial review of an administrative decision is governed by General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (a) of the UAPA, which provides that [a] person who has exhausted all administrative remedies . . . and who is aggrieved by a final decision may appeal to the superior court .... A final decision is defined in \u00a7 4-166 (3) (A) as the agency determination in a contested case ....</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\u201cA contested case is defined in \u00a7 4-166 (2) as a proceeding ... in which the legal rights, duties or privileges of a party are required by statute to be determined by an agency after an opportunity for hearing or in which a hearing is in fact held .... Not every matter or issue determined by an agency qualifies for contested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>case status. . . . [W]e have determined that even in a case where a hearing is in fact held, in order to constitute a contested case, a party to that hearing must have enjoyed a statutory right to have his legal rights, duties or privileges determined by that agency holding the hearing .... In the instance where no party to a hearing enjoys such a right, the Superior Court is without jurisdiction over any appeal from that agency\u2019s determination.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Gaming Policy Board, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 699-700, quoting <em>New England Dairies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Agriculture, </em>221 Conn. 422, 427, 604 A.2d 810 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">In <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Gaming Policy Board, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 694-95, the executive director of the gaming policy board had terminated a state lottery supervisor for insubordination. The supervisor received an initial pretermination hearing before the executive director, and a second hearing before the board, which approved the director\u2019s decision to terminate him. Id., 695. The supervisor then appealed from that administrative decision to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (a) of the UAPA, and the trial court dismissed the administrative appeal. Id., 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">On appeal, this court stated that, \u201c[ejven if the plaintiff did have a legal right or privilege in continued employment with the division, and even if that right or privilege was terminated in a deficient proceeding before the executive director and the board, the plaintiff still cannot prevail unless the defendants were statutorily required to determine the plaintiffs legal right or privilege to his continued employment in a hearing.\u201d Id., 700-701. This court affirmed the trial court\u2019s determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction for lack of a \u201ccontested case\u201d because the hearing was not statutorily required. Id., 702-703. The court reviewed all of the statutes governing the \u201cactivities of the division of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>special revenue and the gaining policy board\u201d; id., 701; and concluded that, \u201cin the absence of an express statutory requirement obligating the defendants to determine the plaintiffs legal right or privilege to continued employment, the plaintiffs claim fails.\u201d Id., 703. In so holding, the court rejected the supervisor\u2019s argument that the existence of an agency personnel policy requiring pretermination hearings rendered his a \u201ccontested case\u201d under the UAPA. Id., 703-704. The court stated that, \u201calthough agency regulations, rules or policies may require the agency to hold a hearing, that does not constitute a matter as a \u2018contested case\u2019 under \u00a7 4-166 (2) unless the plaintiffs rights or privileges are \u2018statutorily\u2019 required to be determined by the agency. If the plaintiffs rights or privileges are not \u2018statutorily\u2019 required to be determined by the agency, a \u2018contested case\u2019 does not exist and a plaintiff would have no right to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (a).\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id., 705; see also, e.g., <em>Dyous </em>v. <em>Psychiatric Security Review Board, </em>264 Conn. 766, 775, 826 A.2d 138 (2003) (reviewing appeal options provided by General Statutes \u00a7 17a-597 [a] and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>concluding that \u201cthere is no administrative appeal from the decision of the [psychiatric security review board] transferring the plaintiff to a maximum security facility\u201d); <em>Morel </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Public Health, </em>262 Conn. 222, 236-37, 811 A.2d 1256 (2002) (concluding that vendor could not take administrative appeal of his disqualification from federal supplemental food program because department hearing was required by federal regulation, not state statute), overruled on other grounds by <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>270 Conn. 665, 675-76, 855 A.2d 212 (2004); <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Medical Examining Board for State Employee Disability Retirement, </em>75 Conn. App. 215, 221-23, 815 A.2d 281 (2003) (no right to appeal from board\u2019s denial of disability retirement benefits because chapter containing applicable statute was silent as to hearings before board).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Indeed, the court further noted in <em>Lewis </em>that, \u201c[although \u00a7 4-166 (2) excludes a large class of agency decision-making from contested case status, it nonetheless provides that the legislature, rather than the agencies, has the primary and continuing role in deciding which class of proceedings should enjoy the full panoply of procedural protections afforded by the UAPA to contested cases, including the right to appellate review by the judiciary. Deciding which class of cases qualifies for contested case status reflects an important matter of public policy and \u2018the primary responsibility for formulating public policy must remain with the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Gaming Policy Board, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\u201cTo ascertain whether a statute requires an agency to determine the legal rights, privileges or duties of a party, we need to examine all the statutory provisions that govern the activities of the particular agency or agencies in question.\u201d Id., 701. We begin with the relevant lien statutes, specifically \u00a7\u00a7 17b-93 and 17b-94. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>footnotes 2 and 3 of this opinion. We note that the text of neither statute requires a hearing prior to the department\u2019s imposition of a lien on the proceeds of a lawsuit. Moreover, our review of the social services statutes reveals a wide variety of specific circumstances wherein the legislature has mandated the provision of a hearing by the department, none of which apply to the imposition of alien. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 17b-16b (limitation of benefits for persons with outstanding state or federal felony arrest warrants); General Statutes \u00a7 17b-66 (public assistance determinations); General Statutes \u00a7 17b-654 (determinations with respect to applicants for or recipients of vocational rehabilitation services).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cThe contrast between [the lien statutes] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>and those statutes is persuasive evidence of a lack of a similar legislative purpose to impose by statute a hearing requirement . . . .\u201d <em>Morel </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Public </em>Health, supra, 262 Conn. 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">This lack of a statutoiy prerequisite is consistent with the department\u2019s position that it provides such hearings pursuant to a settlement agreement that the department entered into in <em>DelVecchio </em>v. <em>Freedman, </em>supra, Docket No. N-86-136. In <em>DelVecchio, </em>the parties entered into a stipulation of dismissal in exchange for the department\u2019s promulgation of new notices, policies and procedures with respect to statutoiy liens. These policies and procedures included the provision of hearings to contest the existence or amounts of the claimed statutory liens, pursuant to then General Statutes \u00a7 17-2a, which is now \u00a7 17b-60.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that, in the absence of a statute <em>requiring </em>that the department conduct a hearing with respect to the liens, the \u201c \u2018[contested case\u2019 \u201d requirement of \u00a7 4-166 (2) was not satisfied, and the trial court accordingly lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the UAPA.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, although the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>court properly rendered judgment dismissing the plaintiffs administrative appeal, it should have done so for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, rather than on the substantive merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The form of the judgment is improper, the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to dismiss the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b460-5\"> The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b460-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17b-93 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) If a beneficiary of aid under the state supplement program, medical assistance program, aid to families with dependent children program, temporary family assistance program or state-administered general assistance program has or acquires property of any kind or interest in any property, estate or claim of any kind, except moneys received for the replacement of real or personal property, the state of Connecticut shall have a claim subject to subsections (b) and (c) of this section, which shall have priority over all other unsecured claims and unrecorded encumbrances, against such beneficiary for the full amount paid, subject to the provisions of section 17b-94, to him or in his behalf under said programs ....</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">\u201c(c) No claim shall be made, or lien applied, against any payment made pursuant to chapter 135, any payment made pursuant to section 47-88d or 47-287, any court-ordered retroactive rent abatement, including any made pursuant to subsection (e) of section 47a-14h, section 47a-4a, 47a-5, or 47a-57, or any security deposit refund pursuant to subsection (d) of section 47a-21 paid to a beneficiary of assistance under the state supplement program, medical assistance program, aid to families with dependent children program, temporary family assistance program or state-administered general assistance program. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">\u201c(e) The Commissioner of Social Services shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, establishing criteria and procedures for adjustment of the claim of the state of Connecticut under subsection (a) of this section.

Shortly thereafter, the department filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, contending that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain it in the absence of a statutory requirement that the department hold a hearing before it imposes a lien pursuant to \u00a7 17b-94, which means that it was not a \u201c \u2018[cjontested case\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7 4-166 (2). The Appellate Court denied the department\u2019s motion without prejudice, but sua sponte ordered the parties to brief the issue of whether the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the UAPA because the department\u2019s decision was not a \u201cfinal decision in a contested case . . . .\u201d After briefing was completed, we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.

We also note that the plaintiffs reliance on <em>Meinket </em>v. <em>Levinson, </em>193 Conn. 110, 474 A.2d 454 (1984), is misplaced. In <em>Meinket, </em>this court stated, inter alia, that, \u201c[t]he modem law of civil procedure suggests that even litigation about subject matter jurisdiction should take into account the importance of the principle of the finality of judgments, particularly when the parties have had a full opportunity originally to contest the jurisdiction of the adjudicatory tribunal. . . . Under the restatement view, a collateral attack on a judgment in a contested case, such as this one, may raise only limited claims of lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 114. <em>Meinket </em>is inapposite because that case involved a collateral attack on a default judgment that had been rendered after a prior proceeding. Id., 111-12. In contrast, the present case simply is a direct appeal from the initial proceedings before the trial court, and thus raises no such finality of judgment issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b468-5\"> In addition to the plain language of \u00a7 4-166 (2), the court found in the legislative history and the case law of other jurisdictions additional support for the proposition that the hearing must be mandated by statute to qualify as a \u201ccontested case\u201d under the UAPA. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Gaming Policy Board, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 706-709. It noted that when \u00a7 4-166 (2) first was enacted in 1971; Public Acts 1971, No. 854, \u00a7 1; it \u201ccontained the language \u2018required by law\u2019 rather than \u2018required by statute.\u2019 The phrase \u2018required by law\u2019 is found in the 1961 Model State Administrative Procedure Act, and is also found in the statutes of most other jurisdictions that have adopted the model act. . . . The term \u2018law\u2019 as contained in the contested case provisions in other jurisdictions has a broader meaning than the term \u2018statute,\u2019 and has been interpreted in other jurisdictions to refer genetically to any species of law, including constitutional provisions, and agency rules, regulations and policies. ... In 1973, the Connecticut legislature amended \u00a7 4-166 (2) and replaced the \u2018required by law\u2019 language with \u2018required by statute.\u2019 ... By amending \u00a7 4-166 (2) to replace the phrase, \u2018required by law,\u2019 with the phrase, \u2018required by statute,\u2019 the legislature clearly manifested an intent that only a determination of rights, duties and privileges required by statute would constitute a basis for a \u2018contested case.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Gaming Policy Board, </em>supra, 706-707.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b470-5\"> See also General Statutes \u00a7 17b-77 (providing hearings for persons \u201caggrieved by\u201d department decisions as to \u201cgood cause\u201d or \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d with respect to assistance applicants\u2019 failure to provide information about absentee parent); General Statutes \u00a7 17b-81 (c) (determination of contributions by legally liable relatives pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4a-12); General Statutes \u00a7 17b-99 (a) (revocation of vendor licenses and franchises); General Statutes \u00a7 17b-112 (g) (\u201c[a]n applicant or recipient of temporary family assistance who is adversely affected by a decision of the Commissioner of Social Services may request and shall be provided a hearing\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 17b-241 (b) (rates of free-standing detoxification centers); General Statutes \u00a7 17b-242 (a) (rates of home health care agencies); General Statutes \u00a7 17b-271 (termination of agreements entered into pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17b-267 between department and fiscal intermediary agencies or organizations); General Statutes \u00a7 17b-275 (physician and pharmacy lock-in arrangements for medicaid recipients utilizing medical services or items at \u201cfrequency or amount that is not medically necessary\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 17b-341 (regulation of rates of self-pay long-term care facilities); General Statutes \u00a7 17b-351 (b) (compensation for loss of constructed, but unlicensed nursing home beds); General Statutes \u00a7 17b-352 (e) (certificates of need for long-term care facilities); General Statutes \u00a7 17b-357 (d) (compliance with federal statutes governing long-term care facilities); General Statutes \u00a7 17b-358 (a) (denial of long-term care facility\u2019s application to terminate department\u2019s appointment of \u201ctemporary manager\u201d to oversee operations and compliance with federal law); General Statutes \u00a7 17b-496 (persons aggrieved by department decisions with respect to Connecticut Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract to the Elderly and the Disabled Program); General Statutes \u00a7 17b-526 (c) (department determinations with respect to financial feasibility of construction of continuing care facilities); General Statutes \u00a7 17b-749 (c) (7) and (8) (commissioner must provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>administrative hearing and appeals process with respect, to child care subsidy program); General Statutes \u00a7 17b-892 (revocation of community action agencies\u2019 designation to serve political subdivisions).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b471-8\"> The department\u2019s policy also provides in relevant part that the bureau of collection services is required to request from the department of income maintenance, now the department of social services; see General Statutes \u00a7 17b-l; \u201ca statement of assistance for a plaintiff or a relative for whom the plaintiff is legally liable immediately after discovering that the state may have a claim against the proceeds of the plaintiffs cause of action.

A letter containing the same information and written in plain language will be sent to the plaintiff at the same time.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b471-9\"> At oral argument before this court, the plaintiff relied on <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Fairfield Hills Hospital, </em>215 Conn. 675, 577 A.2d 1025 (1990), and argued that this court and the trial court have subject matter jurisdiction over his claims because they implicate constitutional supremacy clause issues with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>respect to whether the state lien statutes satisfy the state\u2019s federal obligation to recover medicaid moneys expended. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396k. The plaintiffs reliance on <em>Payne </em>is misplaced because, in that case, the court concluded that the plaintiffs failure to exhaust his administrative remedies did not deprive the courts of subject matter jurisdiction when the plaintiffs claim involved a plenary challenge to General Statutes \u00a7 17-257w (c), now General Statutes \u00a7 17a-602, as applied to all insanity acquittees. <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Fairfield Hills Hospital, </em>supra, 681-82. <em>Payne </em>is inapposite because the present case does not involve the plaintiffs failure to exhaust administrative remedies; rather, it implicates the different issue of whether a \u201ccontested case\u201d exists for purposes of an administrative appeal pursuant to the UAJPA. Indeed, in <em>Payne, </em>this court stated specifically that, \u201ca party who has a statutory right of appeal from a decision of an administrative agency may not bring an independent action to test the very issues that the statutory appeal was designed to test.\u201d Id., 679. Accordingly, and as was noted during the department\u2019s oral argument before this court, because the plaintiff has no statutory right of administrative appeal, he is not foreclosed from seeking judicial relief; he just may not do so under the provisions of the UAPA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
