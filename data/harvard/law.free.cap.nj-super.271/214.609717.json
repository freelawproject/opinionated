We reach our conclusion in light of the overwhelming, and essentially uneontested, proofs that defendant caused the accident and injuries for which she was indicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">On August 1,1989, at approximately 4:10 p.m., defendant struck and killed Meryl Wasserman, then fifteen years old, who was standing on the side of the road with her bicycle picking flowers. After striking Ms. Wasserman, the pickup truck defendant was driving returned to the road, and crossed the roadway into oncoming traffic, where it struck the vehicles in which the other victims were riding. The vehicle travelled about 500 feet before coming to a stop. Defendant was found to have had a blood alcohol reading of .17 shortly after the accident, together with .63 micrograms of prozac and .16 micrograms of xanax per milliliter of blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">The principal issue on this appeal flows from the trial judge\u2019s ruling that defendant could not offer the testimony of a psychologist, Dr. Frederick Rotgers, in support of a diminished capacity defense. The judge concluded that the essence of testimony, proffered through Dr. Rotgers at an <em>Evid.R. </em>8 hearing, was relevant only to the defense of intoxication which could only excuse crimes requiring purposeful or knowing conduct. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-8b. As defendant was charged only with crimes requiring reckless culpability,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the judge determined that defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>dant could <em>not </em>introduce the evidence in support of a diminished capacity \u201cdefense\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:4-2. That provision of the Code of Criminal Justice provided at the time of trial, as it does now, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">Evidence that the defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect is admissible whenever it is relevant to prove that the defendant did not have a state of mind which is an element of the offense. In the absence of such evidence, <em>it may be </em>presumed that the defendant had no mental disease or defect which would negate a state of mind which is an element of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">During trial defendant\u2019s treating psychiatrist, Dr. John Robert Blake, testified for the State<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that prior to the accident he had diagnosed defendant \u201cas having panic disorders with agoraphobia.\u201d He prescribed xanax for the condition. The doctor \u201cadded a diagnosis of alcohol abuse\u201d when he discovered defendant \u201cabusefd]\u201d alcohol. The doctor told defendant not to mix alcohol with medication. According to Dr. Blake, the combination of xanax and alcohol \u201caffectfs] the brain in a dramatically more marked way than either one of the substances would on their own,\u201d and he was sure from discussions with defendant that \u201cshe was aware that alcohol would exacerbate and make the use of her medications very dangerous.\u201d He gave defendant \u201cwarnings ... that mixing the medications with alcohol can be potentially dangerous and is really forbidden.\u201d Nevertheless, defendant \u201cdenied that she was drinking alcohol in a way that was a problem.\u201d The doctor endeavored to develop a treatment plan which took the impact of defendant\u2019s alcoholism into account and commenced to introduce prozac in lieu of xanax. Nevertheless, defendant remained on xanax which \u201cmultiplfied] the [negative] effect of [the] alcohol\u201d in affecting her judgment and put her \u201cat higher risk for engaging in dangerous activities.\u201d On the other hand, according to Dr. Blake, defendant was \u201cable to perceive risks and consciously disregard them,\u201d suffered no disorder that affected the \u201chigher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>functioning part of her brain\u201d and could \u201cassess her own behavior \u25a0 and appreciate the consequences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Defendant presented Dr. Rotgers, a clinical psychologist, at an <em>Evid.R. </em>8 hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rotgers concluded that based on his \u201cevaluation of her\u201d and defendant\u2019s blood alcohol and medication levels at the time of the accident, defendant was \u201cseverely cognitively impaired at the time by virtue of being intoxicated, highly intoxicated with alcohol and alprazolam, which is the prescription drug Xanax.\u201d He noted she also had prozac in her system and, as a result of the combination, was \u201cseverely, severely cognitively impaired.\u201d Dr. Rotgers noted that the blood alcohol reading of .17 was \u201cvery high in and of itself, and in combination with the Xanax ...., the level of impairment was far beyond what it would have been simply had she been intoxicated with alcohol\u201d and was equivalent to a .20 or .25.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Dr. Rotgers explained that \u201cbecause of the combination of alcohol and Xanax\u201d defendant suffered from \u201ctunnel vision,\u201d and in that condition \u201cshe was just unable to think about what the risks might have been.\u201d The doctor further stated that the \u201csynergistic effect\u201d of the combination of alcohol and xanax prevented defendant from perceiving the risk of driving in her \u201chighly intoxicated\u201d state and consciously avoiding it. In response to a question from the judge at the end of the hearing, Dr. Rotgers also noted that \u201cbut for the panic attack\u2014panic disorder and agoraphobia, [defendant] wouldn\u2019t have been drinking.\u201d He stated that drinking was defendant\u2019s way of \u201crelieving] the pressure of\u2019 her agoraphobia and panic disorder and that she found the combination of alcohol and xanax \u201cdampened the anxiety\u201d more than xanax alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Dr. Rotgers acknowledged, however, that defendant \u201cimplemented\u201d that remedy \u201con her own.\u201d He further explained that because defendant was \u201calcohol dependent\u201d her drinking began \u201cto get out of control\u201d and she was unable to stop, although she perceived the drinking \u201csubjectively as [having] a therapeutic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>effect.\u201d In summary, Dr. Rotgers testified that defendant was \u201chighly intoxicated\u201d and based on the aggregate of facts and conditions was \u201cseverely impaired\u201d at the time of the accident. But he was not certain whether this impairment met the \u201clegal criterion for diminished capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Defendant first contends that the convictions must be reversed because Dr. Rotgers\u2019 testimony was excluded and the defendant was precluded from asserting a diminished capacity defense. Defendant contends that although defendant\u2019s panic disorder and agoraphobia did not alone constitute mental disease or defect which negated the requisite culpability, the combination of defendant\u2019s ingestion of xanax, prozac and alcohol taken to combat her medical condition was of such a nature that it rendered her incapable of perceiving the risk of driving in her \u201chighly intoxicated\u201d state, which precipitated the accident that resulted in Meryl Wasserman\u2019s death. Specifically, defendant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">In summary and paraphrased, Dr. Rotgers testified that the combination of diagnosed conditions caused defendant to consume Xanax, Prozac and Alcohol on August 1, 1989, further the conditions and substances in combination negated defendant\u2019s <em>cognitive abilities </em>prior to her deciding to drive the motor vehicle, the operation of which in turn caused the death of Meryl Wasserman. Dr. Rotgers held firm to a totality of conditions and circumstances analysis in support of his expert opinion that Gail Kotter\u2019s <em>cognitive abilities </em>to assess risk, evaluate her ability to drive and in fact <em>perform the </em>activities necessary to drive a motor vehicle were grossly impaired. He refused the [c]ourt\u2019s urging to isolate the cause and effect to a singular mental condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">We will assume that defendant\u2019s contentions are directed to the other convictions as well as the aggravated manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">We agree with defendant that a diminished capacity charge must be given to the jury when there is evidence of a mental disease or defect that negates the state of mind required to commit the offense or impacts on a defendant\u2019s ability to form the requisite culpability. <em>State v. Galloway, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>631, 647, 628 A.2d 735 (1993); <em>State v. Moore, 122 N.J. 420, </em>432-37, <em>585 </em>A2d 864 (1991); <em>State v. Pitts, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>580, 562 A.2d 1320 (1989); <em>State v. Carroll, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>549, 577 A.2d 862 (App.Div.1990), <em>certif. denied, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>326, 604 A.2d 600 (1991). This is true even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>with respect to a case in which only \u201creckless\u201d conduct suffices to convict. <em>See State v. Juinta, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>711, 724-25, 541 A.2d 284 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>339, 550 A.2d 453 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">In asserting that the defense produced enough evidence to warrant the presentation of proofs and instructions on diminished capacity, defendant relies upon <em>State v. Galloway, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 631, 628 A.2d 735. In <em>Galloway </em>the Appellate Division had concluded that defendant, who had been diagnosed as having a \u201cpersonality disorder,\u201d could not be considered as having \u201ca mental disease or defect.\u201d . We had further determined that a \u201cpersonality disorder\u201d and the loss of impulse control \u201cwas not the type of mental disease that had been recognized by our law as diminishing mental capacity by affecting cognitive faculties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 641, 628 A.2d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The Supreme Court, however, concluded that the diagnosis did not control and that \u201c[f]orms of psychopathology other than clinically-defined mental diseases or defects may affect the mental process and diminish cognitive capacity, and therefore may be regarded as a mental disease or defect in the statutory or legal sense\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-2. <em>Id. </em>at 643, 628 A.2d 735. The Supreme Court further determined that whether \u201ca condition constitutes a mental disease or defect is one to be made in each case by the jury after the court has determined that the evidence of the condition in question is relevant and sufficiently accepted within the psychiatric community to be found reliable for courtroom use.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The fact that the condition did not fit within a specific category within the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM </em>Manual) does not control and that \u201c[t]he formal characterization of the defendants\u2019 mental condition was not critical\u201d to the diminished capacity defense. <em>Id. </em>at 645, 628 A. 2d 735. In essence, the <em>Galloway </em>Court held</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">that all mental deficiencies, including conditions that cause a loss of emotional control, may satisfy the diminished-capacity defense if the record shows that experts in the psychological field believe that kind of mental deficiency can affect a person\u2019s cognitive faculties, and the record contains evidence that the claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>deficiency did affect the defendant\u2019s cognitive capacity to form the mental state necessary for the commission of the crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 647, 628 A.2d 735.]</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Hence, if the \u201cevidence is sufficient to allow a jury to consider and determine whether defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect that impaired his cognitive capacity and prevented him from forming the intent\u201d or culpability required for the act, the issue is for the jury to decide. <em>Id. </em>at 649, 628 A.2d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">However, we agree with the trial judge that, in light of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-8b, a charge on diminished capacity would have been inappropriate in this case. The judge stated that if the defense were \u201callowed, it would contravene the provisions of 2C:2-<em>8(h). </em>In short, it would serve as nothing more than an intoxication defense which is prohibited by statute.\u201d The judge added that alcohol abuse would become a defense to any \u201creckless manslaughter or a death by auto charge where drinking was involved if the defendant at one time suffered some type of emotional disease that caused that person to begin to drink.\u201d In essence, the judge concluded that defendant was endeavoring to assert \u201can intoxication defense that the legislature felt should be precluded in reckless culpability cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">Dr. Rotgers did not testify at the <em>Evid.R. </em>8 hearing that defendant\u2019s panic attack disorder <em>or </em>mental condition affected her ability to form the requisite state of mind or culpability, or even affected her cognitive faculties at the time. Rather, Dr. Rotgers indicated that the ingestion of prescribed drugs taken for the mental condition together with the drinking of alcohol combined to impair the defendant\u2019s cognitive faculties. It was the opinion of the defense expert that the \u201cdiagnosed condition\u201d required defendant \u201cto consume\u201d drugs which when taken with alcohol caused her to \u201cnegate ... cognitive abilities.\u201d Thus, it was the combination of the alcohol and medication, and not the mental condition, which caused defendant\u2019s \u201chighly intoxicated\u201d state and affected her perceptions. In essence, defendant\u2019s faculties would not have been impaired \u201cbut for\u201d the alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>It is true that Dr. Rotgers indicated that defendant\u2019s mental condition led her to drink, and to drink excessively in light of the medication. It is also true that the medication was prescribed because of a mental condition. But while doctors need not conclude that defendant suffers from a particular condition or disorder, and no <em>DSM </em>Manual diagnosis is necessary to support the defense, we deal with a legal question concerning \u201cwhether defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-2.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We emphasize that this is not a case where defendant\u2019s cognitive faculties were limited exclusively because of medication prescribed for a medical condition. While Dr. Rotgers did note that defendant\u2019s alcohol abuse was psychologically related to her medical condition and her psychological needs, we cannot conclude that the Legislature intended to have the diminished capacity \u201cdefense\u201d erode the limited impact of the intoxication defense which does not excuse reckless culpability. Dr. Rotgers did not suggest pathological intoxication. Indeed, the pathological intoxication defense was not asserted, and defendant does not now suggest its application. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-8d, e(3). Dr. Rotgers did not suggest that defendant\u2019s cognitive faculties were impaired by any, pathological or psychological condition\u2014or even exclusively by her medication for her psychological condition\u2014only by a combination of the medicine prescribed for her mental condition and the alcohol defendant consumed. Whether or not defendant\u2019s drinking was \u201cvoluntary\u201d as a matter of fact, it was \u201cself-induced\u201d as a matter of law (see <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-8e(2)), and \u201c[w]hen recklessness establishes an element of the offense, if the actor, due to self-induced intoxication, is unaware of a risk of which he would have been aware had he been sober, such unawareness is immaterial.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:2-8b.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>We therefore agree with the trial judge that permitting the \u201cdefense\u201d of diminished capacity in these circumstances involving allegations of reckless misconduct would be inconsistent with legislative intent. <em>Cf. State v. Hammond, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>306, 571 A.2d 942 (1990) (involuntary intoxication not a defense to driving while intoxicated). In <em>Galloway, </em>the Supreme Court did not consider an issue involving intoxication or alcohol abuse, and we agree with the trial judge that if the proofs here justified a defense of diminished capacity, we would be approving a complete defense to a crime premised on reckless culpability, notwithstanding the fact that the Legislature stated that self-induced (non-pathological) intoxication cannot excuse such wrongdoing. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-8b. To the contrary, the Legislature has provided that \u201c[ijntoxication does not, in itself, constitute mental disease within the meaning of chapter 4,\u201d which includes <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:4-2. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>2C:2-8c. Thus, while intoxication may in other circumstances combine with a defendant\u2019s mental condition to prevent the defendant from having the requisite state of mind and proofs may be admissible to raise that issue, if a charge were given to the jury on diminished capacity in this case, \u201cself-induced\u201d ingestion of alcohol would provide a defense to a crime involving reckless culpability, notwithstanding the significant impact of the alcohol. As Dr. Rotgers stated that defendant\u2019s ingestion of alcohol on top of xanax had a \u201csynergistic effect\u201d which prevented her from realizing the risk involved and consciously avoiding it, his testimony essentially supported an intoxication defense under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-8b. However, that defense relates only to crimes involving purposeful or knowing culpability. <em>State v. Warren, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>571, 575-77, 518 A.2d 218 (1986); <em>State v. Cameron, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>42, 52, 514 A.2d 1302 (1986); <em>State v. Juinta, supra, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 722-23, 541 A.2d 284. Here, defendant was not charged with such a crime. Rather, she was charged with aggravated manslaughter, reckless aggravated assault, and assault by auto, all of which involve only reckless culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">We do not conclude that the State did not have the burden of proving the requisite culpability, and the judge charged the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>that it did. The difficulty in this case, unlike others, is that we deal facially with a ruling concerning the admissibility of evidence, not with the failure to give a diminished capacity instruction to the jury based on the evidence admitted. <em>See State v. Moore, supra, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>at 434-37, 585 A.2d 864 (error in instructions requires reversal); <em>State v. Pitts, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>580, 592, 562 A.2d 1320 (1989) (evidence insufficient to warrant a diminished capacity instruction); <em>State v. Carroll, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>549, 560-61, 577 A.2d 862, <em>certif. denied, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>326, 604 A.2d 600 (1991) (erroneous instruction found to be harmless because of insufficient proofs to support the defense); <em>see also State v. Watson, </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>169, 178-181, 618 A.2d 367 (App.Div.1992) (erroneous instruction harmless because Dr. Rotgers\u2019 testimony which included consideration of impact of alcohol did not support finding of diminished capacity as a matter of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">We nevertheless agree with the trial judge here that the evidence submitted at the <em>Evid.R. </em>8 hearing would not have warranted a diminished capacity charge and that Dr. Rotgers\u2019 testimony in furtherance of a diminished capacity defense was inadmissible.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Defendant attacks the judge\u2019s instruction on the meaning of reckless conduct. With respect to the reckless culpability requirement for an aggravated manslaughter, reckless manslaughter and death by auto conviction (charged as lesser included offenses on count one), the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">You\u2019ll see as I define these three statutes that the reckless conduct required by the aggravated manslaughter statute is qualitatively greater than the recklessness required to support a reckless manslaughter charge, and the reckless conduct contemplated by reckless manslaughter is <em>quantitatively </em>greater than the recklessness contemplated by the death by auto statute. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">With respect to the death of Ms. Wasserman as alleged in count one, the judge subsequently instructed the jury, that to convict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>defendant of aggravated manslaughter, it must find that \u201cthe defendant acted recklessly ... that defendant was aware of and consciously disregarded the risk of probably causing death and that the risk she disregarded was a substantial and unjustifiable one.\u201d The judge later compared this to \u201c[t]he degree of risk in reckless manslaughter [which] is a mere possibility of death.\u201d The judge noted the distinction between the \u201cprobable result\u201d required for aggravated manslaughter and \u201cpossibility of death\u201d required to prove simple manslaughter several times. The judge also emphasized \u201cthe additional element that [the] death be caused under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to [the value of] human life\u201d to sustain an aggravated manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Defendant argues that the terms \u201cprobable\u201d and \u201cpossible\u201d are \u201cstatistical terms of quantitative difference (Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary) [and] are not qualitatively different.\u201d Hence the defendant charges that the charge was wrong and inconsistent. There was no objection to the charge in this regard, and use of the words \u201cprobable\u201d and \u201cpossible\u201d in terms of defining the difference between aggravated and simple manslaughter has been recognized in the law. See <em>State v. Curtis, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>854, 366-67, 479 A.2d 425 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>212, 491 A.2d 708 (1984). <em>See also State v. Clausell, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>298, 332, 580 A.2d 221 (1990). The judge also noted the distinction between recklessness required for manslaughter and the lesser offense of death by auto. <em>See State v. Jiminez, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>567, 574-84, 608 A.2d 996 (App.Div.1992). We are therefore satisfied that the jury was properly instructed in the charge as a whole and that the jury understood the instructions. Hence, we find no plain error in the judge\u2019s instructions warranting reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Defendant argues that the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive. She challenges both the increase in the presumptive term from twenty to thirty years, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-4c, 44\u2014lf(l)(a), and imposition of a period of parole ineligibility. The judge gave a comprehensive statement of reasons and concluded \u201cthat the aggravating factors substantially outweigh[ed] the mitigating\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>expressly applied those reasons to increase the presumptive term and impose the parole disqualifier.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The question before us is not whether we would have increased the presumptive term or whether we would have imposed a parole disqualifier. Rather, the only issue properly before us is whether the sentencing judge exercised his discretion \u201cin accordance with, the principles set forth in the Code.\u201d <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 365, 471 A.2d 370 (1984). If there is a basis in the record for the findings of aggravating and mitigating factors and the balancing thereof, and the judge applied the correct sentencing guidelines and reached a conclusion that could \u201chave reasonably been made upon weighing of the relevant factors\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 366, 471 A.2d 370), there is no basis for our interference. Moreover, we cannot \u201csecond-guess\u201d the sentencing judge <em>(Id. </em>at 365, 471 A.2d 370), and must uphold the sentence even if there is \u201croom for reasonable disagreement\u201d as to whether it is the appropriate one. The sentence is facially severe, particularly by virtue of the imposition of the discretionary parole ineligibility term for defendant\u2019s first criminal offense. However, about two weeks after this transaction defendant was again arrested (and subsequently convicted) for drunk driving and having an open container of alcohol in her motor vehicle, notwithstanding the events giving rise to this prosecution. Moreover, concurrent sentences were imposed irrespective of the fact there were separate victims, and we deem that factor to be significant with respect to the propriety of the aggregate sentence. In fact, the judge specifically indicated that he was not imposing consecutive sentences because he imposed the ineligibility term. The aggregate specific term may not be much higher than what might have been imposed in the form of consecutive sentences, and the ineligibility term was only one-third of the specific term imposed. In any event, given our scope of review, we find no basis for interfering with the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">We do not believe that the other issues raised by defendant warrant discussion. <em>R. </em>2:11\u20143(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-13\"> The trial judge also sat as a municipal court judge for purposes of hearing the driving while intoxicated charge. <em>See State v.
