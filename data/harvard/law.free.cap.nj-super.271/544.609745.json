The infraction which caused the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Township to initiate the proceeding did not arise from the lawful exercise of plaintiffs police powers in furtherance of his official duties. Nevertheless, plaintiff argues that the plain language of the second part of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-155 compels reimbursement when a proceeding, in which the police officer prevails, is initiated by the municipality rather than by another entity. We disagree, and affirm the summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs complaint. We also affirm on the Township\u2019s cross-appeal from the denial of its claim under the frivolous claims statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:15-59.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">On September 21, 1989, plaintiff appeared to testify before a Gloucester County Grand Jury in his capacity as a police officer. The charges being investigated involved an alleged aggravated assault and terroristic threat upon him by a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">While waiting to be called as a witness, plaintiff became \u201cvery agitated\u201d and expressed an intention to leave. He told Assistant Prosecutor Keith Warburton that he was going to leave because he had been waiting since 9:00 a.m. and it was his day off. According to Warburton, plaintiff threatened to slap him if Warburton did not return to the grand jury room. Warburton thereupon instructed plaintiff to leave. Because of plaintiffs absence, the Grand Jury returned a \u201cno bill\u201d on the criminal charges being investigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">As a result of the incident, the Township\u2019s Chief of Police initiated a disciplinary proceeding against plaintiff charging him with violating various provisions of the Township\u2019s police manual. A hearing officer found plaintiff guilty of the charges and recommended a ten-day suspension. The Merit System Board affirmed. Plaintiff thereupon filed an appeal before us. In an unpublished opinion, we held that the Chiefs complaint was not filed within the forty-five day limitation period of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-147, and accordingly reversed. (A-1886-91T1).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Plaintiff filed the present action against the Township pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-155, demanding reimbursement for $14,866.83 incurred in counsel fees during the disciplinary proceeding and subsequent appeal. The motion judge granted the Township <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>summary judgment dismissing the complaint, concluding that since plaintiffs conduct was not directly related to the lawful exercise of police powers and in furtherance of his official duties, plaintiff was not entitled to reimbursement under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-155 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">Whenever a member or officer of a municipal police department or force is a defendant in any action or legal proceeding arising out of and directly related to the lawful exercise of police powers in the furtherance of his official duties, the governing body of the municipality shall provide said member or officer with necessary means for the defense of such action or proceeding, but not for his defense in a disciplinary proceeding instituted against him by the municipality or in criminal proceeding instituted as a result of a complaint on behalf of the municipality. If any such disciplinary or criminal proceeding instituted by or on complaint of the municipality shall be dismissed or finally determined in favor of the member or officer, he shall be reimbursed for the expense of his defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-8\"> The language \u201cand directly related to the lawful exercise of police powers in the furtherance of his official\u201d duties was added in 1986 by the Legislature <em>(L. </em>1985, c. 457 \u00a7 1) to \u201celiminate the coverage of this section for charges arising from acts outside the scope of police duties, but occurring in the course of the performance of those duties, and for \u2018status charges.\u2019\u201d <em>See </em>Senate County &amp; Mun. Gov\u2019t Comm., <em>Statement to Senate Bill No. 168k </em>(1985). The amendment was in response to an interpretation of the preamendment version of the statute by the Supreme Court in <em>Moya v. City of New Brunswick, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>491, 448 A.2d 999 (1982), where the Court expanded the municipality\u2019s obligation to reimburse police officers beyond the literal terms of the statute. <em>See Sparkman v. City of Atlantic City, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>623, 628-29, 568 A.2d 917 (App.Div.1990). Thus, a police officer is now entitled to a \u201cmeans for the defense\u201d of an action or reimbursement for counsel fees only where he is \u201ccharged with an infraction arising from the lawful exercise of police powers in the furtherance of his official duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 629, 568 A.2d 917. This is so even if the infraction or criminal act occurs while the officer is on duty. <em>Bruno v. City of Atlantic City, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>469, 474, 571 A.2d 1003 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>165, 584 A.2d 231 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Plaintiff does not contend that his confrontation with and threat against the Assistant Prosecutor arose out of and directly related to \u201cthe lawful exercise of police powers in the furtherance of his official duties.\u201d Indeed, plaintiff does not challenge the finding by the motion judge that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\">It\u2019s clear to me that plaintiffs misconduct which preceded his testimony can\u2019t be deemed, in fact, I think it\u2019s conceded by [plaintiffs counsel] that it doesn\u2019t, arise out of and be directly related to the lawful exercise of police powers in the furtherance of plaintiffs official duties. [Plaintiffs] reasons for being obnoxious, threatening to assault the assistant prosecutor were personal and did not further his police duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">We may therefore assume that had plaintiff been a defendant in any action or legal proceeding instituted by an entity other than the municipality arising from his conduct, he would not have pressed his claim for reimbursement of his counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Rather, plaintiff advances before us a narrow statutory-interpretation argument. He points out that the statute has two parts. The first is contained in the initial, sentence of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-155, which requires the municipality to provide a defense in any action against the officer, criminal or otherwise, <em>except </em>in a proceeding filed by the municipality. Plaintiff argues that the second part of the statute, the last sentence, unambiguously provides that if any disciplinary proceeding \u201cinstituted by or on complaint of the municipality\u201d is dismissed, the officer \u201cshall be reimbursed for the expense of his defense.\u201d Plaintiff asserts that it is only the first part of the statute, involving proceedings instituted by entities' other than the municipality, that was tightened by the 1986 statutory amendment. Thus, he reasons, whether or not the infraction arises from the lawful exercise of police powers in the furtherance of his official duties, if the proceeding is initiated by the municipality and is dismissed, the municipality must reimburse.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Plaintiffs argument undercuts the legislative purpose of the 1986 amendment to the statute and would lead to absurd results. <em>See Schierstead v. City of Brigantine, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>220, 281, 148 A.2d 591 (1959). Under plaintiffs reading, whether or not the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>officer is entitled to reimbursement depends solely on the identity of the complainant. But the legislative goal to the 1986 amendment was to deny a means for the defense of an action or reimbursement when the officer\u2019s infraction or criminal act is a \u201cperversion\u201d of, rather than in furtherance of his official duties. <em>Bruno, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 473, 571 A.2d 1003. That goal is achieved by focusing on the nature of the police officer\u2019s conduct rather than who has initiated the proceeding against him. Indeed, even under the preamendment version of the statute, we held in <em>Meyerson v. City of Bayonne, </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>437, 442-43, 449 A.2d 542 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>567, 453 A.2d 879 (1982), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">notwithstanding the fact that the criminal proceedings here were initiated by a complaint signed by [the municipality] and determined in favor of [the police officer |, we hold that [the officer] is not entitled to be reimbursed ... in defending against those charges because they did not arise out of nor were they incidental to the performance of [the police officer\u2019s] duties!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-7\"><em>See also, Sparkman, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 629-30, 568 A.2d 917 (denial of police officer\u2019s demand for counsel fees incurred by him in defense of criminal charges returned by grand jury <em>and </em>disciplinary proceedings initiated by municipality).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Admittedly, the last part of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-155 is clear. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\">If any <em>such disciplinary </em>or criminal <em>proceeding instituted by </em>or on complaint of the <em>municipality shall be dismissed or </em>finally determined in favor of the member or officer, <em>he shall be reimbursed, for the expense of his defense.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-10\">[(Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">However, the sentence was intended only to distinguish between a municipality\u2019s obligation to <em>reimburse </em>a police officer after a proceeding instituted by it is finally determined in the officer\u2019s favor, and its obligation to provide a defense to the officer at the outset of a proceeding instituted by some other entity. <em>See Township of Edison v. Mezzacca, </em>147 <em>N.J.Super. </em>9, 14, 370 A.2d 511 (App.Div.1977). By speaking in terms of reimbursement, the sentence focuses on the municipality\u2019s obligation to pay costs already incurred by the officer in successfully defending against the municipality\u2019s complaint. This would include \u201cthe reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>fees of counsel selected by the officer, for the municipality could have no say in the choice of counsel to defend against charges made by it.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">In contrast, the first part of the statute pertains to the defense of actions other than those initiated by the municipality. Instead of focusing on <em>reimbursement, </em>it requires the municipality to provide \u201cnecessary means for the defense of such action or proceeding.\u201d In such cases, at the outset of the proceeding \u201cthe municipality must provide competent counsel, its own or outside counsel, or it may approve counsel requested by the officer!.]\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, the municipality is provided with some control over costs, or at least is placed in a position to know in advance what those costs will be. <em>Id. </em>at 15, 870 A.2d 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Consequently, the two sentences, read together, simply construct a rational mechanism whereby the municipality reimburses the prevailing police officer in cases instituted by it, and provides a means of defense of those not so instituted. However, in either case, the message of the 1986 amendment is clear: the police officer will be entitled to reimbursement or counsel \u201conly where he is charged with an infraction arising from the lawful exercise of police powers in the furtherance of his official duties.\u201d <em>Sparkman, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 629, 568 A.2d 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
