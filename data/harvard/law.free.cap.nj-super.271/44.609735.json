THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING DEFENSE COUNSEL\u2019S MOTION TO SUPPRESS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-8\">II. THE SENTENCE IMPOSED WAS MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">The only argument which requires discussion is Ellis\u2019 argument that the trial court should have granted his motion to suppress. Defendants\u2019 other arguments are clearly without merit and do not require discussion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2). We conclude that Ellis\u2019 motion to suppress was properly denied, but we reach this conclusion for different reasons than the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">The trial court made the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-11\">On October 1,1989, the narcotics unit, Tucson, Arizona airport detail, received an anonymous tip that two black males would transport narcotics aboard American Airlines flight no. 230 bound for Newark International Airport, Newark, New Jersey. The Arizona police believed that both men, later identified as Jessie Ellis and Vernon Kelly, had purchased one-way tickets to Newark airport and had refused to place identification tags on their suitcases when asked to do so by airline personnel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-12\">This information was communicated by telephone to the port authority police at Newark International Airport, who provided it to Detective Joseph Bienkowski, a 23-year veteran of the Criminal Investigations Bureau. Detective Bienkowski, in turn, contacted the United States Customs Office to conduct a K-9 screening of all the luggage from flight no. 230. Detective Bienkowski and other police from the DEA and port authority participated in the investigation. The officer observed the K-9 dog sniff each bag before it was placed on the conveyor belt. The dog reacted positively to four bags. Immediately following the dog\u2019s reaction, Detective Bienkowski placed a \u201cdummy bag\u201d ahead of the four bags in question. It is common practice for port authority officers to place \u201cdummy bags\u201d ahead of suspected contraband bags to alert plainclothes officers waiting at the baggage carousel as to which passengers and bags to observe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-13\">Detective Bienkowski went to the luggage claim area for the aircraft in question and joined several other plainclothes agents who were watching that area. Ellis and Kelly claimed the four bags in question and began to exit the baggage area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-14\">As Ellis and Kelly walked toward the terminal doors, Detective Bienkowski and the other officers identified themselves as police officers and both men placed the bags on the floor. Defendants were asked for their permission to have their four bags searched and were informed that they had the right to refuse the search. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Kelly stated, \u201cThey\u2019re not our bags. You can search them.\u201d Ellis, standing beside Kelly, did not answer and remained silent throughout the search. The luggage was opened and the four bags contained approximately 100 pounds of marijuana divided into five packages of approximately 20 pounds a package. Ellis and Kelly were then placed under arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">[246 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 74-75, 586 A.2d 876.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">These findings are supported by substantial credible evidence. <em>See State v. Alvarez, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>560, 564, 570 A.2d 459 (App.Div.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">The trial court rejected the State\u2019s argument that defendants \u201cabandoned\u201d their four bags when they placed them on the floor of the terminal and Kelley said, \u201c[tjhey\u2019re not our bags.\u201d <em>Id., </em>246 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 76, 586 A.2d 876. However, the court agreed with the State\u2019s contention that Kelley voluntarily consented to the search of the bags. The trial court also ruled that Ellis acquiesced in that consent, reasoning that \u201cEllis\u2019 silence and refusal to object to the statement \u2018they\u2019re not our bags\u2019 and subsequent failure to object to the actual police search of the luggage constituted a valid and lawful consent to search by acquiescence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77, 586 A.2d 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">Ellis does not dispute the trial court\u2019s holding that Kelley validly consented to the police officers\u2019 search of the two bags Kelley had been carrying. However, Ellis argues that the State failed to show that Kelley had \u201ccommon authority\u201d over the two bags Ellis had been carrying and thus Kelley\u2019s consent to search did not extend to those bags. Ellis also argues that the State failed to show circumstances which would justify a finding that he impliedly acquiesced in Kelley\u2019s consent to search the bags.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">Consent to a search may be obtained not only from the owner of the property to be searched but also \u201cfrom a third party who possesses common authority over the property, see <em>United States v. Matlock, </em>415 <em>U.S. </em>164, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>988, 39 L.Ed.2d 242 (1974), or from a third party whom the police reasonably believe has authority to consent, see <em>Illinois v. Rodriguez, </em>497 <em>U.S. </em>177, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>2793, 111 L.Ed.2d 148 (1990).\u201d <em>State v. Maristany, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>299, 305, 627 A.2d 1066 (1993). \u201cIn assessing an officer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>reliance on a third party\u2019s consent, we consider whether the officer\u2019s belief that the third party had the authority to consent was objectively reasonable in view of the facts and circumstances known at the time of the search.\u201d <em>State v. Suazo, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>315, 320, 627 A.2d 1074 (1993); <em>see generally, </em>Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search &amp; Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment, </em>\u00a7 8.3 (2d ed. 1987) (1994 pocket part at 70-71).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">We are satisfied that the police, based upon the circumstances known to them when they stopped defendants near the baggage carousel, reasonably relied upon Kelley\u2019s consent to the search of all four bags, including the two which Ellis had been carrying. The police received an anonymous tip that the defendants were jointly involved in the transportation of narcotics from Tucson, Arizona to Newark. The suspicion created by this tip was reinforced by defendants\u2019 refusal to place identification tags on their bags when they checked them at the Tucson airport. In addition, when the bags arrived in Newark, a K-9 dog trained by the United States Customs office to detect narcotics reacted positively to all four bags. Consequently, the police had a reasonable basis for believing that each of the four bags contained narcotics, that defendants were jointly engaged in the transportation of those narcotics into New Jersey, and that they had joint possession of the four bags as part of that criminal enterprise. Under these circumstances, the police had an objectively reasonable basis for believing that Kelley had the authority to consent to a search of all four bags. This belief was reinforced by the fact that Ellis, who was standing next to Kelley when he consented, failed to assert that any of the bags belonged to him alone or to object to the search. <em>Cf. United States v. Langston, </em>970 F.2d 692, 698 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>439, 121 L.Ed.2d 358 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
