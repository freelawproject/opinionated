The Law Division judge denied the application because the debtor did not have the present capacity to pay. We conclude that the application should have been granted because <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:17-50 is mandatory. If the debtor has absolutely no ability to pay any amount, the wage execution may be modified by a stay pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:17-55, until payment is possible. The priority of the wage execution thus is established, but a just resolution under the circumstances is obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>The debtor-defendant here had defaulted under an automobile loan agreement in November 1990. The creditor-plaintiff repossessed the automobile and sold it at public auction to the highest bidder pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-706. A deficiency of $6,927.82 resulted and prompted the wage execution application. At the hearing in response to the wage execution order, the judge examined the <em>pro se </em>debtor and found that she \u201cobviously\u201d had no present ability to pay under a wage execution. That finding is well-supported by the record. We have no quarrel with it. <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co. of America, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 483-84, 323 A.2d 495 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">We do conclude that the judge should not have denied the wage execution application summarily. The statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:17-50,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is mandatory; it directs that \u201cthe court <em>shall </em>grant an order\u201d executing on wages upon proper application, (emphasis added). In <em>Greate Bay Hotel and Casino v. Guido, </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>301, 304, 592 A.2d 319 (App.Div.1991), we explained the reason for the mandatory character of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:17-50 and explained why the statute does \u201cnot contemplate the exercise of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The mandatory language protects priorities. \u201cThe difference between the initial application and the modification is a significant one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304, 592 A.2d 319. Wage executions are satisfied sequentially, in order of priority. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:17-52. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>\u201cOnce in effect, that execution retains priority, over other, later executions although it may be modified to accommodate the ends of justice.\u201d 249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 304, 592 A.2d 319; <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2A:17-55.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">As Judge Long explained in <em>Greate Bay, </em>the mandatory scheme \u201cwas created to avoid a situation in which one judge denies a wage execution and another judge thereafter grants one to a less diligent junior creditor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304-05, 592 A.2d 319. The statute\u2019s mandate establishes the policy\u2014prior in time, prior in right.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">We interpret <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:17-55 conferring the power to permit \u201cmodification of such execution as shall be deemed just\u201d to include the issuance of a stay of the order of execution until payment is possible. The statute provides that the execution, when \u201cmodified shall continue in full force and effect until fully paid____\u201d <em>Id. </em>Suspension of actual collection on a wage execution under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:17-55, with judicial protection of the priority is thus achieved, <em>see Family Finance Corp. v. Jenkins, </em>131 <em>N.J.Super. </em>336, 343, 329 A.2d 604 (Cty.Dist.Ct.1974), but the debtor\u2019s rights are not overlooked.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">We modify the Law Division judge\u2019s order of June 11, 1993. We direct that the wage execution be imposed <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to March 22, 1993, the date the wage execution was \u201cpresented\u201d to the debtor, <em>see N.J.S.A </em>2A:17-52, and that the execution be stayed pending further order of the Law Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Remanded for modification.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-8\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A: 17-50 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-9\">When a judgment has been recovered in the Superior Court, a County Court or county district court and where any wages, debts, earnings, salary, income from trust funds, or profits are due and owing to the judgment debtor, or thereafter become due and owing to him, to the amount of $48.00 or more a week, the judgment creditor may, on notice to the judgment debtor unless the court otherwise orders, apply to the court in which the judgment was recovered, or to the court having jurisdiction of the same, and upon satisfactory proofs, by affidavit or otherwise, of such facts, the court shall grant an order directing that an execution issue against the wages, debts, earnings, salary, income from trust funds, or profits of the judgment debtor.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b418-9\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A: 17-55 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-10\">Either party may apply at any time to the court from which an execution mentioned in section 2A:17-50 of this title shall issue, upon such notice to the other party as such court shall direct, for a modification of such execution. Upon the hearing, such court may make such modification of such execution as shall be deemed just. Such execution as so modified shall continue in full force and effect until fully paid and satisfied, or until further modified as herein provided.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
