The indictment, filed on August 8, 1989, was returned after defendant\u2019s prior guilty plea in the Spring Lake Heights Municipal Court to a complaint which charged that on September 24, 1988 defendant committed a \u201ctheft upon Dr. Thomas Leonhardt by knowingly depriving him of one prescription note sheet, and using that note sheet in a fraudulent manner,\u201d in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The municipal court guilty plea was entered on December 14, 1988. Defendant was sentenced that day to probation for one year and to pay a $50 fine and $25 in costs. She received probation for two years and was ordered to pay DEDR and VCCB penalties and a lab fee on the criminal conviction which gives rise to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">The indictment alleged that on October 24, 1988 defendant attempted \u201cto acquire or obtain possession of a controlled dangerous substance, namely Pereocet, by misrepresentation, fraud, deception or subterfuge, contrary to the provisions of <em>N.J.S. </em>2C:5-1 and <em>N.J.S. </em>20:35-13.\u201d In giving a factual basis for her guilty plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>to the indictment in the Law Division, defendant admitted taking a \u201cprescription sheet from [her] doctor\u201d and that she \u201cwrote on it and ... tried to obtain drugs that way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">On this appeal defendant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">POINT I PROSECUTION OF THE INDICTMENT IS BARRED BY THE DOUBLE JEOPARDY CLAUSE OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND ARTICLE I, SECTION 11 OF THE NEW JERSEY CONSTITUTION.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Particularly since <em>Waller v. Florida, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>387, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1184, 25 L.Ed.2d 435 (1970), courts have recognized that \u201cthe defense of double jeopardy is available to a defendant, even though the first trial was in a municipal court, as is here the ease.\u201d <em>State v. Ebron, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>207, 215, 294 A.2d 1 (1972). <em>See also State v. DeLuca, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>98, 527 A.2d 1355 (1987), <em>cert. denied </em>484 <em>U.S. </em>944, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>331, 98 L.Ed.2d 358 (1987); <em>State v. Dively, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>573, 458 A.2d 502 (1983). Defendant argues that the municipal court disposition in these circumstances bars prosecution of the subsequent indictment by virtue of three United States Supreme Court decisions. First she claims that as \u201c[t]he fraud that she committed was presenting the prescription form with the forged signature of the doctor to the drug store,\u201d the indictable prosecution for fraud is barred by <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 <em>U.S. </em>299, 52 <em>S.Ct. </em>180, 76 <em>L.Ed. </em>306 (1932). Defendant claims that the prosecution is also barred by <em>Illinois v. Vitale, </em>447 <em>U.S. </em>410, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2260, 65 L.Ed.2d 228 (1980), and <em>Grady v. Corbin, </em>495 <em>U.S. </em>508,110 <em>S.Ct. </em>2084, 109 L.Ed.2d 548 (1990), because both prosecutions involve the same \u201cconduct.\u201d Defendant refers to these cases in support of her claim that the indictable prosecution is barred because the federal and state constitutions prohibit placing a defendant twice in \u201cjeopardy\u201d for \u201cthe same offense.\u201d <em>U.S.C.A. Const. </em>amend. V; <em>N.J. Const. </em>art I, K ll.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Under <em>Blockburger, </em>\u201cthe test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not.\u201d <em>Blockburger, supra, </em>284 <em>U.S. </em>at 304, 52 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 182, 76 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 309, In <em>Vitale, </em>the Court interpreted <em>Blockburger </em>by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">We recognized that the <em>Blockburger </em>test focuses on the proof necessary to prove the statutory elements of each offense, rather than on the actual evidence to be presented at trial. Thus we stated that if \u201c \u2018each <em>\u00a1statute </em>requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not,\u2019 <em>Morey v. Commonwealth, </em>108 Mass. 433, 434 (1871),\u201d the offenses are not the same under the <em>Blockburger </em>test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\"><em>[Illinois v. Vitale, supra, </em>447 <em>U.S. </em>at 416, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2265, 65 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 235.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-8\"><em>Grady </em>held \u201cthat the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a subsequent prosecution if, to establish an essential element of an offense charged in that prosecution, the government will prove conduct that constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted.\u201d <em>Grady, supra, </em>495 <em>U.S. </em>at 510, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2087, 109 L.Ed.2d at 557 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">Here the conduct involved in the criminal prosecution did not involve the theft for which defendant had pled guilty in the municipal court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The non-indictable theft may have encompassed the means by which defendant obtained the prescription pad, but the indictable prosecution related to her subsequent use of the pad in an illegal manner. The non-indictable offense dealt with a theft from the office of Dr. Leonhardt in Spring Lake Heights on September 24, 1988. The indictment related to defendant\u2019s endeavor to obtain CDS on October 24, 1988 in Brick Township. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>This case therefore deals with isolated events, not a single event which was the subject of multiple prosecutions in <em>Vitale </em>and <em>Grady. See also State v. DeLuca, supra, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>98, 527 A.2d 1355; <em>State v. Dively, supra, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>573, 458 A.2d 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">In any event, in <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>509 U.S.-, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>2849, 125 L.Ed.2d 556 (1993), a majority of the United States Supreme Court has overruled <em>Grady. See </em>509 <em>U.S. </em>at-- -, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2859-64, 125 L.Ed.2d at 572-78 (Part IV of Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices O\u2019Connor and Thomas, 509 <em>U.S. </em>at-,-, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2865, 2868, 125 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 579, 583, and by Justice Kennedy). Under <em>Dixon, </em>which deems the <em>Blockburger </em>\u201csame elements\u201d test as controlling, the constitutional inquiry is described as \u201cwhether each offense contains an element not contained in the other; if not, they are the \u2018same offence\u2019 and double jeopardy bars additional punishment and successive prosecution.\u201d <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>509 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2856, 125 L.Ed.2d at 568. Under that test there would clearly be no bar here. We nevertheless have dealt at length with <em>Vitale </em>and <em>Grady </em>because neither party has supplemented their briefs by reference to <em>Dixon </em>and because we must examine if the opinions of the New Jersey Supreme Court which considered <em>pre-Dixon </em>precedent require us to reach a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-14\">Our Supreme Court has not interpreted the constitutional protection against double jeopardy to prohibit prosecution of the indictable offense in these circumstances. In <em>State v. Yoskowitz, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>679, 563 A.2d 1 (1989), defendant pled guilty in Livingston Municipal Court to filing a false police report relating to the fabricated theft of his automobile which was reported as stolen in order to obtain insurance proceeds. Defendant was subsequently indicted in Union County for attempted theft by deception and arson. The theft was related to defendant\u2019s false insurance claim, and the arson was premised on arson evidence of defendant\u2019s participation in the destruction of the vehicle. <em>Yoskowitz </em>was decided before <em>Grady, </em>and our Supreme Court noted its prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>consideration in <em>Dimly </em>and <em>DeLuca </em>of the impact of <em>Vitale </em>on <em>Blockburger. </em>In <em>DeLuca, </em>the Court \u201cestablished that a second prosecution will be barred if either the \u2018elements\u2019 test <em>or </em>the \u2018evidence\u2019 test is satisfied.\u201d <em>Yoskowitz, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 691, 563 A.2d 1. Hence, <em>Yoskowitz </em>properly read <em>Vitale </em>to expand on <em>Blockburger. See also State v. Churchdale Leasing, Inc., supra, </em>lio <em>N.J. </em>at 106, 557 A.2d 277; <em>State v. DeLuca, supra, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 107-108, 527 A.2d 1355; <em>State v. White, </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>515, 518-23, 591 A.2d 954 (App.Div.1991). The <em>Yoskowitz </em>Court, applying \u201cthe two-prong double-jeopardy analysis of <em>DeLuca,\u201d </em>upheld the criminal prosecution because \u201cdefendant failfed] to satisfy either the \u2018elements\u2019 or \u2018evidence\u2019 tests.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Yoskowitz, supra, 116 N.J. </em>at 692, 563 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">As already noted, our state constitution must be interpreted to accord the same protection as the federal double jeopardy clause. <em>State v. DeLuca, supra, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 101-102, 527 A.2d 1355; <em>State v. Barnes, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 370, 420 A.2d 303; <em>State v. Rechtschaffer, supra, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 404, 360 A.2d 362. <em>See also State v. Dillihay, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>42, 47, 601 A.2d 1149 (1992); <em>State v. Churchdale Leasing, Inc., supra, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>at 107, 557 A.2d 277, noting that the interpretation of our \u201cState Constitution as coextensive with the federal clause ... evolved ... in the context of multiple prosecutions, not multiple penalties.\u201d We therefore do not read <em>DeLuca </em>or <em>Yoskowitz </em>as requiring adherence to the <em>DeLuca </em>test in light of <em>Dixon. </em>However, to the extent <em>DeLuca </em>and <em>Yoskowitz </em>may be understood to embody state constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>principles, until our Supreme Court holds otherwise, we do not find that the two prosecutions in this case involve the same \u201cconduct\u201d or that the second prosecution was barred. <em>See also State v. Catanoso, </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>246, 266-67, 635 A.2d 512 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>563, 636 A.2d 521 (1993); <em>State v. White, supra, </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 521-22, 591 A.2d 954.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">We also note that there is no statutory bar to the second prosecution. As the first disposition involved a non-indictable matter in Monmouth County, it could not have been joined at the time of disposition with the criminal offense in Ocean County. <em>See Yoskowitz, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 699-704, 563 A.2d 1. Hence, there is no bar to reprosecution based on the failure to join the separate offenses. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-8b; 2C:l-10a(2); <em>R. </em>3:15-l(b). <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-10a(3) (employing the <em>Blockburger </em>test to determine whether there is a bar to subsequent prosecution for a different statutory offense). <em>See also State v. Muniz, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>319, 571 A2d 948 (1990). Although <em>R. </em>3:15-3(a) now requires joinder of non-indictable offenses with indictables involving \u201cthe same conduct or arising from the same episode,\u201d this rule was effective September 1, 1992, long after the disposition of the municipal court (and criminal) charges. <em>See also R. </em>3:15-3(c) on the consequences of the failure to join.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-11\"> As the State points out, actual use of the prescription pad is not an element of theft of moveable property. We do not know why the allegation with respect to use was contained in the complaint, and, as hereinafter rioted, we have not been supplied with a transcript of the municipal court plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b428-8\"> Our state constitution literally protects only against reprosecution \"after acquittal,\" <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, 1f 11, but has been consistently interpreted to be coextensive with, and to provide no greater protection than, the federal double jeopardy clause. <em>See, e.g., State v. Churchdale Leasing, Inc., </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>83, 107, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>557 A.2d 277 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeLuca, supra, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 101-102, 527 A.2d 1355; <em>State v. Barnes, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>362, 370, 420 A.2d 303 (1980); <em>State v. Rechtschaffer, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>395, 404, 360 A.2d 362 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b429-11\"> Defendant has the burden o\u00ed proving her double jeopardy claim, and in the absence of production by her of the transcript of the municipal court proceedings we do not know what facts were relied on in obtaining the factual basis for her plea. As the elements of the two offenses for which defendant was convicted differ, and each requires proof of a fact the other does not, defendant has not sustained her burden. <em>See State v. Ebron, supra, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>at 215-18, 294 A.2d 1 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b431-7\"> The <em>Yoskowitz </em>Court remanded for consideration of whether the criminal prosecution was barred \"under the unique circumstances of [the] case,\" 116 <em>N.J. </em>at 708, 563 A.2d 1, because of the possibly reasonable expectation that the municipal court prosecution was intended to constitute a disposition of all related matters.
