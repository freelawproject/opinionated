[temporarily assigned].</author>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">This appeal requires us to consider whether a tortfeasor\u2019s excess insurer is liable to the victim\u2019s automobile insurer for personal injury protection (PIP) benefits paid by the automobile insurer to the victim. We conclude the excess carrier is liable as an \u201cinsurer\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-9.1, and we affirm the order granting summary judgment to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">While driving his automobile, Charles Self was seriously injured when he collided with a commercial vehicle driven by Thomas Thoenig, owned by Harry A. Kimble &amp; Sons, Inc. Self was insured by Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. and Kimble had a liability policy, with $1 million maximum coverage, from American Reliance Insurance Co., and an excess policy for liability exceeding $1 million from Selective Insurance Co. Liberty Mutual allegedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>paid $13,430 in PIP benefits to Self, and pursuant to <em>N.J.SA </em>39:6A-9.1, sought reimbursement from American Reliance in an arbitration proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">The arbitrator awarded Liberty Mutual $10,590; when asked to pay, American Reliance advised it had exhausted its policy limits of $1 million in settling the basic liability claims for the accident on. Kimble\u2019s account and could not honor the award. Liberty Mutual then learned of the excess policy Kimble had with Selective, and sought reimbursement from Selective without making any further efforts to collect its arbitration award from American Reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Selective refused, claiming its excess liability policy did not cover such a claim, so the PIP carrier filed an action for damages seeking the $10,590 awarded by the arbitrator on the initial claim against American Reliance, the tortfeasor\u2019s primary liability carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">This is a statutory cause of action brought under <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-9.1 which provides the PIP insurer the right to recover, from the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance company, PIP benefits it has paid its insured. That section provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\"><em>An </em>insurer ... paying ... personal injury protection benefits ... as a result of an accident occurring within this State, shall, within two years of the filing of the claim, have the right to recover the amount of payments from any tortfeasor who was not, at the time of the accident, required to maintain personal injury protection or medical expense benefits coverage, other than for pedestrians ... or although required did not maintain personal injury protection ... benefits____ In the case of an accident occurring in this State involving an insured tortfeasor, the determination as to whether an insurer ... is legally entitled to recover the amount of payments ... shall be made against the insurer of the tortfeasor, and shall be by agreement of the involved parties or, upon failing to agree, by arbitration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">Defendant argues, as an excess carrier, it is not \u201cthe insurer of the tortfeasor\u201d intended by this legislation, and only insurers issuing policies required by law, such as primary motor vehicle liability policies, are subject to <em>N.J.SA </em>39:6A-9.1. Because no law requires a motor vehicle owner to carry excess insurance, defendant contends excess carriers are not \u201cinsurers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\"><em>N.J.SA </em>39:6A-9.1 was preceded by <em>N.J.SA </em>39:6A-9 of the original No Fault Act. The two sections must be compared in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>order to ascertain the legislative intent regarding the meaning of \u201cthe insurer of the tortfeasor.\u201d The original section created a right to reimbursement by what it called \u201csubrogation,\u201d but <em>Aetna Ins. Co. v. Gilchrist Bros., Inc., </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>550, 562, 428 A.2d 1254 (1981), explained the right of reimbursement was not created to place the PIP carrier in the shoes of its insured. Because the insured was prohibited from recovering its medical expenses from the tortfeasor by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-12, <em>Aetna </em>held the PIP carrier was encumbered by the same limitation and did not have a right of action against the tortfeasor by way of subrogation. Instead, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-9 provided the PIP carrier a strictly limited right to reimbursement from the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance company, by the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">Such ... insurer may only by intercompany arbitration or by intercompany agreement exercise its ... rights against <em>only the insurer of muy person liable for suck damages in </em>tort____ (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Based on the limited language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-9, in <em>Garden State Fire and Cas. Co. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>176 <em>N.J.Super. </em>301, 422 A.2d 1327 (App.Div.1980), we held an excess insurance earner was not liable for reimbursement of PIP benefits via \u201csubrogation,\u201d not due to its status as an excess carrier, but because the excess policy did not provide PIP coverage. <em>Id. </em>at 306, 422 A.2d 1327. We described the insurer against whom the PIP earner could exercise its statutory right to reimbursement, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">It is only an insurer providing No Fault benefits. This is demonstrated by considering the qualifying phrase that the subrogated insurer may proceed directly against the tortfeasor who failed to have in effect the required No Fault coverage. Obviously, \u201cthe insurer\u2019 referred to in the preceding phrase of that sentence of the statute is one which provides such coverage. The statute does not speak of \u201can insurer\u201d or \u201cany insurer.\u201d Use of the definite article \u201cthe\u201d indicates a particular type of insurer within the contemplation of the act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">[176 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 307-308, 422 A.2d 1327.]</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\"><em>In </em>part, this conclusion was based <em>on our </em>perception that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-9 was enacted for a limited period of two years, in order to \u201callow insurers who provide PIP payments to recover them, at least temporarily, as part of the rate-setting process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 306, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>422 A.2d 1327. <em>See also Pennsylvania Mfrs. Ass\u2019n. Ins. Co. v. Gov\u2019t Emp. Ins. Co., </em>136 <em>N.J.Super. </em>491, 499, 347 A.2d 5 (App.Div. 1975), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>348, 370 A.2d 855 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">The PIP carrier\u2019s right to reimbursement was reinstated nine years later as part of major legislative reforms of the private automobile insurance system. <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-9.1 was enacted as part of the New Jersey Automobile Insurance Freedom of Choice and Cost Containment Act of 1984. It is obvious that <em>N.J.SA </em>39:6A-9.1 was designed to overrule <em>Aetna, </em>but it serves a different purpose and has a broader scope than its predecessor. Reimbursement is not limited to arbitration with another carrier providing PIP benefits. Now a direct action is permitted against the insurer of \u201cany tortfeasor who is not, at the time of the accident, required to maintain personal injury protection ... coverage.\u201d No longer designed just to compile statistics for rate-setting purposes, the right to reimbursement was recreated by this Act whose principal purpose was to reduce the cost of private passenger automobile insurance by substantially revising the no-fault system. <em>See </em>Governor Kean\u2019s Statement to <em>L. </em>1983, c. 362 (October 4, 1983). We have previously indicated that reimbursement was permitted under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-9.1 from commercial carriers who do not provide PIP coverage. <em>See Sherman v. Garcia Const., Inc., </em>251 <em>N.J.Super. </em>352, 598 A.2d 242 (App.Div.1991); <em>see also Buoni v. Browning Ferres Ind., </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>96, 529 A.2d 1044 (Law Div.1987). Allowing the PIP carrier to recoup its payments from a commercial liability carrier reduces premiums for private automobile insurance, thus advancing a purpose of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-9.1. Consistent with this purpose, reimbursement from \u201cthe insurer of the tortfeasor\u201d includes reimbursement from an excess carrier as well as a liability carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Selective also contends <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-9.1 is not applicable because its policy only agrees to \u201cindemnify the insured for ultimate net loss in excess of the ... limit ... which the insured may sustain by reason of liability imposed upon the insured____\u201d It also cites a policy exelusion for \u201cany obligation for which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>insured or any carrier as his insurer may be held liable under any workmen\u2019s compensation, unemployment compensation or disability benefits law, or under any similar law.\u201d We ascertain nothing in the coverage language substantially different from any general liability policy; those also agree to \u201cindemnify\u201d the insured against loss. Nor has the exclusion any apparent relevance to defendant\u2019s statutory duty to reimburse a PIP carrier. Statutory requirements prevail over policy language. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Malec, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>1, 6, 514 A.2d 832 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"AIi\">We agree with Judge Alley\u2019s analysis of <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-9.1 that \u201cthe legislature has implicitly declared through the statute that the burden belongs to the tortfeasors, not the victims. To shift financial responsibility to the wrongdoers\u2019 insurance providers ultimately shifts the costs to the wrongdoers themselves.\u201d We conclude Selective, the issuer of an excess liability policy, becomes an insurer of the tortfeasor when the primary carrier exhausts its limits, and Selective must reimburse Liberty Mutual as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-9.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
