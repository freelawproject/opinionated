Ferreira, by his next friend, John H. Ferreira, against Isaac ft. Diller to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by the plaintiff when run over by an automobile operated by the defendant. From a judgment in favor' of the plaintiff for $4,000, the defendant prosecutes a writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-9\" pgmap=\"573\">This cause has been tried three times, this being the second appeal to this court. The facts are fully stated in the opinion filed at the former hearing. (See Ferreira v. Diller, 176 Ill. App. 447.)</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-10\" pgmap=\"573\">A demurrer was sustained to the third, fourth and fifth counts of the declaration and leave was given plaintiff to amend. He amended the third and fourth counts, by erasing certain lines, and the fifth count by changing the word \u201cor\u201d to \u201cand\u201d on the copy of the original declaration, and not on the original amended declaration. The copy as amended was then refiled and the plaintiff in error then filed a plea of general issue. The plaintiff in error insists that as the fifth count was held bad on demurrer and was not amended, and as the original amended declaration was not refiled, it was error for the court to submit the case to the jury.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-11\" pgmap=\"573\">The evidence of all the disinterested witnesses tended to show the boy was not nearly as badly injured as he thought he was.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b574-7\" pgmap=\"574\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AzTV\" pgmap=\"574\">1.
