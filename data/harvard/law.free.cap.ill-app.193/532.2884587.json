A decree upon an original bill to foreclose a mortgage which is a prior lien to that of a party filing a cross-bill, and asking for a deficiency judgment against the maker and successive owners who assumed the mortgage, may be entered without first having a hearing on the cross-bill and having settled all issues raised thereunder, where the issues in no way affect the interests of the holder of the prior mortgage.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Afb\" pgmap=\"555\">2. Mortgages, \u00a7 632*\u2014when deficiency decree may he entered.

Mortgages, \u00a7 656*\u2014when omission of party harmless error. The omission in an original bill to foreclose a mortgage of the name of a necessary party who executed the note and mortgage is not prejudicial where the evidence shows that the party died several years before the bill was filed and at the time of her death had no interest in the premises except an inchoate right of dower.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AM8\" pgmap=\"555\">4.

Where the amount of an attorney\u2019s fee in an action to foreclose a mortgage was fixed at $238 by the trial court upon the evidence taken in support thereof, it will not be held upon appeal to be excessive where the facts and circumstances shown by the record appear to warrant the charge.</headnotes><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b555-4\" pgmap=\"555\">Frank P. Drennan answered the bill and filed a cross-bill averring ownership of a mortgage covering said premises to secure a note for the principal sum of $1,500 payable to his order, and asking for deficiency judgments against the maker of the mortgage and subsequent owners of the property who had assumed the judgment thereof, if the mortgaged premises should not sell for enough to pay the whole of the mortgage indebtedness.</p><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b555-5\" pgmap=\"555\">F.
