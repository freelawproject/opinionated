The complainants prayed that the action of November 24, 1913, be held illegal; and also for a temporary injunction restraining the defendants from disposing of said property. An injunction without bond was issued. Thereafter a motion, which was denied was made to dissolve the injunction, and by leave of court the complainants dismissed their bill as to one complainant who -had died and as to the defendant Court Bose .No. 12, and made it a complainant, and filed an amended and supplemental bill, to which the Grand Court of Illinois was made a defendant. The amended bill alleged that the laws of the order did not provide adequate relief. Subsequently, with leave of court, other amendments were made to the bill, including the prayer, so as to include the new defendants. The defendants, except the Grand Court, moved to dissolve the injunction, and the motion was denied. The Grand Court answered admitting- most of the allegations of the bill. The other defendants then answered denying most of its allegations, when the defendants with the exception of the Grand Court, again moved to dissolve the injunction, and the motion was denied. Whereupon the defendants, with the exception of the Grand Court, filed a bond, and attempted to appeal from the order denying such motions.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b419-10\" pgmap=\"419\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Ady\" pgmap=\"419\">1. Injunction, \u00a7 367<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when denial of motion to dissolve is appealable. Under section 123 of the Practice Act (J. &amp; A. j[ 8661), an appeal lies from the denial of a motion to dissolve an injunction made either before or after answer.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AOmd\" pgmap=\"419\">2.

The filing of an amendment to an injunction bill, as well as a supplemental bill and amendments thereto, which merely make the allegations of the original bill more specific, although made without an express order that they should be without prejudice to a preliminary injunction previously granted, do not have the effect of dissolving such writ.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AWl\" pgmap=\"419(20) 420(82)\">4. Fraternal and mutual benefit societies, \u00a7 55*\u2014when member may enjoin disposition of property. A bill of complaint filed by a member of a local beneficiary society against the society and its officers, alleging an illegal attempt by the defendants and others to secede from the order, and that the defendants were in possession of money and property belonging to the society which they intended to turn over to a new society which they intended to join, or to convert it to their own use, held to justify the granting of a preliminary injunction until a hearing on the merits.</headnotes><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b419-5\" pgmap=\"419\">It was contended that the verification to the original, the amended and supplemental bills were defective, and made those pleadings entirely on information and belief, and that the court erred in subsequently permitting the amendment of the verifications.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b419-6\" pgmap=\"419\">The motions for leave to file the amended and supplemental bills and subsequent amendments did not ask that it be without prejudice to the injunction.</p><attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b419-7\" pgmap=\"419\">J.
