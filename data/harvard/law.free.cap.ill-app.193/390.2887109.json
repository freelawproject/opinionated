Prom a judgment in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, the defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-9\" pgmap=\"412\">The evidence showed that just previous to the fire, a locomotive belonging to the defendant passed, and in its operation threw out large quantities of cinders; that the wind was blowing from the track towards the bam; and that shortly after the passing of the engine fire was noticed in the portion nearest the track, near an opening in the barn.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-10\" pgmap=\"412\">At the request of the plaintiff, the court instructed the jury that \u201cproof of the destruction of property by fire escaping from a locomotive raises a prima facie case of negligence, which the defendant must rebut by showing the absence of negligence by a preponderance of the evidence, or that plaintiff\u2019s own fault or negligence contributed -to the injury.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-11\" pgmap=\"412\">The errors relied on by the appellant were a denial of a motion to exclude the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, to direct a verdict for the defendant, and in giving such instruction.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b413-7\" pgmap=\"413\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A1V\" pgmap=\"413\">1. Railroads, \u00a7 932<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence warrants inference that fire was caused by locomotive. An inference that a fire which destroyed a barn near a railway track was caused by sparks escaping from a locomotive, may be drawn from evidence that just previous to the fire, when the wind was blowing from the track towards the harn, that an engine passed throwing out a large quantity of cinders, and that soon thereafter fire was discovered in the barn near an opening in the side nearest the track.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Ab7d\" pgmap=\"413\">2. Railroads, \u00a7 945*\u2014directing verdict for defendant in action for fire caused by locomotive. A motion to strike out the plaintiff\u2019s evidence and to direct a verdict for the defendant was properly denied in an action for the destruction of a barn by fire caused by a locomotive, where the testimony showed that the fire was discovered in the barn, near an opening facing the track, shortly after the passing of a locomotive which emitted a large quantity of cinders, and that the wind was blowing from the track towards the barn.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AfB\" pgmap=\"413\">3.

Evidence of circumstances justifying an inference that a fire which consumed a building was caused by burning cinders or sparks emitted from the defendant\u2019s passing locomotive, establishes a prima facie case which, under the statute, casts on the defendant the burden of proving such facts as would excuse it.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"AT2\" pgmap=\"414\">6.
