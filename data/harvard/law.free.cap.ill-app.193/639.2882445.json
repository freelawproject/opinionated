The car had a door on the west side of the north end and one on the east side of the south end. Appellee testified that the motorman in the front vestibule motioned to her to go around the front end of the car to the door on the east side of the rear end; that when she passed around the north end of the car she saw another car coming on the other track, and that it stopped on the opposite crossing; that she then started towards the rear door of the car, and that the other car then started up without ringing a gong or giving any signal and caught and rolled her between it and the stationary car and injured her. The testimony was conflicting as to whether the gong was sounded on the car which caused the injury. The motorman testified that he did not signal appellee to' go around the car, but that he reached to open the front vestibule door, and that she signaled she did not want that door opened. The evidence bearing on the question of the negligence of the appellant and the due care of the appellee was very conflicting.</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b662-8\" pgmap=\"662\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AqO0\" pgmap=\"662\">1.
