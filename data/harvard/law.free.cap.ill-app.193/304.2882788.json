Railroads, \u00a7 ' 334<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when injury to crops by overflow proximate result of obstruction of stream. Evidence that a railway company obstructed a stream by driving piles closely together, which in times of heavy rains or freshets caused the water to back up on the plaintiff\u2019s land to the injury of his crops, is sufficient to sustain an inference that the negligence of the railway company was the proximate cause of such injury.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AYB\" pgmap=\"327\">2.

An instruction in an action against a railway company, for damages to crops from the waters of a stream backing up as the result of the defendant placing piles closely together in the stream, as to the liability of the company for overflow of waters during such a heavy rain or freshet as could have been reasonably anticipated, is not bad because of the omission of the words \u201cby an ordinarily prudent person,\u201d where such qualification was fully covered by other portions of the court\u2019s charge.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b327-4\" pgmap=\"327\">F.
