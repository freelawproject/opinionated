The bill alleged that the complainants were all members of said Court; and in its main features the bill and its amendments were like those discussed in Savio v. Vieno, ante, p.395. A preliminar/injunction was granted. Thereafter by leave of court, the bill was amended, which the defendants moved to dismiss because filed without the consent of certain of the complainants, affidavits of whom were filed denying authority to use their names. The court permitted the complainants to discontinue the suit as to all of such parties excepting Pietro Biva, and then denied the motion to dismiss the action. Complainants filed an amendment to their hill making the Grand Court, Foresters of America, of the State of Illinois, a defendant; whereupon all of the defendants answered ; and thereafter the defendants, other than the Grand Court, moved to dissolve the injunction, which was denied, and the movents then appealed from the two orders denying the motions to dissolve.</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b421-10\" pgmap=\"421\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A28S\" pgmap=\"421\">1. Injunction, \u00a7 262<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when dissolved on filing of plea of another suit pending. An injunction, issued in an action by members of a fraternal society against the officers and trustees thereof, to restrain an unlawful disposition of its property, should not be dissolved and the suit dismissed on the filing merely of a plea of the pend-ency of another action against the defendants pertaining to the same matter where some of the complainants in the last\u2019 action were not parties to the first suit.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AlA\" pgmap=\"421\">2. Equity, \u00a7 183*\u2014when suit dismissed on plea of another action pending. The mere filing of a plea alleging the pendency of another suit between the same parties concerning the same matter does not entitle the defendant to a dismissal of the bill of complaint before the plea has been put on issue and tried.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AS0\" pgmap=\"421(34) 422(23)\">3.
