The plaintiff disregarded the warning signal of the crossing watchman and the call of a brakeman on the next to the last car of the train.</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b550-7\" pgmap=\"550\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A444\" pgmap=\"550\">1. Railroads, \u00a7 633<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when not required to have brakeman on rear car of backing train. It is not the duty of a railroad company to have a brakeman on the rear end of a freight train which is slowly backing towards a public crossing, where the brakes are efficiently operated by power applied from the locomotive.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AZyM\" pgmap=\"550\">2. Railroads, \u00a7 645a*\u2014when absence of brakeman from rear of backing train not proximate cause of injury. The absence of a brakeman on the rear car of a freight train-slowly backing towards a crossing is not the proximate cause of an injury to one driving over the crossing to catch a ferry boat which has given its leaving signal, where the driver had observed the progress of the freight train for two blocks back, and was warned by the crossing flagman and by a brakeman on the car next to the rear.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AyaE\" pgmap=\"550\">3. Railroads, \u00a7 695*\u2014when declaration does not aver duty to place brak\u00e9man on rear of backing train. An allegation in a count in a declaration in an action for personal injuries received while attempting to drive across a track in front of a backing freight train, that it became the duty of defendant railroad company if the cars and engine intended to pass over the crossing, \u201cto station some person on-one of such cars, or on the ground at the crossing,\u201d\" for the purpose of warning all persons about to cross the track that the train was being backed towards the crossing and intended to cross over the crossing, does not allege any duty to have some person stationed on the rear car.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Azfq\" pgmap=\"550\">4. Railroads, \u00a7 713*\u2014what evidence admissible under count charging general negligence. Proof that there was no brakeman on the rear car of a freight train slowly backing towards a public crossing is competent under a count charging general negligence in the operation of the train, in an action to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been received on account of the negligence of the railroad company.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b550-4\" pgmap=\"550\">Samuel Woods and Matthew F.

Railroads, \u00a7 647<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when failure to warn not proximate cause of injury. The failure to sound warning signals upon the approach of a freight train slowly backing towards a public crossing is not the proximate cause of an injury to one attempting to drive over the crossing in front of the approaching train, where he had known for two blocks back that the train was approaching the crossing.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"Ayc\" pgmap=\"551\">6. Railroads, \u00a7 678*\u2014when contributory negligence to cross in front of approaching train. One who has knowledge of the approach of a freight train which is slowly backing towards a public crossing, not only as a result of his own observation but also because of warnings by a crossing flagman and by a brakeman on the next to the rear car, and attempts to cross, does not exercise due care, and is guilty of contributory negligence.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
