Pangburn, administratrix of the estate of John Franklin Pangburn, deceased, plaintiff, against Knickerbocker Ice Company, a corporation, and Levi &amp; Company, defendants, to recover for the wrongful death of plaintiff\u2019s intestate. The action was dismissed as to defendant Levi &amp; Company and there was a verdict and judgment for plaintiff against defendant ice company, for $8,000, from which defendant appeals. .</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-4\" pgmap=\"73(391) 74(254)\">The facts were as follows: Levi &amp; Company were in control of an ice house in which the defendant ice company delivered ice through a door in the east end of the building near the roof. The building had a flat roof and immediately over the door was a six by six beam eighteen feet long, which was securely fastened to the roof. The east end of this beam extended about two feet beyond the building. The beam did not extend out far enough from the building, and perhaps the chain from which the pulley block was suspended did not raise the pulley block high enough to permit the ice brought up by the tackle to go in at the door, and a plank four feet three and one-half inches long was nailed to the top of the beam, the east end of which extended east of the east end of the beam eighteen inches, leaving two feet nine and one-half inches of the plank resting on and nailed to the beam. On top of this plank a block of wood was placed and the chain from which the pulley block was suspended was passed around the block and plank a few inches east of the east \u25a0end of the beam. The beam, plank and block on top of the plank had been in the position described at least eighteen years before the accident. During all this time the defendant provided the pulley block, rope, tongs and other appliances for raising the ice and attached the pulley block to the chain. The defendant ice company and it alone used the beam, plank, chain, pulley block and tackle for the purpose of raising ice. On the day of the accident, certain of the ice company\u2019s employees, including the deceased, were engaged in unloading a car of ice which stood just east of the ice house, and hoisting ice by means of the tackle and putting it into the ice house through the door above mentioned. In this work a horse was used to hoist the ice. In doing so it was found that the ice could not be raised high enough to go in at the door without the pulley block striking against the plank from which it was suspended. About one-third of the carload of ice had been raised before the accident, and each time that ice was hoisted the pulley block struck against the beam with such force as to cause a jar, and the ice company\u2019s superintendent decided that the trouble should be remedied and directed the deceased to go up on the roof and remedy it. In obedience to the order, deceased went on the roof and attempted to remedy the trouble by inserting another block of wood between the chain and the block of wood over which it passed, for the purpose of raising the chain and the pulley block suspended from it. The deceased inserted a block of wood under the chain and signaled the men below to hoist the ice: He then laid down, either on or alongside of the beam and plank with one hand resting on the plank and with his head and body extended about a foot from the building so that he could see as the ice was hoisted whether the trouble had been remedied. When a lot of ice had been hoisted to within, a few feet of the door, the strain on the projecting east end of the plank pulled that part of the plank which was nailed to the beam loose from the beam, and the plank, chain, pulley block, ice, etc., fell to the g*round, a distance of thirty-five or forty feet, carrying with them plaintiff\u2019s intestate, and in the fall he was so injured that he died from the effect of his injuries.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-5\" pgmap=\"74(137) 75(31)\">The plank did not break, but the strain on the outer end of the plank acting on the end of the beam to which the plank was nailed, as a fulcrum, pulled that part of the plank which was nailed to the beam loose from the beam and permitted the plank and appliances attached to it to fall to the ground. An examination of the plank and beam showed that the plank was rotten; that a part of the nails by which it was fastened to the beam were pulled through the plank and remained sticking in the beam, and other nails were pulled out of the beam and remained in the plank. The position of the deceased on or alongside of the plank did not tend to pull the plank loose from the beam, for his weight rested on that part of the plank which was nailed to the beam and not on that part of the plank which extended beyond the end of the beam.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-5\" pgmap=\"75\">The jury returned two verdicts, one finding Levi &amp; Company guilty and assessing plaintiff\u2019s damages as against them at $3,000; the other finding the ice company guilty and assessing plaintiff\u2019s damages against it at $5,000. The record showed that, \u201cthereupon, the trial judge orally instructed the jury that there was a mistake in the rendering of the verdict, and stated orally and not in writing that if they found all the defendants guilty all must be included in one verdict, and they should then assess whatever damages they, the jury, found from the evidence and under the instructions of the court the plaintiff has sustained. The trial judge then directed the jury orally to return and bring in such a verdict, all of which was done in the absence of the defendant, etc. * * * Thereupon, the jury returned into the court and presented to the court the following verdict, signed by all the jurors: \u2018We, the jury, find the defendants guilty and assess the plaintiff\u2019s damages at the sum of -$8,000. \u2019 And as soon as the said proceedings came to the knowledge of the Knickerbocker Ice Company it then and there by its counsel excepted to said procedure, etc.\u201d The court sustained the motion of Levi &amp; Company for a new trial and the suit was then dismissed as to them, and denied the ice company\u2019s motion for a new trial and entered judgment on the verdict against the ice company.</p><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b75-7\" pgmap=\"75\">McKinley &amp; Hansen, and Winston, Payne, Strawn &amp; Shaw, for appellant; Edward W.
