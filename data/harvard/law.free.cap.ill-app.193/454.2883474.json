Mines and minerals, \u00a7 91<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when failure to provide place of refuge pro'ximate cause of injury. Where three juries have found that the proximate cause of a minor\u2019s injury was the failure of an employer to provide places of refuge in a mine as required by section 21b of the Mines and Miners\u2019 Act (J. &amp; A. 7489), and the Appellate Court has held that it was a question for the jury, the question is res adjudicata.</headnotes><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b477-4\" pgmap=\"477\">There is no controversy about the facts. It was agreed on the trial in open court that there had been a violation of the statute. The facts disclosed are substantially the same as they appear on a former appeal of this ease (181 111. App. 197). It is conceded by counsel for appellant that appellee at the time of the injury was-acting within the scope of his employment. The principal contentions urged are that the lack of the places of refuge was not the proximate cause of the injury, errors in the admission of evidence, in the giving of instructions and that the damages are excessive.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b477-5\" pgmap=\"477\">It is also insisted that the places of refuge provided for by the statute then in force were not meant for the benefit of appellee, but for miners going in and out of the mine, so as to allow them to escape passing cars or trips. The appellee, a flagman in a mine, was injured by being unable to escape a car which he had just assisted placing on the track as he was directed to do by an assistant mine boss.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b477-6\" pgmap=\"477\">Error is assigned on the admission of evidence that the injury to the appellee\u2019s prostate gland would cause a lessening of tone, would impair vitality' and vigor and affect the power of procreation also on an instruction given for appellee, that neither assumed risk nor contributory negligence was a defense, without defining these terms.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b477-7\" pgmap=\"477\">Brown, Hay &amp; Creighton, for appellant; Mastin &amp; Sherlock and Underwood &amp; Smyser, of counsel.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b477-8\" pgmap=\"477\">Drennan &amp; Lawler, for appellee.</attorneys> <footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"AVxL\" pgmap=\"477\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.

In an action for injuries sustained by a miner by reason of the failure of the former to provide places of refuge in a mine as required by section 21b of the Mines and Miners\u2019 Act (J. &amp; A. jf 7489), the defendant is not injured by the admission of evidence that at the time the plaintiff was injured he had gone to' the assistance of a driver in replacing a derailed car, at the direction of an assistant mine boss, where the evidence showed that it was a part of the plaintiff\u2019s duties to do so.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"AZf\" pgmap=\"478\">4.
