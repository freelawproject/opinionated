There was a judgment for the defendant, and the plaintiff appeals.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-11\" pgmap=\"272(31) 273(105)\">The deceased, a boy about thirteen years of age, was killed by coming in contact with an electric light wire lying on or near a sidewalk, in the village of Granville, ill Putnam county. The wire was a part of an electric lig\u2019ht system owned and operated by the defendant. On the evening' before the accident a storm broke off a portion of a tree the upper part of which fell over and upon the wires, and about seven o\u2019clock the next morning the wires gave way and the tree fell over and upon the sidewalk, leaving the wires hanging from the poles and reaching to and upon the ground. One person living in the vicinity noticed the position of the wires at the time they broke, but did not notify any one of their condition.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-5\" pgmap=\"273\">The deceased was last seen alive when returning from an errand for his parents, about 11:30 in the morning, going towards the sidewalk on which the tree was lying and about half a block from it. He was next found lying near the tree dead, with one wire under him and another lying, on his breast, spitting fire, with his clothing on fire. There were no eyewitnesses. The engineer in charge of the electric power plant testified that about seven o\u2019clock he felt a jerk or jolt in the machinery, and believing that there was something unusual on the line, made tests with the appliances at hand for that purpose, but found no evidence that any wires were grounded, and that he paid no further attention to the matter until informed of the accident a few minutes after it happened; that the appliance used-by him was known as a \u201cplug-in circuit breaker.\u201d There was testimony given by several experts in electrical matters that the use of such an appliance was of no avail to determine whether there was a broken wire, unless used at the very instant the wire fell, or unless it remained on the ground so as to make a complete circuit; but that had there been a \u201cstatic ground detector\u201d or an \u201cautomatic circuit breaker\u201d in use upon the switchboard of the plant, the current would have been automatically shut off the instant the wires parted. A static ground detector was in the plant at the time of the accident but had not yet been installed.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b274-7\" pgmap=\"274\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AXv\" pgmap=\"274\">1.

It is for the jury to determine whether there was negligence in equipping or operating an electric lighting plant, or in failing to take steps to ascertain whether any accident had happened to its wires after an engineer observed unusual movements of the machinery several hours before a person was killed by electricity from a broken wire hanging in a street.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ACG\" pgmap=\"274\">2.

An instruction in an action for the death of a person by .coming in contact with a charged broken electric light wire hanging in a street, that there could be no recovery if the defendant\u2019s machinery at its plant was equipped with approved and modern appliances in good repair, to prevent and detect the escape of electricity from its wires, and its machinery was properly and carefully managed, held erroneous as excluding from the consideration of the jury the question whether it was negligent in not detecting several hours before the accident, the breaking of the wire, and repairing it.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A-D\" pgmap=\"274(78) 275(27)\">4.

An instruction in an action for the death of a person by coming into contact with a charged, broken electric light wire hanging in a street, that it -was sufficient if the defendant used a high degree of diligence in equipping its machinery with standard appliances, devices and apparatus generally recognized as effective for detecting the condition of the repair of its wires, held erroneous, because ignoring evidence tending to show that the defendant failed to maintain such appliances in good condition and to operate them in a careful and skilful manner.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b274-4\" pgmap=\"274\">Tracy &amp; Tracy and Clarence W.

The question of the negligence of the defendant held for the jury, in an action for the death of a person by coming into contact with a charged, broken electric light wire hanging in a street, where the evidence tended to show that the engineer of the plant noticed something wrong with the machinery which led him to believe that there might be a broken wire, but which the use of the apparatus at hand failed to detect, and he made no further effort to discover the condition of the wires until several hours after the accident.</headnotes> <p id=\"b275-6\" pgmap=\"275\">Niehaus, J., took no part in this decision.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
