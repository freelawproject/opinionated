On January 9,1914, at the September term, 1913, the motions were overruled, and on January 24, 1914, the plaintiff was allowed an appeal to this court on filing a bond within twenty days, and a bill of exceptions within one hundred days. On May 4,1914, a bill of exceptions, was filed, which showed neither a motion for a new trial on September 30, 1912, nor anything that occurred subsequent to the entering of judgment on that day, other than the prayer for an appeal. Neither did the bill of exceptions contain anything as to any motions, or rulings thereon, at the March term, 1914.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-10\" pgmap=\"630(22) 631(13)\">The only bill of exceptions in the case was filed May 4, 1914.
