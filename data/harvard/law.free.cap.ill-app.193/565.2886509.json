Brassard, respectively and separately filed their bills against the defendants in aid of executions issued on judgments which they had respectively and separately recovered against the defendant James H. Snelling. By agreement the suits were consolidated and heard as one case and one decree entered in favor of the complainants, from which the defendants James H. Snelling and Frances E. Snelling appeal.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-10\" pgmap=\"587\">The evidence tended to show that after incurring the indebtedness on which the judgments were obtained, that the defendant James H. Snelling conveyed his farm to Levi W. Rood, who in turn conveyed it to Frances E. Snelling, the wife of James H. Snelling. Frances E. Snelling contended that the deed was given her in consideration of money received by her from her father\u2019s estate and loaned her husband many years before.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-11\" pgmap=\"587(43) 588(157)\">The defendants claimed in their answer to the Brassard bill that the notes on which he (Brassard) recovered judgment against Snelling, Williams and Stewart were void and without consideration as against James H. 'Snelling; that Snelling signed the notes merely as accommodation maker, and that the real makers thereof were Williams and Stewart; that Sneliing was by-fraud and misrepresentation induced by Williams and Stewart to sign the same upon their fraudulent representation .that there was a mortgage of $12,000 upon the property which Sneliing had purchased or traded for in Chicago, whereas in truth there was but a mortgage of $9,000 on said property; that Sneliing signed said notes with the understanding and agreement that there was a $12,000 mortgage on said property; that said Stewart and Williams and one Jesse M. Brown sold to Brassard the notes in question, and that Brassard was informed and well knew at the time of the purchase of said notes that Sneliing had signed same without any consideration; and that in consequence thereof, appellee Brassard required the said Jesse M. Brown to guaranty the note by indorsement thereon before Brassard would or did purchase the same.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-5\" pgmap=\"588\">The appellants claimed that the evidence did not sustain the allegations of the bill and do not warrant the finding in the decree.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-6\" pgmap=\"588(166) 589(31)\">The evidence showed that James H. Sneliing was a farmer. That in 1877 he bought the Southwest Quarter of Section 11 in Township 24 North, Range 9 East of the Third Principal Meridian, in Ford County, for $4,300; that the first payment on the land was $2,000, which he borrowed from his father; that in October, 1885, Sneliing and his wife bought the southeast quarter of the same section, taking title thereto in their joint names, and entered into the possession and enjoyment of the same, as tenants in common; that the quarter section bought by Sneliing, and Snelling\u2019s undivided one-half of this quarter section so jointly purchased, is the land here in the controversy; that the purchase price of this last quarter section was paid by money which \u201ccame from the income of the S.
