They were opened by defendant and examined by the officer. Shortly thereafter three officers came to defendant\u2019s house and stated that they had heard he was killing sheep in the basement, to which defendant replied that this was not so. The officers stated that they had been sent to make an investigation. Defendant took them down into Ms basement, and after inspection they informed defendant that they found no evidence of any killing of sheep or cattle. That no indications of sheep killing were seen was testified to by the officers upon the trial. After this inspection in the basement, one of the officers informed the defendant that he was under arrest and attempted to put upon his hands a wrist chain, and the other officers seized his hands so as to bind them with the wrist chain. Defendant resisted this for three or four minutes, and then submitted quietly and walked up stairs and was taken to the police station in a patrol wagon.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b95-8\" pgmap=\"95\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Ap2\" pgmap=\"95\">1.
