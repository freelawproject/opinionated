The freight was to be paid by the purchasers, and settlement to be made on arrival of the fountain at Springfield, terms $800 cash, balance of $1,000 payable in sixty days with interest, the title to remain in the defendant until notes and chattel mortgage were executed by the purchasers. Time was not made the essence of the contract. The purchasers made an advance payment of $400 when the order was signed. Among other provisions of the specifications was the following \u201cPump section. There are to be two 10 pump sections, each to have 10 porcelain syrup jars, 7 pumps, liquid style. * * C'outrakon testified that in a conversation with appellee\u2019s agent before the contract was signed it was agreed that the pumps should all be liquid carbonic pumps made by the Liquid Carbonic - Company. Appellants claim that they canceled the contract because the fountain was not shipped on or about May 1st, and that \"they are entitled to recover the advance payment. On April 21st, appellee wrote to appellants that on account of some unforeseen conditions that had arisen it would not be able to ship the fountain on May 1st. On April 28th appellee wrote to appellants that it expected to ship the outfit within the next ten days. On May 17th appellants wrote to appellee that they had rescinded the contract and demanded the return of the $400. Appellants employed Mr. McGrath, an attorney in Springfield, to act for them in the matter. On May 20th the appellee wrote to McGrath that it was ready to ship the fountain, and requested appellants to comply with the contract as to the further sum of $400, the balance of the cash payment. On May 20th appellee wrote to McGrath the fountain would be shipped the next day. McGrath communicated with appellants and by their direction on May 21st sent a telegram to appellee, \u201csend fountain under terms of original contract except the $1,000 to be paid July 26th, and $400 more when fountain is in store.\u201d The fountain was shipped May 21st, and on May 24th appellants wired appellee that the fountain was in Springfield, and that they would accept it, but wished to change the terms of the old contract as to payment. On May 22nd appellee sent the bill of lading with a note and chattel mortgage to a bank in Springfield. On May 24th appellee wrote to McGrath that they had sent the First National Bank the papers and note and mortgage for $1,000, due July 26th, and that they held a carpenter in readiness to set up the outfit. On May 26th appellee received another letter from McGrath stating that \" the fountain and fixtures would be accepted if as represented. Appellants refused to accept the fountain and fixtures, which remained at the freight depot in Springfield until September when the outfit was returned to appellee in Chicago.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-4\" pgmap=\"471\">Appellants contend that they cannot be required to accept the outfit and pay for it because (1) it was not shipped on or about May 1st; (2) that appellee failed to furnish a mechanic to set it up; (3) the connections were not properly matched; the workmanship was poor and the mahogany veneering loose; (4) the tanks were not as called for by the specifications and (5) the pumps were not the kind made by the Liquid Carbonic Company.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-5\" pgmap=\"471\">The delay in shipment was caused by the failure of the marble works that manufactured certain onyx columns on the fountain to have them cored; the evidence is uncertain as to whether that was the fault of the marble, works or the appellee.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-6\" pgmap=\"471\">The plaintiffs inspected the fountain on its arrival, and say that it was not as represented. The contract contains the clause, \u201call claim for-shortage or noncompliance with contract must be made within five days of delivery of goods.\u201d It did not appear that the appellants gave notice within five days of what they insist was a' noncompliance with the contract, other than the question of time.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-7\" pgmap=\"471\">The evidence as to the other defenses urged to the set-off, is conflicting, there being no manifest preponderance either way.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-8\" pgmap=\"471(18) 472(11)\">A motion for a new trial on the ground of newly-discovered evidence was denied, the evidence being cumulative as to the kind of pumps furnished in the fountain.</p><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b472-8\" pgmap=\"472\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A8o\" pgmap=\"472\">1.
