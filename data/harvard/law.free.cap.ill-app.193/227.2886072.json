An instruction in an action against a railroad company for the destruction of property by fire, caused by sparks from a locomotive, which places the burden of proof on the plaintiff to show not only that the fire was caused by the defendant, but also that either the engine was not in a reasonably safe condition or was not managed with reasonable care and skill, deprives the plaintiff of the benefit of the Act of 1869 (J. &amp; A. IT 8891) declaring that the fact that a fire was started by a locomotive shall be taken as full prima facie evidence to charge the defendant with negligence.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Apy\" pgmap=\"250(69) 251(22)\">2.

An instruction in an action against a railroad company for the destruction of property by a fire caused by sparks from a locomotive, that there was no proof that the engine in question was not provided with the most approved spark arrester, or that the engine and its appliances were not in good condition, or that it was not handled by a competent engineer, held not sustained by the evidence.</headnotes><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b250-4\" pgmap=\"250\">Defendant\u2019s evidence tended to show that, in doing its switching on the day of the fire, the engine in question did not go near the plaintiff\u2019s property; and also that a gale of wind was blowing from a direction which would in any event have prevented sparks from the engine being carried in that direction; that the engine was properly equipped, and that it was operated by a competent engineer. There was proof that this switch engine, drawing comparatively light loads, had thrown hot sparks a number of times within a few weeks before and shortly after the fire.</p><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b250-5\" pgmap=\"250\">W.
