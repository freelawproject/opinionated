Fought, the appellee, recovered a judgment for $1,000 against Joseph Schlitz Brewing C.ompany, the appellant, for the failure and refusal of appellant to deliver beer to appellee under a certain contract, from which the defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-10\" pgmap=\"594\">A contract in writing was entered into November 17, 1904, by the terms of which the appellee agreed to handle exclusively the beers of appellant in Shelby county for a period of five years, the defendant to loan appellee a beer wagon to be used by him in his beer business, and to allow him five dollars for cold storage of each carload of beer handled under the contract.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-11\" pgmap=\"594(31) 595(141)\">In May, 1905, the city council of the city of Shelby-ville refused to grant licenses for the sale of intoxicating or malt liquors for the municipal year ending May, 1907. At that time the appellee had on hand fifty-two half barrels of draught beer which he shipped back to appellant and was credited with its value on his account. In August, 1906, appellant rendered appellee a bill covering their previous transactions showing a balance due to appellant of seventy-two cents, which appellee paid. In May, 1907, the city council granted licenses for the sale of intoxicating and malt liquors for the municipal year ending May, 1908. Appellees then made a demand on appellant for beer under their contract, and appellant refused to let him have any, on the ground that the contract was terminated when the city council refused to grant licenses in May, 1906, and that the contract had been forfeited, terminated and abandoned. The appellee brought this suit after the contract had expired by lapse of time.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b595-8\" pgmap=\"595\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Afz5\" pgmap=\"595\">1.
