Appellee claimed she was to receive twenty-five dollars per week, while the appellant company contended that her employment was for fourteen weeks beginning February 10, 1913, provided that she \u201cmade good.\u201d That after appellee worked about three weeks she was told that as the business was not paying, she must discharge one of the clerks, which she refused to do as she had employed the clerk for the season ending in July, and rather than break her agreement with the girl, who was only receiving ten dollars a week, she agreed to pay her five dollars per week out of her own salary, to which the appellant agreed, and thereafter the appellee received twenty dollars a week until about July 12th, when she was told that expenses were too high and that during the dull season, which lasted from July 1st until about August 15th, her salary would have to be cut from twenty dollars to ten dollars a week; that she told appellant that she could not live on ten dollars a week, and the appellant said he would make it fifteen dollars a week until the busy season started about August 15th, and then he would make it twenty-five dollars a week until February 10, 1914; that appellee worked at fifteen dollars a week until about August 12th, when she was discharged under protest; she immediately tried to \"secure a similar position with several merchants -in Bloomington, which she was unable to do at that season of the year, and she then went to Chicago where she also failed to secure employment, and finally returned to Bloomington and accepted a position as a clerk in the millinery department of another store at a salary of fifteen dollars a week for ten weeks; that the one hundred and fifty dollars thus received for the ten weeks was all that she was able to earn from the time she was discharged to February 10, 1914; that in seeking this employment she was put to an expense of twenty-five dollars.</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b531-8\" pgmap=\"531\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AtH\" pgmap=\"531\">1.

During the trial appellant made a motion to exclude all the testimony introduced by appellee concerning the original contract made on January 15, 1913, on the ground that it was void under the Statute of Frauds, which motion the court sustained. By leave of court appellee filed an additional special count, which was based upon the agreement made by appellee and appellant on July 12th, by which appellee was to receive fifteen dollars per week from that time until August 15th, when she was to receive twenty-five dollars a week until February 10, 1914, when appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance on the ground of a surprise was overruled.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b531-5\" pgmap=\"531\">Light &amp; Light, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b531-6\" pgmap=\"531\">DeMange, Gillespie &amp; DeMange, for appellee.</attorneys> <footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"ADvo\" pgmap=\"531\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
