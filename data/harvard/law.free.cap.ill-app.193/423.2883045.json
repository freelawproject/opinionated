Keller, Jennie Zimmerman, Elenora K. Martin and Grace Bach against Charles W. Keller, John H. Keller, Mary A. Keller and William T. Yandeveer, Appellants, alleging a tenancy in common in certain real estate, the existence of certain mortgage indebtedness, and that the land, except two town lots, was in the possession of Charles W. Keller under farm agreement, dated March 1, 1913, which terminated March 1, 1914. The bill grayed for a partition according to the respective rights of the parties. The farm agreement was \u201cbetween Charles W. Keller, Jennie Zimmerman, J. H. Keller, Elenora Martin, Grace Bach and C. B. Keller, heirs of J. B. Keller, deceased, parties of the first part, and Charles W. Keller, individually, party of the second part,\u201d and was signed by all of them under seal. The contract stated that the parties being desirous of farming the lands for profit, agreed to pay the second party for the managing and conducting the same as follows: That the second party should reside on the land, farm, and manage the same to the'best of his ability, rotating crops as occasion required, and to make such repairs and improvements on the land as might be necessary; that the parties of the first part would \u201cfurnish one-half of the necessary personal property with which second party is to farm said lands; and second party agrees to furnish one-half of all the personal property necessary for conducting the farm, and that the personal property is to be owned by first parties and second party in common ; \u2019 \u2019 that the \u2018 \u2018 second party is to furnish and pay the expense of all labor necessary for successfully conducting said lands and feeding and raising live stock;\u201d and that neither of the parties were to keep any stock on the farm not owned by them in common; that the second party was to devote his entire time to carrying out the contract. The agreement was to be in force for one year, when it might be terminated and the property owned in common disposed of by either of the parties by giving thirty days\u2019 notice in writing, or if not terminated, that it might be renewed by the mutual agreement of the parties. In the event of termination of the contract and the inability of the parties hereto to agree as to the disposition of the personal property on hand, then it was to be sold at public sale within thirty days after such notice was served, and the proceeds of said sale, after deducting the expenses thereof, were to be divided between the parties according to their . i espective interests. It was further agreed that Edmund H. Bach should act as the representative of the parties of the first part, and also how the bank account should be kept and checked against, and the moneys arising from sales deposited, and the profits divided.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-5\" pgmap=\"446(77) 447(43)\">The defendants admitted the ownership of the land, but denied that the contract expired March 1, 1914, and asserted that the agreement had been renewed for another year, and that a written memorandum thereof was to be made; that the defendants had executed such written memorandum; that C. W. Keller, relying on said agreement had sown seventy acres of winter wheat, had purchased a large number of cattle for fattening, and had done other things towards carrying out the contract for another year; and he asked that if partition was decreed, it be subject to the right of occupancy in furtherance of the partnership contract for another year, and that the interests of the defendants be set off jointly.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b447-10\" pgmap=\"447\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AqgB\" pgmap=\"447\">1. Partnership, \u00a7 23<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when agreement to work farm constitutes partnership. A partnership is created where a person goes into possession of farm land owned by another, to work, manage and pay for working it, under an agreement whereby each is to furnish one-half of the necessary personal property, which is to be owned in common, and the proceeds are to be divided at the expiration of one year.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Ahr\" pgmap=\"447(45) 448(29)\">2. Partnership, \u00a7 57*\u2014when partnership to farm land extended by implication. A contract of partnership to farm land held not extended by implication for another year by the fact that the person who was to manage, work and pay for working it, sowed wheat in the fall preceding the expiration of the term, with the knowledge and consent of the husbands of the female owners of the land, and purchased cattle for feeding.</headnotes><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b447-5\" pgmap=\"447\">The evidence showed that any agreement for the extension of the term, if made, was with the husbands of the female complainants, acting for them, and that the memorandum of the extension was not signed by the complainants.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b447-6\" pgmap=\"447\">The court found the interests of the parties as set up in the bill, and that under the contract Charles W. Keller was entitled to the possession of that portion of the farm lands upon which he had sown wheat in the fall of 1913, until the crop was matured and harvested, and that his right of possession to the balance of the land expired March 1, 1914.
