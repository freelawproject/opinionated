The trial resulted in a judgment for the plaintiff and the defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-10\" pgmap=\"398(119) 399(34)\">The evidence showed that the defendant went into possession under a written lease which expired March 1, 1913, and that it was extended by written indorsement until March 1, 1914. The defendant claimed that during the latter part of the year 1913 there was a verbal agreement between him and his lessor that his term should be extended for another year from and after the expiration of his written lease on March 1, 1914. Before the expiration of the defendant\u2019s term under the written lease his lessor sold and conveyed the premises to George Dainty and Edward Pearson, and thereafter the former made and executed a written lease of the farm on behalf of himself and his cotenant to the plaintiff for the term of one year from and after March 1, 1914. On the refusal of the defendant to surrender possession on that date, the plaintiff brings this action.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b399-8\" pgmap=\"399\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Ayu\" pgmap=\"399\">1.
