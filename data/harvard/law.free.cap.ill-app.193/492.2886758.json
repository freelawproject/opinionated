The defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-11\" pgmap=\"514(76) 515(97)\">The plaintiff claimed that the appellant so negligently managed and controlled its car that it was not stopped at a certain crossing, so as to permit the appellee to alight upon the crossing, but that the car was negligently and carelessly stopped so that the steps thereof were about six feet north of the north line of the crossing, and that the agents and servants of the defendant negligently failed to exercise due and proper care in assisting plaintiff to alight from the car; that by reason of the darkness, she could not by the exercise of ordinary care for her own safety, observe and know that the steps of the car were not over and above, the crossing, and that while in the exercise of due care, and having good reason to believe and believing that said steps were above the crossing, she was, by reason of the great distances and the uneven and slanting condition of the ground, there caused to fall and sustain an injury.</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b515-9\" pgmap=\"515\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AMh\" pgmap=\"515\">1.

The evidence showed that appellee resided near the crossing in question, which was constructed of brick and was about three feet wide. The street where the appellee alighted was the ordinary unpaved street of a country town, and while it probably was somewhat lower than the crossing itself, no dangerous conditions were shown to exist therein. When the car came to a stop, appellee and a friend proceeded to get off, the latter leaving the car first in safety. Appellee followed, and as she stepped off the car she missed her step and her foot turned under her, and her ankle was dislocated and sprained.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b515-6\" pgmap=\"515\">Rinaker &amp; Rinaker, J.
