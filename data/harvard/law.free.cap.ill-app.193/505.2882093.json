E. Clark for malpractice in the treatment of her eye. The plaintiff appeals from the judgment rendered on the verdict finding the defendant not guilty.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-9\" pgmap=\"527(220) 528(58)\">When appellant was twenty-three years of age her left eye was removed from the socket. Pour years later a surgeon at Cincinnati unsuccessfully performed an operation including a grafting of skin in and about the eyelids for the purpose of permitting the use of an artificial eye. Twenty-four years later she went to appellee, who was a specialist in the diseases of the eye, ear, nose and throat, for the purpose of having one of her ears treated, when the condition of her eye and the possibility of the use by her of an artificial eye through another operation was frequently discussed, and resulted in appellee performing the operation on her eye over which this controversy arose. Appellant testified that appellee assured her he could perform the operation successfully, while appellee testified he told her that there was a fair chance of a successful operation, but he rather discouraged it on account of the appellant\u2019s age. Appellee grafted skin taken from the arm of appellant onto the eyelids. The operation, so far as the grafting was concerned, appeared to have been successful, but the eyelids shrank to such an extent that an artificial eye could not be used; and appellant claims that as a result of the operation the eyelashes on the upper lid were destroyed so as to disfigure her more than she was before the operation. Appellant then went to Chicago and had another operation performed by a specialist in that city, which\" was also unsuccessful. Afterwards she went to Joliet and had still another operation performed, which was likewise unsuccessful. She then brought this suit against the appellee.</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AAkm\" pgmap=\"528\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AVe\" pgmap=\"528\">1.

The plaintiff in an action against a surgeon for negligence in unsuccessfully grafting skin to an empty eye-socket for the purpose of permitting the use of an artificial eye, has the burden of proving that the operation was negligently and unskilfully performed.</headnotes><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b528-5\" pgmap=\"528\">Appellant introduced no evidence, except her own as to the skilfulness of the operation performed by appellee. While the evidence for appellee, shown by a number of experts, tended to prove that the operation was skilfully performed and in accordance with the modern scientific knowledge of such operations. It is a matter of great doubt from the evidence whether the disfigurements now complained of were caused by the operation performed by appellee or the subsequent operations performed by the other specialists.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b528-6\" pgmap=\"528\">The jury were instructed that \u2019 the appellee was bound only to exercise the ordinary skill and care such as physicians in good practice ordinarily use, and the appellant also requested and caused the court to give instructions announcing the same rule.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b528-7\" pgmap=\"528\">R.
