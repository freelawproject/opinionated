The defendant claimed a set-off for damages caused by the plaintiff\u2019s failure to deliver 1,807 tons of coal which the defendant ordered and required, and which it was compelled to obtain elsewhere at an increase over the contract price. At the trial a judgment was rendered for the plaintiff for the full amount of its claim, and the defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-9\" pgmap=\"396\">The evidence showed that during the period covered by the contract the plaintiff produced more than enough coal to supply the defendant\u2019s needs, and that it had no excuse for not doing so, and that the defendant used diligence in obtaining the necessary coal elsewhere. There was no evidence to show that the defendant ordered coal in excess of its daily needs in order to store it for use after the expiration, of the contract; although it appeared that on the plaintiff\u2019s failure to supply coal that the defendant took a sufficient quantity to answer its immediate need from a supply which it had obtained elsewhere and had in storage.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b396-10\" pgmap=\"396(8) 397(12)\">O\u2019Donnell, Donovan &amp; Bray and Knapp &amp; Campbell, for appellant; John E.
