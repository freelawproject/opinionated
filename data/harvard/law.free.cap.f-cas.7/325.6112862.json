The patent was for an improvement in cushions for billiard tables. The claim is as follows: \u201cThe catgut or other cord, E, partially or fully imbedded, or otherwise attached, at the angle, a, of the rubber cushion, C, so as to protect said cushion against the impact of the ball, substantially as herein shown and described, and for the purposes set forth.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-15\">[For a full description of the invention, together with drawings, see Decker v.

Tossibly, also, he may have devised a new mode of introducing the wire, by a perforation near the edge of the rubber. Neither of these concessions will justify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>defendant in using the substance of the plaintiff's invention for stiffening and regulating the elastic edge of the cushion, by a cord attached thereto, or inserted therein, or in employing an equivalent, either in respect of material used, or in respect of the manner of securing the cord, so that it may perform its office. The proof is without contradiction, that the infringing device operates in the same <em>way, </em>and by substantially the same means, to produce the same result. In regard to the validity of the reissue, I concur with Judge Blatchffeld, in the case of Decker v. Grote [Case No. 3,726].</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
