W\u00e9 think it necessary to notice only two points in this case. The first point was, that it does not appear that the parties dispensed with a tidal by jury. To authorize this court to reverse the judgment of the justice, we think, under the statute, it ought to appear that the plaintiff required a jury, and that it was refused. Secondly, the court are satisfied that the judgment entered by the justice is substantially good. The parties are identified, the sum is certain; and the only objection is, that the justice has said, \u201cI give judgment,\u201d instead of saying, \u201cIt is considered that the \u2022defendant have and recover of the plaintiff.\u201d In using the word \u201cjudgment,\u201d the justice \u25a0has included the more technical and formal words. His language is sufficiently certain, at least, as much so, as if a jury should say, \u201cWe find for the defendant.\u201d Judgment af'firmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
