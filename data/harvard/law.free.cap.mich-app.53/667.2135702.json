J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayq7\">This cause was remanded to our Court by order of the Supreme Court dated April 18, 1974, for reconsideration in light of <em>People v Turner, </em>390 Mich 7; 210 NW2d 336 (1973). The first decision by this Court is reported at 49 Mich App 497; 212 NW2d 263 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">In <em>Turner, </em>our Supreme Court rejected the subjective test for entrapment and accepted Justice Stewart\u2019s dissenting opinion in <em>United States v Russell, </em>411 US 423; 93 S Ct 1637; 36 L Ed 2d 366 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">This Court upon remand has reconsidered this cause in light of <em>Turner </em>and does hereby reaffirm its original opinion affirming defendants\u2019 convictions of conspiracy to commit abortion in violation of MCLA 750.14; MSA 28.204 and MCLA 750.157a; MSA 28.354(1). Defendants were convicted, by a jury of this offense on February 10, 1971. The <em>Turner </em>case was decided in September of 1973, approximately 2-1/2 years later. In <em>People v Gaines, </em>53 Mich App 443; 220 NW2d 76 (1974), a panel of this Court held that <em>Turner </em>was to be applied prospectively:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">\"We hold that until the Supreme Court clearly mandates that <em>Turner </em>is to be applied retroactively, we must approach this on the basis of the standards which were applicable prior to <em>Turner. </em>To do otherwise would have a highly detrimental effect on the administration of justice. This seriously disruptive effect predisposes a prospective application, in a fashion not dissimilar to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s refusal to apply <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Escobedo </em>retroactively.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>In this cause, under the standards applicable prior to <em>Turner, </em>we cannot say as a matter of law that defendants were entrapped.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b691-5\">McGregor, J., concurred.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b691-6\">Miles, J., did not participate.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
