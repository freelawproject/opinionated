Bouldin Rector, </em>City Atty., and <em>A. L. Love, </em>Asst. City Atty., both of Austin, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b424-12\"><em>Lloyd W.

Sutherland, on Statutory Construction, 2d Ed., p. 397, reads as follows: \u201cA classification based upon existing or past conditions or facts and which would exclude persons, places, things or objects thereafter coming into the same situation or condition is special and void. Thus a classification of states or counties based upon existing population or upon population shown by specified census reports is of this character.\u201d In the case of Smith v, State, 49 S. W. (2d) 739, this court held a statute which relates to persons or things as a class is a general law, while a statutes which relates to particular persons or things of a class is special and comes within the constitutional inhibition. In the case of Scoggin v. State, 38 S. W. (2d) 594, this court held article 803a of the Acts of the 2nd Called Session of the 41st Legislature unconstitutional. Said Act, as amended by the 5th Called Session of the 41st Legislature, is identical with the Act of the 2nd Called Session of the 41st Legislature, with two exceptions: One is that any peace officer who wilfully violates any provision of said Act shall, upon conviction, be fined in any sum not exceeding two hundred dollars. The Attorney-General or any county attorney may institute quo warranto proceedings to oust from office any official violating any provision of said Act or permit any deputy to do so. The other is that the provision in said Act pertaining to motor equipment and uniform shall not apply to an arrest made within the incorporated limits of a city or town having a population less than ten thousand inhabitants according to the Federal Census Report of 1920.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Hence it will be observed that article 803a, as amended, is not materially different from article 803a as originally enacted hy the 2nd Called Session of the 41st Legislature. Therefore, the same rule of construction as applied to the original article would apply to the amended article above referred to. We do not deem it necessary to enter upon an extended discussion of the act in question but content ourselves with referring to the case of Scoggin v. State, supra, where the question under consideration has been fully discussed in an original opinion rendered by Judge Lattimore and in an opinion rendered by Presiding Judge Morrow on a motion for rehearing. The rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>construction adopted by this court in the case of Smith v. State, supra, applies with equal force to the case under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\">Having reached the conclusion that the Act is unconstitutional, the order of the court declining to release relator is re- . versed, and relator is ordered discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">\n<em>Order reversed, and relator ordered discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
