An attorney for the accused has filed in this court an argument urging that the indictment is fatally defective under the opinion in the case of Offield v. State, 75 S. W. (2) 882 (127 Texas. Crim. Rep., 237). The Offield case is not authority for granting any relief to this appellant. In the indictment in the case before us it was charged that appellant sold spirituous liquor. The selling of spirituous liquor is an offense against the law anywhere in Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-17\">The indictment sufficiently charging the offense, and no error appearing, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-18\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b144-19\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b144-20\">HAWKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Adx\">Appellant fails to draw the distinction between the indictment in this case and in that found in Offield v. State, 75 S. W. (2d) 882 (127 Texas Crim. Rep., 237). An indictment in all respects like the one here was upheld in Carwile v. State, No. 16,878, opinion on rehearing of date December 12, 1934, not yet reported.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> While no statement of facts is in the record, the charge of the., court shows the liquor in question was whisky, a. spirituous liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-21\">Appellant makes the point that the indictment contained a recital that the grand jury which returned the indictment was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>organized at the September term ((193 \u2014 .\u201d Attached to appellant\u2019s motion is what purports to be a copy of an indictment which contains such recital.
