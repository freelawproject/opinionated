The indictment fully charges the offense. The charge of the court seems to correctly submit the law applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-17\">The testimony is apparently clear and plain and shows a sale of whisky by appellant to the party named in the indictment as the purchaser. Appellant testified and admitted that he was present when said party came to appellant\u2019s home looking for whisky. Appellant admitted that he procured the whisky and delivered it to said party. His only defense is that he was not the original seller but acted as a go-betwe\u00e9n.
