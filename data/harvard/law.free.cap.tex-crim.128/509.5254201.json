It was further averred that said check was in due course of business presented to said bank for payment, and that payment was refused for want of sufficient funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">C. A. Thornblom, to whom said check was given, detailed the circumstances under which he received said check from appellant, and testified that he deposited the check in the City National Bank in San Saba; that he did not present it to the Ozona National Bank for payment; that \u201cafter it had been gone for a short time it was returned unpaid.\u201d He notified appellant that it had not been paid and received no reply. The check was still unpaid at the time of the trial. No witnesses other than Thornblom testified to any fact. Appellant urges that the evidence does not support the conviction. The contention must be sustained. There is an entire failure of proof that the check was ever presented for payment to the bank upon which it was drawn. The case is so similar to that of Fortune v. State, 66 S. W. (2d) 304, that it is only necessary to refer to such case, and those cited in that opinion to make clear the reasons calling for reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">\n<em>Reversed and .remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">Morrow, P.
