In a supplemental response to Lopez\u2019s petition, the State concedes that in light of the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Daniels v. State, </em>121 So.3d 409 (Fla.2018), Lopez\u2019s petition should be granted. We agree, and for the same reasons articulated in <em>Horne v. State, </em>128 So.3d 953 (Fla. 2d DCA 2013), we grant the petition, reverse Lopez\u2019s second-degree murder conviction, vacate his sentence, and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">Jimy Pedroza died after Lopez stabbed him. Lopez was charged with second-degree murder and was tried by jury. The evidence at trial showed that Lopez admitted throwing the knife at Pedroza but claimed he acted in self-defense during a fight with Pedroza, who was intoxicated and outweighed him by seventy pounds. The State contended that Lopez stabbed Pedroza in anger because he believed Pe-droza was having an affair with his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">The jury was instructed on second-degree murder, manslaughter by intentional act, manslaughter by culpable negligence, justifiable homicide, and excusable homicide. The instruction for manslaughter by act corresponded with the then-standard jury instruction as amended in 2008. Lopez did not object to the instruction. The jury found Lopez guilty of second-degree murder, and he was sentenced to life in prison. This court affirmed Lopez\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>Lopez v. State, </em>88 So.3d 162 (Fla. 2d DCA 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-6\">Lopez\u2019s appellate attorney filed his initial brief on February 22, 2011, more than four months after the First District Court of Appeal issued its opinion in <em>Riesel v. State, </em>48 So.3d 885 (Fla. 1st DCA 2010), holding that the manslaughter by act instruction as amended in 2008 was fundamentally erroneous. Twenty-three days before this court affirmed Lopez\u2019s conviction and sentence, this court certified conflict with the First District\u2019s <em>Riesel </em>decision in <em>Daniels v. State, </em>72 So.3d 227, 230 (Fla. 2d DCA 2011). The Florida Supreme Court ultimately overruled our decision, holding that the amended instruction still erroneously required proof of an intent to kill. <em>Daniels, </em>121 So.3d at 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-8\">Lopez is entitled to relief because his intent was pertinent and material to what the jury had to consider in order to reach its verdict. <em>See Horne, </em>128 So.3d at 957. Lopez admitted that he threw the knife at Pedroza but argued that he did not intend to kill Pedroza. If the jury found that the State did not prove Lopez acted with evil intent but that his acts were not justifiable or excusable under the law, manslaughter would have been the appropriate verdict. But the faulty instruction on manslaughter by act deprived the jury of the ability to decide whether Lopez\u2019s lack of intent to kill, when considered with all the other evidence, fit within the elements of the offense of manslaughter. <em>See Haygood v. State, </em>109 So.3d 735, 742-13 (Fla.2013) (holding that the jury instruction on manslaughter by culpable negligence does not cure the fundamental error in giving an erroneous manslaughter by act instruction where the defendant is convicted of second-degree murder and the evidence supports a finding of manslaughter by act, but it does not reasonably support a finding that the death occurred due to the culpable negligence of the defendant). The only non-intentional homicide offense remaining for the jury\u2019s consideration was second-degree murder; therefore the jury was deprived of all the tools it needed to reach a proper verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-9\">Accordingly, we grant the petition. Because Lopez is entitled to have his conviction set aside, a new appeal would be redundant in this instance. Therefore we reverse Lopez\u2019s second-degree murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>conviction, vacate the sentence, and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-4\">Petition granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1305-5\">SILBERMAN, BLACK, and SLEET, JJ., Concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
