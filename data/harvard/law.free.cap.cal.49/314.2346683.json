In 1859, Bitter and Le Boy obtained a judgment in the District Court, foreclosing the mortgage, and directing the mortgaged property to be sold to satisfy the sum of $39,284 39, then due on the mortgage.

On the 3d day of April, 1869, Philips conveyed to the plaintiff, Frink, a portion of the mortgaged premises fronting twenty-three feet and eight inches on Battery street, and sixty-three feet and four inches on Sacramento street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-6\">Before the conveyance to Frink, Le Boy became the owner by assignment of the mortgage and judgment debt. Frink, on the 27th of January, 1870, commenced this action to recover possession of the premises thus conveyed to him. At the time the judgment in this action was rendered, there was due to Le Boy on the judgment debt, the sum of $23,-000. The defendants, other than Le Boy were his tenants. In their answer, the defendants plead the Statute of Limitations, and, by way of cross complaint, set up the mortgage, the judgment foreclosing the same, and the said agreement with Philips, and asked that the mortgaged premises be sold under the decree, and that the sum due Le Boy be paid out of the proceeds of the sale. They also asked, if this relief was denied them, that Le Boy be quieted in his title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-7\">The plaintiff answered the cross-complaint, pleading the Statute of Limitations as to the right of Le Boy to have affirmative relief. The Court refused to grant the relief asked by the defendants, and rendered judgment for the plaintiff. The defendants appealed from the judgment and from an order denying a new trial.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b339-8\"><em>W.

(Ja<em>ckson </em>v. <em>Lodge, </em>36 Cal. 47; <em>Espinosa </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>40 Cal. 58; <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>24 Cal. 403.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>The contract by which Le Roy was to postpone the enforcement of his judgment of foreclosure, and in consideration thereof to have possession of the property, collect the rents and apply the same in liquidation of the debt, was an express continuing trust, not affected by the Statute of Limitations, and could not be terminated without payment of the debt, and judgment should have been rendered that the premises be sold, and the proceeds applied to the payment of the judgment. <em>(Seymour </em>v. <em>Freer, </em>8 Wallace, S.

(2 Hittell Dig. Ar. 4,359, Sec. 17; <em>Mann </em>v. <em>McAtee, </em>37 Cal. 11; <em>Stout </em>v. <em>Macy, </em>22 Id. 647; <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Crary, </em>30 Cal. 621.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-8\">The case bears no analogy to that of a mortgagee in possession. The mortgage was extinguished by the decree. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Beebe, </em>1 Barb. 379; <em>Mallory </em>v. <em>Leach, </em>14 Abb. Pr. R. 449.

Patterson </em>and <em>John B. Felton, </em>in reply.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-6\">The stipulations between Philips and Le Boy gave Le Boy a continuing right of possession of the premises in dispute\u2014by virtue of these stipulations Le Boy became a trustee for all parties, and his right to continue in possession continued until the decree and mortgage were fully paid and satisfied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-7\">Le Boy remained in possession for years, collecting rents and paying commission^, and rendering an account from time to time. Here is a construction put upon the contract by the parties, a construction acted on for ten years. But we contend that the clear language of these stipulations admits of no other construction than that acquiesced in for ten years by all the interested parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-8\">In the first place, the very object of these two stipulations was to make the property pay the decree and mortgage, and to return the property to the debtors. This object could only be carried out by leaving the property in the hands of the trustee until that object was accomplished. It would have been a great hardship to the debtors to have put any other construction upon the stipulations. They would have been obliged to lose their property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-9\">There is no time fixed in the stipulation when Le Boy\u2019s right of possession should cease. The accomplishing the object for which that possession was given would, therefore, be the natural limit to his right of possession.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b341-10\">By the Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">The action is ejectment, and the title of the plaintiff is derived from one Philips, who, while the owner of the premises, executed and delivered to the defendant a mortgage thereof to secure a debt owing by him to the defendant. The mortgage was subsequently foreclosed by decree, but no sale of the mortgaged premises was had. Philips was indulged with further time to pay the mortgage debt, and the parties accordingly entered into a written agreement to the effect that the order of sale should not issue for the period of eighteen months, and, by a subsequent agreement in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>writing, a further delay of twelve months was allowed. It was further agreed in writing between the parties that the defendant Le Roy should enter into the possession and control of the premises, collect the rents and apply them to the satisfaction of the decree. Le Roy accordingly entered, and has since remained in possession, pursuant to the agreement, and, after applying the rents, a large balance of the amount named in the decree remained unsatisfied at the time the present action was brought by the plaintiff, who had, in the meantime, received from Phillips a conveyance of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">1. There is no doubt that during the periods of time limited in the agreements between the parties, those agreements operated an assignment to the defendant of the rents to be collected during the designated periods, so far as they might be necessary to satisfy the decree, and that during those periods unless the mortgage debt had in the meantime been paid, a Court of equity would not have permitted Philips to have broken his agreement with Le Roy, by the assertion of his legal title, or the disturbance of the latter in his possession taken under the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\"><em>2. </em>Nor do we see that the circumstance that the periods of time stipulated in the agreements themselves have long since expired can operate to change the relations of the parties, or render it more consonant to the principles of equity that Le Roy should now be turned out of possession, the debt being still unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Though no formal renewal of the agreement was made, the parties had acquiesced in its subsequent continuance to the time that the present action was brought. The statute of limitations can have no application to the rights of the parties in such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">It would hardly be claimed, for instance, that Philips, or the plaintiff as his grantee, would be barred of the right to resume the possession upon payment or tender of the balance of the mortgage debt, and it is not perceived that the equity of Le Roy, upon the other hand, to be maintained in possession until satisfaction of his debt, is less cogent, or has been lost, from the fact that for upwards of ten years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>he has been in the actual possession of which he is now sought to be deprived.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Judgment and order denying a new trial reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial. Remittitur forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
