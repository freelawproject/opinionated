On the 13th of August, 1872, this action was commenced to enforce the mortgage. It appeared by the complaint, that McHenry was, on the 20th day of March, 1872, declared a bankrupt in the District Court of the United States, and that Montgomery Godley was, on the 12th day of April, 1872, appointed his assignee. Godley was made a party defendant. The mortgaged\" property was not within the limits of the Nineteenth Judicial District. The defendant, McHenry, demurred because the property was outside of the District, and because there was another action pending in the District Court of the United States, between the parties for the same matter contained in the complaint. The Court overruled the demurrer on the 11th day of September, 1872. On the 4th day of October, 1872, the District Court of the United States, on motion of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, the assignee consenting, made an order allowing the plaintiff to proceed wtih its foreclosure suit in the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Court, provided no judgment for a deficiency was taken against the bankrupt or his assignee. On the 27th of January, 1873, McHenry answered, setting up the proceedings in bankruptcy as a bar. On the 14th of March, 1873, the Court, on motion of the plaintiff, struck out the answer as sham and irrelevant. On this motion, the order of the United States District Court was used as evidence. Judgment was then entered for the plaintiff. The judgment was in form a personal judgment against McHenry, followed by the usual decree of foreclosure. The Court, on application of the defendant, fixed the amount of the undertaking required to secure the plaintiff against the commission of waste, and for the value of the use and occupation, under the nine <em>hundred </em>and forty-fifth section of the Code of Civil Procedure, at $600. The plaintiff procured an order of sale, and the Sheriff advertised. The defendant, McHenry, who appealed, gave an undertaking in the sum of $600, and also one in the sum of $300. The Sheriff then refused to sell, claiming that the undertakings were sufficient to stay proceedings. On the <em>ex parte </em>application of the plaintiff, the Court made an order requiring the Sheriff to proceed and sell. The defendant also appealed from this last order.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-5\"><em>James B.
