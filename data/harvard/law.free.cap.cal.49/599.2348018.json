The executors petitioned to have the will admitted to probate. The usual order was made for notice to be given of the time and place of hearing. The petition set forth that the deceased had brothers, a sister, and mother living, two of whom resided out of this State. The surviving husband filed objections to probating the \u00a1will, which were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-8\">\u201cSamuel Cobb, the husband of said deceased, comes now and files these his grounds of objection to the probate of the instrument filed in this Court, and of which probate is asked, as the last will and testament of Mary Cobb, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-9\">\u201c1st. He objects to the probate of said instrument as a will on the ground that said instrument is not a will or testament. That there is no person or corporation named therein as legatees competent to take.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-10\">\u201c2d. That no testamentary disposition is therein made of any property or estate, and the same cannot, therefore, be admitted to probate as a will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-11\">\u201c3. The said deceased was not competent to make a will at the time of the alleged execution of said instrument.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-12\">\u201c4th. The said Mary Cobb, at the date of the alleged execution, was not of sound and disposing mind.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-13\">\u201c5th. Said Mary Cobb, at the time of the execution of said instrument, was acting under duress, menace, and undue influence, and signed the same under such undue influence, duress, and menace.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-14\">\u201cDated October 20, 1873.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-15\">The petitioners demurred to the first and second grounds of objection, and the Probate Court sustained the demurrer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Issues of fact were settled and tried on the other objections, and they were decided in favor of the petitioners. The only proof of service of notice of the time and place of hearing the application for probating the will was the certificate of the Clerk that he had posted notices in three of the most public places in the county of Santa Clara. The Court admitted the will to probate; and, in the order admitting it to probate, recited, \u201cand it appearing to the Court on due proof made that notice of the hearing of said application was duly given according to the statute in such cases made and provided.\u201d Samuel Cobb, the contestant, appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b623-6\"><em>Houghton &amp; Reynolds, </em>for the Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-7\">The document presented for probate is not a will entitled to probate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-8\">1. It does not express the will of the testator as to the disposition of any property. (Civil Code, sec. 1275; Bouvier\u2019s Law Die., title Will, sub. 7.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-9\">2. A last will and testament is the disposition of one\u2019s property, to take effect after death. (1 Redfield on Wills, sec. 2; Jacob\u2019s Law Dic., title Will; Bouvier\u2019s Law Dic., title Will.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-10\">3. The appointment of executors is an incident to and not an expression of the will of the testator. It is the naming of persons to execute the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-12\">The language of this instrument is: \u201cI hereby nominate and appoint Edward McLaughlin and Charles E. White the executors of this my last will and testament.\u201d But there being no will, there is none to execute. (Bouvier\u2019s Law Dic., title Executor.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-13\">The Court, therefore, erred in sustaining the demurrer to objections of appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b623-14\"><em>Spencer &amp; Rankin, </em>for the Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-15\">The document presented for probate is \u201cThe legal declaration of Mrs. Cobb\u2019s (the testatrix) intentions of what she wills to be performed after her death.\u201d (Bac. Abr. Wills; and Bouv. Dic., Wills.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-16\">Appellant assumes, without evidence, that all the legatees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>named in the will are incapable of taking; but if that be so, it is a question that cannot arise in an application to prove the instrument. All that the Court has to inquire into in this proceeding is as to the testamentary character of the instrument itself. (Jarman on Wills, 25.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-6\">But if inoperative for any other purpose \u201cit operates as an appointment of an executor who distributes the property as under an intestacy.\u201d (Id. 25.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b624-7\">By the Court, Wallace, C. J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">1. The Court proceeded to hear the petition for the probate of the will, without proof of service of notice upon the heirs of the testatrix, in accordance with the requirements of section 1306 of the Code of Civil Procedure\u2014several of the heirs not appearing to the proceeding. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">2. The instrument offered being evidently of a testamentary character, upon application to admit it to probate, the inquiry is only as to the mental condition of the testatrix; whether she was acting under duress, menace, fraud, or undue influence; whether the will was duly executed, and the like. The other questions attempted to be raised by the objections filed in the case concern the construction to be placed upon the will, and cannot be considered until it shall have been admitted to probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">Order reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings. Remittitur forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">Mr. Justice Crockett did not express an opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
