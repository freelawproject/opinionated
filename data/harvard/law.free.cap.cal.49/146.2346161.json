There was a jury trial and the plaintiff had a verdict for $800. The defendant moved for a new trial, and in support of his motion filed a statement. The following were the reasons specified in the statement why a new trial should be granted:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-6\">First\u2014The said judgment is against law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-7\">Second\u2014Said judgment is contrary to the evidence, and there is neither law nor evidence to sustain said verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-8\">1st. Because the ditch described in the complaint did not belong to plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-9\">2d. The allegations and proofs do not correspond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-10\">3d. Defendant\u2019s claims were older in date, and had priority over the ditch in the complaint described.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-11\">4th. The defendant was not liable to an action for any of the acts charged in the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-12\">5th. Errors in law occurring at the trial of said cause and duly excepted to by defendant, as shown by the various exceptions taken by defendant, and in' giving the instructions given, and in the refusal of those asked by defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-13\">One of the defenses relied on by the defendant was, that the ditch which was washed away did not belong to the plaintiff, but had been dug years before by miners for their own use, and left by them before the plaintiff entered into possession of it. The complaint averred that the ditch, which had been washed away, passed by a certain shaft on a side hill. The defense claimed that it passed some hundred and fifty or more feet below the shaft, and that there was, therefore, a variance between the proofs and the allegation of the complaint. The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-14\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b167-15\">Jo. <em>Hamilton, </em>for the Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b167-16\"><em>C. A. Tuttle, </em>for the Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-17\">The alleged reasons why a new trial should be granted are:</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-18\">1st. That the judgment is against law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>I see nothing to support this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-6\">2d. The judgment is contrary to the evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-7\">There are no specifications under this head showing in what the evidence does not sustain the verdict. The allegations, 1st, 2d, 3d and 4th, are mere statements of counsel\u2019s own opinions on the subject, and not statements showing wherein the evidence is insufficient. In other words, the statement does not \u201c specify the particulars in which the evidence is alleged to be insufficient.\u201d (Pr. Act, Sec. 195; <em>Butterfield </em>v. <em>C. P. R. R. Co., </em>37 Cal. 384.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-8\">The reasons assigned why a new trial should be granted, are, in form, a mere Common Law assignment of errors, which is unknown to our practice. There is no specification of \u201cparticular errors upon which the party will rely \u201d as required in Sec. 195 of Pr. Act. I contend, therefore, that the whole statement should be disregarded. <em>(Hutton </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>25 Cal. 478.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b168-9\">By the Court, Wallace, C. J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">1. It is impossible to determine, from the record before us, whether an appeal was taken from the order denying a new trial or from the judgment, or both. The transcript contains the judgment and the order denying a new trial. Ho notice of appeal and no evidence of service of such notice is shown; the only stipulation upon this point is \u201cthat notices of new trial and appeal, and appeal bond were duly served and filed and made in time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">2. If the appeal is to be regarded as taken from the judgment alone, it is sufficient to say that we discover no error upon the judgment-roll, as found in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">3. If the appeal was taken from the order denying a new trial, it is apparent that that order is not before us for examination. If errors of either law or fact occurred which would have entitled the defendant to a new trial, they are not sufficiently specified within any recognized rule of practice\u2014even the most liberal in its character.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-13\">Judgment and order affirmed. Remittitur forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-14\">Neither Mr. Justice Rhodes nor Mr. Justice Niles expressed an opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
