On this point the Court charged the jury: \u201cYou cannot acquit him on the ground of insanity, because a doubt may arise in your minds on the question. His insanity must be made to appear to you beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Some of the authorities hold this to be the correct rule'; but in this State the contrary rule- has been settled by several decisions of this Court, the latest of which was in the case of the <em>People </em>v. <em>McDonell </em>(47 Cal. 134.) In that case we held that while the burden of proof is on the defendant to establish the insanity, it is sufficient to prove it by a preponderance of evidence; in other words, that \u201cinsanity must be clearly established by satisfactory evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b34-11\">Wallace, C. J., concurring:</author>\n<p id=\"b34-12\">As to whether a prisoner, relying upon the defense of insanity at the time of the commission of the act charged against him as a crime, may rest upon mere preponderating evidence of the fact of insanity, or must go further and establish his alleged insanity beyond a reasonable doubt, is a question upon which the authorities are in conflict. In view of the notorious facility with which this defense is often availed of to shield the guilty from just punishment, I should, if the matter were <em>res integra </em>in this Court, be inclined to adopt the latter rule. But in the case of the <em>People </em>v. <em>Coffman </em>(24 Cal. 230), the question was thoroughly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>considered here, and it was held that insanity might be established in a criminal case by the same amount of evidence by which it might be established in a civil action involving the question \u2014 that is, by mere preponderating evidence; and, upon the authority of that case, I concur in the judgment in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
