On the trial, it appeared in evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>that an attachment had been issued against the plaintiff\u2019s property, and that the defendant Fett had signed the attachment bond, but had no connection with the seizure of the plaintiff\u2019s property by the officer, except as surety on the bond. It also appeared that the undertaking was void. The other defendant had not been served with process, and did not appear. The Court rendered judgment for the defendant, and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b375-6\"><em>Hamilton, Horton &amp; Bullock </em>and <em>Myres &amp; Fellows, </em>for the Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-7\">We claim that Fett, having performed an act indispensable to the issuance of the writ, and the perpetration of the wrong, is as clearly connected with it, as the party making the affidavit, or suing out the summons.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-8\">The statute itself connects the surety with the wrong, in holding him responsible for damages. Had the undertaking been good, his connection and liability were fixed by statute; and its being void, he is no less connected with its. consequences. Upon the contrary, he does the very thing that causes them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-9\">The surety was bound to know that his undertaking was void\u2014that it afforded the plaintiff no protection, and that he was aiding, assisting and countenancing a trespass.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-10\">The writ having issued without the undertaking required by law, was issued without authority, and all concerned were trespassers.
