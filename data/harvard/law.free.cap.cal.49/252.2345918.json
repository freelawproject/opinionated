The notes were payable to L. P. Felton or order, and were indorsed to the plaintiff. The complaint averred that the defendant, on the 1st day of July, 1863, departed from the State of California, and did not return until November, 1868. The action was commenced March 28, 1870. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for the amount due on the second note, and judgment was' entered accordingly. The plaintiff moved for a new trial, which was granted. The defendant appealed from the order granting a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-12\">[The report of this case on a former appeal, will be found in the 45 Cal. 544.]</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b272-13\"><em>D.

The defense pleaded to this note was two-fold\u2014payment and want of consideration. As to the first defense\u2014payment\u2014it is not even claimed in argument by counsel for appellant that the evidence was not conflicting. As to the second defense\u2014want of consideration\u2014the evidence is plainly conflicting. The virtual admissions made by the defendant to Lardner are to the effect that the $2,200 note was not without consideration; the only defenses that he then claimed to have to the note were payment and the Statute of Limitations. The admissions, express in some instances and implied in others, made by the defendant in his written correspondence had with Felton, years after the giving of the $2,200 note, of themselves go far to contradict his evidence given at the trial as to the want of consideration. It is the settled rule that an order granting a new trial for insufficiency of evidence to support the verdict will not be disturbed here when the evidence is shown to be conflicting in its character.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Order affirmed.
