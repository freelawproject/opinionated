On the 24th of February, 1871, he executed a deed of the real estate to the defendants, in trust, for the establishment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>maintenance of. an institution for the diffusion of knowledge, to be called the \u201cMont Eagle University.\u201d Hawes died on the 12th day of March, 1871.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-6\">On the 31st day of December, 1871, the plaintiff, who was the widow of Hawes, received letters of administration on his estate. Soon after, she commenced this action. She averred in her complaint that the deed was not recorded during the life of Hawes, and was not intended to take effect during his life, and attached to her complaint a copy of the deed. The defendants, in their answer, admitted that they claimed the property by virtue of the deed, but denied that it was invalid. The plaintiff demurred to the answer and the demurrer was sustained. . Final judgment was then rendered for the plaintiff. The defendants appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-7\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b390-8\"><em>Lloyd Baldwin </em>and <em>S.

The reservation of \u201can estate coupled with the possesion,\u201d etc., to continue during the life of the grantor does not prevent the remainder in fee from vesting immediately. <em>(Richardson </em>v. <em>York, 2 </em>Shepley, 216.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-10\">2. The common law rule against freeholds to commence <em>in futuro, </em>is not applicable to trust estates.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-11\">3. The reason of this common law rule is of purely feudal origin, and is founded upon the requisite of livery of seizin, without which a freehold estate could not be conveyed. (2 Black * 104.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-12\">Without livery of seizin the feoffee had a mere estate at will. The delivery of corporeal possession was held absolutely necessary. <em>Nam feudum sine investitura nullo modo constitu\u00ed potuit.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-13\">A freehold\u2014\u201cthe possession of the soil by a freeman,\u201d\u2014 could only be conveyed by livery of seizin; and, conversely, when such livery was made, no life estate\u2014that is, freehold \u2014could by any possibility remain in the feoffor. Such was the logic of the common law upon which rested the \u201c stubborn dogma \u201d that an estate of freehold could not be created to commence <em>in futuro.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>4. But this formality is long since dispensed with. A deed takes effect from its delivery. Title vests upon delivery of the deed, not upon livery of seizin. The grantee has a right of entry the moment his deed is delivered. ( <em>Wattson </em>v. <em>Dowling, </em>26 Cal. 125; 4 Greenl. Cruise\u2019s Dig. p. 47, note 2; 2 Washburn, 154.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-7\">5. The common law requiring livery to complete a conveyance is <em>\" </em>repugnant to and inconsistent with \u201d the first section of the Act concerning conveyances, which says that \u201c conveyances of lands or of any estate or interest therein may be made by deed,\u201d etc. (1 Hitt. 643.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-8\">Livery is no part of a deed, therefore the Statute of 1850, 1 Hitt. 599, adopting the common law of England as \u201c the rule of decision,\u201d (whatever that may mean), did not bring \u201c livery of seizin,\u201d or \u201cinvestiture,\u201d or any of their consequences into our method of conveyancing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b391-9\"><em>J.

The defendants by their answer, claim to be the owners in fee of the said real estate; and they found their claim of title upon a certain instrument, called \u201c the deed of foundation of Mont Eagle University,\u201d which they allege was executed by Horace Hawes in his lifetime, to-wit: on the 24th day of February, 1871. The plaintiff demurred to the answer, on the ground that it did not state sufficient facts to constitute a defense\u2014that is to say, that the deed is void. The demurrer was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">The deed purports to \u201cgive, grant, alien and convey \u201d unto the defendants, their associates and successors, the real estate in controversy, in trust for the establishment and maintenance of Mont Eagle University, \u201cto have and to hold the above granted lands and property, subject to the reservations aforesaid, unto the said parties of the second part, their associates and successors, to be appointed as hereinafter provided forever.\u201d One of the reservations which precede the habendum clause, is as follows: \u201c Be-serving also unto the said grantor and party of the first part, in all the property herein granted and conveyed, an estate coupled with the possession and the rents, issues and profits thereof, to continue for and during his natural life.\u201d The other reservations need not be noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">The instrument under consideration was evidently intended as a deed, and not as a covenant to stand seized to uses, or as a will.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s position is that the instrument is to be construed as creating a freehold, to commence <em>in futuro, </em>and therefore void. The common law of England was adopted by the statute of this State as the rule of decision. One of the rules of the common law is that an estate of freehold cannot be granted to commence <em>in futuro, </em>without the creation, at the same time, of a particular estate, which vests in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>immediate possession in some other person (2 Blackst. Com. 165; 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 233). The rule was undoubtedly of feudal origin, as suggested by the defendants; and after livery of seizin was no longer necessary to effectuate a conveyance of the estate the rule became a technical one; but it remained, and still remains, a rule of property, where not abrogated by statute. It has often been recognized and enforced in the Courts of the several States. (See <em>Wallis </em>v. <em>Wallis, </em>4 Mass. 136; <em>Pray </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>7 Mass. 384; <em>Gale </em>v. <em>Co-burn, </em>18 Pick. 400; Brewery, <em>Hardy, </em>22 Pick. 380; <em>Marden v. Chase, </em>32 Me. 33; <em>Singleton </em>v. <em>Bremer, </em>4 McCord, 151.) In <em>Gale </em>v. <em>Coburn, supra, </em>the grantor reserved to himself an estate for life, in words quite similar to those in this case, and on the question before us the Court said: \u201cIn the first place, we think that by any reasonable construction of this deed it must be construed to create a freehold commencing <em>infuturo, </em>and that it would be a forced construction to consider it as passing a freehold to the grantee, presently, and creating a new estate for life to the grantor, by way of reservation. The whole and entire estate is reserved to the grantor for his life. The words \u2018the right to use, occupy, and enjoy\u2019 an estate, in a grant, operate to transfer the estate, and create a freehold when such right is for life, and I see no reason why they should not have the same effect in a reservation or exception. And the words added in this deed, \u2018free of all rent or charge whatever, and all molestation in the same/ thereby vesting the entire possession and occupation, as well as the use and enjoyment, strengthen the conclusions derived from the use of those words, and constitute an absolute estate for life in the grantor. Whether a particular provision in a deed constitutes an exception or reservation, technically, does not depend on the use of the word \u201cexcept,\u201d or the word \u201creserve,\u201d but upon the nature and legal effect of the provision itself. The effect of this deed, I think, is to grant the land in fee to the grantee, but with this qualification, that the grantor is first to have a freehold estate in it for his own life. Such a conveyance, if regarded as a feoffment or bargain and sale, is contrary to the rules of law, and cannot be maintained.\u201d Many other cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>might be cited to the same effect, but in view of the uniformity of the decisions on the question, it is unnecessary to do so. The rul\u00e9, though it had its origin when titles were usually conveyed by livery of seizin, has so constantly been upheld as a rule of property, since deeds were substituted as the mode of conveying titles to real estate, that it ought not to be disturbed by any action of the Court. The remedy, if one be needed, should be provided by statute, for it would then\u2018be prospective only in its operation; and it has, in fact, been furnished by section 767 of the Civil Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Judgment affirmed.
