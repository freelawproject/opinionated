Both parties claimed title under Lyman King. The plaintiff proved by King that he owned the demanded premises, and went into possession of the same prior to 1860. He then introduced a deed to him from King, dated January 4, 1866. The defendants called as a witness one of their number, L. B. Clark, who testified that King sold him the demanded premises and gave him a written conveyance, in April, 1862, and that the conveyance was lost; that he did not know the conveyance was lost till December, 1865, when he looked through all his papers, safe, pigeon-holes, and house for it, and could not find it, and that he sold to the Pittsburgh Company, in December, 1865, and delivered to the Company all his papers. The defendants constituted the Pittsburgh and Tuba Eiver Mining Company. The defendants then offered to prove the contents -of the conveyance, but the plaintiff objected because its loss had not been shown, and that no foundation had been laid for the same. The Court overruled the objection, and permitted evidence of its contents to be introduced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b691-10\">The defendants recovered judgment, and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b691-11\"><em>G.

The defendants had not shown that such a paper ever really existed, in that they had not shown the deed or any execution of an original, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>copy of the same. They had not shown the loss of such instrument (if any existed), or properly accounted for the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b692-6\"><em>W. C. Belcher </em>and <em>J.

The search for this paper made by Clark was first made by him in December, 1865; the particular day of that month upon which the search was made is not stated. Clark sold to the Pittsburgh Company in that month, and testified that he then delivered all his papers to that company.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">The defendants should have shown an unsuccessful search among the papers of that company before resorting to parol proof of the contents of the lost paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
