The jury returned into Court with the following verdict: \u201cWe, the jury, agree that the defendant is guilty of murder in the second degree.\u201d The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-19\">The other fact is stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-20\"><em>Lewis </em>O. <em>Garter, </em>for the Appellant, argued that as the title of the cause was surplusage, <em>(People v. Ah Kim, </em>34 Cal. 189,) that the verdict did not designate what defendant it refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>red to, and that it was necessary for the jury to find, as they might agree and yet not render a verdict, and cited Penal Code, Sec. 1,162.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-5\"><em>John L. Love, </em>Attorney-General, for the People, argued that the entire record showed who the defendant was, and that the words \u201cagree\u201d and \u201cfind\u201d were synonymous terms, and that, under Sec. 1,151 of the Penal Code, the word \u201c guilty\u201d alone was a good verdict.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b262-6\">By the Court, McKinstry, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The verdict is good. When the jury ' \u2018 agree \u201d they <em>\u2018' </em>find \u201d if they return their agreement into Court. The verdict would have been sufficient if it had been simply \u201cGuilty of murder in the second degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">The defendant challenged a juror thus: \u201cI challenge the juror for implied bias.\u201d This was not a proper specification of the grounds of challenge. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>16 Cal. 130; <em>People </em>v. <em>Renfrow </em>41 Cal. 37.)</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">Neither Mr. Justice Crockett nor Mr. Justice Rhodes expressed an opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
