From that time forward the said persons acted as a corporation under the name of \u201cThe Eoman Catholic Orphan Asylum,\u201d and, on the 28th day of May, 1862, one Beideman executed and delivered to the said \u201cEoman Catholic Orphan Asylum,\u201d a deed for fifty vara lot three (3), in block eighty-four of the western addition, at the north-east corner of Post and Franklin streets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-10\">On the 9th day of April, 1873, the plaintiff petitioned said Court for leave to sell said lot, and such proceedings were had that, on the 25th of April, 1873, leave was granted. Afterwards the plaintiff and defendant entered into a contract in writing, by which the plaintiff agreed to sell the defendant the lot for $12,000, and the defendant agreed to pay the sum, and paid down $500, as a part of the price. The plaintiff, at the proper time, tendered a deed and demanded payment, but the defendant refused to pay the money or receive the deed on the ground that the plaintiff was not duly incorporated, and was incapable of acquiring or transferring the title to land. The plaintiff commenced this action to compel the defendant to receive the deed, and to obtain judgment for the purchase price. The complaint averred the above facts, and had a copy of the certificate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>attached to it. The defendant demurred because, first, the plaintiff had not legal capacity to sue; and, second, that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-6\">The Court overruled the demurrer, and the defendant having declined to answer, rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b478-7\"><em>Jarboe &amp; Harrison, </em>for the appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-8\">I. The certificate of incorporation is insufficient to create a corporate body. The statute under which the plaintiff claims to have been formed (Stat. 1858, p. 264), prescribes that the provisions of chapter eight of the Act concerning corporations (Stat. 1850, p. 373), shall be complied with in .forming such corporations, and when \u201cincorporated under the provisions of said act,\u201d the society \u201cshall possess the same powers, be subject to like liabilities, and enjoy the like privileges as therein provided.\u201d (Sec. 1.) The statute of 1850 referred to, prescribes as essential to becoming a corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-9\">1. That trustees shall be \u201cappointed\u201d or \u201celected\u201d by the society \u201cby such method as their rules, regulations or discipline may direct.\u201d (Sec. 176.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-10\">2. That a certificate of such appointment be executed by the person or persons \u201cmaking the appointment,\u201d or the judges \u201cholding the election.\u201d (Sec. 176.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-11\">This certificate must <em>specify\u2014(a) </em>The names by which the trustees shall thereafter forever be called and known. (6) The number of trustees to be appointed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-12\">It will thus be seen that the statute presupposes an existing society. That such society has rules or regulations for the \u201celection\u201d or \u201cappointment\u201d of officers. A compliance with these rules in selecting the trustees to be named in the certificate. The certificate in the present case is radically defective in various particulars.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-13\">1. It does not appear that any \u201csociety\u201d was in existence prior to the date of the certificate; on the contrary, the inference from the certificate is that none existed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-14\">2. If there was any society, the certificate fails to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>that the trustees were \u201cappointed\u201d in accordance with its rules, or that they were appointed \u201cby the society,\u201d or indeed that any \u201ctrustees\u201d were appointed by any person or persons whatever. The language of the certificate is: \u201cThat Frances A. McEnnis (and eight others), trustees, are appointed to manage the concerns of said society, for the period of one year.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-5\">This is not a certificate \u201cof their appointment,\u201d but is a certificate that certain persons are appointed to manage the concerns.of the society for one year. These persons, it is true, are styled trustees, but this is a mere <em>descriptio personarum </em>and falls very far short of being a certificate that they have been appointed as trustees. To appoint certain persons \u201cto manage the concerns of the society for one year,\u201d differs materially from appointing them \u201cas trustees to take charge of the estate and property belonging thereto, and to transact all affairs relative to the temporalities thereof.\u201d (Stat. 1850, p. 378, Sec. 175.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-6\">The one are mere subordinate agents or employes of the parties making the appointment and are subject to the will of the appointing power, while the other class, by their appointment become the legal representative of the corporate body, and invested with the legal custody of its estate, endowed with perpetual succession, and with power to prescribe the very laws by which their own conduct shall be regulated and their office terminated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-7\">3. The name by which the \u201ctrustees\u201d are to be \u201cforever \u201d known, is not stated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-8\">The certificate itself limits the existence of the society to fifty years, and the name of the \u201csociety\u201d is not the name by which the \u201ctrustees \u201d are to be called and known.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-9\">4. The certificate does not show in what county the \u201csociety \u201d is \u201csituated.\u201d The statute requires that it be recorded in such county. (Sec. 177.) The language of the certificate is:</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-10\">\u201cThat the city of San Francisco, in the State of California, is where the principal place of business of the company or society is to be located.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-11\">There is a great difference between the location of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>\u201cprincipal place of business\u201d of a society, and the location or place of the society itself. <em>(Harris </em>v. <em>McGregor, </em>29 Cal. 125.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-6\">Whatever the statute has required to be incorporated into the certificate must be inserted, else the society does not become a corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-7\">The Legislature has granted the privileges of a corporation upon certain conditions, and any material omission will be fatal to the existence of the corporation. (Moquel<em>umne Hill W. Co. </em>v. <em>Woodbury, </em>14 Cal. 426; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Mc-Gregor, </em>29 Cal. 125; <em>Eastern Plank R. Co. </em>v. <em>Vaughan, </em>14 N. Y. 546; <em>Union Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Cram, </em>33 N. H. 636.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-8\">There is a distinction to be drawn between what are termed the preliminary steps towards forming a corporation, and the proceedings to be had in becoming a corporation. The former are merely matters of detail leading up to the latter, but the latter are conditions precedent, in the absence of which the society has no corporate existence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b480-9\"><em>George &amp; Loughborough, </em>for the Respondents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-10\">The certificate shows that nine trustees or directors were appointed, and that they were appointed by the persons who signed the certificate. It appears that all the members of the association were appointed trustees, and that they all executed the certificate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-11\">The certificate declares that they were \u201c appointed to manage the concerns \u201d of the society. This language correctly describes the office to which they were appointed, even if the word \u201ctrustees,\u201d as used in the certificate, be regarded as merely descriptive of their persons. Bouvier defines \u201c directors\u201d (a word used in the statute as the equivalent of \u201c trustees,\u201d) to be \u201cpersons appointed or elected according to law, authorized to manage and direct the affairs of a corporation or company.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-12\">It was not necessary to state in the precise language of the statute, that they were appointed \u201cas trustees to take charge of the estate and property belonging to the corporation, and to transact all affairs relative to the temporalities thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b481-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>The question of the plaintiffs\u2019 due incorporation or its right to exercise corporate powers, cannot be inquired into otherwise than at the suit of the State on information of the Attorney-General. (Stat. 1862, p. 110.) Until such action be brought, such <em>de facto </em>corporation has all the rights of a corporation <em>de jure.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b481-6\">By the Court, McKinstry, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The Act concerning corporations, (Stats. 1850, p. 273-4), authorizes all \u201cmoral, beneficial, literary or scientific associations,\u201d by such methods as their rules or regulations may direct, to appoint or elect any number, not less than three nor more than nine, trustees to take charge of the estate and property belonging thereto, etc. And, in section 176, \u201cupon the appointment or election of such trustees or directors, a certificate of such appointment shall be executed by the person or persons making the appointment, or the judges holding the election, stating the names of the trustees or directors. The name by which said trustees shall thereafter forever be called and known shall be particularly mentioned and specified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">I. It is urged that the certificate given in evidence fails to comply with the statute, in that it does not appear therein that the nine persons whose names are subscribed to it constituted an existing society, with rules and regulations for the election or appointment of its officers, or that the trustees named had been chosen in accordance with such rules and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">The statute does not require that the \u201crules or regulations\u201d adopted by a society shall be set forth in the certificate, and I can hardly believe that a person other than the members can object that the rules were not complied with. If, however, this were permissible, there is no evidence in the present case of any departure from such rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">The object of the provision of the statute is to require that the members of the society shall express their choice as to the persons to become trustees of the corporation, directly or through officers or agents selected by them in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>the method prescribed by their rules or regulations. Whatever doubt might arise in other cases, none can exist that the will of the society is expressed in the certificate, where \u2014as in the present case\u2014all the members sign the certificate. The statute does not require that the rules shall have been reduced to writing, or that they shall have existed for any particular period of time; and the rules, whatever they are, may be changed by the unanimous action of the members. It affirmatively appearing that no one of the members objected to the mode which was pursued in selecting the trustees, but on the contrary, that all united in that mode, it must be assumed that there were no \u201crules or regulations\u201d in conflict with the method adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">II. I have examined the original of the statute of 1850 in the office of the Secretary of State, and find that in the printed volume, the word \u201cnames\u201d has been substituted for the word \u201cname,\u201d in the clause last above quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The object of that clause is to require that the certificate shall show the \u201cname\u201d by which the trustees (acting for the corporators,) shall be known, may acquire and dispose of property, sue and be sued. If this certificate had contained a statement, \u201cthe name by which the trustees of this society shall be known is the Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum,\u201d no question could be made as to its sufficiency. I can see no substantial difference between this and the language, \u201cthe corporate name of our society is \u2018The Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum.\u2019\u201d In each case the object of the statute is secured\u2014a name is adopted, under which the trustees, acting for the society, may transact its business.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">III. The statute does not require that the certificate shall contain a statement of the county in which the society is \u201csituated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
