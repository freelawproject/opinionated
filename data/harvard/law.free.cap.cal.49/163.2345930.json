The County Court reversed the judgment and rendered a judgment against the defendants here, for $19 60 costs. After the rendition of the judgment by the justice, and before it had been reversed by the County Court, the plaintiffs therein, (defendants here,) procured an execution from the justice, and, by virtue thereof, a constable levied on and sold a team of two horses and a wagon, the property of the defendant (plaintiff here), for three hundred dollars. Quinn brought this action to recover the sum for which the team sold, and the costs in the County Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-6\">The defendants in their answer set up the. following facts by way of counter claim: That on the 8th day of October, 1869, one J. L. Grant was the owner of the N. E. \u00bc of section 9, T. 11 <em>N., </em>R. 7 E., Mount Diablo meridian, together with the boarding and lodging-houses thereon, and was indebted to A. P. Craner and W. P. Craner, and that the Craners sued him, and, on the 2d day of May, 1870, recovered a judgment against him for $1,093 10, and procured an execution thereon, and sold the property on the 13th day of June, 1870, and the defendants became the purchasers, and obtained a sheriff\u2019s deed on the 17th day of December, 1870, and that said Grant, to defraud said Craners of their debt, in 1869, made a fraudulent sale of said property to one Jordon, and that the plaintiff Quinn, well knowing the facts, entered into possession of the property in subordination to the title of Jordon, and since the 13th day of June, 1870, had been holding the property and enjoying the rents, issues and profits thereof; and that said rents, issues and profits had been of the value of $125 per month, and that therefore the plaintiff was indebted to the defendants in the sum of $2,900, for said rents and profits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-7\">The plaintiff demurred to the counter claims, and the Court sustained the demurrer. The plaintiff had judgment, and the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-8\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b184-9\"><em>Jo Hamilton, </em>for the Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-10\">Having purchased the property at sale on execution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>we are entitled to the rents from day of sale, and may sue the party in possession for the same, even though he claims adversely. Our right is regulated by statute. <em>(Henry </em>v. <em>Everts, </em>30 Cal. 426.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-6\"><em>Hale &amp; Craig, </em>for Respondents.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b185-7\">By the Court, Wallace, C. J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">1. The answer of the defendant, in so far as it attempted to set up a counter claim, was as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-9\">\u201c Defendants, for further and separate defense herein, aver that plaintiff ought not to have the sum sued for, or any other sum of money from them, for they aver that plaintiff is, and was, at-and before the commencement of this suit, largely and justly indebted to defendants in this suit, much more than the sum sued for, to wit: the sum of twenty-eight hundred dollars.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">The demurrer of the plaintiff to this part of the answer was properly sustained. A counter claim should contain all the substantive averments necessary in a complaint, based upon the same cause of action; and, tested by this rule, the pleading is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">2. A further counter claim against the plaintiff was set up in the answer of the defendants, in substance, for the value of the use and occupation of certain premises, which the plaintiff held of one Jordon. Jordon\u2019s title accrued in 1869, by deed from one Grant to him; Grant was indebted to the Craners, who, in 1870, commenced an action, and in May of that year obtained a judgment against him. Upon execution sale, under this judgment, the defendants purchased the interest of Grant, the alleged fraudulent debtor of the Craners, and in December, 1870, obtained a sheriff\u2019s deed to the premises, pursuant to the execution sale. It is clear that the <em>bona fides </em>of the antecedent conveyance from Grant to Jordon cannot be collaterally inquired into in this action, nor the value of the use and occupation of the premises be recovered from the plaintiff, who entered and held under Jordon, and in hostility to the alleged title of the defendants. The demurrer to this portion of the answer was, therefore, properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>3. These views dispose of the \u201cerrors of law\u201d relied upon, and the motion for a new trial was properly denied, because the statement contains no specifications sufficient to support the motion. The only specifications are: First, \u201cthat said judgment is against law;\u201d second, \u201csaid judgment is contrary to the evidence in this.\u201d <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>Mat-field, ante, </em>p. 42.)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Judgment and order denying a new trial affirmed. Remittitur forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Mr. Justice Niles did not express an opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
