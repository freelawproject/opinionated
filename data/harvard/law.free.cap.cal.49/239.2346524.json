The plaintiff claimed to be their assignee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-6\">The defendant was the owner of a tract of six hundred and forty acres of land near said town, through which flowed a small stream of water which he used for watering his stock. The plaintiff diverted the water from the stream, above defendant\u2019s land, and commenced the erection of a flume across the defendant\u2019s land, in which to carry the water to the town, to be there distributed through pipes to the inhabitants. The defendant thereupon commenced an action against Loomis, in the District Court, for the trespass, and obtained an injunction restraining further trespasses. Loomis then commenced this action to condemn the land to the extent of an easement thereon, for the purpose of conveying the water over the same in a flume, and also to condemn the water in the stream. He asked, in his complaint, to be permitted to enter upon and occupy the land, and to be allowed to remove and use such gravel, stones, trees and timber as was necessary for his use. He also asked that the Court authorize him, during the pendency of the action, to continue in possession of the property sought to be condemned. On filing the complaint, and on the 14th of October, 1873, the District Judge, at Chambers, made an <em>ex parte </em>order dissolving the injunction granted by the County Judge in the case of <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Loomis, </em>and authorizing Loomis to continue in possession of the property sought to be condemned, upon his giving a bond in the sum of one thousand dollars, conditioned as provided in section 1,254 of the Code of C. P. Loomis gave the bond. Andrews filed his answer and asked that the order be vacated, and the Judge, on the 24th of October, 1873, made an order vacating the first order. Loomis then moved the Judge to vacate the second order and reinstate the first, and the Judge, at Chambers, on the 15th of November, 1873, granted the motion. From this last order Andrews appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number><em>Wm. J.
