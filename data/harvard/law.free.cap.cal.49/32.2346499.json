Ah Sam was called as a witness for the People, and having given testimony material to the issue, on his cross-examination by the defendant, said he was in jail on a criminal charge. He was then asked, \u201cwere you not there on a charge of house-breaking ? \u201d ' The district attorney objected to the question, and the Court sustained the objection. The defendant was convicted, and appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b52-10\"><em>Hinds &amp; Terry, </em>for the Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-11\">The evidence affected the credibility of the witness, and a witness may be asked as to collateral acts affecting his standing, and having some bearing on his credibility.

He was not asked if he had been convicted of the felony, but if he had been charged with it. \u201e This being merely a collateral matter, relating only to the credibility of the witness, and not material to the issue, the extent to which it could be pursued was in the discretion of the trial Court, and we cannot say that this discretion was abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">We have looked carefully through the record in connection with the ingenious brief of the prisoner\u2019s counsel, and discover nothing in the other points worthy of special notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Judgment and order denying new trial affirmed.
