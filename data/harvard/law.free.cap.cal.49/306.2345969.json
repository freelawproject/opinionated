The case on the former appeal is reported in the 42 Cal. 336. On the second trial, it appeared that defendant Pierce had not oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>cupied any of the demanded premises, except the southwest quarter of section fifteen. At the commencement of the trial, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys suggested the death of plaintiff Fagan, and asked that his executors, John and Patrick Tormey, be substituted as plaintiffs in his place. The Court made the order. The plaintiffs then introduced in evidence two patents issued by the United States, one to John Tormey, Peter Fagan and Isaac Lankershim, as tenants in common, conveying, along with other lands, the south half of the south-west quarter of section fifteen, and the other issued by the United States to R. C. Gillespie, H. O\u2019Neil, J. Tormey, Patrick Fagan, I. Lankershim, D. Reese, and Patrick McKay, as tenants in common, conveying the north half of said quarter section. When the plaintiffs rested, as no title had been shown in the plaintiff Hickson, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys asked to discontinue as to Hickson, and the Court granted leave. After both parties had rested, as the plaintiff had not shown any title in Fagan or his executors, to the north half of said quarter section, the defendant asked for judgment in his favor for said north half, he having pleaded a misjoinder of plaintiffs. The plaintiffs then asked to dismiss as to Fagan and the executors representing him, and the Court ordered the action so dismissed. No amendment was made to the complaint. Judgment was then rendered in favor of the two other plaintiffs. The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-6\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b327-7\"><em>M.

The order was entered in the minutes, and became a part of the judgment roll. (Practice Act, Sec. 203.) It therefore appeared on the face of the record in what manner two of the plaintiffs went out of the case, and why the action was thereafter prosecuted in the names of the other plaintiffs alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The point that by striking out the names of two of the plaintiffs, the cause of action was changed, is not tenable. The two remaining plaintiffs, as tenants in common, could maintain a joint action under our statute; and after the names of the other plaintiffs were stricken from the complaint, its averments were that the two remaining plaintiffs were jointly entitled to the possession. In legal effect, it was the same as before. There is nothing in the point that it was error to permit the amendment, except on payment of costs. Section 68 only requires that amendments by adding or striking out the name of a party shall be \u201con such terms as may be proper.\u201d The Court below was to exercise its discretion as to the terms, and we do not perceive that it abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Order and judgment affirmed. Remittitur forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Mr. Justice Rhodes did not express an opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
