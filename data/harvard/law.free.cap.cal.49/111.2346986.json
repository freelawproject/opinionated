Halleck died at the city of Louisville, State of Kentucky, on the 9th day of January, 1872, leaving a will in which he nominated Elizabeth Halleck, his wife, the executrix of his estate. The will was probated, and, on the 23d of April, 3873, the executrix filed, in the Probate Court, her final account, and also a report in which she alleged that all the debts of the deceased, expenses, and charges of administration had been paid, and that the estate was in a condition to be closed, and praying that the final account might be allowed and settled. On the same day she filed a petition for a distribution of the estate. Thomas J. L. Smiley and G. W. Smiley filed an opposition, of which the following is a copy:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-7\">\u201cHow come Thomas J. L. Smiley and G. W.

The opponents appealed from the several orders.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-8\"><em>R. W.

Halleck.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b135-11\">By the Court, McKinstry, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">It is alleged in the \u201c opposition that the opponents\u2014as creditors of the estate of Folsom\u2014have a <em>claim </em>against the estate of Halleck \u201c which is contingent upon the estate of Folsom, deceased, proving insolvent, and such insolvency being caused, wholly or in part, by the acts or omissions of said Halleck as executor,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">The relation of Halleck, as executor, to the estate of Folsom, was fixed during the lifetime of the former. If, by reason of his \u201cacts or ommissions,\u201d the estate of Folsom became insolvent, the right of the creditors of Folsom (to be enforced by appropriate proceedings) was an existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>right prior to the death of Halleck. Whether the remedy of the creditors of Folsom\u2019s estate was by action in the District Court for the <em>devastavit, </em>or by obtaining an order for an account and for judgment against the executor in the Probate Court, their \u201c claim \u201d was absolute while Halleck lived, and did not depend on the contingency that the estate of Folsom might \u201c prove to be insolvent \u201d on an accounting to be taken after the death of the executor of that estate. All claims which constitute demands against the decedent in his lifetime must be presented to the executor or administrator. The \u201copposition\u201d does not allege that the claim was ever presented to the executrix of Halleck\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">But if the facts that Folsom\u2019s estate was insolvent and that the insolvency was caused by the mal-conduct of Halleck would constitute a \u201cclaim\u201d against the estate of the latter, the <em>opposition </em>does not allege the existence of such a claim. It is only averred in the opposition that by reason of an account not having been filed by Halleck, as executor of the Folsom estate, \u201c the opponents have been unable to determine whether or not the said Halleck was at all indebted to the estate of Folsom, and unable to ascertain whether or not said Folsom\u2019s estate is insolvent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Orders affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Neither Mr. Justice Crockett nor Mr. Justice Rhodes expressed an opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
