On January 8, 1948, no answer having been filed, a judgment was entered against the defendant. On September <em>22, </em>1950, defendant moved for an order setting aside the judgment and permitting her to file an answer \u201con the ground that the defendant did not have her day in court.\u201d The only part of her affidavit which tended to support the motion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">\u201cWhen I received the summons and complaint in this matter, I was in this country about six months. I did not know what to do and I then went to my Uncle, Frank Chiquillo, who was a brother of Anna Naglieri, the plaintiff in this suit. He took the papers from me and told me not to worry about this, that he would take care of it. I asked him about the papers about a week later, and he told me that he had spoken to Mr. Donad\u00edo (attorney for plaintiff) and that Mr. Donad\u00edo would let him know. I did not hear anything further about this matter until after a judgment had been entered against me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">X then went to a lawyer and did not explain all these things to him because I did not understand the importance of these facts. When I told him that a judgment had been entered against me, he told me there was nothing I could do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">In support of her appeal, plaintiff included in the appendix certain affidavits, notices of motions and orders in other proceedings in the case which defendant moved to expunge from the record. We have not found it necessary to consider these documents in our determination of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Plaintiff contends that the trial court was without jurisdiction to vacate the judgment. <em>'Buie 4:2-2 (a) </em>(3) provides that an appeal may be taken from an interlocutory order, \u201cDetermining that the court has jurisdiction over the subject matter or the person.\u201d If the court lacked the power to vacate the judgment, the - order falls within the class of interlocutory orders that are appealable. <em>Cf. Steinhauser v. Friedman, 12 N. J. Misc. </em>167 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1934); <em>New Jersey Cash Credit Corp. v. Linehan, </em>6 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>740 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>1928). See also <em>Petersen v. Falzarano, </em>6 <em>N. J. </em>447, 453 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\"> <em>Utile </em>3 :60\u20142 authorizes the court to relieve a party from a final judgment for any one of five specified reasons, or, for \u201cany other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment or order.\u201d Of the specified reasons the only applicable one is \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d To take advantage of this reason, the rule requires a litigant to move for relief \u201cnot more than one year after the judgment, order or proceeding was entered or taken,\u201d and under <em>Buie </em>3:6\u20141 this period cannot be enlarged. Since, in the present ease, the facts set forth in defendant\u2019s affidavit amount at most to a showing of excusable neglect, and the motion was not made within one year after the rendition of the judgment, the court was without power to grant relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\"><em>Buie </em>3 :00\u20143 permits the court without any time limitation to relieve a party from a judgment for \u201cany other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment or order.\u201d In the present case, however, no \u201cother\u201d reason than that set forth in defendant\u2019s affidavit is presented to justify relief; there are no facts alleged that show a commission of fraud upon the court. Furthermore, there was no showing of \u201ca strong case of extreme hardship or injustice\u201d depriving the defendant of an opportunity to defend the ease. See <em>Wilford v. Sigmund Eisner Co., </em>13 <em>N. J. Super. </em>27, 33 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951); <em>Klapprott v. United States, </em>335 <em>U. S. </em>601, 93 <em>L. Ed. </em>266, 279 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The limitations imposed by <em>Buie </em>3 :60-2 are expressions of the policy of terminating litigation within a reasonable time, which is essential to the proper administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The order vacating the judgment is set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
