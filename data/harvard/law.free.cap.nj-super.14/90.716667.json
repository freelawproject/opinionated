C.</author>\n<p id=\"AVPI\">Plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that she is an \u201cactive member\u201d of the East Orange Police Department, within the meaning of <em>R. 8. </em>43 :16-17, and as such is eligible for retirement by reason of her age and years of service. That she is a member of the police force is conceded, but defendant contends that she is an \u201cemployee member,\u201d and as such is not eligible for retirement because plaintiff has not yet attained the age for retirement applicable to employee members. The trial court gave summary judgment for defendant and from that judgment plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">The facts are stipulated. On November 22, 1916, plaintiff, after examination and certification by the Civil Service Commission, was duly appointed clerk of the police department. Although the manual relating to the duties of the clerk did not subject plaintiff to call for police duties, she in fact did, over the years, perform police duties of various kinds in addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>tion to her duties as clerk, and apparently still does. At one time the board of police commissioners contemplated creating the position of policewoman or police matron, but never in fact created it, nor was there any purported appointment of plaintiff or anyone else to that position. Plaintiff has never been certified by the Civil Service Commission for a position other than the 1916 one as clerk. Plaintiff at all times was and is carried on the payrolls as a clerk in the department and, as already stated, in fact performs the duties of a clerk despite the additional performance of certain police duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><em>B. 8. </em>43 :16-1 to 18, enacted in 1944, created the distinction between \u201cactive member\u201d and \u201cemployee member.\u201d Prior thereto all members of the police department were subject to the same requirements of age and years of service for retirement. <em>B. 8. </em>43:16~1 provides that any \u201cactive member\u201d having 25 years of service and having reached the age of 51 years is eligible for retirement, whereas an \u201cemployee member\u201d may retire after like years of service but upon reaching the age of 60 years. Plaintiff has served more than 25 years and is now 56 years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\"><em>B. 8. </em>43 :16\u201417 defines \u201cmember,\u201d \u201cactive member\u201d and \u201cemployee member\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">\u201c(1) \u2018Member\u2019 shall mean a person who on the effective date of the act of which this act is amendatory, that is on July first, one thousand nine hundred and forty-four, was a member of a municipal police department or paid or part paid fire department or county police department or a paid or part paid fire department of a fire district located in a township and who has contributed to the pension fund established under chapter sixteen of Title 43 of the Revised Statutes and shall hereafter contribute to said fund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">(2) \u2018Active member\u2019 shall mean any \u2018member\u2019 who is a policeman, fireman, detective, lineman, driver of police van, fire alarm operator or inspector of combustibles and who is subject to call for active service or duty as such.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">(3) \u2018Employee member\u2019 shall mean any \u2018member\u2019 who is not subject to call for active service or duty as a policeman, fireman, detective, lineman, driver of police van, fire alarm operator or inspector of combustibles.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>The trial court pointed out that the definition of \u201cactive member\u201d required both that the member have the status of \u201cpoliceman * * *\u201d and he \u201csubject to call for active service or duty as such,\u201d and concluded that although plaintilf had in fact been subjected to call for such service or duty, she at no time held the required status, and observed that the circumstance that plaintiff liad thus been subjected to call could not operate to rewrite the specific legislation applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">We think the trial court\u2019s conclusions are in all respects correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Plaintiff attacks the finding that she does not have the required status of a \u201cpoliceman\u201d within the definition of an \u201cactive member.\u201d She relies upon <em>B. S. </em>40 :174-89, enacted in 1920, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">\n<em>\u201cPresent clerks transferred to force</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\"><em>2. </em>All such clerks of the bureau of detectives or detective department. having charge of the filing and docketing of police records of said detective bureau or department, including identification clerks and the person having charge of the Bertillon system of said bureau iDr department, and clerks or secretaries to the chief of police, now in the employ of such city are hereby transferred to and made a part of the police force thereof without further appointment or action, <em>in addition to the number of policemen limited by any law for such city.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">The argument is that the italicized words constituted a legislative declaration that all persons thus transferred to and made a part of the police force were thereby denominated \u201cpolicemen\u201d and that that characterization should be carried into the construction of the word \u201cpoliceman\u201d as used in <em>R. S. </em>43 :16\u201417.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\"><em>B. S. </em>40:174-89 will not stand that interpretation. It merely transferred the employees described to the police force and made them a part of it. It did not constitute a declaration that the employees thereby transferred were policemen.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">Judgment is affirmed without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
