The County Court in which the case was tried adjourned February 4, 1911. There was no order allowing the statement of facts to be filed after adjournment. The statement of facts was filed on February 13, nine days after adjournment of court. It has been the uniform holding of this court to strike out and not consider a statement of facts thus filed. Looper v. State, 136 S. W. Rep., 791-2; Mosher v. State, 136 S. W. Rep., 467. A long list of other cases might be cited, but we deem it unnecessary. The motion of the Assistant Attorney-General is granted, and said statement of facts struck out and not considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">There is no bill of exceptions, nor other matters which we can consider in the absence of a statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
