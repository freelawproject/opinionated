In the County Court the county attorney made a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the appeal bond was insufficient in that it does not bind the defendant to appear at any particular place. Upon the authority of Russell v. State, 84 S. W. Rep., 589, this motion was properly sustained, and the case properly dismissed from the County Court. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>appeal bond in the Russell case, supra, is precisely, in this respect, the same as the bond in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\">The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
