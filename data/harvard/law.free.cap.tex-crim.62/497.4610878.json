W. Donaldson, County Attorney, in and for the county of Fannin and State of Texas, duly elected and qualified, now here, in the County Court of said county, present this information and show to the court that one Lon Gentry, late of the county of Fannin, heretofore, viz, on or about the 1st dajr of April, A. D. 1910, with force and arms, in the county of Fannin, State of Texas, did then and there unlawfully, who was then and there an adult male, did commit an aggravated assault in and upon the person of one Minnie Wakefield, then and there being a female, contrary to the form of the statute in such cases made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the State. \u201cJ. W. Donaldson,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\">\u201cCounty Attorney, Fannin County, Texas.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Both the complaint and information started \u201cIn the name and by the authority of the State of Texas.\u201d In addition to the filing of the complaint in the Justice Court, both it and the information were filed in the County Court on June 9, 1910.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">There was no statement of facts, but were some bills of exception, which were filed after the adjournment of the court and without any order entered permitting this. Hence, these bills of exception can not be considered. Williams v. State, 35 Texas Crim. Rep., 391. However, the material questions raised by the bills of exception were also presented in the motion to quash the complaint and information, and are so raised thereby that it is necessary to pass upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">The first ground of the motion to quash is that the affidavit or complaint was not taken by a justice of the peace of any precinct of Fannin County. As shown above, the affidavit was made and signed by J. H. Ball, and the jurat shows that it was sworn to and subscribed \u201cbefore me this 30th day of April, 1910. W. A. Daniel, Justice of the Peace, Precinct Ho. -, Fannin County, Texas,\u201d and was then endorsed and filed as follows: \u201cAffidavit. The State of Texas versus Laun gentery. Filed the 30th day of April, 1910. W. A. Daniel, Justice of the Peace, Precinct No. 6, Fannin County, Texas.\u201d The information substantially conforms to the complaint which is all that is required under the law. Code Criminal Procedure, articles 257, 466 and 467. The jurat, although the precinct of which the magistrate is justice of the peace is left blank, we believe to be sufficient within itself (Nieman v. State, 29 Texas Crim. App., 360), and especially when taken in connection with the filing indorsed thereon it is amply sufficient. The complaint may be made and sworn to before any justice of the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">The next ground of the motion is that there is a fatal variance between the complaint and information in that the complaint charges \u201cLaun gentary\u201d with committing an aggravated assault on \u201con Minnie Waikefield,\u201d while the information charges \u201cLon Gentry\u201d with committing an aggravated assault on \u201cone Minnie Wakefield.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>second \u201con\u201d was evidently meant for the word \u201cone,\u201d but it is clearly surplusage, and need not be considered either in the complaint or information. Mayo v. State, 7 Texas Crim. App., 342; Mathews v. State, 39 Texas Crim. Rep., 553. \u201cLaun Gentary\u201d is idem sonans with \u201cLon Gentry.\u201d Wilks v. State, 27 Texas Crim. App., 381; Henry v. State, 7 Texas Crim. App., 388. And so is \u201cMinnie Waikefield\u201d with \u201cMinnie Wakefield.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">There is no merit in appellant\u2019s last ground of his motion to quash because the complaint was filed on April 30, 1910, and the information not until June 9, 1910. Roberson v. State, 15 Texas Crim. App., 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The lower court\" did not err in not quashing the complaint and the information on any of the grounds set up. The judgment is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b524-8\">on rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">May 31, 1911.</p>\n<author id=\"b524-10\">PRENDERGAST, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A0g\">The appellant has filed a motion for rehearing, and earnestly insists that this court erred in holding that the name \u201cLaun Gentarv\u201d is <em>idem sonans </em>with \u201cLon Gentry,\u201d and cites several cases where different words were held not to be <em>idem </em>sonans, decided by the courts of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">The doctrine' of <em>idem sonans </em>has been much enlarged by modern decisions to conform to the growing rule that a variance, to be material, must be such as would mislead a party to his prejudice. State v. White, 34 S. C., 59; 12 S. E., 661; 27 Am. St. Rep., 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">Again, as laid down in 29 Cyc., 272, the rule is as follows: \u201cThe law does not regard the spelling of names so much as their sound. By the doctrine of <em>idem sonans </em>if two names, although spelled differently, sound alike, they are to be regarded as the same. Great latitude is allowed in the spelling and pronunciation of proper names, and in all legal proceedings, whether civil or criminal, if two names, as commonly pronounced in the English language, are sounded alike, a variance in their spelling is immaterial. Even slight differences in their pronunciation is unimportant; if the attentive ear finds difficulty in distinguishing two names when pronounced, they are <em>idem sonans\u201d </em>citing in note 54, p. 272, a large number of names which are held by the courts to be <em>idem sonans. </em>In many of them the spelling is much different, and if the pronunciation was attempted to be given of each letter any syllable in the name in an accurate and particular way, there would be much greater difference than in the names we hold <em>idem sonans </em>in this case. Ho injury whatever to the appellant by spelling his name in the complaint \u201cLaun Gentary\u201d and in the information \u201cLon Gentry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">The motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-14\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
