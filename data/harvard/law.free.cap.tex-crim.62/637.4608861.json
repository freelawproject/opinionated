The evidence shows the name of the deceased was Jim J ones. There is nothing in the record to show that the deceased was known as wejl by the name of Jim Jones as Tom Jones, but all the way through the record shows the deceased\u2019s name was Jim Jones, and not Tom J ones. This may be a mistake in the record. However that may be, the indictment alleges the killing of one man, and the evidence shows the killing of another. This is such a variance as requires a reversal of the judgment. The court submitted to the jury the case upon the theory that Tom Jones was killed. The record fails to show that there was such a man as Tom Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-24\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-25\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
