Relator consummated an agreement with the district attorney, which is fully, sanctioned by the trial judge, by which he was and is to testify for the State against Grant until Grant\u2019s case is finally settled, at which time relator\u2019s case is to be dismissed. The agreement is such an one as is recognized by the laws of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-18\">The agreement and the evidence which he agrees to give and to which has on at least two trials testified are in writing and set out in the record. We deem it unnecessary to incumber this opinion with details of these documents. Relator has responded to his agreement when called upon to do so to the satisfaction of the State authorities. Upon Grant\u2019s first trial a conviction resulted, the death penalty being awarded by the jury. This judgment was reversed. Upon another trial Grant has been again convicted and has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-19\">Relator\u2019s contention is that under his agreement he is held more as a witness than under the accusation of murder. In a sense this is true, but not in the sense that he is entitled to his discharge or to be admitted to bail. His agreement is that he is only to be discharged w;hen Grant\u2019s case becomes a finality. This has not occurred. Until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>that event his status remains under the indictment preferred against him. The evidence is sufficient to refuse bail. It is unnecessary to-write further than to say that the questions urged are decided adversely to the relator\u2019s contention in Ex parte Greenhaw, 41 Texas Crim. Rep., 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
