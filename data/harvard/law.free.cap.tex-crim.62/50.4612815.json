He was convicted for fornication, that being the only ground submitted by the court in the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-17\">The complaint upon which the information was based was by John Champion, who swore: \u201cI have reason to believe that on or about June 1, 1910, in Brown County, Texas, Jerry Green, an unmarried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>man, did unlawfully have habitual intercourse,\u201d etc. A motion was made in the lower court to quash the complaint and information, because the information did not charge in the terms of the statute that the party making the complaint stated, \u201cI have reason to believe, <em>and do believe. </em>The words \u201cand do believe\u201d were omitted. The statute, article 357, Code Crim. Proc., requires this and this court has held in Tompkins v. State, 77 S. W. Rep., 800, and Smith v. State, 45 Texas Crim. Rep., 411, 76 S. W. Rep., 436, that this is necessary. The motion should have been sustained and the information on the charge of fornication should have been quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">We would dismiss this case but for the fact that the other charge of adultery is still in the cas\u00e9. If the State desires to proceed to charge the appellant with fornication it certainly must file a new complaint and information.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The cause is reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
