All of the grounds set up in the motion for a new trial relate to the sufficiency \u2019 of the evidence except one, and that is with reference to a charge on circumstantial evidence. This charge seems to be in the form that has been approved frequently by this court, and is the charge usually given. The contention of appellant is that there is an expression in the charge which made it a charge on the weight of evidence, in that the court used in connection with the statement \u201cthese necessary facts must be consistent with each other and with the main facts sought to be establishd\u2014that is, . with the defendant\u2019s guilt\u2014and when taken together must be of a conclusive nature, leading on the whole,\u201d etc. The criticism is that the expression above quoted, as follows, \u201cthat is, with the defendant\u2019s guilt,\u201d is a charge on the weight of evidence. The main fact sought to be established is defendant\u2019s guilt. This does not assume that defendant is guilty, nor so instruct the jury, but it informs the jury that these necessary facts must be consistent with each other, and with \"the main fact sought to be established\u2014that is, the defendant\u2019s guilt. We think there is no merit\" in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-15\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-16\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
