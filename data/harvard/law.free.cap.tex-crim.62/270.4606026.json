There is no motion for a new trial in the record, but there is a motion to quash the indictment, which the court overruled. The indictment is in the language of the statute; and informed defendant with the nature of the offense of which she was charged, and is in the language of Willson\u2019s Criminal Forms, and the court did not err in overruling the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">There are two bills of exception in the record in regard to the admissibility of certain testimony showing intimacy between defendant and the injured party. Appellant justified her conduct on the theory that the prosecuting witness had attempted to commit the offense of rape on her, and denied ever having had carnal intercourse with the witness. The prosecuting witness denied the assault and testified to numerous acts of carnal intercourse with her, and that the night the offense is alleged to have been committed he went at her request to an appointed place, and twice had sexual intercourse with her prior to the commission of the alleged offense. The testimony objected to, we think, was admissible on the question of whether or not her statement was true that she had never had carnal intercourse with the injured party, and that he attempted to ravish her.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
