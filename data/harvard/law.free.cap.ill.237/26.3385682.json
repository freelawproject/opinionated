Constitutional law\u2014legislature may create code of practice applicable to \u2022municipal court alone. The constitutional' amendment, adopted in 1904, providing that in the event of the creation of municipal courts in Chicago \u201cthe jurisdiction and practice shall he such as the General Assembly shall provide,\u201d authorizes the creation by the legislature of a code of practice applicable to such municipal courts alone, provided no provision with reference to jurisdiction or practice so changes the organization or functions of the court that it can no longer be regarded as a city court.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b27-4\" pgmap=\"27\">2. Same\u2014statute giving municipal judge discretion to charge the jury orally is valid. The constitutional amendment adopted in 1904, providing that the jurisdiction and practice of municipal courts in Chicago \u201cshall be such as the General Assembly shall provide,\u201d authorizes section 37 of the Municipal Court act, (Laws of 1905, p. 175,) giving judges of municipal courts in Chicago the discretion to charge the jury orally or in writing, and the vesting of such discretion is not a delegation of legislative power.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b27-5\" pgmap=\"27\">3. Practice\u2014written instructions may be refused if municipal judge has determined to charge jury orally. After the judge of the municipal court has determined to charge the jury orally and has so advised counsel before beginning his charge, it is not error for him to refuse to give instructions in writing presented by counsel.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b27-6\" pgmap=\"27\">4. Appeals and errors\u2014objections to statement of cause of action should be pointed out in the brief.

Stephen A. Foster, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-9\" pgmap=\"27\">On May 20, 1908, Rena Morton, a minor, the defendant in error, by her next friend, recovered a judgment for the sum of $500, in the municipal court of Chicago, against Evan Pusey, plaintiff in error, for personal injuries alleged to have been sustained by her through the negligence of plaintiff in error in the operation of an automobile at the corner of Sixty-fourth street and Stony Island avenue, in the city of Chicago, on the evening of August 4, 1907. To review that judgment plaintiff in error has sued out a writ of error from this court.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-10\" pgmap=\"27(28) 28(286)\">The amended statement' of claim filed by defendant in error avers that the injuries complained of were occasioned through the negligence of the plaintiff in error in operating and driving a certain automobile at an undue or high rate of speed across a busy thoroughfare, by failing to sound any horn or other warning of his approach, and by running his machine down the wrong side of the street, past and around a certain street car then standing at said crossing, at an undue speed, by reason of which defendant in error was unable to see or escape from said .automobile; that the plaintiff in error failed to properly manage and control his said machine and to apply brakes and stop the same within a proper time and distance, and was careless and unskillful in the management and control of said automobile, by reason of which negligence defendant in error, while in the exercise of due care, was struck by said automobile and injured, both internally and externally, and by reason of said injuries she incurred large expense for doctor\u2019s bills and medicine and sustained financial loss of wages and salary during a period of three months; that said internal and external injuries aforesaid consisted of the striking, bruising and wounding the left side of defendant in error and the injuring and hurting of her left arm and left leg, by reason of which she sustained great pain, and her left ankle and left knee were rendered sore and stiff and permanently weak, injured and impaired; that the head of defendant in error was also injured, bruised and cut, and since said accident she has had fainting spells and headaches, pains in and about her head and eyes, and the shock and fall also impaired the internal organs and functions of defendant in error and have impaired her gen\u00e9ral health.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-5\" pgmap=\"28(80) 29(403) 30(67)\">Sixty-fourth street runs east and west. Stony Island avenue runs north and south and crosses the end of Sixty-fourth street just west of an entrance to Jackson' Park. Running east toward Stony Island avenue on Sixty-fourth street are three street car tracks, the south track turning to the south and the other two turning to the north on Stony Island avenue. On this south track east-bound cars are operated, and at the junction of the two streets this track is laid within three or four feet of the curb on the south side of Sixty-fourth street. On the track immediately north, west-bound cars are operated. The accident occurred about 8:3o o\u2019clock on the evening of August 4, 1907, at the junction of these two streets. A car running east on the south track on Sixty-fourth street had just arrived at the corner and had stopped to let passengers off before turning south on Stony Island avenue. At this time there were a number of persons on the west side of the avenue immediately south of Sixty-fourth street, some of them waiting to take the car and others intending to cross the railway tracks. For some distance plaintiff in error had followed the car on the south track with his automobile, and when the car slowed down to make the stop at the corner the plaintiff in error turned his machine to the left and ran on east along the north side of and close to the car: Just as he reached the east end of the car, defendant in error, who was crossing Sixty-fourth street, walking to the north on the west line of Stony Island avenue, and who had passed just in front of the street car after the motorman on the car had motioned her to do so, stepped in front of plaintiff in error\u2019s machine and was struck by it and knocked down. On the trial plaintiff in error testified that he was running his machine, at the time of the accident, on second speed, and that he was traveling less than six miles an hour, and that when the machine was operated at first speed it could be run as slow as three miles an hour; that the machine was stopped by him thirteen or fourteen feet east of the point where the accident occurred; that when he turned out to go around the car he saw no one on the street ahead of him, and that he did not see defendant in error until the instant before she was struck, and it was then too late to apply the emergency brake; that just as he was leaving the car track to go around the street car he sounded his horn and at the moment defendant in error stepped in front of his machine he shouted to her. When struck by the machine defendant in error\u2019s left knee and left arm were quite severely injured, and it appears from the evidence that for a considerable length of time afterward she suffered from other bodily ailments occasioned by.the shock. Prior to the injury the defendant in error was employed as stenographer, but on account of the condition of her health following the accident she was obliged to give up this work.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-5\" pgmap=\"30\">At the close of all the evidence the court denied plaintiff in error\u2019s motion for a peremptory instruction.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-6\" pgmap=\"30\">Charles A.

All laws relating to courts shall be general, and of uniform operation; and the organization, jurisdiction, powers, proceedings and practice of all courts, of the same class or grade, so far as regulated by law, and the force and effect of the process, judgments and decrees of such courts, severally, shall be uniform.\u201d These objections to the section of the statute in question are based on the fact that it gives discretion to the judge of the municipal court to instruct the jury either orally or in writing, while a like discretion is not conferred upon the judge of any other court.</p> <p id=\"b33-8\" pgmap=\"33(93) 34(210)\">The amendment to the constitution adopted by the voters in 1904, and which is section 34 of article 4 of the fundamental law of the State, provides that in the event of the creation of municipal courts in the city of Chicago \u201cthe jurisdiction and practice of said municipal courts shall be such as the General Assembly shall prescribe.\u201d If plaintiff in error\u2019s contention is correct, the words just quoted are entirely without meaning. We do not think they should be so regarded. One purpose of the legislature and of the people unquestionably was to authorize the creation of a code of practice for the municipal court of Chicago which might apply to that court alone. Such a code cannot take away from a litigant any right given him by the constitution as it stood prior to this amendment in reference to any matter .other than practice in that court, but as the question of instructing orally or of instructing in writing is solely a matter of practice, we think that the statute in question is warranted by section 34, supra. Nor can it be said, as here contended, that this section delegates to the judge legislative power to determine whether or not, in any particular case, the jury shall be instructed by one method or another. Statutes vesting like discretionary powers in judges' of courts of record have never been regarded in this State as conferring legislative power upon the judges. It is, however, beyond the power of the legislature to make any provision in reference to the jurisdiction of or practice in the municipal court which would effect such a change in the organization or functions of the court that it could no longer be regarded as a municipal or city court. Miller v. People, 230 Ill. 65.</p> <p id=\"b34-3\" pgmap=\"34(152) 35(48)\">After the court had disposed of a motion made at the close of all the evidence the attorney for plaintiff in error asked that the jury be instructed in writing, and presented certain written instructions and requested that the court give the same. These were all refused, for the reason that the court had elected to instruct the jury orally. At the conclusion of the oral charge the judge inquired whether there were any objections to the instructions as given. Counsel for plaintiff in error did not make any objection nor take any exception to the charge so far as the law stated or omitted was concerned, but asked that two of the written instructions which he had before passed up, and which two he then again presented, should be given. The court refused both. One of them contained a proper element which went to the measure of damages, the substance of which should have in some manner been given to the jury, but as offered these instructions were properly refused for the reason that they were in writing when the court had determined to charge the jury orally and had so advised counsel before beginning to instruct.</p> <p id=\"b35-5\" pgmap=\"35\">The sufficiency of the amended statement of plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was challenged. Plaintiff in error has not in his brief pointed out wherein that statement fails to meet the requirements of the statute. We will not enter upon an independent investigation ourselves for the purpose of ascertaining whether the alleged error exists.</p> <p id=\"b35-6\" pgmap=\"35\">Evidence was received tending to show that prior to the time of the injury the menses of the injured girl had occurred at regular intervals and that afterward the periods at which they occurred were irregular, indicating derangement, which it was claimed resulted from the accident. It was objected that the statement of claim was not broad enough to permit the admission of such testimony. We have examined that statement and are of opinion the evidence was admissible.</p> <p id=\"b35-7\" pgmap=\"35\">It is also complained that the court erred in refusing to instruct the jury to find for the defendant at the close of all the evidence. The statement preceding this opinion shows that the evidence tended to prove plaintiff\u2019s statement of her claim. The motion was without merit.</p> <p id=\"b35-8\" pgmap=\"35\">The verdict was not against the weight of the evidence nor was the amount of damages allowed excessive.</p> <p id=\"b35-9\" pgmap=\"35\">Plaintiff in error by his reply brief and argument raises a constitutional question not suggested by his original brief and argument. The portion of his reply brief dealing with this proposition has been disregarded by us.</p> <p id=\"b35-10\" pgmap=\"35\">The judgment of the municipal court will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b35-11\" pgmap=\"35\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
