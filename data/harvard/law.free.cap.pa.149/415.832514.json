He further insists that if this was done and water was thereby caused to flow on the lands of the plaintiff at the point \u2018 A \u2019 that he is entitled to nominal damages, even though no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>injury resulted, basing his claim for damages upon the fact that if nominal damages were not granted the defendant would acquire a right to cast his water upon the land of the plaintiff. But, gentlemen of the jury, I instruct you that such is not the law. If you believe the contention of the defendant to be true, that there was an open drain from the bridge through the land of the plaintiff up to \u2018 B \u2019 and from there up to the point \u2018 A,\u2019 and that this open ditch was in existence at the time that Mr. Rodenbaugh (defendant\u2019s predecessor) went upon the premises, about 1871, and constructed these drains in dispute, upon his own land, taking into consideration the fact that there was no standing body of water on the Rodenbaugh lands above\u2014no water there, if the evidence is to be believed, except that which descends from the falling rains or from the melting snows, then we instruct you [that he had a right to collect those waters by means of drains and discharge them upon the land of the plaintiff at the point \u2018A.\u2019\u201d] [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s 1st, 2d and 5th points, and the answers thereto, are given in the opinion of the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-5\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1-3) the refusal of plaintiff\u2019s 1st, 2d and 5th points, quoting points and answers ; (4) the charge as above in brackets, quoting it in substance.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b440-6\"><em>J.

Chief Justice Paxson,</author>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">This was an action of trespass by the owner of the servient tenement against the owner of the dominant, to recover damages for collecting all the waters which would pass from the dominant to the servient, to one spot, by artificial underdrains, and discharging them there.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Upon the trial below, the court was requested by the plaintiff\u2019s second and fifth points, to instruct the jury that if they believe that underdrains were made and concentrated to one point, that said underdrains discharged a larger quantity of water at that point than by surface discharge would naturally flow, -the plaintiff is entitled to recover; and that it makes no difference in such case whether there was a ditch at that point of the discharge or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The court refused these points, and for further answer referred to the answer to plaintiff\u2019s first point.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">It is therefore necessary to examine the first point, and the answer thereto, in order to ascertain whether the jury were property instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">The first point is as follows: \u201c That while the Meixell land is bound to receive all the surface water from Morgan\u2019s land, which would naturally go that way by the inclination of the land, and all the water that may be led by superficial cultivation, that a different principle obtains in cases of artificial, concealed or mole drains; that Morgan cannot concentrate all the water bjr underground drains and discharge them at one point.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">\u201c <em>Answer.: </em>Refused as put. The defendant had a right to lay an artificial drain on his land to carry off the ordinary rainfall and discharge the water at one point, if the jury find that point was the natural watershed for both tracts of land, and further find that there was an open ditch on the plaintiff\u2019s land into which the waters from the defendant\u2019s land naturally descended, and further find that the water from the drains did not materially increase the flow of water upon the defendant\u2019s land and work injury to him. If the point of discharge of the defendant\u2019s drains was not the natural outlet for the water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>from the defendant\u2019s land over that of the plaintiff, and there was no ditch at the point of discharge on the plaintiff\u2019s land to receive and carry off the water, and the defendant collected the water on his own land by underdrains, and discharged it on the plaintiff\u2019s land in greater volume than it would naturally flow there, and thereby injured the plaintiff, then we affirm the point, and plaintiff can recover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">This ruling was as favorable to the plaintiff as he had any right to expect. It is settled law that, \u201c for the sake of agriculture, a man may drain his ground which is too moist, and discharging the water according to its natural channel, may cover up and conceal the drains through his lands; may use running streams to irrigate his fields, though he thereby diminishes, not unreasonably, the supply of his neighbor below; and may clear out impediments in the natural channel of his streams, though the flow of water on his neighbor\u2019s land be thereby increased : \u201d Kauffman v. Griesemer, 26 Pa. 407; Penna. Coal Co. v. Sanderson, 113 Pa. 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">If it were the law, that under no circumstances could the flow of water from the dominant to the servient tenement be increased, it would seriously iriterfere with agricultural and mining operations. The very act of draining land necessarily increases the flow of water, whether such drainage is caused by open ditches or underground tiles. In doing so, however, care must be taken not to cause unnecessary injury to the owner of the servient tenement. The water must not be diverted from its natural channel by the opening of new or different channels. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
