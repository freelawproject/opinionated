Fayette Co., June T., 1891, No. 846, for defendant, John Snider, Jr., on case stated.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"AT3\">Before Paxson, C.

Under the will of John Snider, deceased, dated April 11,1889, the defendant took only an undivided third of certain real estate in remainder. The fifth paragraph of the will, relied upon by the defendant, is quoted in the opinion of the Supreme Court. The court below by Ewing, J., entered judgment for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-13\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the entering of the judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b386-14\"><em>Edward Campbell, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbP\">The only way defendant\u2019s note can be deducted from his share of the estate is by obtaining judgment against him and enforcing the judgment against his share.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-15\">He cited Bittle v.

While a testator may not turn an advancement into a debt, it is well settled that he may turn a debt into an advancement. It was contended, however, that to so treat it would produce inequality, and that there was no-share coming to John Snider, Jr., from which this advancement could be deducted. All this is outside of the case stated. If inequality is the result, it is neither the fault of the court below nor of this court, but the responsibility therefor must rest with the testator himself. Aside from this, we cannot know that he did not intend to create this very inequality.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
