Co., June T., 1891, No. 56, on verdict for plaintiff, Henry Harrison.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"A2\">Before Panson, C.

J., the evidence was to the following effect: Plaintiff was interested with others in applications for United States letters patent on a supposed invention by one Coleman who made a model to illustrate it. These applications were rejected and abandoned. Afterwards, plaintiff applied for and obtained two letters patent, interests in both of which he sold to defendant. One of plaintiff\u2019s patents was admitted to be valid; the validity of the other was sought to be impeached by evidence that the invention therein claimed was substantially shown in the model made by Coleman and in his applications. The model and copies of the Coleman applications were offered in evidence; and two experts were called by the defendant whose testimony was to the effect that the disputed invention of plaintiff, or material parts of it, was anticipated thereby.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-5\">The charge of the court below was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-6\">\u201c The defence set up in this case is an alleged want of novelty in the Harrison invention and patent, which rendered it void and invalid. I feel it my duty to instruct you that the evidence given by the defendant is not sufficient to invalidate the Harrison patent on the ground of want of novelty. I give you that instruction because it is a matter of law, and, therefore, must be decided by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-7\">\u201c You will understand that the statutory definition of \u2018 novelty \u2019 differs from that of the popular signification of \u2018 novelty.\u2019 The words of the act of congress are that patents may be granted for inventions which are new and useful. What a new invention is has often been the subject of determination by the courts, which have had that question before them, and it has been held in many cases, and is, I think, the undoubted law, that in order to defeat a patent upon the ground of want of novelty, it must be known to the public, or it must be in use by the public.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-8\">\u201c The existence of the specifications which were contained in the abandoned application of Mr. Coleman for his patent, and the evidence which they contain of resemblance to the contrivance patented by Mr. Harrison, do not prove want of novelty. They only show that a somewhat similar invention, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>an invention which the other side contends was substantially the identical invention of Mr. Harrison, existed before; that it had been invented by Mr. Coleman. That is not a defence in law to a patent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-5\">\u201c The reason upon which the courts have put that interpretation of the statute is that a thing may be entirely new to the public which is perfectly well known to a few individuals, and the sense in which the act of congress uses the word \u2018 new \u2019 is that it must be new to the public, and that a want of novelty, in order to be made out so as to invalidate a patent, must be such want of novelty as shows that the invention was known to the public. Hence, it has been determined in many cases that the existence of specifications and of models, which would be an infringement if they had been subsequent inventions to the patent which has been granted, would not prove a want of novelty within the meaning of the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-6\">\u201c I, therefore, feel bound to instruct you, as a matter of law, that the existence of these' specifications and of the application of Mr. Coleman, in the patent office, and what are called the Coleman models, does not prove that want of novelty which is meant by the statute and which it is necessary to prove in order to invalidate the patent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-7\">\u201c [The sum of it all is that on the evidence produced by the defendant, there is nothing to show that- the Harrison patent is not a perfectly valid patent, and if it is a valid patent, he is entitled to be paid what the defendant promised to pay for it, and it only remains for you to assess the damages which the plaintiff has suffered by the breach of contract, according to the evidence.] \u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-8\"><em>JError assigned </em>was the portion of the charge in brackets, quoting it.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-9\"><em>Alex. </em>Simpson, <em>Jr., </em>with him <em>Maxwell </em>Stevenson, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-10\">We admit that the mere fact that a patented machine is similar in construction to one manufactured prior to the patent is not alone sufficient to invalidate the patent. If the invention \u25a0 is an original invention so far as the patentee is concerned, the prior manufacture must have been made public in some way, in order to invalidate the patent. But under the evidence, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>the question had been submitted to the jury, they might have found that the Harrison patent was void, because he was not the original inventor, but had taken the combination and ideas from Coleman\u2019s model and applications: Gayler v.
