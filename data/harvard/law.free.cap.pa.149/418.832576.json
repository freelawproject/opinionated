F. Hopwood, Esq., appearing for William L. Robinson both as executor and legatee, and S. L. Mestrezat, Esq., appearing for Mary E. Bowie, legatee ; whereupon the said executor by his attorney offered in evidence the will of deceased, dated September 16,1867, probated April 11, 1889, also the account of said executor, at No. 40, December court, 1890, showing a balance in his hands of the corpus of the estate of 156,474.05, the revenues-from the estate having been distributed by accountant himself in his said account. The auditor was directed by agreement of counsel herewith filed to treat all the exceptions as withdrawn except the fifth and last exception, and which is to the effect that \u2018 the accountant should have paid to exceptant the principal of two-fifths of decedent\u2019s estate, less debts, expenses of administration and legacy to Mrs. King.\u2019 This exception involves the construction of the last will and testament of Eleazer Robinson, and preparatory to this investigation the parties agree upon and admit the following facts, to wit: That Elizabeth Robinson, the wife of Eleazer, died during the lifetime of her said husband, and the testator himself afterwards died on the 29th day of March, 1889, leaving to survive him three children mentioned in his will, viz.: Emma, intermarried with Cortland Kiijg, William L. Robinson, and Mary E., intermarried with Dr. A. P. Bowie. That William L. and Mary E., while of tender- age at the time of the execution of said will, were of lawful age, and both married at the time of testator\u2019s decease. With these facts before us, we proceed to examine said will. The testator in his said will, after making a bequest to his daughter Emma (who has been paid) and giving the balance of his estate to his wife, Elizabeth, during her natural life, provides as follows: \u2018 After rne death of my said wife, I direct my executors hereinafter named to have an appraisement made of my whole estate, and I give, devise and bequeath unto my son William L., upon his arriving at the age of twenty-one years, the three-fifths of my estate, and to my daughter, Mary E., I direct my executors to pay her the interest arising from the two-fifths of my estate during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>her natural life, and at her death the principal, being the twor fifths of my estate, is to be equally divided between her children share and share alike, but if my said daughter, Mary E.; should die without issue, then the said interest hereby devised to her shall revert to my estate.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-4\">\u201c In the last paragraph of the will he provides further that, \u2018 If either of my said children should die without issue, then their share of my estate shall revert to my estate, and the surviving child shall take the share of the deceased one, the interest or right in, or to such share shall be the same as the three-fifths and two-fifths heretofore devised; if to my son, then absolutely; if to my said daughter, Mary E., then the interest for life, then the principal to her children, but in no event is any of it to go to my daughter, Emma.\u2019 The testator having disposed of his personal property along with his real estate without distinction, the whole will be treated agreeably to the rules concerning the disposal and distribution of real estate: Jarman on Wills, vol. 3, page 297; Mickley\u2019s Appeal, 92 Pa. 514; 141; Pa. 350.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-6\">\u201c The testator having survived his wife, Elizabeth, we think there can be no doubt but that William L. Robinson took, upon the death of the testator, a fee simple estate in the said three-fifths of the property devised to him under the paragraph of the will first above quoted. The only question is, how was the-absolute estate thus granted in the first instance affected by the latter paragraph above quoted? In a leading case on this subject, (Mickley\u2019s Appeal, 92 Pa. 514,) Justice Sharswood says-: \u2018 If a bequest be made to a person absolute in the first instance, and it is provided that in the event of death, or death without issue, another legatee or legatees shall be substituted to the share or legacy thus given, it shall be construed to mean death; or death without issue, before the testator. The first taker is always the first object of the testator\u2019s bounty, and his absolute estate is not to be cut down to an estate for life, or what is practically the same thing, to be subjected to an executory gift over upon the occurrence of the contingency of death or death without issue, at any future period within the rule against perpetuities without clear evidence of such an intent:\u2019 See also Caldwell v. Skilton, 13 Pa. 152; Stevenson v. Fox, 125 Pa. 568; McCormick v. McElligott, 127 Pa., 230; King v. Frick, 135 Pa., 575.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>\u201c The evidence of the testator\u2019s intention, as gathered from the whole will, tends greatly towards giving William L. a fee simple estate rather than otherwise. For instance, he provides for the payment to William L., upon his arrival at the age of twenty-one years, before the death of his mother, \u2018 such of his interest in my estate as his said mother may direct,\u2019 and the paragraph last before quoted provides that should William L. acquire any property by way of remainder, upon the death of his sister, Mary E., that it should go to him \u2018 absolutely.\u2019 Thus the testator clearly contemplates the giving of at least parts of his estate to William L. absolutely. We are of the opinion that the testator\u2019s words, \u2018 die without issue,\u2019 in the ease of William L., relate to and provide only for the case of his death during the lifetime of the testator, the contemplated life tenant, Elizabeth, having previously died; which doctrine, of course, under the facts here, gives William L. a fee simple estate. Even were it held that the words, \u2018 die without issue,\u2019 relate to death at any time within or beyond the life of the testator, we can see no practical difference in the case of William, for in that view of the matter the effect would be to give the said property to William L. and to- his \u2018 issue;\u2019 that is, to the \u2018 heirs of his body,\u2019 which under the rule in Shelley\u2019s case would clearly create an estate tail, which under our act of April 27, 1855, becomes a fee simple estate. Nor would the reversion to testator\u2019s estate or executory devise or remainder over to Mary E. in case of her surviving, in any way prevent William L. from thus taking a fee simple estate, as the said provisions are not at all inconsistent with a fee tail estate. In Taylor v. Taylor, 63 Pa., p. 485, Justice Sharswood says: \u2018 An estate tail may no doubt be subject to an executory devise over on some condition or event to take effect in abridgment or derogation of it, though such an executory devise can be destroyed by a common recovery suffered by the tenant in tail, which enlarges his estate into a fee and excludes all subsequent limitation, whether in remainder or by the way of springing use or executory devise.\u2019 From either standpoint, therefore, it will be seen that William L. Robinson took a fee simple estate in the property devised to him by his father, and that his share of the funds in the hands of the executor should be distributed to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>\u201c We next proceed to ascertain the character of the estate acquired by Mary E. Bowie. In paragraph of will first above quoted, testator says : \u2018 And to my daughter, Mary E., I direct my executors to pay her the interest arising from the two-fifths of my estate during her natural life, and at her death the principal, being two-fifths of my estate, is to be equally divided between her children share and share alike.\u2019 There can be no doubt, we think, of the fact that at least a life estate is therein devised to said Mary E., by implication, even if nothing further was said in the will on this point. \u2018 A devise of the rents, issues and profits of land is a devise of the land for so long as the rents, etc., are given:\u2019 France\u2019s Estate, 75 Pa., 220; Jar-man, vol. 2, 112; 63 Pa. 170. The testator evidently believing that he had substantially devised the said two-fifths of his estate to Mary E. at least for life,'continues: \u2018but if my daughter, Mary E., should die without leaving issue, then the said interest hereby devised to her shall revert to my estate.\u2019 Thus using the word interest in the last instance to cover much more than the mere income. The serious question here is not whether something less than a life, or freehold estate, but whether something greater than a life estate was not thus devised. A life estate does not necessarily preclude the existence of an estate tail, as the latter includes the former, and only is it necessary to use apt words of limitation in connection with the former to raise it to the importance of an estate tail. The facts and provisions in this case are so similar to the case of Haldeman v. Haldeman, 40 Pa., 29, that the auditor relies greatly upon the opinion of the court in that case, and takes the privilege of quoting pretty freely from it. Our testator here, as in that case, provides that in the event of the death of the said Mary E., the said two-fifths of his estate to go to her \u2018 children, share and share alike.\u2019 There was no devise over, here, in case Mary left children, but the latter were to take absolutely. Had the testator stopped here, there would have been no doubt but that the word \u2018 children \u2019 would be properly construed a word of purchase according to its ordinary legal signification, and a life estate thereby only granted to Mary, with the remainder to her \u2018 children \u2019 living at the time of her death, if she left any such, if not then to lapse. In such a case should Mary leave no \u2018 children, \u2019 but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>grandchildren, the devise must fail, as the latter would not iill the requirement of the word \u2018 children \u2019 used in its ordinary or restricted sense as before indicated, and thus we think the real intention of the testator as gathered from the whole will would be frustrated: Haldeman case; also Castner\u2019s Appeal, 88 Pa. 491. We have, however, additional light from the will itself as to the sense in which he used the word \u2018 children,\u2019 viz.: \u2018But if my said daughter, Mary E., should die without issue, then the said interest hereby devised to her shall revert to my estate.\u2019 Under this clause the said interest would not revert should Mary \u2018leave issue.\u2019 Does the word \u2018issue\u2019 here mean such issue, that is, \u2018children,\u2019 or does the word \u2018children\u2019 mean \u2018 issue,\u2019 that is, \u2018 heirs of the body ? \u2019 The latter sense enlarges the class of persons who should take at the death of Mary to include her descendants, and thereby we think more fully expresses what the testator had in his mind. Justice Strong, in the Haldeman case, said: \u2018 Whenever, therefore, in the devise of a remainder to the child or children of the first taker, it is thus made clearly to appear that those words are used in the sense of \u201c issue \u201d or \u201c heirs of the body,\u201d they are to be treated as describing lineal succession to an entail. Cases are numerous of devises to one for life or for life only, with remainder to his \u201c son \u201d or \u201c first son,\u201d or \u201c eldest son,\u201d in the singular number, (all properly words of purchase,) with a devise over in default of issue of the first taker, in which he has been held to take an estate tail, in order to let in other sons, who, without such a construction would have been excluded. The estate tail has been implied from the devise over, and the word \u201c son \u201d or \u201c eldest son,\u201d has been elevated into a generic term, embracing the whole line of male lineal succession, and therefore a word of limitation.\u2019 \u2018 For similar reasons limitations of a remainder to an unborn child or son of the first taker have been held evincive of an intention to use the word \u201cson \u201d or \u201cchild \u201d in the sense of \u201cheir of the body.\u2019\u201d The principles thus set forth are easily applicable to this case, and we may say here, as was said in that case, that our testator employed the words \u2018 children \u2019 and \u2018 issue \u2019 indiscriminately, and both of them as meaning an entire line of lineal descent. \u2018 The intent that the devise should not lapse while issue of the daughter remains, is evident.\u2019 In Carroll v. Burns, 108 Pa., 386, it was said that \u2018the rule is un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>questioned that prima facie the word \u201cissue\u201d means \u201cheirsof the body,\u201d and will be construed as a word of limitation, unless there be explanatory words showing it was used in a restricted sense.\u201d In Stone v. McMullen, 10 W. N. C., 541, it was held that \u2018the words \u201c die without legitimate issue,\u201d must have their legal effect to create an estate tail in the absence of an unequivocal intent on the part of the testator, that thej^ shall not be construed in their technical sense : \u2019 See also Reinoehl v. Shirk, 119 Pa., 108. That the word \u2018 issue \u2019 by our testator was not used accidentally, or without intending to employ it with all that it means, it will be seen that still further anxious to limit the respective interest to William and Mary and their respective line of descendants or issue, if they should have such, he again, with much deliberation, makes it the leading part of a new paragraph, wherein he provides as follows: \u2018 If either of my said children should die without issue, then their share of my estate shall revert to my estate.\u2019 Thus we have the word \u2018 issue \u2019 again employed, and as before, in a most important place in the will. By it the testator reinforces what he had before evidently desired to express by the word \u2018 issue,\u2019 that is, \u2018 heirs of the body,\u2019 and thereby his intention becomes more emphatic and certain, and as said in the Haldeman case, \u2018 shows an intent to express hereditable succession.\u2019 Nor do we think it at all sufficient to overthrow this view of the case that the testator afterwards, in the latter part of the said paragraph, in a matter very remote, the providing for a contingency that has since passed, and which, in the first instance, was of much less importance, used the word \u2018 children,\u2019 but not, however, in relation to this above named devise of the two-fifths to Mary. In said paragraph, immediately following that word, \u2018 children,\u2019 which we believe he recklessly used, there is evidence of a strong intent on the part of the testator that the interest he had devised should go to the said Mary E. and William L. respectively, and to their descendants or issue, he says, \u2018 but in no event is any of it to go to my daughter Emma.\u2019 Should William die without issue before Mary, an occurrence which the testator was bound to know might happen, and should then Mary die leaving issue but not children, to whom would this two-fifths go ? The testator says not to Emma, the only other child, and shall we make him say not to Mary\u2019s is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>sue ? We think not. He plainly excludes the only other heir that could inherit in such a case, and looks no farther than to Mary and her issue; but to her and her entire line of issue he does look, from all that is contained in the will taken as a whole.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-5\">\u201c Expressions like these, \u2018 if he die before he has any issue,\u2019 or \u2018 on failure of issue,\u2019 or \u2018 for want of issue,\u2019 or \u2018 without issue,\u2019 have been adjudged again and again to impart a general and indefinite failure of issue, and an estate tail is defined. A limitation over by way of executory devise on such failure of issue, is void as being too remote: Vaughan v. Dickes, 20 Pa., 514; Stone v. McMullen, 10 W. N. C., 541, also 119 Pa., 108; Price v. Taylor, 28 Pa., 107. In this last named case it was remarked by Justice Lowrie as indicating the policy of the law, or rather the dispositions of courts, that \u2018 au estate tail, that is, an estate that is to pass by lineal descent according to the laws and customs of the country, is the very form of .transmission of property to which persons are naturally most favorable; and therefore we naturally incline to expect this law of descent to be provided for, when the devisor thinks of anything beyond the laws of descent of a fee simple.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-6\">\u201cFor the reason above set forth we think, in construing this will as a whole, that the said Mary E. Bowie thereby takes an estate tail in the said two-fifths of the said testator\u2019s estate, and which becomes a fee simple estate therein, under our act of assembly of April 27, 1855, and we do further find that the said Mary E. is entitled to receive her said share, or two-fifths, regardless of any suggested trust in the will, as such trust becomes useless in a fee simple, where it might be of value in an estate tail or for life; it would be a restraint placed upon alienation inimical to the fee simple, and therefore void. Reifsnyder v. Hunter, 19 Pa., 41; Walker v. Vincent, 19 Pa., 369. The two-fifths of the balance in hands of-the executor should therefore be paid by him to Mary E. Bowie, legatee under the will.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-7\">Exceptions to the auditor\u2019s finding that Mary E.

Robinson, the executor therein named.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-5\">\u201c By his will the testator provides as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-6\">\u201c \u2018 After the death of my said wife, I direct my executors hereinafter named, to have an appraisement made of my whole estate, and I give, devise and bequeath unto my son, William L., upon his arrival at the age of twenty-one years, the three-fifths of my estate, and to my daughter, Mary E., I direct my executors to pay her the interest arising from the two-fifths of my estate during her natural life, and at her death the principal, being the two-fifths of my estate, is to be equally divided between her children, share and share alike; but if my said daughter, Mary E., should die without leaving issue, then the said interest hereby devised to her shall revert to my estate.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-7\">\u201c The testator further provides:\u2014\u2018 If either of my said children should die without issue, then their share of my estate shall revert to my estate, and the surviving child shall take the share of the deceased one, the interest or right in or to such share shall be the same as the three-fifths and two-fifths heretofore devised, if to my son, then absolutely; if to my daughter, Mary E., then the interest for life, the principal to her children.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AyT\">\u201cThe auditor has found that under this will William L. Robinson took an estate in fee simple, and in so finding we think he is abundantly sustained by the authorities. We need only refer to Mickley\u2019s Appeal, 92 Pa. 514, where it was held that if a bequest be made to a person absolute in the first instance, and it is provided that in the event of death, or death without issue, another legatee or legatees shall be substituted to the share or legacy there given, it shall be construed to mean death or death without issue, before the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-8\">\u201c The first taker is always the first object of the testator\u2019s bounty, and his absolute estate is not to be cut down to an estate for life without clear evidence of such intent. There can be no doubt that the finding of the auditor as to the share or interest of William L. Robinson is correct: Stevenson v. Fox, 125 Pa. 568.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>\u201c The auditor has also found that under this will Mary E. Bowie takes an estate tail in the two-fifths of testator\u2019s estate, which becomes a fee simple estate therein under our act of assembly of April 27, 1855, and in so finding we think he is sustained by the authorites.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-5\">\u201c \u2018 Where the intendment of a will is doubtful, the law leans in favor of an absolute estate ; of the primary, rather than the secondary intent; of the first taker as the primary object of the testator\u2019s bounty; and of a distribution conformable to the general rul\u00e9s of inheritance: \u2019 Fitzwater\u2019s Appeal, 94 Pa. 141.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-6\">\u201cThe testator evidently believed that he had devised the two-fifths of his estate to his daughter, Mary E., at least for life, for in the same connection he provides: \u2018If my daughter, Mary E., should die without issue, then the said interest hereby devised to her shall revert to my estate.\u2019 By the word interest, he certainly did not mean the income of the two-fifths, for that was to be paid to. the said Mary E. during her life. We think the testator used the word interest in this connection as meaning much more than income, otherwise the two-fifths itself would be undisposed of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-7\">\u201c Air estate for life with remainder to the issue of the first devisee, is an estate tail in law: Smith on Executory Interests, section 537.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-8\">\u201cWe agree with the auditor that the testator seems to have used the words child, children and issue meaning the same thing, and that he used them all as meaning heirs of the body and not as descriptive merely of individuals. For if by the word issue he meant child or children, instead of those words meaning issue in the sense of heirs of the body, the devise would lapse on the death of Mary E., without leaving a child, although she should leave a granddaughter. This was certainly not the testator\u2019s intention.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-9\">\u201c For the reasons given and so clearly expressed by the auditor, and in which he is fully sustained by the authorities he cites, we agree with him in his finding that under the will of her deceased father, Eleazer Robinson, Mary E. Bowie takes an estate tail in the two-fifths of the testator\u2019s estate, which becomes a fee simple estate therein under our act of assembly of April 27,1855.\u201d .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number><em>Errors assigned </em>were: Jn Robinson\u2019s Appeal, (1) tbe confirmation of the auditor\u2019s report; (2) holding that Mary E.
