M., of that day, at the office of the prothonotary of said court, for the trial of all matters in variance in the above suit between the parties.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-4\">Subsequently the attorney for plaintiff and the attorneys for defendant signed the following :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-5\">\u201c Rule to refer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-6\">\u201cAnd now to-wit: Dec. 9, 1889, E. L. Whittelsey, Esq., chosen legal arbitrator, arbitration to be held Wednesday of the week commencing the third Monday of January, 1890, being the 27th, at 11 A. M.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-7\">The arbitrator\u2019s award was in favor of the plaintiff. Defendants appealed and plaintiff took this rule, which the court below made absolute in the following opinion by Gunnison, P. J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-8\">\u201c The award of the legal arbitrator was appealed from by the defendant, under the belief, which was undoubtedly common among the profession, that an appeal was authorized by law. Afterwards, it was decided by this court in Parel v. Roberts, No. 57 Nov. T., 1887, that the acts providing for legal arbitrations, so far as this county is concerned, were unconstitutional for the reason that they denied parties a right to a trial by jury, there being no provisions for an appeal from the award. Where the selection of a legal arbitrator is mutual, such action amounts to a voluntary submission by the parties, and, if not revoked before award is made, is irrevocable. The rights of the parties thereafter are determined by the common law rule applicable to arbitrations at common law, and not by the statute governing proceedings in compulsory arbitrations. There is no principle which provides for an appeal to the courts from the award of arbitrators chosen by the parties to whom their differences are voluntarily submitted, not under the provision of the compulsory arbitration act. Hence, the appeal must be stricken off, unless the plaintiff has waived her right to move to strike it off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>\u201c Counsel for defendants contend that she has waived the right, (1) by appearing and asking for a continuance when the case has been on the trial list; (2) by appearing afterwards before a commissioner and cross-examining a witness, whose depositions were taken to be read at the trial; and (3) by not taking advantage of her right to move to strike off until about nine months after the appeal was taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-4\">\u201c The authorities cited are, in effect, that, by doing any positive act, or suffering unreasonable delay, by which the opposite party is induced to incur the expense of preparing for trial, the right to ask for the dismissing of an appeal irregularly entered, may be lost; but in all cases cited, the appeals were provided for by law, the irregularity being in the manner or time of taking them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-5\">\u201c In this case the law provides for no appeal to this court, and, in my opinion, no act was done by the plaintiff which can give this court jurisdiction of the appeal; whether by her positive act, such as ruling the defendants to plead, or by going to trial, after the appeal, she would have waived her right to the benefit of the award in her favor, it is not necessary to decide; we simply decide here, that in this case there was nothing done which amounted to such a waiver.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the striking off of defendants\u2019 appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b284-7\"><em>T.
