In 1879, in each case, an affidavit of service of notice was filed, and a sci. fa. issued and returned made known by posting and advertising and n. h. as to defendant. In the first case judgment was entered in 1879, for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, a sci. fa. to revive issued in 1884 and returned n. h.; an alias sci. fa. issued June 16,1885, and returned made known to J. W. Kester, registered owner, and n. h. as to unknown, J. W. Kester, on June 19, 1885, being suggested as registered owner; judgment for want of an appearance was entered the same year; in 1890, a sci. fa. and alias sci. fa. to revive were issued and returned n. h., and judgment entered for want of an appearance. In the second case, judgment was entered, in 1882, for want of an appearance; and in 1887 a sci. fa. and alias sci. fa. to revive were issued and a like judgment entered. In 1891 the rules to strike off the claims were entered in both cases ; and also, a day or two after, an appearance for the defendants, not naming them. Both rules were discharged Oct. 11, 1891, and these appeals taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-9\">It was stated in the \u201c argument \u201d in the paper book of the appellant, in each case, that on the argument of the rule in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>court below, the defendant had filed, with the permission of the court, a certificate of the registry bureau, signed by John W. Frazier, registrar, certifying the lot in question to be \u201c registered in this department as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-5\">Former owner.

Campbell </em>Lancaster, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYW\">No notice was given to the registered owner; nor was the sci. fa. served on him as a summons, as required by the act of March 29, 1867. These cases are within the purview of the act: Simmons v. Kern, 92 Pa. 455; Gans v. The City, 102 Pa. 97; and Phila. v. Dungan, 124 Pa. 52, which decides that the presumption is that there was a registered owner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-10\">The certificate of the registry bureau is made evidence by the act of March 14,1865.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-11\">Under the act of May 20, 1891, this court can amend, modify or reverse the decree in a case like this, and can make the certificate of the registry bureau a part of the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-12\">A sheriff\u2019s sale under these judgments and claims would confer no title: Simmons v. Kern, supra ; and a verdict could never be recovered upon trial: Gans v. City, supra. Besides, if the sci. fas. were improperly served, the lien is also lost by lapse of time.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b47-13\"><em>P. E.
