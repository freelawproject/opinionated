Warren Co., March T., 1891, No. 52, on verdict for plaintiffs, Geo. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>M.

J., it appeared that defendants claimed title under an oil lease of which plaintiffs had notice when they purchased. If oil was found within six months from its date, the lease was to \u201c continue in force so long as oil shall be found, whether for fifteen years, more or less.\u201d The date of the lease was January 30,1886. The consideration was $50.00, and one eighth of the oil produced. The first well was completed within six months from the execution of the lease and oil obtained. It was admitted that nothing was done toward the drilling of any well subsequent to the first.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 point, affirmed, was: \u201c That under all the evidence the verdict should be for the plaintiffs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-6\">Defendants\u2019 4th point, refused, was: \u201c Under all the evidence in the case the verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-7\">The court directed a verdict for the plaintiffs for the land described in the writ, together with six cents damages and costs; which verdict was rendered by the jury and judgment entered thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-8\">The other material facts appear in the following portion of the charge of the court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-9\">[\u201c I will again read the paragraph in the lease wherein those words occur: \u2018 The party of the second part covenant to commence operations for said mining purposes so as to complete the first well within six months from the execution of this lease, or thereafter within sixty days remove all machinery and buildings for the business erected and used and this lease be declared null and void unless further prosecuted after the first well drilled.\u2019 Unless what was further prosecuted? It does not mean, we think, unless the first well was further prosecuted, nor is it probable that it meant unless the lease was further prosecuted, but that which they were to commence and operate were operations for said mining purposes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-10\">\u201c And, therefore, we would read this clause or paragraph, that the party of the second part covenant to commence operations for said mining purposes so as to complete the first well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>within six months from the execution of this lease, or thereafter within sixty days remove all machinery and buildings for the business erected and used, and this lease be declared null and void unless operations for said mining purposes be further prosecuted after the first well drilled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-4\">\u201c Understanding that, then, to be the meaning of this lease, and it being a conceded fact that there were no operations for mining purposes prosecuted upon that land after the first well was drilled, in the opinion of the court, the lease was null and void.] [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-5\">[\u201cWe would say to you, however, that there is a question as to within what time the defendants or the lessee, Harrison Wade, and those claiming under him, were to prosecute these operations for mining purposes ? And that would be within a reasonable time. If the time which elapsed between the time of the making of the lease and the completing of the first well were not so long a time as it has been, it might be a question for the jury to say whether a reasonable time has elapsed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-6\">\u201c But, in view of the nature of oil, in view of the extent of territory that is herein embraced, and in view of the fact that that time is from the summer of 1886, up until the present time, or up until the time when suit was brought, about a year ago, there is not room, we think, for a question as to the fact that more than a reasonable time has elapsed, and, therefore, we say that in view of the undisputed facts in this case, and upon the construction we give to this clause in the lease, the lease is null and void, and therefore the defence fails. That being true, it is our duty to say to you further, that your verdict must be in favor of the plaintiffs for the land described in the writ, together with six cents damages and costs.\u201d] [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-7\"><em>JErrors assigned </em>were (1) affirming plaintiffs\u2019 point; (2) refusing defendants\u2019 fourth point; (3, 4) the portions of the charge as above in brackets ; quoting points and charge.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b312-8\"><em>JD.
