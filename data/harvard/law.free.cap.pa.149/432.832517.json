The bridge was 34 feet wide and had 3 tracks on it. The train was on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>the middle track. Most of the passengers got out on the platform side of the train, but Robert Pastoris got off on the other side. The space between the track on which the train was and the track on the side on which Robert Pastoris got off was 6 feet. The track on this side was 5 feet wide and the distance between this track and the edge of the bridge was 3 feet. There was no railing on the bridge, but it was all planked over. Robert Pastoris was found in the creek a few minutes after the train stopped. He was considerably under the influence of liquor at the time the train stopped at the station. He was very much injured by his fall and died the next day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-3\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel offered to- prove that another person, after the time of this accident, in alighting from a train at the same station, fell off the side of the bridge on the opposite side from that where Pastoris fell over.
