Hart, from judgment of C. P. No. 1, Phila. Co., Sept. T., 1888, No. 602, on verdict for plaintiff, William Fisher.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Anb\">Before Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, Ceben, Claek, Williams, McCollum and Mitchell, JJ.</judges>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-13\">Trespass for personal injuries.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-14\">On the trial the following facts appeared: Plaintiff, a minor, was in the employ of defendant learning the trade of bricklaying. On Aug. 7,1888, the plaintiff was working on a building which was being erected by defendant. It became necessary to raise the scaffold. In so doing, a ledger board (the board which is nailed to the uprights and acts as the support of the putlocks upon which the floor of the scaffold rests) was insufficiently nailed to all the uprights, except the westernmost one. In consequence, the scaffold fell while plaintiff was working <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>upon-it where he had. been directed to <em>go </em>by defendant. For the injury thus sustained this action was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-5\">There was no question but that the defendant was personally present at the time the scaffold was raised and directed the work. One of the witnesses testified that, after Gordon, the workman who nailed the ledger board, had put one nail in it, the defendant ordered him to come to another place on the scaffold and nail there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-6\">After the preliminary questions given in the opinion, counsel for plaintiff was, under objection, allowed to put the following question to one of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses: \u201c Did not you say to me yesterday afternoon as follows: \u2018 I did not superintend the construction of the building of this scaffold; John D. Hart did that himself. When he was around he didn\u2019t allow anybody to superintend anything. He did all that himself. I only saw Gordon nail on this ledger board that fell. He nailed one nail in one end of the board. This was all that I saw. Hart was standing there looking at him also.\u2019 \u201d [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-7\">Defendant\u2019s sixth point, refused, is quoted in the opinion of the Supreme Court. [2] His fifth point, also refused, was: \u201c Under all the evidence in this case, the verdict of the jury should be for the defendant.\u201d [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-8\">The court charged in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-9\">\u201c The contention between counsel here appears to be tlaat there was negligence on part of defendant. And on defendant\u2019s part it is claimed that one of his employees was negligent, and defendant seeks to have you apply the principle of law that where the accident is a result of the negligence of a co-employee there is no right to recover. There is such a principle of law, and if the facts warrant the application of it the defendant is absolved from responsibility, and plaintiffs cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AR6\">********</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-10\">\u201c If this accident was caused by the improper construction of this scaffolding, and you believe it was constructed under the supervision and direction of defendant, and such faulty construction was the result of defendant\u2019s order, or want of proper care, he is liable to plaintiff, if plaintiff is not guilty of contributory negligence; if the accident was caused by the improper construction of the scaffold erected by-a fellow employee, simply under orders to erect a scaffold, and if the negligence was un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>known to defendant, your verdict should be for defendant, if he gave directions which would have secured a safe scaffold if carried out.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-5\">The verdict was for the plaintiff in the sum of $7,500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-6\"><em>Errors </em>assigned, were (1) refusal to sustain objection to above question, quoting it; (2, 3) refusal of defendant\u2019s 6th and 5th points, quoting them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b258-7\"><em>John Gr. </em>Johnson, with him &lt;7. <em>Davis </em>and <em>3. </em>27. <em>Bunner, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtAr\">The question covered by the first assignment of error was inadmissible. The witness had shown no bias and had made no statement injurious to the plaintiff. He had simply announced his inability to remember a certain fact. This did not justify the question: Sterns v. Merchants\u2019 Bank, 53 Pa. 496.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-8\">The defendant\u2019s sixth point should have been affirmed. That it was not read to the jury, and that the general charge, to a certain extent, covered the matter, does not cure the error: People\u2019s S. Bank v. Denig, 131 Pa. 249.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-9\">This case should be reversed without a new venire. There was a faint effort to prove that Hart had called Gordon to nail one of the ends of the ledger. It did not appear, however, that Hart knew when he called that the other end had not been completed in the nailing, nor that he insisted upon Gordon coming before such nailing was completed, nor that there was not time given to Gordon afterwards to finish the nailing. The whole trouble came from Gordon\u2019s negligence: Wood\u2019s Mas. &amp; Serv. \u00a7\u00a7 431, 434; Brown v. Accrington Cotton Co., 3 H. &amp; C. 511; Crawford v. Stewart, 19 W. N. C. 48.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-10\">At best work upon scaffolds is hazardous: Armour v. Hahn, 111 U.

Justice Stebbett,</author>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The subject of complaint in the first specification is the admission of the leading question, therein recited, that was put by the plaintiff to his own witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">As a general rule neither party has a right to treat his own witness as hostile, and proceed either to cross-examine him or to call other witnesses to contradict him, without first showing sufficient cause for so doing. The rule and' recognized exceptions thereto were fully considered by Mr. Justice Thompson, in Stearns y. Merchants\u2019 Bank, 53 Pa. 496 ; and there appears to be nothing in what is said there to justify the action of the court below in this case. The only ground laid by the plaintiff for proposing to cross-examine his own witness was the answers of the latter to the following questions : \u201c Q. Did John D. Hart superintend the construction of this scaffold? A. I don\u2019t remember. Q. Did you not tell me so yesterday ? A. I don\u2019t remember.\u201d The witness had not testified to anything prejudicial to the plaintiff, nor does it appear that he had manifested any bias. Without any further effort to refresh his memory than is indicated in the foregoing questions, the plaintiff was permitted to treat him as an adverse witness, and to propound, by way of cross-examination, the leading question complained of. The result of this was to put in the mouth of the witness the very allegations of fact which the plaintiff wished him to verify by an affirmative answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">While in such matters of practice the trial judge must necessarily be invested with large discretion, we think that no sufficient ground was laid for the admission of the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">Six points for charge were presented by the defendant, the first three of which were read and affirmed. The remaining three, without being read, were refused. In the 6th point, the learned judge was requested to charge: \u201c If the jury find from all the evidence in the case that the accident is solely attributable to the negligence of Gordon in neglecting to nail the ledger of the scaffold, plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">This point was warranted by the evidence, and involved a question of fact that was proper for the consideration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>jury. The alleged fact of which it is predicated, if it had been submitted to and found by them in favor of defendant, would have precluded a verdict for plaintiff. The refusal of the court to affirm the point was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">There was no error in refusing to withdraw the case from the jury by directing a verdict for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">It follows that the first and second specifications are sustained and the third is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Judgment reversed, and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
