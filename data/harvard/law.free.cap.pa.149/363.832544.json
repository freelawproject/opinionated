George Bullock.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-5\">Plaintiff testified that the second note was \u201c a part renewal \u201d of the first. The second note at maturity was renewed by a third note dated June 28, 1888, for $22,000 at one year, Bullock paying the interest in advance. The first and second notes had been surrendered to Bullock, and on the first note the plaintiff had indorsed the following :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-6\">\u201c The three hundred shares of Conshohocken Worsted Mills within named placed with note dated June 29th, 1887, one year after date for twenty-two thousand dollars ($22,000).\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-7\">Bullock died insolvent before the dividends were demanded by plaintiff. In rebuttal plaintiff testified, under objection, as a reason for his not going for his dividends, that Bullock, who was president and treasurer of- the company, had told him \u201c there was no dividends made.\u201d [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-8\">The court charged in part as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-9\">\u201c It seems that Augustus Boyd was the owner of three hundred shares of stock of the defendant company. A certificate was given to him by the company, and sometime afterwards this stock was sold to George Bullock, and Mr. Boyd transferred the stock upon the books of the company to Mr. Bullock.. Mr. Bullock, it seems upon the evidence, did not pay for the stock, and it seems that he was also indebted to Mr. Boyd upon some other transaction; at least, a note for $40,000 was given by Mr. Bullock to Mr. Boyd, the plaintiff, and to secure the payment of that note the three hundred shares of stock were re-assigned by Mr. Bullock to Mr. Boyd. They were to be as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>collateral security to secure the payment of these $40,000. Therefore, the stock stood upon the books of the company as the stock of A\u00fagustus Boyd. He was entitled to the dividends of that stock. The registry of the stock is the evidence which the company has in the division of the dividends that are declared and the parties to whom they are payable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-3\">\u201c Therefore, if the company paid these dividends to any other person than the man whose name stands upon the books of the company as entitled to them, it is due that they should give some satisfactory explanation why they paid them to such other person rather than to the man who apparently is entitled to those dividends.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-4\">\u201c It is not claimed that the plaintiff gave any direct authority to anyone to pay these dividends to any other than himself. In fact, he gave no directions directly, so far as there is anything in this evidence. It seems, however, that the company saw fit to pay them to George Bullock. Had it a right to make the payments to Mr. Bullock, and does such payment protect it in this suit for the dividends ? As I said, the company had no right to pay to anyone but Mr. Boyd, unless they can give some reason satisfactory to relieve them from the payment to Mr. Boyd. There is no evidence here that Mr. Boyd gave any directions that those dividends should be paid to Mr. Bullock. It is true that he did not claim them for some time, but while that might be some evidence to indicate to your minds that he did not consider himself entitled to them, yet when he explains that he had no knowledge that such dividends were declared, and that he made application to the president and treasurer of the- company, and was informed that no dividends had been declared, it would seem, if you believe his testimony, a full explanation of his failure to make demand upon the company if he believed himself entitled to them. But the company does not claim that there was any direct authority from Mr. Boyd t\u00ae pay these dividends to Mr. Bullock, but it contends that the transactions between Mr. Bullock and Mr. Boyd were of such a character that by virtue of those transactions Mr. Boyd released or waived the claim he may have had upon those dividends, and that they became payable to Mr. Bullock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-5\">[\u201c Now this stock was assigned as security to pay $40,000. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Mr. Boyd, therefore, had a right to hold that stock as a protection until that note was paid. He was not only entitled to hold the stock, but he was entitled to the dividends that the stock might earn as an additional security for his debt. Has he done anything by which he has lost his right to those dividends ? It is said that he gave up the original $40,000 note and entered into a new transaction by taking a new note for $22,000 and obtaining a new pledge of this same stock, and that therefore he released by this new transaction any claim he may have had upon the dividends that were declared during the time that the $40,000 note was maturing. If this be true, then he has forfeited his claim to those dividends, and that is the main question of fact that you are to consider. Were these subsequent notes renewals of the original note of $40,000 ? If they were then those dividends belong to Mr. Boyd, the plaintiff, and he is entitled at your hands to a verdict for them, if you find that the last note was a renewal of the second and the second was a renewal of the first.] [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-4\">[\u201cYou have heard the evidence upon this point. There is nothing upon the face of the notes that directly indicates that the one was a renewal of the other, or that it was not. What was the intention of the parties at the time the second note was taken and at the time the third note was taken ? Because, if Mr. Boyd took this note as a renewal, and that was the intention of the parties when the second note was made, and again the intention of the parties when the third note was made, then he has not lost his right to those dividends.] [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-5\">[\u201c You have heard the testimony of the plaintiff as well as the other testimony in this case, and you may consider that in determining what was the intention of the parties when the second note was taken and when the third note was taken. If it was to take it as a renewal of the previous note, then, as I have already stated to you, these dividends must be found for the plaintiff in this case. He testifies that he took the third note as a renewal. Then you may take the other facts in the case. These subsequent notes were made at or about the time that the original note matured, and he testifies that he received on account of the first note $18,000, and took the renewal note for the balance of $22,000. Then the stock continued upon the books of the company during all this time in the name of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>plaintiff. These, with other facts, are for you to consider in determining whether it was the intention of the parties to consider these subsequent notes as renewals of the prior notes.] [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AN7\">[\u201cIf I have a note from your foreman for $500 for one jmar, and at the end of the year take a new note for a similar amount, it does not necessarily follow that because I turned back to him the original note that I took the second note as a payment of the debt. It depends upon our understanding. It would not be a payment of the original note unless it was so understood between us.\u201d] [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-3\">The plaintiff\u2019s first and fifth points, affirmed, were as follow: [\u201c 1. That if the jury are satisfied from the evidence that the $22,000 note of Bullock now held by the plaintiff is a renewal of part of the original note of $40,000 (for which the stock in the defendant corporation was transferred to the plaintiff as collateral security) then the plaintiff is entitled to all the dividends on said stock declared before suit brought, while the same stood in his name, and the receipt of any of them by George Bullock, unless he be shown to have been thereunto authorized by the plaintiff, would not bar the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover such dividends.\u201d] [9]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-4\">[\u201c 5. That if the jury shall be satisfied from the evidence that the $22,000 note now held by the plaintiff is a renewal of that much of the original $40,000 note which remained unpaid, and that the stock held as collateral remained during all the time in the name of the plaintiff, the right of the plaintiff to the dividends in suit was not affected by such renewal.\u201d] [10] Defendant\u2019s 1st, 3d, 4th, 5th and 6th points, all simply refused except the first, the answer to which is given, were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-5\">[\u201c 1. When Boyd, the plaintiff, accepted the three hundred shares of the Conshohocken Worsted Mill stock as collateral security for the payment of the $22,000 note of June 29,1887, in evidence, he took it as it stood at that date, without the previously declared dividends (now sued for), which had been paid to Bullock by the defendant company anterior to said June 29,1887. And therefore the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d <em>Answer: </em>\u201c This is true, unless the $22,000 note is a renewal for a part of the original debt and note.\u201d] [11]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-6\">[\u201c 3. The court is requested to charge as a question of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>that the $40,000 note and the $22,000 note upon their face show the agreement of the parties thereto, and which must rule this case, to wit: That the $40,000 note was surrendered and satisfied together with the collateral or pledge, and that a new and entirely different contract was made in the $22,000 note, and therefore the plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d] [12]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-4\">[\u201c 4. The fact that the contract of pledge in the $40,000 was not retained in the $22,000 note, as well as the material differ\u00e9nce in the form and substance of the two notes, is conclusive evidence that when the $40,000 note was surrendered to Bullock it was settled and paid and the three hundred shares of stock mentioned in it as collateral security was released and surrendered to Bullock, and therefore the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d] [13]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-5\">[\u201c 5. That upon the law and evidence in this case the verdict must be in favor of the defendant, and the court is requested to so direct the jury to find.\u201d] [14]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-6\">[\u201c 6. As' there was a payment of $18,000 by George Bullock on the $40,000 n\u00f3te, dated July 1,1882, when it came due, and there being no evidence that the dividends declared, being $5,700, were not part of this payment, the presumption is the plaintiff has received the dividends from Bullock and cannot recover in this case.\u201d] [15]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-7\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1-4) above rulings on evidence; (5-8) the portions of the charge as above in brackets, quoting charge; (9-15) the answers to the points as above, quoting points and anwers.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b394-8\"><em>John Q. </em>Johnson, with him <em>Jacob Grotwalts </em>and <em>James </em>Boyd, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiX\">Plaintiff accounted for his delay in not demanding a dividend declared in 1884 until 1890, by stating that he did not know before 1890 that any dividends had been declared. It was therefore proper to cross-examine him as to his opportunities for information, and he should have been compelled to answer the question in the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-9\">The plaintiff claimed the dividends as owner and testified that he told Moir that Bullock had no right to draw the dividends, as the stock had been in the name of plaintiff for years.

The attention of the jury should have been directed to the facts that the first note together with the contract of pledge had been surrendered; that the replacing of the collateral for the new note was indorsed on the surrendered first note ; that the terms of the second note were different and it was for a smaller amount; and that Bullock was dead and could not be heard.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b395-6\"><em>Charles Sunsicker </em>and <em>Joseph B. </em>Townsend, for appellee.\u2014\u25a0 The plaintiff was a competent witness.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-7\">His suit was not against Bullock, but a corporation of which Bullock had been president and treasurer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-8\">When defendant called plaintiff he made plaintiff a competent witness for all purposes: Act May 23,1887, \u00a7 7; Yeakel\u2019s Appeal, 137 Pa. 160.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-9\">As long as any part of the original debt remains and new notes are taken in renewal, the collateral remains as security: Shrewsbury Savings Institution\u2019s Ap., 94 Pa. 309.

When he was first called 'as a witness in his own behalf, his examination was confined to his demand on May 31, 1890, for the dividends, and this was more than a year after the death of Bullock. He was then called by the appellant, and compelled to testify, as if under cross-examination, to matters occurring in Bullock\u2019s lifetime, after which he was a competent witness for himself \u201c as to all relevant matters, whether or not these matters were touched upon in his cross-examination\u00a7 7, act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 160; Corson\u2019s Est., 137 Pa. 160. The 4th specification of error is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">We think the learned judge of the court below was clearly right in holding that the questions contained in the 1st, 2d and 3d specifications of error were not admissible. They were not relevant to the subject-matter of the examination in chief, and were evidently intended to introduce the appellant\u2019s defence under cover of a cross-examination. The only matter to which the witness had testified was his demand for the dividends on May 31, 1890, and this did not open the door to a cross-examination of him concerning transactions he had with Bullock many years before. If these transactions justified the company in refusing to pay the dividends on his demand, it was proper to show them as a part of its defence, but it could not introduce them in the manner proposed. In considering the remaining specifications, regard must be had to the material facts which are admitted by the parties or established by the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">It appears that on July 1, 1882, Boyd was the owner of 300 shares of the stock of the appellant company, and Bullock was indebted to him in the sum of $10,000. On that day Boyd sold and. transferred his stock to Bullock for $30,000, and received Bullock\u2019s note for $40,000 at five years, with interest payable quarterly. This note was for the price of the stock and the amount of Bullock\u2019s indebtedness to Boyd on other matters. As collateral to the note the stock was transferred by Bullock to Boyd, and a certificate therefor was issued to him and duly registered, so that from that time to the present Boyd has appeared on the books of the company as the owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>of the stock. From the dividends declared by the company, after this transaction and before the maturity of the note, the sum of $5,700 belonged to the stock so held by him, but was paid by the company to Bullock, without any authority from the legal holder of the stock to make such payment, or notice to him that a dividend had been declared. The uncontradieted testimony of Boyd is that he repeatedly spoke to Bullock on the subject of the dividends, and was always assured by him that the company had not declared any but that it was accumulating a fund as a working capital. It appears now that a dividend of five per cent was declared by the company on November 11,1884, one of six per cent on November 10, 1885, and one of eight per cent on November 9,1886, and that these were all paid to Bullock, at the time or soon after they were declared. It is conceded that the dividends belonged to Boyd, and that in an action by him against the company to recover them at any time prior to June 29,1887, the unauthorized payments to Bullock would not have been available as a defence. But it is claimed that by a transaction with Bullock on that day he relinquished his right to the dividends.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\">What was that transaction? A reduction of the debt to $22,000. by payment on account of it, a retention of the collateral security for it, a surrender of the old note, and an acceptance of a renewal note on one year\u2019s time for the balance of it. It is true that the new note conferred on the creditor additional power over the collateral, but this was in aid of the creditor in the conversion of the security, and did not in any sense impair it. It is clear from the testimony of Boyd that he did not understand that the transaction involved a surrender by him of $5,700 of the collateral security which he then held, and the only conclusion consistent with a belief in his veracity and Bullock\u2019s integrity is, that it was the mutual intention of the parties that Boyd should retain all the security he then had by virtue of the pledge of the stock in July, 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">It is contended that the claim of the appellant company respecting the nature and effect of this transaction is sustained by Fairbank v. Merchants\u2019 National Bank, 30 Ill. Ap. 28, decided by the Supreme Court of Illinois in October, 1889. In that case a husband deposited with the bank, on May 14, 1883, as collateral security for his own note and the note of a firm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>of which he was a member, 100 shares of his wife\u2019s stock in the Chicago City Railway Co. This stock had been previously pledged by him to the bank as security for his indebtedness to it, and, during the life of the first pledge, his wife received the dividends upon it. After her death the bank filed a bill in equity against her executor to compel her estate to account for and pay the dividends so received by her. The question was, whether the transaction of May 14, 1883, was a continuance of the pledge which was in force when she received the dividends or the creation of a new and distinct pledge. It was claimed by the bank that the note of May 14, 1883, was a renewal of the notes for which the stock was originally pledged, and by the estate that it was in satisfaction of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">The court, conceding that the intention of the parties must govern, found the fact to be as claimed by the estate. But the evidence in that case differed materially from the evidence in this. In that case it was the duty of the court to find the facts and ascertain the intention of the parties, whilst in this these matters were for the jury, and our examination of the evidence is for the purpose of determining whether it is sufficient to support the verdict. It is probable that in each case the facts were correctly found from the evidence in it. We are satisfied, from our examination of. the testimony in the case at bar, that the verdict was fully authorized by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The appellant company, with full knowledge that the dividends belonged to Boyd, who appeared on its books as the owner of the stock, and who, it is now admitted, was entitled to receive them, deliberately paid them to Bullock without the consent of or notice to the owner, and, whilst conceding the mispayment, seeks to evade its own just liability by setting up an alleged equity in Bullock\u2019s estate, arising from subsequent transactions between the pledgor and pledgee. It is a defence founded upon an unauthorized act, to which the company and Bullock were parties, and which was unknown to Boyd at the time of the transaction, in which it is claimed he surrendered, without knowing it, $5,700 of his collateral security. If it is technically admissible in this action, it is clear from the undisputed evidence that there is no substantial merit in it. A separate consideration of the second renewal is unnecessary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>because tbe condition existing after the first one was not changed by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\">The instructions to the jury were unobjectionable, and the remaining specifications of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">J udgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
