The trial court sentenced defendant to two years imprisonment in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict and he appeals from that judgment. He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s admission of evidence which he contends implicated him in other criminal activity and the refusal of his proffered lesser included offense jury instruction. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">The evidence disclosed that on June 9, 1990, Janice McDaniel (McDaniel) arrived at an apartment, then leased to her, and noticed a window \u201cbroken out.\u201d She and a friend entered the apartment and discovered the defendant in a bedroom. McDaniel and defendant had been acquainted for approximately eleven years and had resided together in the apartment for several weeks prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>to May 28, 1990, when defendant surrendered \u201cthe key\u201d to her and \u201cmoved out.\u201d To ensure that defendant \u201cwould remain out,\u201d McDaniel \u201cchanged the lock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Upon finding defendant again on the premises, McDaniel \u201cran out\u201d of the apartment and reported her situation to Officer Kenneth May (May) of the Fairfax County Police Department. May proceeded to the apartment and, as he approached, \u201cheard a lot of noise from inside . . . what [he] thought was breaking of items and glass items being thrown around.\u201d Using McDaniel\u2019s key, May entered the apartment, immediately located defendant sitting on a couch, and placed him under arrest. May and McDaniel described the apartment as \u201cin shambles\u201d and \u201cpretty ugly,\u201d with lamps, \u201cknickknack[s]\u201d and \u201ceverything\u201d broken and scattered about the rooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The officer recalled that defendant had \u201cseveral cuts\u201d and \u201cdried blood\u201d on his hands and arms, was dressed in a shirt \u201ctorn several times,\u201d \u201cbarefooted,\u201d \u201csweating ... a little bit out of breath\u201d and appeared \u201ctired.\u201d His \u201cfront pockets\u201d contained $173.30 in cash and coins, including a \u201clarge amount of $2 bills.\u201d McDaniel testified that approximately $170.00, much of it in $2 bills, was missing from the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Defendant was transported to a local police station and questioned by May. He told the officer that he had consumed \u201ca fifth of-Wild Turkey\u201d earlier that day, was \u201can alcoholic\u201d and had gone to the apartment to \u201ctalk to\u201d McDaniel and resolve any \u201canimosity\u201d between them. He admitted the \u201cbreak in,\u201d the damage to McDaniel\u2019s property and the theft of her money but attributed his conduct to anger, rather than any intent to commit larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Defendant neither testified nor offered any evidence in his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Defendant first complains that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence, over his objection, the written \u201cWARNING AND CONSENT\u201d form which he executed incidental to his statement given to Officer May. The preamble of the document recited that the officer was \u201cinvestigating the commission of the crime of [b]urglary two counts.\u201d Defendant contends that the words \u201c[bjurglary two counts\u201d revealed to the jury that he was also a suspect in another offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Before the form itself was received in evidence, Officer May read it to the jury, including the offending words, without objection. Defendant also failed to object when McDaniel remarked in her testimony that she \u201cfound out that another place had been broken into\u201d and to the prosecutor\u2019s caution to Officer May that he \u201cconfine [his testimony] please to the offense for which we are here.\u201d He now claims this evidence compounded the prejudicial effect of the exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">It is well established that evidence of other crimes of an accused is generally not proper in the trial of an unrelated offense. <em>Kirkpatrick v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 269, 272, 176 S.E.2d 802, 805 (1970); <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 313, 323-24, 369 S.E.2d 688, 694 (1988); <em>Sutphin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>1 Va. App. 241, 245, 337 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1985). The purpose of this rule is to prevent confusion of offenses, unfair surprise to the defendant and a suggestion of \u201ccriminal propensity,\u201d thus preserving the \u201cpresumption of innocence.\u201d <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 497, 502, 303 S.E.2d 890, 893 (1983); <em>Sutphin, </em>1 Va. App. at 245-46, 337 S.E.2d at 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">We have applied this proscription to \u201cother independent acts,\u201d <em>Sutphin, </em>1 Va. App. at 245, 337 S.E.2d at 899, \u201cother wrongdoing,\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 444, 448, 350 S.E.2d 673, 674-75 (1986), \u201cother crimes,\u201d <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 636, 638, 352 S.E.2d 536, 537 (1987), \u201cother criminal acts,\u201d <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>5 Va. App. 125, 127, 360 S.E.2d 876, 877 (1987), \u201cother offenses,\u201d <em>Foster, </em>6 Va. App. at 323, 369 S.E.2d at 694, and \u201cprior . . . bad acts,\u201d <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 135, 141, 379 S.E.2d 476, 479 (1989), of an accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Assuming, without deciding, that defendant\u2019s failure to object during trial to that evidence which he now finds prejudicial did not constitute a waiver of these issues, we find that the testimony and exhibit were not evidence of other crimes or wrongdoing contemplated by our case law. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18; <em>Harward </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>5 Va. App. 468, 473, 364 S.E.2d 511, 513 (1988). The vague references to another crime or investigation did not involve defendant in these matters or confuse the jury and were harmlessly irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Defendant next assigns error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant an instruction on Code \u00a7 18.2-121, a misdemeanor, as a lesser included offense of statutory burglary. Code \u00a7 18.2-121 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">It shall be unlawful for any person to enter the land, dwelling, outhouse or any other building of another for the purpose of damaging such property or any of the contents thereof or in any manner to interfere with the rights of the owner, user or occupant thereof to use such property free from interference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Defendant argues that his entry to the apartment, though unlawful, was without the coinciding larcenous intent necessary to sustain a conviction of statutory burglary. In support of this theory, defendant points to his recent past relationship with McDaniel and the premises, his condition, conduct and demeanor at the time of the offense and his statement to Officer May. He contends that this evidence was consistent with the misdemeanor, Code \u00a7 18.2-121, and required an instruction on that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The trial court, however, concluded that Code \u00a7 18.2-121 was not a \u201clesser included offense\u201d of statutory burglary, Code \u00a7 18.2-91, and refused defendant\u2019s instruction. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">While evidence of a lesser included offense requires an instruction on that crime, an accused is not entitled to an instruction \u201con an offense which is not a lesser included offense of the one with which he or she is charged.\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>11 Va. App. 649, 651, 400 S.E.2d 794, 795 (1991); <em>see also Barrett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 102, 107, 341 S.E.2d 190, 193 (1986). A lesser included offense must be \u201ccomposed entirely of elements that are also elements of the greater offense.\u201d <em>Kauffmann </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 400, 409, 382 S.E.2d 279, 283 (1989); <em>see also Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 757, 759, 240 S.E.2d 658, 660, <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 892 (1978). The lesser offense is therefore always \u201ccharged by implication\u201d as a part of the \u201cgreater offense\u201d and \u201cnecessarily proven by the proof of the greater offense.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>11 Va. App. at 652, 400 S.E.2d at 795. The elements of the crimes, their \u201cfundamental nature,\u201d are determinative, not \u201cthe particular facts of a specific case or the language of a given indictment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>A violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-121 is an offense against the \u201cland, dwelling, outhouse or any other building of another,\u201d its \u201ccontents\u201d or \u201cuse\u201d of \u201csuch property free from interference.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-121.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-91, statutory burglary, for which defendant was indicted and tried, relies upon Code \u00a7 18.2-90 to identify its prohibited \u201cacts.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-90 includes offenses against properties not specified in Code \u00a7 18.2-121, <em>i.e. </em>ships, vessels, river craft. Thus, a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-91 will not invariably and necessarily include a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-121 and the misdemeanor is, consequently, not a lesser included offense of either Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-90 or 18.2-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Under such circumstances, defendant was not entitled to the proffered lesser included offense instruction and the trial court correctly decided the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Duff, J., and Moon, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
