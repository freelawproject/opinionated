Campbell, appellant, seeks reversal of his conviction of forging a public record in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-168. He alleges that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that the crime had to be \u201cto the prejudice of another\u201d or to the gain of the defendant, and incorrectly defined \u201cintent to defraud\u201d in a jury instruction. We hold that \u201cto the prejudice of another\u201d is not an element of the offense of forging a public document. Because appellant did not object in the trial court for the same reasons as he does on appeal to the instruction regarding the definition of \u201cintent to defraud,\u201d he is barred from raising that issue on appeal. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>On appeal, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Higginbotham </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Appellant was a judge in the traffic division of the General District Court of the City of Norfolk. On March 20, 1989, Paul A. Sciortino, Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney for the City of Virginia Beach, was given a ticket by a Norfolk police officer for making an improper turn. Mr. Sciortino was involved in a political re-election campaign and, because of prior bad publicity from a traffic accident, he did not wish this charge to be a matter of public record.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Mr. Sciortino and his attorney, Andrew Ege, met with Judge Campbell in chambers. Judge Campbell had been Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney in the City of Norfolk and had known Sciortino many years. During the meeting, Mr. Ege jokingly suggested that the case be dismissed. Judge Campbell mentioned the usual disposition in such cases was a fine of fifty dollars and asked whether that was \u201cacceptable.\u201d Mr. Ege and Sciortino indicated that it would be acceptable. Mr. Ege then asked, \u201c[D]oes it have to appear on the docket, can we leave it off the docket?\u201d Judge Campbell said that \u201cit has to appear on the docket.\u201d Mr. Ege then asked, \u201c[W]ell, if his name is misspelled you don\u2019t have to correct it, do you?\u201d Judge Campbell responded, in what he testified was a \u201cjokingly or light-hearted manner,\u201d that \u201cthere are a lot of clerical errors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Immediately after the meeting in chambers, Mr. Sciortino paid the fifty dollar fine and costs to the clerk. A short time later, Judge Campbell went over to a deputy clerk who was seated at a computer terminal which maintained the official records of the general district court. He directed her to bring up the record of Mr. Sciortino\u2019s case and she did so. He then told her to \u201cscramble or jumble\u201d the letters of Mr. Sciortino\u2019s last name. The clerk changed the spelling from \u201cSciortino\u201d to \u201cSchortinoe\u201d and asked the judge, \u201c[H]ow is that?\u201d Judge Campbell then told her to switch the first and middle names and the clerk changed the entry from \u201cPaul A.\u201d to \u201cAnthony Paul.\u201d Judge Campbell remarked that Mr. Sciortino was \u201cscared to death about this accident because Paul thinks the newspaper is going to crucify him again, and they probably will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Judge Campbell testified that his instructions to change the name had been a joke and had been misinterpreted by the clerk as a direction to change the name on the computer records. The deputy clerk who made the change, as well as two other clerks who were present, testified that the instructions were not given in a joking manner but were stated in a manner consistent with an instruction to change the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Based upon this evidence, the jury returned a verdict of guilty to the charge of forgery and fixed the sentence at six years imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The appellant argues that his conviction cannot stand because the jury was not instructed to find that his conduct was \u201cto the prejudice of another\u2019s rights in property or some other tangible thing\u201d and because the jury was not instructed to find that Judge Campbell possessed a specific intent to cause \u201cactual, tangible loss\u201d to another or \u201cactual, tangible gain to himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The pertinent plain language of Code \u00a7 18.2-168 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-8\">If any person forge a public record ... he shall be guilty of a Class 4 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">Code \u00a7 18.2-168 is the first of seven statutes in the \u201cforgery\u201d article of the criminal code. Specific statutes address forging a public seal, Code \u00a7 18.2-169; forging coins, bank notes or currency, Code \u00a7 18.2-170; possession of instruments for forging a writing, Code \u00a7 18.2-171; falsifying transcripts and diplomas, Code \u00a7 18.2-172.1; and possession of forged coins or bank notes, Code \u00a7 18.2-173.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">Of all of the statutes, only Code \u00a7 18.2-172 provides the requirement that the writing be \u201cto the prejudice of another\u2019s right.\u201d It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-12\">If any person forge any writing, other than such as is mentioned in Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-168 and 18.2-170, to the prejudice of another\u2019s right ... he shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Appellant argues that forgery is and always has been a common law crime even in the case of public records. Code \u00a7 18.2-168, appellant alleges, does not abolish the common law but explicitly invokes it, as is clear both from its very terms and from long standing Virginia rules of statutory construction. Appellant concedes that the elements of forgery are as follows: (1) The false making or material alteration; (2) with intent to defraud; (3) of a writing; (4) which, if genuine, <em>might apparently be of legal efficacy, </em>or the foundation of legal liability, <em>or operate to the prejudice of another man's right. See, e.g., Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 171, 173, 313 S.E.2d 394, 395 (1984); <em>Bullock </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 558, 561, 138 S.E.2d 261, 263 (1964), cert. <em>denied, </em>382 U.S. 927 (1966); <em>Ramsey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va. App. 265, 269, 343 S.E.2d 465, 468 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Appellant argues that Virginia courts have consistently reiterated the requirement of harm or prejudice with regard to the crime of forgery. Appellant cites Virginia statutes as early as 1819 and the case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Linton, </em>4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 476 (1825), which held \u201cthe rule is, that the false making and forging any instrument, whereby another may be injured, constitutes the offense of forgery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478. However, the history of forgery of public documents makes clear that \u201cto the prejudice of another\u2019s right\u201d is not an element of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The forgery statute in effect in 1819 (Va. Code \u00a7 154 embodied forms of forgery including those now separated into different statues) reveals that the only type of forgery requiring proof of \u201cprejudice of another\u201d were those dealing with forgery of writings other than those specifically listed. Included among those types of forgeries specifically listed in Va. Code \u00a7 154 (1819), i.e. those which did not require proof of \u201cto the prejudice of another\u2019s right,\u201d were the forgeries of \u201cany record of any court, or public office, or any body politic or corporate.\u201d Thus, even in 1819 \u201cto the prejudice of another\u2019s right\u201d was not considered an element of the offense of forging public documents. The Supreme Court so held in <em>Murry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>32 Va. (5 Leigh) 782 (1835).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">Where a statute is unambiguous, the plain meaning is to be accepted without resort to the rules of interpretation. <em>Virginia Dep\u2019t of Labor </em>v. <em>Westmoreland Coal Co., </em>233 Va. 97, 99, 353 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>S.E.2d 758, 760 (1987). When the General Assembly uses different terms in the same act, it is presumed to mean different things. <em>Klarfeld </em>v. <em>Salsbury, </em>233 Va. 277, 284-85, 355 S.E.2d 319, 323 (1987). Thus, the intention may primarily be discerned from the language of the statute. \u201cIn construing a statute the court should seek to discover the intention of the legislature as ascertained from the act itself when read in the light of other statutes relating to the same subject matter.\u201d <em>Robert Bunts Eng\u2019g &amp; Equip. Co. </em>v. Palmer, 169 Va. 206, 209-10, 192 S.E. 789, 790-91 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">In considering the seven statutes dealing with the forgery, the language \u201cto the prejudice of another\u2019s right\u201d appears only in Code \u00a7 18.2-172 and that statute expressly excludes Code \u00a7 18.2-168, which criminalizes the forging of public documents. Therefore, we hold that the legislature did not intend that the \u201cprejudice to another\u2019s right\u201d requirement be in any other sections. It is readily apparent that violation of any of the forgery statutes other than Code \u00a7 18.2-172 is an offense against the public in general or, as in this case, the government itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Furthermore, Virginia case law has never associated the element of \u201cprejudice of another\u201d with the crime of forgery of public documents. <em>See </em>Va. Code \u00a7 154 (1819) (where a single statute embodied those crimes which now appear as seven statutes, Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-168 to 18.2-173). Code \u00a7 154 (1819) specifically set forth in plain and unambiguous language the definition of the various crimes. Under that statute, it was clear that the language \u201cto the prejudice of another\u2019s right\u201d was applied only to personal papers and not public documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">While the arrangement of the statutes regarding forgery in Virginia has varied, the scheme by which they are written has not. At all times the predicate of the crime of forgery has been some type of document or writing. Our statutes specifically list certain documents which are the subject of forgery. This list is not exclusive. There is a catch-all provision by which other writings not specifically listed may serve as a predicate to the crime of forgery. To serve this purpose, however, the writings must have the potential to operate \u201cto the prejudice of another\u2019s right.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-172; <em>see also Gordon v. Commonwealth, </em>100 Va. 825, 830, 41 S.E. 746, 748 (1902) (\u201cIt is only necessary, according to the foregoing definitions and authorities, that it was a writing of such apparent legal efficacy that the forgery of it might have been used to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>the prejudice of another\u2019s rights\u201d). This interpretation is borne out through case law as demonstrated by <em>Murry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>32 Va. (5 Leigh) 782 (1835).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">As to the objection, that the indictment does not charge the act to have been committed \u201cto the prejudice of another\u2019s right;\u201d we are of opinion, that these words relate, not to the different writings particularly mentioned in the previous part of the section, the counterfeiting of most of which had, long before, been made felony; but only to the words immediately connected with them; <em>\u201cany other writing, </em>to the prejudice of another\u2019s right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\"><em>Murry </em>supports the interpretation that the words \u201cto the prejudice of another\u2019s right\u201d do not apply to those types of forgeries specifically listed in the code but only to forgeries of \u201cother writings\u201d not specifically listed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-8\">[I]t is urged that the omission of the averment, \u201cto the prejudice of another\u2019s right,\u201d is a defect so material that it may be taken advantage of after verdict. ... It is said that these terms import a part of the description of the offence denounced in the statute; and that according to well settled rules of pleading they cannot be omitted. <em>I think these words are not intended to be descriptive of the offence, but of the writings of which forgery may be committed. </em>The first and third sections of the act specify various writings by name or general description, the forgery of which is made felony; and the fifth section [which parallels the language of Code \u00a7 18.2-172] makes the forgery of any writing, other than those mentioned in the first and third sections, \u201cto the prejudice of another\u2019s right,\u201d in like manner felony: thus discriminating between those writings which might affect the rights of others whereof forgery might be committed, and other writings, by which, whether false or genuine, the pecuniary interest of others could not be affected . . . That <em>these words, \"to the prejudice of another\u2019s right,\u201d refer to the writings contemplated by the statute, and not to the act of the party, </em>is, I think, sufficiently established by <em>Hendrick\u2019s Case, </em>5 Leigh 707, and <em>Murry\u2019s Case, </em>Ibid 720; in neither of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>which did the indictment contain that particular expression, though it is found in the act of 1819, on which those prosecutions were founded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-5\"><em>Powell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 52 </em>Va. (11 Gratt.) 822, 824-25 (1854) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">As the forgery of a public record is specifically listed as a writing or document which serves as a predicate to the offense of forgery, as codified in Code \u00a7 18.2-168, it need not be considered under the catch-all provision of Code \u00a7 18.2-172 which addresses \u201cother writings.\u201d The words \u201cto the prejudice of another\u2019s right\u201d are only employed in cases involving writings other than those specifically listed as predicates to the offense of forgery. In the context of \u201cother writings,\u201d the words \u201cto the prejudice of another\u2019s rights\u201d serve to distinguish \u201cbetween those writings which might affect the rights of others whereof forgery might be committed, and other writings, by which, whether false or genuine, the pecuniary interests of others could not be affected.\u201d <em>Powell, 52 </em>Va. (11 Gratt.) at 825.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Instruction No. Eight told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-9\">To act with the intent to defraud means to act with an evil intent, or with the specific intent to deceive or trick. It is sufficient if it was the intention of the defendant to frustrate the administration of a law or if his actions were prejudicial to, or a fraud upon, a commonwealth or a governmental unit or tended to impair a governmental function.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">The first sentence correctly defined \u201cintent to defraud.\u201d However, the second sentence, in part, equated actions conducted with the intent to defraud with actions that \u201ctended to impair a governmental function.\u201d The second sentence was in the disjunctive and, therefore, a fair reading would instruct that intent to defraud is proven if the appellant\u2019s actions, irrespective of intent, tended to impair a governmental function. This interpretation of the instruction constitutes an incorrect statement of the law because it rules out <em>mens rea </em>as an element of the offense. Clearly, <em>mens rea </em>remains an element of all forgery, even of public documents. <em>See Hanbury </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>203 Va. 182, 187, 122 S.E.2d 911, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>914-15 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">However, appellant did not raise this objection at trial. Appellant\u2019s sole objection to the granting of Instruction No. Eight stated: \u201cAgain, on the grounds that it fails to point out that intent to defraud means to deprive under the circumstances of this case one of tangible rights.\u201d Thus, the objection in the trial court was not the same objection as is raised on appeal. An objection and reason therefor must be raised at the time the instruction is granted; otherwise, it is barred from being raised on appeal, except as may be necessary to meet the ends of justice. Rule 5A:18. Furthermore, the reasons stated for the objection in the trial court must be the same reasons that are argued on appeal. <em>See Gardner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 418, 350 S.E.2d 229 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Appellant argues that under the ends of justice exception, we should reverse the case notwithstanding the failure to make the proper objection in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The Supreme Court in <em>Jimenez </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 244, 402 S.E.2d 678 (1991), discussed the ends of justice exception as applied to jury instructions and the sufficiency of the evidence. In <em>Jimenez, </em>an essential element defining the crime was left out of the instruction. Moreover, no evidence was introduced to prove the element. The Supreme Court found that Jimenez had been convicted of a crime of which the Commonwealth\u2019s own evidence showed he was not guilty. <em>Id. </em>at 251, 402 S.E.2d at 681 (citing <em>Ball </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 754, 273 S.E.2d 790 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">In <em>Jimenez, </em>the Supreme Court stated that \u201cwhen a principle of law is vital to a defendant in a criminal case, a trial court has an affirmative duty properly to instruct a jury about the matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 250, 402 S.E.2d at 681 (citing <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 390, 393, 219 S.E.2d 669, 671 (1975); <em>Whaley v. Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 353, 355-56, 200 S.E.2d 556, 558 (1973)). In <em>Bryant </em>and <em>Whaley, </em>the defense offered an instruction embodying a principle of law upon which they relied but their instructions were \u201cargumentative, confusing and intentionally misleading,\u201d or otherwise improperly drawn. <em>See Bryant, </em>216 Va. at 392, 219 S.E.2d at 671; <em>Whaley, </em>214 Va. at 354-55, 200 S.E.2d at 557-58. In both cases, the defendants sought to have their position on the law embodied in a jury instruction. The principles of law con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>tained in the instructions were correct as applied to the facts, but the instructions were wrong for other reasons. Rather than correcting the instructions and giving them with a correct statement of law, the trial judges simply refused the instruction and the case went to the jury without any instruction on the principle of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Here, the appellant did not offer an instruction on the principle of law that was incorrectly stated to the jury by the Commonwealth\u2019s instruction but acquiesced in the Commonwealth\u2019s instruction to the extent it is now in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">We have held that the ends of justice do not require that an argument be entertained on appeal unless there has been an obvious miscarriage of justice. <em>Mounce </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va. App. 433, 357 S.E.2d 742, 744 (1987). We must determine whether a miscarriage of justice obviously occurred or might have occurred. Here, no obvious miscarriage of justice occurred. The evidence is overwhelming of the defendant\u2019s intent to alter a public document with the intent to deceive. Moreover, contrary to <em>Jimenez, </em>an abundance of evidence was offered proving the element concerning the defendant\u2019s criminal intent. In fact, an examination of the record reveals that it would have been difficult for a rational trier of fact to have reached any other conclusion than that appellant intended that the record be altered. <em>See Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Accordingly, on the facts of this case, we are not required to waive the bar of Rule 5A:18 to achieve the ends of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Therefore, the judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">Coleman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-14\"> The jury also found appellant guilty of malfeasance in office and fixed his punishment at twelve months in jail and a $1,000 fine.

The majority concludes that because Joseph Hugh Campbell\u2019s attorneys failed to object to the defective instruction, Rule 5A:18 bars our consideration of that issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I believe that the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception to the Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>must be invoked and, further, that the error in giving the instruction was not harmless. Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\u201c[W]hen a principle of law is vital to a defendant in a criminal case, a trial court has an affirmative duty properly to instruct a jury about the matter.\u201d <em>Jimenez </em>v. Commonwealth, 241 Va. 244, 250, 402 S.E.2d 678, 681 (1991). That duty arises even when \u201ctrial counsel neglected to object to the instruction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248, 402 S.E.2d at 679. Obviously, the proper description of the elements of the offense was vital to the defendant. Instruction number eight was so defective that it allowed the jury to convict Campbell of forgery even if the jury concluded that Campbell lacked an intent to defraud. Intent to defraud, however, is a necessary element of forgery. <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 171, 173, 313 S.E.2d 394, 395 (1984).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">[A]n essential of the due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment [is] that no person shall be made to suffer the onus of a criminal conviction except upon sufficient proof \u2014 defined as evidence necessary to <em>convince a trier of fact </em>beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence <em>of every element </em>of <em>the offense.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-7\"><em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 316 (1979)(emphasis added).

App. 485, 488, 370 S.E.2d 717, 719 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The misstatement of law relieved the Commonwealth of its burden to prove criminal intent because the trial judge improperly informed the jury that it could convict Campbell even if the jury found that Campbell lacked the requisite <em>mens rea. </em>Thus, the jury could have believed Campbell\u2019s defense \u2014 that he had no intent to defraud because his statement to the clerk who changed the record was only intended as a joke \u2014 and yet convicted him by finding that his conduct \u201ctended to impair a governmental function.\u201d This occurrence deprived Campbell of the process that he was due.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">\u201cThere is always in litigation a margin of error, representing error in factfinding, which both parties must take into account. Where one party has at stake an interest of transcending value \u2014 as a criminal defendant his liberty \u2014 this margin of error is reduced as to him by the process of placing on the other party the burden of . . . persuading the factfinder at the conclusion of the trial of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-7\"><em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364 (1970)(quoting <em>Speiser </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>357 U.S. 513, 525-26 (1958)). This doctrine, which is the cornerstone of our system of criminal justice, \u201crequires more than simply a trial ritual.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 316-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 126, 380 S.E.2d 8 (1989), this Court emphasized that \u201c[although the ends of justice exception is narrow and is to be used sparingly, [the Court will not place] too restrictive an interpretation upon <em>Mounce </em>[v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>4 Va. App. 433, 357 S.E.2d 742 (1987)].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132, 380 S.E.2d at 11. Specifically, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">The language in <em>Mounce </em>that to avail himself of the rule the defendant had to affirmatively show [that] \u201ca miscarriage of justice [has] occurred, not . . . that a miscarriage <em>might </em>have occurred\u201d requires that the error be clear, substantial and material.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). Unquestionably, the error in instructing this jury meets that standard. No amount of sophistry can eliminate the possibility that the jury believed the defense testimony, rationally applied the facts, as believed, to the incorrectly drawn instruction, and convicted Campbell.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The resolution of this dilemma is not found in weighing this hypothesis of innocence against the quantum of proof that the Commonwealth offered in support of guilt. If the jury believed the testimony of Campbell, as it was entitled to do, the quantum of contrary evidence was irrelevant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">Traditional principles dictate, both in the civil and criminal law, that the determination of a witness\u2019 credibility is within the fact finder\u2019s exclusive purview because he has the best opportunity to observe the appearance and demeanor of the witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">\u201cThe credibility of witnesses is a question exclusively for the jury, and where a number of witnesses testify directly opposite to each other, the jury is not bound to regard the weight of the evidence as equally balanced, they have the right to determine from the appearance of the witnesses on the stand, their manner of testifying, and their apparent candor and fairness, their apparent intelligence, or lack of intelligence, and from all the other surrounding circumstances appearing on the trial, which witnesses are more worthy of credit, and to give credit accordingly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-8\"><em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>5 Va.

Our inquiry is not whether it would have been difficult for a rational trier of fact to have reached any other conclusion, but whether \u201cthe error did not affect the verdict.\u201d <em>Lavinder </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991). If we give effect to the presumption that a jury follows the trial judge\u2019s instructions, <em>LeVasseur </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 564, 589, 304 S.E.2d 644, 657 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1063 (1984), it is not appropriate for this Court to affirm a conviction when the jury could have based its decision on otherwise legally innocent behavior. Where the error relates not to the jury\u2019s consideration of improperly admitted evidence, but to a jury\u2019s legally improper application and consideration of wholly proper evidence, it cannot be said that the erroneous instruction \u201cdid not affect the verdict,\u201d <em>Lavinder, </em>12 Va. App. at 1005, 407 S.E.2d at 911, or that Campbell received \u201ca fair trial on the merits and [that] substantial justice has been reached,\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-678. \u201cIt is elementary that a jury must be informed as to the essential elements of the offense; a correct statement of the law is one of the \u2018essentials of a fair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Darnell, </em>6 Va.
