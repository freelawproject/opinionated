The trial judge set aside the agreement and scheduled a hearing to determine the parties\u2019 rights to the equitable distribution of their property in accordance with the provisions of Code \u00a7 20-107.3. This appeal arises from those rulings. The threshold question to be decided is whether the trial judge\u2019s ruling constitutes an appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">The parties agree that the ruling is interlocutory. However, appellant contends that the ruling \u201cadjudicat[es] the principles of a cause\u201d and, thus, is appealable. Code \u00a7 17-116.05(4). Recently, in <em>Polumbo </em>v. Polumbo, 13 Va. App. 306, 411 S.E.2d 229 (1991), a panel of this Court held that an interlocutory decree invalidating an antenuptial agreement was not an appealable order. <em>Id. </em>at 307-08, 411 S.E.2d at 229. In so ruling, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-9\">In order to adjudicate the principles of a cause, a decree must decide an issue which \u201cwould of necessity affect the final order in the case.\u201d The decree must \u201cdetermine the rules by which the court will determine the rights of the parties.\u201d It must \u201crespond to the <em>chief object </em>of the suit which was to secure a divorce.\u201d However, \u201c[t]he mere possibility\u201d that an interlocutory decree \u201cmay affect the final decision in the trial does not necessitate an immediate appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 307, 411 S.E.2d at 229 (quoting <em>Pinkard </em>v. <em>Pinkard, </em>12 Va. App. 848, 851, 407 S.E.2d 339, 341-42 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-12\">At the time of the trial judge\u2019s ruling in this case, no decree of divorce had been granted. Although the ruling may affect the ultimate decision concerning the disposition of the parties\u2019 property and their rights and interests in the property, it will not of necessity do so. At the hearing to determine an equitable distribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>tion of the parties\u2019 rights and interests in their property in accordance with Code \u00a7 20-107.3, the trial judge might reach the same or a more favorable disposition with respect to the appellant\u2019s property rights. In any event, \u201c[t]he matter was still in the breast of the court and \u2018subject to alteration and amendment\u2019 by the judge before entering an appealable order.\u201d <em>Weizenbaum </em>v. Weizenbaum, 12 Va. App. 899, 903, 407 S.E.2d 37, 39 (1991) (quoting <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>128 Va. 676, 685, 105 S.E. 225, 228 (1920)). Accordingly, we hold that the ruling was not an appealable order, and we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Baker, J., and Moon, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
