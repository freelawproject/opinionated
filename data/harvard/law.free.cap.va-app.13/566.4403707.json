He contends that he was denied both his constitutional and statutory rights to a \u201cspeedy trial\u201d and, further, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdict. We disagree and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The evidence disclosed that, on the morning of March 17, 1989, Deputy John Stanton (Stanton) of the Williamsburg Sheriffs Department was transporting defendant from the \u201cRichmond penitentiary\u201d to Williamsburg. Defendant was manacled in \u201cleg chains and ... a waist chain that ha[d] a handcuff attached to each side.\u201d Stanton was the operator of the \u201cunmarked\u201d vehicle, defendant was seated in the rear and no \u201cdivider\u201d separated the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">In route, defendant suddenly stated, \u201cSheriff, don\u2019t make me blow your damn brains out.\u201d Stanton was \u201cstartled\u201d and \u201cscared\u201d and \u201cjerked\u201d his \u201chead to the right to see what was going on.\u201d He observed defendant with \u201can object . . . something metal that appeared to be the barrel of a pistol,\u201d which Stanton \u201cassumed it was.\u201d The vehicle was then travelling \u201capproximately 65 [mph],\u201d and Stanton lost control for \u201c10 or 15 seconds,\u201d until it came to rest in the grassy median.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Stanton immediately began to \u201clook and feel for [his] gun,\u201d which was missing and had been \u201cin [his] holster at the time . . . the car went out of control.\u201d Unarmed, the deputy \u201cwas fearful for [his] life\u201d and, when defendant demanded that Stanton \u201cget the car back on the road,\u201d he \u201cdecided . . . that [he] wasn\u2019t going with\u201d defendant. In an effort to \u201cwreck\u201d the car and \u201cbail out,\u201d Stanton \u201ccut . . . toward the guardrail\u201d and \u201cjumped out on the grass.\u201d Defendant, however, \u201cgot to the wheel and got it straightened out\u201d and escaped in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">The car was discovered in downtown Richmond later the same day with its two radio antennae and several hubcaps removed and in the trunk. A \u201cfake gun\u201d was found on the rear seat. Defendant was arrested shortly thereafter on a Richmond street and Stanton\u2019s stolen pistol was found in the \u201cwaistband\u201d of his trousers. He was indicted on March 20, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>On defendant\u2019s motion, the trial court ordered a competency evaluation pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-169.1. This statute prescribes the procedure to determine the mental \u201ccapacity\u201d of an accused \u201cto understand the proceedings against him\u201d or \u201cassist his attorney in his own defense.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-169.1. If the court concludes that such inquiry is appropriate, it \u201cshall\u201d order an evaluation of the accused by designated professionals. With the cooperation of the attorney for the Commonwealth and the defendant in certain particulars, the designated professionals shall file a written report of their relevant findings and conclusions with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">While the statute requires that the report be \u201cpromptly submitted,\u201d it does not specify the time within which the examination must be conducted. Code \u00a7 19.2-169.1. It does, however, provide that \u201cthe court shall promptly determine whether the defendant is competent to stand trial,\u201d without the necessity of a \u201chearing\u201d unless \u201crequested\u201d by the Commonwealth, defense counsel or incidental to defendant\u2019s hospitalization. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The evaluation order was entered by the trial court on April 12, 1989. On April 21, 1989, May 10, 1989, and July 12, 1989, the institution responsible for the examination requested information from both the prosecuting and defense attorneys. The Commonwealth responded on July 28, 1989, and the defendant on September 7, 1989. Without explanation in the record, however, the evaluation was not conducted until January 3, 1990. The written report, dated January 24, 1990, was filed with the court and, at defendant\u2019s request, a \u201cMental Competency Hearing\u201d was conducted on July 24, 1990. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court entered an order which found defendant \u201ccompetent to stand trial\u201d and, with \u201cthe mutual consent of the attorney for the Commonwealth, the attorney for the defendant and of the court,\u201d scheduled trial for August 27, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">On the morning of trial, defendant moved the court to dismiss the indictment due to delay in \u201cbringing defendant to trial\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 19.2-243 and the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. It was undisputed that defendant had been incarcerated since his arrest, albeit for unrelated reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>The provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-243 relevant to this appeal require that the trial of an incarcerated accused commence within five months of indictment, or, in this instance, on or before August 19, 1989 (152 days from March 20, 1989), absent application of one or more exceptions to the statute. <em>See Foster v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 167, 172, 380 S.E.2d 12, 15 (1989); <em>Moten v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va. App. 438, 441, 374 S.E.2d 704, 706 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">This statute and its predecessors have been the subject of numerous opinions and analyses by both this court and the Supreme Court of Virginia. It has been well established that (1) the statute is a furtherance of the constitutional rights of \u201cspeedy trial,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but is subordinate to them, (2) the Commonwealth must explain a failure to try an accused within the statutory period or be held responsible for the delay, (3) exceptions expressly set forth in the statute are not \u201call inclusive\u201d and \u201cothers of a similar nature may be implied,\u201d (4) delay attributable to a defendant \u201cwill not be considered in computing compliance with the statute,\u201d and (5) an assessment of delay is limited on appeal to the record before the court. <em>Godfrey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 460, 463-64, 317 S.E.2d 781, 783-84 (1984); <em>see Stephens </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 225 </em>Va. 224, 229-30, 301 S.E.2d 22, 26-27 (1983); <em>Holliday </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 612, 352 S.E.2d 362 (1987); <em>Cantwell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va. App. 606, 347 S.E.2d 523 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The record in this case clearly indicates that the substantial delay of trial in this instance was occasioned by defendant\u2019s motion for an evaluation pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-169.1. Despite several written requests to defense counsel for information necessary to the examination, defendant did not respond until September 7, 1989, nearly five months after the initial correspondence. Thereafter, the evaluation was undertaken at Central State Hospital, followed by the written report, a competency hearing before the court on July 24, 1990, and trial on August 27, 1990. The record reflects that defendant was uncooperative during the examination and that the competency hearing was held on his motion. It is also apparent that defendant consented, through counsel, to the scheduled trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Defendant\u2019s pretrial motions were \u201cby no means . . . frivolous or wholly without substance\u201d and were acts \u201cwhich necessitated a slowdown of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 225 </em>Va. 224, 233, 301 S.E.2d 22, 27 (1983). The motions evinced no concern for a speedy trial and defendant\u2019s subsequent unresponsive and uncooperative conduct further confirmed his indifference. <em>See id. </em>at 233-34, 301 S.E.2d at 27; <em>Moten, 7 </em>Va. App. at 442-46, 374 S.E.2d at 706-08. Defendant\u2019s actions invited the delay which he now finds oppressive and such conduct removes his case from the protections afforded by the statute. <em>Moten, 7 </em>Va. App. at 442-45, 374 S.E.2d at 706-07; <em>Stephens, 225 </em>Va. at 233-34, 301 S.E.2d at 27; <em>see also Taylor </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 425, 428-29, 404 S.E.2d 86, 88-89 (1991); <em>Shearer v. Commonwealth, 9 </em>Va. App. 394, 399-400, 388 S.E.2d 828, 831-32 (1990); <em>Cantwell, 2 </em>Va. App. at 610-13, 347 S.E.2d at 525-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Defendant\u2019s constitutional claim is similarly without merit. He relies upon the four factors enumerated in <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514 (1972), to establish a denial of his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. Under <em>Barker, </em>the considerations which must be balanced in a constitutional speedy trial analysis are (1) length of delay, (2) reason for delay, (3) assertion of defendant\u2019s right and (4) prejudice to defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 530; <em>see Holliday, 3 </em>Va. App. at 616, 352 S.E.2d at 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">While the Commonwealth concedes that the threshold issue, length of delay, is sufficient in this instance to trigger a <em>Barker </em>inquiry, this delay was largely attributable to defendant\u2019s motions and related conduct. <em>See Moten, 7 </em>Va. App. at 445, 374 S.E.2d at 708; <em>Fowlkes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 763, 766, 240 S.E.2d 662, 664 (1978); <em>Beachem </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>10 Va. App. 124, 131, 390 S.E.2d 517, 520 (1990). Moreover, the defendant\u2019s speedy trial concerns first appeared on the day of trial and he asserts prejudice only as a result of \u201canxiety and concern\u201d over \u201cthe outcome of the charges.\u201d <em>See Beachem, </em>10 Va. App. at 133-34, 390 S.E.2d at 521-22; <em>Holliday, 3 </em>Va. App. at 620-21, 352 S.E.2d at 366-67; <em>see Miller </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 929, 936-37, 234 S.E.2d 269, 274-75 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1016 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>\u201c[S]peedy trial claims require a functional analysis of the rights in the context of the particular facts\u201d of a case and, in the \u201cbalancing test,\u201d the \u201cconduct of both the prosecution and the defendant is examined.\u201d <em>Holliday, </em>3 Va. App. at 616, 352 S.E.2d at 364; <em>See also Sheard </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 227, 231, 403 S.E.2d 178, 180 (1991). We have reviewed and examined the conduct of the prosecution and the defendant, balanced the several considerations mandated by <em>Barker </em>and find no denial of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right of speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Lastly, defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the robbery conviction. When the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal, it is well established that we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. The conviction will be disturbed only if plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975); <em>Traverso v. Commonwealth, 6 </em>Va. App. 172, 176, 366 S.E.2d 719, 721 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The elements of robbery, a common law offense in Virginia, include a \u201c \u2018taking, with intent to steal, of the personal property of another, from his person or in his presence, against his will, by violence or intimidation\u2019 \u201d which precedes or is \u201cconcomitant with the taking.\u201d <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 519, 521, 351 S.E.2d 356, 356 (1986) (quoting <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 291, 293, 163 S.E.2d 570, 572-73 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Defendant threatened Stanton\u2019s life while brandishing an object which appeared to be a weapon. As a result, Stanton was fearful and surrendered the vehicle<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to defendant. Defendant then escaped with both the automobile and Stanton\u2019s pistol, apparently taken by defendant while Stanton was in extremity. These circumstances amply support a robbery conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Benton, J., and Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-7\"> Va.
