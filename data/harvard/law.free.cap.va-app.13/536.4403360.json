One witness, Geraldine Wooldridge, testified that when she saw Mosebrook get out of the truck, he had some blood on his face and was complaining that his head and neck were hurting. A CT scan performed at the emergency room showed extensive bleeding around the base of the brain. A cerebral angiogram showed an aneurysm and the final diagnosis was a cerebellum hemorrhage, left pica aneurysm. In his report of September 26, 1990, Dr. G. A. Hurt stated that \u201cit was possible\u201d that the aneurysm ruptured and caused the severe bleeding which temporarily made Mosebrook unable to handle his vehicle. Mosebrook had no recollection of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">The burden is upon a claimant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he sustained a compensable injury. <em>Woody v. Mark Winkler Management, Inc., </em>1 Va. App. 147, 150, 336 S.E.2d 518, 520 (1985). Factual findings of the commission are binding on appeal when supported by credible evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number><em>Southland Corp. </em>v. <em>Parson, </em>1 Va. App. 281, 283, 338 S.E.2d 162, 163 (1985); Code \u00a7 65.1-98. However, if no credible evidence exists in support of a factual finding, the issue of sufficiency of the evidence is one of law for this Court to decide. <em>Spruill </em>v. <em>C.W. Wright Constr. Co., </em>8 Va. App. 330, 333, 381 S.E.2d 359, 360 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">When an employee\u2019s injuries result from an idiopathic condition and no other factors intervene or operate to cause or contribute to the injuries sustained as a result of the idiopathic condition, no award shall be made. <em>Parson, </em>1 Va. App. at 285-86, 338 S.E.2d at 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Here, there was no credible evidence of any factors peculiar to his work environment that may have caused or contributed to Mosebrook\u2019s injuries sustained as a result of the idiopathic condition. <em>See id.; County of Chesterfield v. Johnson, </em>237 Va. 180, 183-84, 376 S.E.2d 73, 75 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The only evidence supporting a finding of a compensable accident was the speculation in Dr. Hurt\u2019s report that \u201cit was possible\u201d that the aneurysm rupturing caused the severe bleeding which temporarily made the claimant unable to handle his vehicle. This led to the deputy commissioner\u2019s conclusion, which was affirmed by the full commission, that the aneurysm ruptured prior to the collision with the tree and that the effects of the aneurysm were made more severe by the operation of the truck. There was no \u201ccredible evidence\u201d in this case that the operation of the truck increased the severity of the aneurysm.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Dr. Hurt\u2019s statement at best speculated that the idiopathic condition affected Mosebrook\u2019s driving. In no way did the statement establish that a condition of Mosebrook\u2019s employment aggravated or caused the aneurysm. Evidence that shows a mere possibility that the accident resulted from an employment related aggravation of an idiopathic condition does not constitute \u201ccredible evidence\u201d to support an award of compensation. Mosebrook did not prove a compensable injury by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Accordingly, since no credible evidence supports the award, the award is reversed and the claim dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Barrow, J., and Coleman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
