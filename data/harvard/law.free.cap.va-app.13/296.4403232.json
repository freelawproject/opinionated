He appeals and contends that (1) the victim\u2019s failure to report the incident for fourteen months constituted unreasonable delay, rendering the victim an inherently incredible witness, and (2) the trial court improperly admitted evidence of defendant\u2019s intimate relationship with a male defense witness which strongly suggested other criminal activity. We disagree and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">Following well established principles, we must view all the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and accord to the evidence all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Traverso v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 172, 176, 366 S.E.2d 719, 721 (1988). The jury\u2019s verdict will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">On August 25, 1988, the victim, a juvenile, was arrested for possession of alcohol. In accordance with usual procedure in that locality, the arresting officer contacted defendant, the juvenile pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>bation officer on-call that evening. Defendant responded, and, after conferring with the victim and the arresting officer, spoke with the victim\u2019s family by telephone, explained the situation and offered to drive the victim to his grandmother\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The victim testified, however, that defendant instead took him to his apartment. After offering the victim a beer, defendant discussed juvenile detention, describing it as a \u201cliving nightmare,\u201d and threatened to send him there unless the victim agreed to engage in sexual acts. Defendant then performed fellatio and attempted anal intercourse with the victim, after which he drove the victim to his grandmother\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The victim testified that, while in the apartment, defendant made a telephone call both prior to and following the sexual assault. The grandmother testified that, after receiving the initial phone call from the arresting officer, she received two additional calls during the succeeding two hours. The first call was from \u201ca man\u201d who advised her that the victim was with him and would remain overnight. The second caller, also \u201ca man,\u201d told her that the victim had changed his mind and wished to come to her home. The grandmother recalled that the victim arrived at her house with \u201ca man\u201d shortly after the last call.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The victim did not report the incident until another arrest on an unrelated matter, fourteen months later. When the arresting officer involved in that offense mentioned the possibility of detention, the victim became very upset and emotional. The officer and a different probation officer thought the victim overreacted and, after questioning, the victim related the earlier incident with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">At trial, a defense witness testified that defendant did not move into the apartment described by the victim until after the incident. When questioned on cross-examination, this witness admitted that he was an \u201cintimate friend\u201d of defendant and had engaged in \u201csexual relations\u201d with him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Over defendant\u2019s objection, the trial court permitted this evidence as relevant to the witness\u2019 possible bias in favor of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Defendant first argues that the victim waited an unreasonably long period before reporting the offense and characterizes the victim\u2019s testimony as uncorroborated and inherently incredible.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The credibility of a witness is a matter solely for the jury to decide. <em>Mullis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 564, 571, 351 S.E.2d 919, 923 (1987). In this case, any credibility issues were resolved by the jury in favor of the Commonwealth and they will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong. <em>Castaneda </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>7 Va. App. 574, 584, 376 S.E.2d 82, 87 (1989) (en banc); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>7 Va. App. 310, 314, 373 S.E.2d 340, 343 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The victim\u2019s failure to immediately report the incident did not render his testimony inherently incredible as a matter of law. <em>See Hammer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>207 Va. 159, 162, 148 S.E.2d 892, 894 (1966). The jury was entitled to attribute such significance as it deemed appropriate to this delay. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Willis &amp; Bell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>the court held that failure to report a rape for an unreasonably long period after the incident occurred casts \u201csuspicion and doubt\u201d on the victim\u2019s testimony \u201cunless there is a credible explanation for such delay.\u201d 218 Va. 560, 563, 238 S.E.2d 811, 813 (1977). The victim\u2019s youth, fright and embarrassment certainly provided the jury with an acceptable explanation for his behavior in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Furthermore, although portions of the victim\u2019s testimony were corroborated, convictions for sodomy and other sexual offenses may be sustained solely upon the testimony of the victim without corroboration. <em>Garland </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 189, 191, 379 S.E.2d 146, 147 (1989). The jury\u2019s verdict in this instance finds ample support in the evidence and was correctly sustained by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">Defendant next complains that the trial court improperly admitted the evidence of his intimate relationship with the male defense witness. He argues that this testimony indicated to the jury a likelihood that he had engaged in other criminal activity, evidence which is generally inadmissible. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 497, 502, 303 S.E.2d 890, 892-93 (1983); <em>Kirkpatrick </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 269, 272, 176 S.E.2d 802, 805 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>This evidence, however, was admitted solely for the purpose of revealing the witness\u2019 possible bias in favor of the defendant and \u201c \u2018bias of a witness is always a relevant subject of inquiry when confined to ascertaining previous relationship, feeling and conduct of the witness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Henning </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>235 Va. 181, 188, 366 S.E.2d 109, 113 (1988) (quoting <em>Henson v. Commonwealth, </em>165 Va. 821, 826, 183 S.E. 435, 437 (1936)). \u2018\u201c[O]n cross-examination, great latitude is allowed and ... the general rule is that anything tending to show the bias on the part of a witness may be drawn out.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">In <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>201 Va. 321, 111 S.E.2d 396 (1959), the defendant also argued that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of \u201cprior criminal acts of sexual immorality\u201d by defendant and a defense witness. <em>Id. </em>at 326, 111 S.E.2d at 399. The court held that, since the inquiries \u201cconcerned the relations of these two persons to each other,\u201d they \u201crelated to the credibility of these witnesses and the weight which should be given their testimony, and they were admissible for that purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326, 111 S.E.2d at 399-400.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Similarly, in <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 653, 283 S.E.2d 212 (1981), the trial court held that the testimony of a witness which referred to prior unrelated crimes of the defendant was admissible because \u201c[i]t was not offered, as defendant suggests, as affirmative evidence to show defendant committed the crimes with which he was charged\u201d but \u201cwas directed to the issue of [the witness\u2019] credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 663, 283 S.E.2d at 218. Like the present case, the prior crime in <em>Patterson </em>was an offense similar to that for which defendant was then on trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">We thus hold that, under the circumstances of this case, evidence of the witness\u2019 intimate relationship with defendant was material to the issue of credibility and the trial court properly concluded that its probative value outweighed any prejudicial effect. <em>See Wise </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 178, 188, 367 S.E.2d 197, 203 (1988); <em>Curtis v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 636, 638-39, 352 S.E.2d 536, 537-38 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">Duff, J., and Moon, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-9\"> The elicited testimony never specified the nature of \u201cintimate\u201d friendship or the \u201csexual relations,\u201d and the prosecution never characterized the relationship as a crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
