On appeal, defendant complains that the trial court erred in permitting cross-examination of his character witnesses concerning their knowledge of unrelated drug charges against defendant and other misconduct. We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">At trial, defendant called Frank Mitchell (Mitchell) and Jerome Etter (Etter) as character witnesses. Following inquiries into defendant\u2019s reputation for \u201ctruthfulness,\u201d his counsel asked both witnesses if defendant was \u201cknown\u201d as a \u201cdrug dealer.\u201d Each witness responded in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>During cross-examination, the prosecutor asked Mitchell, without objection, if he had \u201cheard\u201d that the defendant was \u201ca runner . . . distributing cocaine\u201d and had \u201calso sold marijuana.\u201d Mitchell denied any knowledge of such rumors. Later, the prosecutor inquired whether Mitchell was aware that the defendant was \u201ccharged with other things involving selling drugs.\u201d Defendant objected and moved for a mistrial. Stating that \u201c[t]he door is open,\u201d the trial judge overruled both the objection and motion. The prosecutor then rephrased the question and asked if the witness had \u201cheard that . . . Defendant ... is also charged with distributing marijuana in addition to distributing cocaine.\u201d Mitchell responded that he had \u201cheard of it,\u201d but only from defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Over further objection, the prosecutor was also allowed to ask Mitchell if he had \u201cheard\u201d that the defendant \u201clied\u201d to a police officer in September, 1989, and he answered that he knew \u201cnothing about that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">While cross-examining Etter, the prosecutor asked, without objection, if defendant was \u201cknown as a dealer of assorted drugs, including marijuana and cocaine.\u201d The witness responded, \u201cNo, he\u2019s not.\u201d Etter was then asked if he had \u201cheard\u201d that the defendant \u201cdistributed marijuana on February 12, 1989,\u201d and was \u201ccharged with distributing marijuana on February 09, 1989 and conspiracy to distribute marijuana on February 09, 1989.\u201d Defendant immediately objected and moved for a mistrial. His objection and motion were overruled, and Etter acknowledged that he had \u201cheard something of that sort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">It is well settled that a criminal defendant may introduce \u201c \u2018evidence of his good character for the trait involved in the particular prosecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Byrdsong </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va. App. 400, 403, 345 S.E.2d 528, 530 (1986) (quoting <em>Barlow </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 338, 340, 297 S.E.2d 645, 646 (1982)); see <em>Chiles </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 698, 699-700, 406 S.E.2d 413, 414 (1991). Once the defendant puts his good character in issue, however, the Commonwealth may introduce evidence of his bad character through cross-examination or \u201cdirect reputation testimony.\u201d <em>Zirkle v. Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 862, 871, 55 S.E.2d 24, 29 (1949); <em>Weimer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>5 Va. App. 47, 52, 360 S.E.2d 381, 383 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>The Commonwealth may question defendant\u2019s character witness with respect to \u201c \u2018specific instances of misconduct\u2019 \u201d by defendant. <em>Weimer, </em>5 Va. App. at 53, 360 S.E.2d at 384 (quoting 3A <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>\u00a7 988 (Chadbourn ed. rev. 1970)); <em>Kanter </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>171 Va. 524, 531, 199 S.E. 477, 480 (1938). Such inquiry is permitted \u201cto determine the grounds of the [witness\u2019] knowledge,\u201d not \u201cas a fact to show guilt.\u201d <em>Weimer, </em>5 Va. App. at 53, 360 S.E.2d at 384 (quoting Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 988). While the scope of this cross-examination is entrusted to the sound judgment of the trial court, its discretion is not unlimited and is subject to appellate review. <em>Zirkle, </em>189 Va. at 872 n.1, 55 S.E.2d at 30 n.1 (quoting <em>Beavers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>147 Va. 585, 590, 136 S.E. 501, 502 (1927)).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">We have previously recognized that character and reputation evidence may often be unreliable and incompatible with the objectivity necessary to a fair and just trial. In an effort to minimize this risk, we have held that the trial court should conduct a preliminary inquiry, out of the jury\u2019s presence, before allowing cross-examination of character witnesses relative to specific acts of misconduct by the defendant. <em>Weimer, </em>5 Va. App. at 54, 360 S.E.2d at 384. Approval of such examination by the trial court depends upon several determinations which result from the hearing, including \u201ca reasonable likelihood\u201d that the previous misconduct \u201cwould have been bruited about the neighborhood or community <em>prior </em>to the alleged commission of the offense on trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 54, 360 S.E.2d at 384-85 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Further, if the interrogation is permitted, the trial judge must inform the jury of its \u201cexact purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 55, 360 S.E.2d at 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Although defendant did not specifically request a hearing and ruling pursuant to <em>Weimer, </em>the necessity of the analysis was triggered by his objections and related motions for mistrial. No <em>Weimer </em>review was undertaken, however, and the limited purpose of the evidence developed during the cross-examination was never explained to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>A <em>Weimer </em>inquiry in this instance would have disclosed that the offenses mentioned in cross-examination allegedly occurred on February 9 and 12, 1989, and the untruthful statement to the police officer in September, 1989. On the date of the subject offense, February 11, 1989, no charge had been lodged against defendant for the February 9 incident and the February 12 offense and the \u201clie\u201d to the police officer had yet to occur. Thus, rumors of these events could not have been \u201cbruited about the neighborhood or community\u201d prior to this offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The Commonwealth argues, however, that defendant \u201copened the door\u201d for questions concerning his reputed drug involvement through direct examination on this precise subject. While \u201ca party has an absolute right to cross-examine his opponent\u2019s witness on a matter relevant to the case, which the opponent has put in issue by direct examination,\u201d this right is subject to \u201creasonable limitations.\u201d <em>Basham </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>199 Va. 817, 824, 102 S.E.2d 285, 290 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">When defendant questioned his witnesses about his reputation as a \u201cdrug dealer,\u201d the defendant\u2019s reputation was placed in issue and the Commonwealth had an absolute right to test the witnesses\u2019 knowledge. Consistent with this rule, the Commonwealth was permitted to ask the witnesses whether they were aware that defendant was reputedly involved in specified illegal drug activity. Defendant did not \u201copen the door,\u201d however, and properly objected to inquiries concerning criminal charges for unrelated drug offenses and other misconduct occurring after the offense for which he was on trial. <em>See Ginger </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>137 Va. 811, 814-15, 120 S.E. 151, 152 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The jury was clearly exposed to improper, inflammatory and prejudicial evidence and suggestion and we are unable to find that it \u201cplainly appears from the record and the evidence\u201d that this error \u201cdid not affect the verdict.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-678; <em>Lavinder </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991). Stated differently, we cannot \u201cconclude, without usurping the jury\u2019s fact finding function, that, had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been the same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under such circumstances, a \u201cfair trial on the merits and substantial justice\u201d may have been compromised and the error cannot be determined harmless. Code \u00a7 8.01-678..</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Barrow, J., and Elder, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-7\"> Other factors relevant to this determination by the trial judge, and also material to this case, specified in <em>Weimer, </em>are: (i) whether a question exists \u201cas to the fact of the subject matter of the rumor;\u201d (ii) the remoteness of the event and the rumor concerning it; (iii) whether the rumor concerns \u201cthe specific trait involved in the offense\u201d on trial; and (iv) whether the inquiry will be conducted in the proper \u201cHave you heard\u201d format, 5 Va.
