Barbour for her occupational disease. On appeal, Ross asserts that the commission (1) misinterpreted the words \u201cdid not result from causes outside of the employment\u201d in Code \u00a7 65.1-46.1 and, (2) as a result of this misinterpretation, applied an incorrect burden of proof, such that employees can prevail merely by proving the lack of a substantial cause outside of the employment. We affirm the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-14\">Barbour began working for Ross in 1975, and, on July 6, 1987, was employed as a machine operator. The machine she worked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>produced plastic bags and had two job stations, both of which required repetitive arm and hand movements. Her duties involved picking up a plastic neck or tube, inserting it in the machine, punching two buttons, placing a plastic bag in the machine, punching two more buttons, and removing the plastic bag to lay it on a conveyor belt. The procedure required use of both hands, and Barbour performed this sequence five or six times per minute for approximately six hours of her eight hour shift.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In addition to her work activities, Barbour shared housework with her family of three, cooked, and occasionally did some mending. She also worked in a home garden. Prior to beginning work with Ross, Barbour spent twelve years with the Lane Company, inspecting and sanding furniture. The sanding required use of both hands. She did not report any difficulty with her hands until December 21, 1987, when she told Dr. Charles Joseph that she had in the past two months experienced pain and numbness in her left hand. In a letter summarizing his examination of Barbour, Dr. Joseph diagnosed her as suffering from bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, a condition which, in Barbour\u2019s case, he thought occupationally related. Dr. Joseph further noted that Barbour did \u201ca lot of sewing and handwork\u201d at home, though at the hearing Barbour testified that, while she did occasional mending, she did neither a lot of handwork nor a lot of sewing.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Barbour underwent a carpal tunnel release on her left hand on February 5, 1988, and was determined to be well healed and free of symptoms on February 22, 1988, when she was discharged from care. She returned to work at Ross on the same machine. On February 8, 1990, Dr. W. Miles Wallace, a neurologist, diagnosed Barbour as suffering from bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and recommended further surgery. Dr. James C. Dunstan, an orthopedic surgeon, performed a bilateral carpal tunnel release on April 27, 1990. Dr. Dunstan testified that, with reasonable medical certainty, the major cause of Barbour\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome was her job. He further stated that activities outside of her employment may have contributed to her condition. Dr. Dunstan noted a definite correlation between repetitive activity and the onset of symptoms associated with carpal tunnel syndrome. Thus, Barbour\u2019s work activities were a more likely cause of her carpal tunnel syndrome if she engaged in no activities outside work involving the same degree of repetitiveness. Dr. Dunstan based his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>conclusion on conversations with Barbour that gave him what he believed was a reasonable familiarity with her job activities at Ross.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Appellant asserts that the commission misinterpreted the words \u201cdid not result from causes outside of the employment\u201d in Code \u00a7 65.1-46.1. Appellant contends that, because the commission misinterpreted the statute, it misapplied the statute, and so raised a question of law properly reviewable on appeal. <em>See Brown v. Fox, </em>189 Va. 509, 517, 54 S.E.2d 109, 113 (1949). We note at the outset that this Court has not previously interpreted the language at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Appellant urges us to read the statute as requiring a claimant to prove \u201cby clear and convincing evidence, to a reasonable medical certainty,\u201d that non-work-related factors did not contribute to his or her disease. To adopt this interpretation would be to misread the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Code \u00a7 65.1-46.1 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">An ordinary disease of life to which the general public is exposed outside of the employment may be treated as an occupational disease for purposes of this Act if it is established by clear and convincing evidence, to a reasonable medical certainty, that it arose out of and in the course of employment as provided in \u00a7 65.1-46 with respect to occupational diseases and did not result from causes outside of the employment. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">We hold that the phrase \u201cdid not result from causes outside of the employment\u201d does not preclude recovery in every instance where some other factor, other than those related to a claimant\u2019s work duties, may have contributed in some degree to the claimant\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">The Report of the Joint Subcommittee Studying Workers\u2019 Compensation, H. Doc. No. 27 (1986), noted conflicting suggestions that, on the one hand, either \u201cmaterially\u201d or \u201csubstantially\u201d be inserted following the words \u201cdid not result\u201d or, on the other, that \u201cin any degree\u201d be inserted in the same place. <em>Id. </em>at 8. The former suggestion would have indicated more clearly that the statute did not mean to preclude compensation in every case in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>some factor outside the workplace contributed to the claimant\u2019s disease. The latter suggestion would have clearly suggested an opposing interpretation. The latter amendment was, in fact, proposed by the Committee for Labor and Commerce. <em>Id. </em>App. 10 at 35. The General Assembly did not adopt the amendment, leaving this Court to parse the meaning of the statute as it now reads.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The language of the statute calls on the fact-finder to decide whether a claimant\u2019s disease arose out of and in the course of occupational activity or whether, instead, it \u201cresult [ed] from\u201d non-work-related activities. In effect, the statute offers the fact-finder a choice, so that the fact-finder must locate, with \u201creasonable medical certainty,\u201d the cause of claimant\u2019s disease. Implicit in the Act\u2019s standard that such a determination be made \u201cwith reasonable medical certainty\u201d is the recognition that pinpointing a single source for an ordinary disease of life will often be a difficult if not an impossible assignment. Thus, the very standard on which application of the language at issue turns points not to a single source, to the complete exclusion of all other sources, but to the primary source as determined by \u201creasonable medical certainty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Such an interpretation is in harmony with this Court\u2019s analysis of the phrase \u201creasonable medical certainty\u201d in <em>Westmoreland Coal Co. v. Campbell, </em>7 Va. App. 217, 223-24, 372 S.E.2d 411, 416 (1988). In <em>Westmoreland, </em>we held that, on the facts of that case, for an expert medical witness to testify \u201cto a reasonable medical certainty,\u201d the witness must conclude \u201cit is at least <em>more probable than not </em>that the disease arose out of and in the course of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Therefore, where the commission has concluded that the disease flowed from the claimant\u2019s occupational activity, the mere possibility that the claimant\u2019s condition might have been influenced in some degree by another, non-work-related activity is not enough to undermine that finding of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Ross further asserts that the commission\u2019s alleged misinterpretation resulted in the application of an incorrect burden of proof, such that employees can prevail merely by proving the lack of a substantial cause outside of the employment. The commission correctly applied the statute when it determined that the claimant\u2019s disease arose out of and in the course of her employment. \u201cWhether a disease is causally related to the employment and not causally related to other factors is ... a finding of fact.\u201d <em>Island </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number><em>Creek Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Breeding, </em>6 Va. App. 1, 12, 365 S.E.2d 782, 788 (1988). When there is credible evidence to support it, such a finding of fact is \u201cconclusive and binding\u201d on this Court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The commission relied on credible evidence in making its finding. For an ordinary disease of life to be compensable under Code \u00a7 65.1-46.1, the claimant must establish \u201cby clear and convincing evidence, to a reasonable medical certainty,\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-6\">that the disease (1) arose out of and in the course of employment, (2) did not result from causes outside of the employment, and (3) follows as an incident of an occupational disease, is an infectious disease or contagious disease contracted in the course of employment, or is characteristic of the employment and was caused by conditions peculiar to the employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-7\"><em>Island Creek, </em>6 Va. App. at 11, 365 S.E.2d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">With respect to the first part of the test, whether the disease arose out of and in the course of employment, the commission was justified in relying on Dr. Dunstan\u2019s conclusion that Barbour\u2019s \u201crepetitive activities at work\u201d were \u201cthe most likely cause\u201d of her disease. In <em>Westmoreland, </em>this Court held that, if an expert medical witness could not testify that \u201cit is at least more probable than not that the disease arose out of and in the course of employment, compensation must and should be denied.\u201d 7 Va. App. at 224, 372 S.E.2d at 416. Because Dr. Dunstan identified \u201cthe most likely cause\u201d of Barbour\u2019s disease, her disease is compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">As for the second part of the test, precluding compensation when a disease results from causes outside of employment, Dr. Dunstan indicated that \u201call activities with use of [Barbour\u2019s] hand contribute to the causation of her carpal tunnel syndrome.\u201d In other words, he could not say \u201c[w]ith reasonable medical certainty . . . that [Barbour\u2019s] job was the only cause\u201d of her disease. Nonetheless, based on his knowledge of Barbour\u2019s \u201crepetitive activities at work,\u201d Dr. Dunstan testified that, in his opinion, \u201cthe major cause in Ms. Barbour\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome with reasonable medical certainty is her job.\u201d The commission was justified in relying on this conclusion. As earlier noted, the mere fact that other activities outside work might have influenced Barbour\u2019s condition is not enough to undermine a finding by the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>that the disease resulted from work-related activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Finally, with respect to the third prong of the test, requiring a finding that the disease be characteristic of the employment and caused by conditions peculiar to the employment, evidence in the record indicates that Barbour\u2019s work involved highly repetitive manual activity. Furthermore, Dr. Dunstan stated that there was a \u201cdefinite correlation\u201d between repetition of manual activity and the onset of carpal tunnel syndrome and that, when no activities outside work involved the same degree of repetitiveness as those activities carried out in the course of employment, the work site was more likely to be a contributing cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The commission had before it credible evidence on which to base its award of compensation. Because the commission neither misinterpreted the statute nor applied an incorrect burden of proof, its decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Barrow, J., and Bray, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b410-15\"> Formerly the Industrial Commission of Virginia.
