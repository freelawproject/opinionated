The punishment provided by the statute is confinement in the penitentiary for not less than five nor more than forty years and a fine not exceeding $100,000. For the first offense, which occurred April 13, 1988, the appellant was sentenced to fifteen years in the state penitentiary, with ten years to serve and five years suspended, and to pay a fine of $1,000. For the second offense, which occurred December 1, 1988, he was sentenced to twenty-five years in the penitentiary, with twenty years to serve and five years suspended, and to pay a fine of $1,000. On appeal, he does not contest his convictions, but contends that his sentences were erroneous because they departed from the Voluntary Sentencing Guidelines then being used on a discretionary basis in the trial court. We find no error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">Upon the appellant\u2019s conviction and preparatory to sentencing, the trial court ordered a presentence report pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-299. As part of that report, the probation officer calculated the range of punishment provided by the Voluntary Sentencing Guidelines for the two charges embraced by this appeal and other charges to which the appellant pleaded guilty and was sentenced pursuant to a plea agreement. The guidelines indicated confinement for not less than seven years, eleven months, nor more than fifteen years, seven months, with a midpoint of eleven years, eleven months. The trial judge noted under the heading of Departure Information, \u201cSubstantial amount of cocaine. Evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>many years activity in selling drugs. Evidence of millions of dollars involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The appellant contends that the trial court erred in departing from the range of sentence provided by the guidelines. However, that is not the argument that he presented to the trial court. His attorney argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">I think we are in agreement as to what the guidelines are as to the charges for which I represent Mr. Robinson, and I would submit to the court that guideline sentencing might be appropriate in other cases, but I don\u2019t really think with his physical condition that the court should follow the guidelines, certainly not to go up to the high end. . . . But I would ask the court that certainly the guidelines, in my judgment, the midpoint certainly would be an optional punishment, if the court were predisposed not to take into consideration Mr. Robinson\u2019s physical condition. . . I would ask the court to place Mr. Robinson on probation .... I don\u2019t believe that society will be helped by imposing a sentence greater than the midpoint on the sentencing guidelines .... I would ask the court to allow Mr. Robinson to return home with his family.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Assuming, but not deciding, that this argument can be construed to suggest to the trial court that it should feel bound by the guidelines or obliged to impose sentences which fell within their scope, we find that argument to be without merit. The issue raised on this appeal is settled by our decision in <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>10 Va. App. 158, 390 S.E.2d 509 (1990). There we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">The legislature has set the range of punishment for those who violate the [criminal] code provisions. In establishing the sentencing range it endowed the trial court with inherent and discretionary power to impose appropriate sentences .... If the sentence is within the range set by the legislature, an appellate court will not interfere with the judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 160-61, 390 S.E.2d at 510 (citation omitted). In <em>Hudson, </em>we approved the trial court\u2019s finding that the \u201cguidelines as we have them now are not binding but used as a tool.\u201d They are a factor to be considered and used by the judge as he sees fit. <em>Id. </em>at 160, 390 S.E.2d at 510. In this case the trial judge stated his rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>sons for departing from the scope of the guidelines. These reasons are supported by the record, and we perceive in them no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The appellant asks that we \u201coverturn\u201d <em>Hudson. </em>We are not disposed to do so. Under the rule of <em>stare decisis, </em>a decision by a panel of this court is an established precedent. <em>See Commonwealth v. Burns, </em>240 Va. 171, 173-74, 395 S.E.2d 456, 457 (1990). We find nothing in the circumstances of this case leading us to believe that a departure from the precedent of <em>Hudson </em>is justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Baker, J., and Coleman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
