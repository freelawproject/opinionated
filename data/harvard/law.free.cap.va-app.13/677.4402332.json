On appeal, defendant asserts that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support the conviction. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">On July 5, 1990, John Rider drove Kaliah Al\u2019Hindi to the restaurant where she worked. As Al\u2019Hindi was getting out of the car, defendant appeared, grabbed her by the arm, and tried to pull her from the car. Al\u2019Hindi managed to get back into the car, and Rider drove away. About thirty minutes later, Rider and Al\u2019Hindi again encountered defendant, who by this time was in a car and accompanied by a friend, Joe Baytops. With Baytops driving, the two men pursued Rider and Al\u2019Hindi at speeds up to eighty-five miles per hour. At one point, when the two cars had been slowed by traffic and travelled side by side, defendant leaned out the passenger window of Baytops\u2019 car and threw a glass bottle at Rider\u2019s car, striking it on the driver\u2019s window, which was closed at the time. The bottle shattered but did no damage to Rider\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">After trying to run Rider\u2019s car off the road, Baytops and defendant pulled in front of Rider and slammed on the brakes, causing Rider to hit them from behind at a speed of approximately forty-five to fifty miles per hour. The collision did $700 in damage to Rider\u2019s car, though no one was injured. Frightened, Rider drove around Baytops\u2019 car and, with Baytops and defendant again in pursuit, sought and flagged down a state trooper.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Both defendant and Baytops testified for the defense. Baytops testified that he and defendant had seen Al\u2019Hindi, a passenger in Rider\u2019s car, flash her middle finger at them, make faces, laugh, and wave a ring that belonged to defendant. Baytops stated that none of this behavior angered him. He also stated that, although he had followed behind Rider\u2019s car, he had not chased Rider. Instead, he had been driving fifty-five miles per hour, the speed limit, on his way to his grandmother\u2019s house. At one point after he had had occasion to pass Rider\u2019s car, Baytops testified, Rider accelerated and rammed him from behind. Baytops noted that it was only after the collision that defendant had tossed not a glass bottle, but a plastic bottle, at Rider\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Defendant testified that, several days prior to the collision, Al\u2019Hindi had taken his class ring without permission. He said that he asked Baytops to follow Rider\u2019s car in order to recover his ring. Defendant indicated that he had intended to follow Rider until he stopped. He also stated that he and Baytops were not chasing Rider\u2019s car, but that Baytops was driving to defendant\u2019s grandmother\u2019s house. After passing Rider, defendant said, Baytops slowed down for mechanical reasons and Rider hit them from behind, then passed them. It was then that defendant threw the bottle.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Defendant asserts that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support a conviction of interfering with the property rights of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Defendant was originally charged, tried, and convicted by the trial judge of maliciously throwing a missile at a moving vehicle, a felony. In its sentencing order, the court vacated the conviction on the felony charge \u201cpursuant to motion of counsel for the defendant.\u201d In accordance with the defendant\u2019s request, the court found defendant not guilty of the felony charge \u201cbut guilty of interfering with the property rights of another, a misdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">A videotape of the sentencing hearing shows that counsel for defendant suggested to the court this alternative resolution. Asked what misdemeanor conviction the facts would justify, defense counsel expressly suggested that defendant could be convicted of interfering with the property rights of another, a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-137. Defense counsel stated that there was \u201cno question\u201d but that defendant had done that.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Furthermore, during a hearing that defendant did not arrange to have transcribed, but which was based on a motion which he has failed to call to the attention of this court, the defendant implored the trial court to convict him of a misdemeanor rather than the felony. Over the objection of the Commonwealth, the trial court granted the defendant the relief he sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">\u201cThe defendant, having agreed upon the action taken by the trial court, should not be allowed to assume an inconsistent position.\u201d <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 201, 214, 257 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>784, 792 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1049 (1980). \u201cNo litigant, even a defendant in a criminal case, will be permitted to approbate and reprobate \u2014 to invite error . . . and then to take advantage of the situation created by his own wrong.\u201d <em>Fisher v.
