She contends that: (1) the Harrisonburg Department of Social Services (the Department) failed to prove that termination was in the children\u2019s best interests; and (2) notwithstanding the termination of her rights, the circuit court erred in denying her continued contact with the children following adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">The court rendered its decision in accordance with Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C), which provides, <em>inter </em>alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-12\">The residual parental rights of a parent ... of a child placed in foster care as a result of . . .an entrustment agreement entered into by the parent . . . may be terminated if the court finds, based upon clear and convincing evidence, that it is in the best interests of the child and that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-13\">2. The parent. . . , without good cause, ha[s] been unwilling or unable within a reasonable period not to exceed twelve months to remedy substantially the conditions which led to the child\u2019s foster care placement, notwithstanding the reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>able and appropriate efforts of social, medical, mental health or other rehabilitative agencies to such end.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Cage concedes that the Department presented sufficient evidence to satisfy the requirements of Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2) but argues that there was no evidence with respect to the children\u2019s \u201cbest interests.\u201d Absent such evidence, she contends that the statutory prerequisites to termination were not fully met and the court erred in its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The record clearly reflects that the trial court heard evidence of Cage\u2019s inability to provide basic necessities for the children and unwillingness to address her lack of parenting skills. At the inception of Department care, the children were sick and developmentally delayed in several areas. The foster parents were very attentive to the children\u2019s emotional, physical and other needs, while the mother visited so infrequently that the children regarded the foster mother as their parent. Test scores administered less than one year after placement reflected significant general improvement in the children\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">This evidence was obviously material to the court\u2019s determination that Cage failed to remedy those conditions which originally justified the foster care placement and to its consideration of the children\u2019s best interests. Nothing in the statutory scheme requires the court to segregate evidence which is at once relevant to <em>both </em>of these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">This evidence, and all reasonable inferences therefrom, must be viewed on appeal in that light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>Martin v. Pittsylvania County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>3 Va. App. 15, 20, 348 S.E.2d 13, 16 (1986). \u201cWhere, as here, the court hears evidence ore tenus, its finding is entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Giving proper deference to the trial court\u2019s conclusions from the evidence in this cause, we affirm its findings and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">Cage further argues that a modified, \u201copen adoption\u201d is preferable to complete termination and would best serve the children\u2019s interests. She defines \u201copen adoption\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>a situation where the adoptive parents and the natural mother agree to terms by which the natural mother can maintain contact with her children, at the discretion of the adoptive parents. The adoptive parents would not be under any legal obligation to allow the natural mother to visit or continue visits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The relevant termination and adoption statutes, however, do not contemplate this proposal. The Department obtained custody of the children by way of entrustment agreements signed by Cage on January 26, 1989. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 63.1-220.2,. a child entrusted to the Department\u2019s care may be placed for adoption \u201cwhen the order of commitment or the entrustment agreement between the parent or parents and the agency or board provides for <em>the termination of all parental rights and responsibilities </em>with respect to the child for the purpose of placing and consenting to the adoption of such child.\u201d (emphasis added). It is apparent that termination is necessary to an adoption placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Nevertheless, Cage asserts a \u201cright\u201d with respect to the children, notwithstanding the termination of all parental rights. Code \u00a7 16.1-228 expressly provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">\u201cResidual parental rights and responsibilities\u201d means <em>all </em>rights and responsibilities remaining with the parent after the transfer of legal custody or guardianship of the person, including but not limited to the right of visitation, consent to adoption, the right to determine religious affiliation and the responsibility for support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">(emphasis added). <em>See also Martin, </em>3 Va. App. at 20, 348 S.E.2d at 16 (\u201cWhen a court orders termination of parental rights, the ties between the parent and child are severed forever and the parent becomes \u2018a legal stranger to the child.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Lowe v. Richmond Dep\u2019t of Public Welfare, </em>231 Va. 277, 280, 343 S.E.2d 70, 72 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Moreover, following adoption, Cage would be divested by statute of \u201call legal rights and obligations in respect\u201d to the children and the children are \u201cfree from all legal obligations of obedience and maintenance in respect\u201d to her. Code \u00a7 63.1-233. The children become, \u201cto all intents and purposes,\u201d children of the adoptive parents. <em>Id. </em>Such language does not accomodate \u201copen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>adoption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The proposal advocated by Cage thus conflicts with the statutory concepts of both termination and adoption and the legislature\u2019s obvious intent. Accordingly, the trial court correctly refused her request.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Duff, J., and Moon, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
