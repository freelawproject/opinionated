The trial judge sentenced him, in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict, to twenty-five years in the penitentiary for the murder conviction and two years for the firearm offense. Robinson contends that the trial court erred by failing to grant his motion for a mistrial when the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney repeatedly asked improper questions about Robinson\u2019s and his brother\u2019s involvement in unrelated drug transactions. We hold that a manifest probability exists that the prosecutor\u2019s repeated questions, which interjected irrelevant and inflammatory implications about Robinson into the case, prejudiced the jury and denied Robinson a fair trial. Therefore, we reverse his convictions and remand the case to the trial court for such action as may be deemed appropriate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>I. <em>Procedural Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The Commonwealth argues that appellate review of the mistrial issue is procedurally barred by Rule 5A:18 because Robinson failed to object to the trial judge\u2019s taking the mistrial motion under advisement. The Commonwealth contends that by waiting until the jury rendered its verdict before renewing the motion for a mistrial, the appellant waived the motion. We reject these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The purpose of the contemporaneous objection rule embodied in Rule 5A:18 is to inform the trial judge of the action complained of in order to give the judge the opportunity to consider the issue and to take timely corrective action, if warranted, in order to avoid unnecessary appeals, reversals and mistrials. <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>5 Va. App. 36, 45, 360 S.E.2d 371, 376 (1987). Robinson\u2019s counsel objected to each incident in which the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney asked an improper question or a witness made an improper reference that Robinson or his witness dealt in drugs or had the reputation of dealing in drugs. After the first incident, Robinson\u2019s counsel objected and moved for a mistrial. The trial judge sustained the objection, admonished the jury to disregard the witness\u2019 answer, and took the motion for a mistrial under advisement. Thereafter, Robinson\u2019s counsel objected to two similar incidents and twice renewed his motion for a mistrial because of repeated improper questions and improper responses by witnesses. Both mistrial motions were made before the case was submitted to the jury. The trial judge also took the second and third motions for a mistrial under advisement. Finally, after the jury rendered its guilty verdicts, Robinson\u2019s counsel again moved for a mistrial and the court overruled the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"AoI\">Robinson\u2019s counsel did all that was necessary to \u201clay his finger on\u201d and to call to the attention of the trial judge the error complained of, the reason therefor, and the relief sought. The trial judge had the opportunity to address the mistrial issue. The trial judge fully understood the problem and, by sustaining the objections and admonishing counsel, attempted to correct the error and prevent its recurrence. However, despite the trial judge\u2019s rulings and admonition, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney persisted in an improper line of character impeachment of the accused and of his witness. Having raised the issue on three separate occasions before the jury reached its verdict, and having taken no action that might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>be construed as a waiver, Robinson did all that was required to preserve the issue for appeal and did not waive his claim by not insisting that the trial judge rule on the motion he had taken under advisement. Defense counsel had every right to expect that the trial judge would rule on the motion when the judge deemed appropriate. It is not uncommon for trial judges to defer ruling on mistrial motions until after the jury has reached a verdict, thereby possibly obviating the need for a retrial should the verdict result in an acquittal. To require counsel to object to a trial judge\u2019s decision to take a motion for a mistrial under advisement, as the Commonwealth asks us to do, is not required to comply with Rule 5A:18. We will not adopt such a procedural requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">II. <em>Substantive Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Robinson contends that the trial court erred in denying his motions for a mistrial. The trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for a mistrial will not be reversed on appeal unless there exists a manifest probability that the denial was prejudicial to the accused. <em>Harward </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>5 Va. App. 468, 478, 364 S.E.2d 511, 516 (1988). Three incidents occurred at trial which were improper and were the grounds of separate objections and motions for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">First, during the direct examination of Marvin Carter, a friend of the homicide victim, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney asked, \u201cWhat was the defendant\u2019s reputation for peacefulness and tranquility?\u201d The witness responded, \u201cHis reputation, he was known for dealing drugs.\u201d While nothing in the record suggests that the prosecutor anticipated the response or encouraged the witness to interject this improper comment about drugs, subsequent events suggest that the incident was part of a deliberate attempt by the prosecutor to interject irrelevant and highly prejudicial evidence that Robinson and his brother, who was a defense witness in the case, dealt in drugs. Robinson\u2019s counsel immediately objected to the evidence and moved for a mistrial. The trial judge sustained the objection, told the jury to disregard the remark, and took the motion for a mistrial under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Next, during cross-examination of Robinson, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney asked him, \u201cDid you traffic in narcotics?\u201d Defense counsel objected and again moved for a mistrial. The trial judge sustained the objection and admonished counsel not to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>tinue to ask improper questions about unrelated criminal activity. The judge did not rule on the mistrial motion at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Finally, in rebuttal, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney called Susan Hazdalenka as a witness and asked her about James Draugh\u2019s (a defense witness) reputation for truthfulness, to which she responded, \u201cExtremely poor. Mr. Draugh was known to be involved. . . .\u201d Defense counsel objected, and the court sustained his objection. Despite the trial judge\u2019s rulings, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney persisted and asked Ms. Hazdalenka about Robinson\u2019s brother, Chucky: \u201cDid you ever have occasion to see Chucky involved in the distribution of narcotics?\u201d Again, defense counsel objected and renewed his motion for a mistrial. The court again sustained the objection and took Robinson\u2019s motion under advisement. After the jury returned the guilty verdicts, Robinson renewed his motion for a mistrial. The court overruled the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Marvin Carter\u2019s testimony regarding Robinson\u2019s involvement in the drug trade, while improper and potentially prejudicial to Robinson, was, insofar as we can tell from the record, unsolicited by the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney. The trial judge instructed the jury to disregard Carter\u2019s testimony. We assume that the jury followed the trial court\u2019s instruction. Consequently, standing alone, no manifest probability of prejudice may be attributed to Marvin Carter\u2019s testimony. <em>See LeVasseur v. Commonwealth, 225 </em>Va. 564, 589, 304 S.E.2d 644, 657 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1063 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">However, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney\u2019s cross-examination of Robinson and his questions of Ms. Hazdalenka about Robinson\u2019s brother\u2019s alleged trafficking in narcotics are different matters. These questions solicited irrelevant and highly prejudicial matters. No evidence was presented that the homicide and shootings which occurred were drug related. If the Commonwealth intended to establish that a dispute over drugs was the motive for the shooting, it should have presented evidence of a nexus between the two. This it did not do. The Commonwealth may not, as the trial judge ruled and admonished counsel, ask questions or present evidence of unrelated criminal activity that does nothing more than impugn the character of the accused and his witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Since no evidence was introduced that drugs were involved in the shooting incident, the only conceivable purpose of the ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>tions by the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney was to inflame the passions of the jury against the accused and his witness. The questions were designed to elicit evidence to show that the accused and his witness were of bad character. They represented the prosecutor\u2019s patent effort through innuendo and insinuation to paint the accused and his witness as drug dealers.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The trial judge, after the incident with Ms. Hazdalenka, noted that the issue of drugs was being \u201csmeared\u201d in the case without any evidence to substantiate the allegations and insinuations of drug involvement. The trial judge did not, however, instruct the jury to disregard the implications of the questions posed to Robinson or Hazdalenka, nor did the trial judge grant Robinson\u2019s renewed motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">When a Commonwealth\u2019s attorney, the people\u2019s lawyer and an elected official, repeatedly asks questions which insinuate and imply that the accused and his witness are persons of bad character involved in criminal drug trafficking, the questions themselves suggest a basis in fact because, by continuing to ask the questions, the jury reasonably may assume that the prosecutor has some basis to believe that the persons are involved in drug trafficking. Based on the improper line of questioning on the part of the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney, the fact that such questioning was not an isolated incident, and in the failure of the trial judge to instruct the jury to disregard such questions, we conclude that a manifest probability exists that Robinson was prejudiced by the line of questioning. Thus, the trial judge erred by not declaring a mistrial because the questions, insinuating that Robinson and his witness were involved in criminal activity unrelated to the offense or offenses being tried, may have confused the jury as to the issues properly before it and prejudiced the jurors against Robinson by portraying him as a person with a propensity to commit crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse Robinson\u2019s convictions and remand the case for whatever action the Commonwealth deems advisable.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">Barrow, J., and Moon, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-13\"> By remanding the case, we express no opinion as to whether a retrial would be barred by the double jeopardy clause. <em>See MacKenzie v.
