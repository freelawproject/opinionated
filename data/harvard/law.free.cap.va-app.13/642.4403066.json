Cooper (defendant) was convicted in a bench trial of possession of \u201ctools, implements or outfit, with intent to commit burglary, robbery or larceny,\u201d a felony, and sentenced to six years imprisonment, with three years suspended. He appeals that conviction, contending that, under principles of double jeopardy, the instant prosecution was barred by a prior misdemeanor conviction in the general district court. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">The facts pertinent to this appeal are uncontroverted. On May 6, 1990, defendant was discovered by a police officer in the \u201claundry room\u201d of an apartment complex \u201cprying on a machine, one of the coin-operated machines,\u201d with \u201cboth hands on a large crowbar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">Several days before trial, defendant\u2019s counsel filed a written motion with the court alleging that defendant had previously been \u201ctried and found guilty\u201d in the general district court \u201cof violating the misdemeanor of destruction of private property.\u201d The motion further stated that the \u201cmisdemeanor charge\u201d involved \u201cthe same set of facts as the pending felony\u201d and that, \u201cin order to establish an essential element of the present felony,\u201d the Commonwealth must \u201cprove the conduct that constitute [d] the misdemeanor,\u201d thereby violating the \u201cDouble Jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution.\u201d Defendant moved the court to \u201cdismiss the indictment\u201d and cited <em>Grady v. Corbin, </em>495 U.S. 508 (1990), in support of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">The record reflects no action on defendant\u2019s motion until, just prior to arraignment on the day of trial, defendant\u2019s counsel argued the motion to the trial judge. He stated that defendant \u201cwas convicted of destruction of private property, laundry machines,\u201d in \u201clower court,\u201d and \u201cthe Commonwealth . . . cannot convict [defendant] of burglary tools without utilizing the evidence of the previous crime,\u201d the misdemeanor. Counsel further represented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>that defendant had appealed the misdemeanor conviction and \u201cnow wishes to withdraw that appeal and take the conviction.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-133.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The Commonwealth responded that it was not necessary to prove \u201cany of the facts of the destruction of private property . . . to prove [defendant] guilty\u201d of \u201cpossession of burglary tools\u201d and \u201cno element\u201d of that offense was essential to the felony prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">At the conclusion of argument, the trial judge \u201cdenied\u201d defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment, but apparently permitted defendant to withdraw the misdemeanor appeal which had been referenced by his counsel, although the record before us documents nothing with respect to that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">It is well established in Virginia that a plea of former jeopardy must be in writing and \u201cset forth the court in which the accused was tried, the time thereof, the specific offense charged, the acquittal or conviction of the accused, and any other circumstance necessary to identify the offense and the accused.\u201d <em>DeBoer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>147 Va. 671, 675, 137 S.E. 469, 470 (1927); <em>see also Reaves </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>192 Va. 443, 445, 65 S.E.2d 559, 560-61 (1951). Absent this evidence, \u201cthere is nothing ... to enable\u201d the court \u201cto determine the facts . . . put in issue by the . . . motion.\u201d <em>Reaves, </em>192 Va. at 445, 65 S.E.2d at 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">The \u201cburden is on the defendant\u201d to \u201csubstantiate\u201d his allegation and \u201cestablish the identity of the offenses\u201d material to his plea. <em>Low </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>11 Va. App. 48, 50, 396 S.E.2d 383, 384 (1990). Customarily, a defendant carries this burden \u201cby production of the record or transcript of the initial trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">While the defendant in <em>Low </em>failed properly to \u201csubstantiate\u201d, his allegation of former jeopardy, we, nevertheless, considered the issue because the existence of the prior \u201cconviction arising out of the same incident\u201d was clearly accepted and undisputed in the record. It had been argued by counsel, \u201cconceded\u201d by the Commonwealth and \u201ctreated as an established fact by the trial judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50-51, 396 S.E.2d at 384. Under those circumstances, we refused to permit the Commonwealth to complain \u201cfor the first time on appeal\u201d that defendant had not properly developed his claim. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 396 S.E.2d at 384; <em>see </em>Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>The record before us in this instance, however, discloses no acknowledgment from either the court or the Commonwealth that the prior misdemeanor conviction referenced by defendant was related to the felony then under prosecution. This earlier prosecution was before the trial court only on defendant\u2019s motion and argument, which described a conviction of \u201cdestruction of private property, laundry machines,\u201d while evidence in the felony trial indicated defendant was \u201cprying on a [coin-operated] machine,\u201d \u201cthe cash, the coin box on the electric dryer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Defendant has failed sufficiently to identify the previous prosecution and otherwise substantiate his allegations to permit the trial court properly to consider the double jeopardy argument. As a consequence, the record before us discloses no error by the trial judge, and we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Koontz, C.J., and Elder, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
