Manis contends that the commission erred in finding that Arellano had made a reasonable effort to market his remaining work capacity in the United States. We agree and reverse the decision of the commission. We hold that Arellano\u2019s pursuit of unlawful employment in this country is not an acceptable means of marketing his residual work capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">Arellano illegally entered the United States in 1973 and has since remained and worked here without proper documentation. After residing in Texas for approximately fifteen years, he travelled to Baltimore and contacted Juan Serna (Serna), a man reputed for hiring illegal aliens. Serna, then a subcontractor under Manis, the general contractor on a construction project, hired Arellano as a \u201ccarpenter\u2019s helper.\u201d On April 24, 1988, Arellano sustained a compensable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">Following a period of total disability, Arellano\u2019s physician released him for light duty. However, as an illegal alien, he was unable to complete employment applications, register with the Virginia Employment Commission or obtain lawful employment. He sought employment by asking \u201cHispanic persons if they knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>of anyone looking for workers.\u201d In August, 1989, Arellano, still an illegal alien, returned to Texas and was reemployed at his original job.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">As a condition to benefits under the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the Act), a partially disabled employee must make a reasonable effort to market his remaining work capacity. <em>Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>228 Va. 598, 601, 324 S.E.2d 654, 656 (1985); <em>National Linen Service </em>v. <em>McGuinn, </em>8 Va. App. 267, 269, 380 S.E.2d 31, 33 (1989). In <em>National Linen Service, </em>we identified those considerations relevant to an analysis of this effort, including the \u201cnature and extent of [the] employee\u2019s job search,\u201d his \u201cintent in conducting\u201d the search and other factors \u201caffecting [an] employee\u2019s capacity to find suitable employment.\u201d 8 Va. App. at 272, 380 S.E.2d at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The burden was on Arellano to prove that \u201c[h]e made a reasonable effort to procure suitable work but [was] unable to market [his] remaining work capacity.\u201d <em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. </em>v. <em>Bateman, 4 </em>Va. App. 459, 464, 359 S.E.2d 98, 101 (1987). Findings of fact by the commission are conclusive and binding on an appellate court if supported by credible evidence; however, in this instance, we find, as a matter of law, that Arellano failed to meet this burden and is not entitled to benefits. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-706 (formerly 65.1-98); <em>Caskey </em>v. <em>Dan River Mills, Inc., </em>225 Va. 405, 411, 302 S.E.2d 507, 510-11 (1983); <em>Tomko </em>v. <em>Michael\u2019s Plastering Co., </em>210 Va. 697, 699, 173 S.E.2d 833, 835 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Pursuant to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), Arellano could not be lawfully employed and legally work in this country, absent a change in his status. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a; <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 40.1-11.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nevertheless, Arellano continued in his unlawful presence in the United States and pursued no lawful employment. Illegal employment is not an acceptable .marketing of remaining work capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">In awarding Arellano benefits, the commission relied on its holding in <em>Francisco v. Formwork Services, Inc., </em>65 O.I.C. 232 (1986), that an employer unlawfully hiring an illegal alien may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>not \u201cescape liability for injuries suffered in . . . employment\u201d by asserting the illegal alien status as a defense to an otherwise valid claim and, thus, \u201cbenefit from its own illegal act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 234. However, <em>Francisco </em>is factually distinguishable from the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In <em>Francisco, </em>the claimant was a direct employee of the employer, had direct contact with the employer, was known personally to the employer and spoke \u201clittle English.\u201d Nevertheless, the employer never inquired into the employee\u2019s work eligibility in the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 233. Under those circumstances, the deputy commissioner found that the employer had hired the worker \u201cat its own peril\u201d and \u201cmay not now use\u201d the \u201cillegal status\u201d as a defense to his claim. <em>Id. </em>at 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">In contrast, Arellano was employed by Serna, a subcontractor of Manis, and Manis, though a statutory employer of Arellano, had no duty to inquire into the work eligibility of his subcontractor\u2019s employees. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(b); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.1; Code \u00a7 65.1-29 <em>et seq. </em>Moreover, Manis knew nothing of Arellano, personally or otherwise, and the record does not disclose other circumstances sufficient to attribute notice of Arellano\u2019s immigration status to Manis and estop this defense to Arellano\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">It is not Arellano\u2019s status as an illegal alien which excludes him from the benefits of the Act but, rather, his resulting inability to properly satisfy requirements imposed on every employee/claimant under Virginia law. We will not sanction a violation of one law by approving it as compliance with another.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">Duff, J., and Moon, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-12\"> Formerly the Industrial Commission of Virginia.
