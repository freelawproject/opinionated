Judge, Assistant Attorney General (Mary Sue Terry, Attorney General, on brief), for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b457-10\">Opinion</p>\n<author id=\"b457-11\">BRAY, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASE\">Steven Wayne Jenkins (defendant) was convicted in a jury trial of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and sentenced by the trial court in accordance with the verdict to ten years imprisonment and fined $10,000. He appeals from an additional order of the trial court which confiscated $870 of defendant\u2019s funds. Defendant complains that this action constituted an unlawful forfeiture. We agree and reverse the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">At the time of defendant\u2019s arrest, police removed and seized $870 from his pockets. Immediately following a hearing and the court\u2019s rulings on defendant\u2019s several post-verdict motions, the Commonwealth moved the court to forfeit these funds \u201cto pay for the fines and costs.\u201d Defendant objected on substantive rather than procedural grounds, complaining that the Commonwealth had failed to establish a sufficient nexus between the money and defendant\u2019s criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-13\">Argument was heard on the issue and the trial court determined \u201cto forfeit the money to the Commonwealth,\u201d to \u201cbe applied to court costs and fine.\u201d An order prepared by the Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>was then entered, spread on the court\u2019s \u201cCriminal Law Book\u201d and lodged in its file of these proceedings. Without actually declaring a forfeiture, this order simply directed \u201cthe Lynchburg Police Department\u201d to \u201cpay over the sum of $870 which it holds in the name of Steve Jenkins to the Clerk\u201d of the trial court \u201cas partial payment upon Mr. Jenkins\u2019 fines and costs in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">It is uncontroverted that the police initially seized defendant\u2019s money pursuant to the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-249. Property subject to \u201clawful seizure\u201d under this statute expressly includes \u201cmoney . . . used in substantial connection with the illegal . . . sale or distribution of controlled substances.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-249(A)(i). All such \u201cseizures and forfeitures\u201d are expressly \u201cgoverned by the procedures contained in Chapter 22.1 of Title 19.2.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-249(B) and Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-386.1 through 19.2-386.14, the referenced statutes, specify, in detail, the proper steps in \u201c[a]n action against any property subject to seizure under the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-249.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">It is well established that forfeiture is appropriate to afford the Commonwealth relief against \u201c \u2018property employed in defiance of the laws of the State.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lincoln Automobile, </em>212 Va. 597, 598, 186 S.E.2d 279, 280 (1972).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Forfeiture is, however, not a criminal proceeding but a \u201ccivil\u201d action against \u201cres\u201d unlawfully employed by its owner or other person.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 599, 186 S.E.2d at 281. Although related to criminal activity, forfeiture is neither \u201cpenalty\u201d nor \u201cpunishment\u201d for an offense and remains entirely separate and distinct from a prosecution of its owner or other individual. <em>Id. </em>at 599-600, 186 S.E.2d at 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The language of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-249 and 19.2-386.1 through 19.2-386.14, the controlling statutes, is \u201cplain, unambiguous, and mandatory.\u201d <em>Haina </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>235 Va. 571, 575, 369 S.E.2d 401, 404 (1988).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The subject matter jurisdiction necessary to forfeiture is conferred upon the trial court only through these several statutes and the court\u2019s authority is dependent upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>scrupulous adherence to their provisions. <em>Id. </em>at 575-76, 369 S.E.2d at 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The order of the trial court confiscating and appropriating defendant\u2019s funds as an incidence of his criminal prosecution did not comply with statutory procedure. Most significantly, the court did not act pursuant to an \u201cinformation,\u201d with attendant rights, including notice right of trial \u201cindependent of any criminal proceeding.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-386.10; <em>see </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-386.1, 386.3 and 386.9. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth contends that defendant\u2019s failure to raise the procedural argument before the trial judge and to sufficiently identify the offending order in his notice of appeal now precludes consideration of this issue. Rule 5A:6, Rule 5A:18. We are also reminded that this Court has only limited jurisdiction in civil matters and that statutory forfeiture procedures provide for appellate review only in the Supreme Court of Virginia. Code \u00a7\u00a7 17-116.05, 17-116.05:1, and 19.2-386.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Assuming, without deciding, that defendant\u2019s objections before the trial court failed to address the relevant procedural deficiencies, we have previously held that \u201cobjections to subject-matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time and are not waivable.\u201d <em>Owusu v. </em>Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 671, 672, 401 S.E.2d 431, 431 (1991); <em>see </em>Rule 5A:18. The Commonwealth\u2019s jurisdictional argument ignores that this appeal arises from the disposition of a criminal case, a matter clearly within our jurisdiction. If this Court were to now decline jurisdiction, defendant, with no civil disposition to appeal elsewhere, would have no remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Accordingly, for the reasons stated, the order of forfeiture is reversed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">Barrow, J., and Elder, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b458-8\"> Although this case related to forfeiture pursuant to another statute, the principles are applicable here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b458-9\"> <em>See </em>Attorney General\u2019s opinion to the Honorable Charles W.
