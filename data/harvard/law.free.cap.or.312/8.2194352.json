State may not recognize or protect this conduct under \u201csexual orientation\u201d or \u201csexual preference\u201d labels, or through quotas, minority status, affirmative action. State, regional and local governments may not promote or condone this conduct. All levels of government, including the state Department of Higher Education and public schools, must set a standard for Oregon\u2019s youth which recognizes this conduct is wrong and unnatural.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">For the reasons that follow, we modify the Attorney General\u2019s Caption and approve his Question and Summary.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-12\">CAPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b45-13\">ORS 250.035(l)(a) requires that the ballot title of a proposed initiative measure shall consist of \u2018e [a] caption of not more than 10 words which reasonably identifies the subject of the measure.\u201d We review for substantial compliance with that requirement. ORS 250.085(4); <em>Reed v.

The Attorney General\u2019s Caption is so general as to be meaningless. The Attorney General\u2019s words, \u201ccertain conduct,\u201d could refer to driving while intoxicated, smoking cigarettes, or owning \u201cpit bull\u201d terriers, for all the Attorney General\u2019s Caption communicates. Thus, the Attorney General\u2019s Caption does not substantially comply with ORS 250.035(l)(a), because it fails reasonably to identify the subject of the measure. Accordingly, we modify the Caption to identify the subject of the measure, <em>i.e., </em>homosexuality and other listed behaviors. We substitute this Caption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-4\">AMENDS CONSTITUTION:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-5\">FORBIDS GOVERNMENT FROM CONDONING HOMOSEXUALITY, OTHER LISTED BEHAVIORS</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">QUESTION AND SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">We have considered petitioners\u2019 arguments concerning the Attorney General\u2019s Question and Summary.
