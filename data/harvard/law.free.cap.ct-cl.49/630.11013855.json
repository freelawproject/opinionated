The brig <em>Bee&gt; </em>whereof Denton James was then master, sailed on a commercial voyage on October 22, 1798, from Edenton, N. C., bound to the island of Barbados. While peacefully pursuing her said voyage she was seized on the high seas on November 24, 1798, by the French privateer <em>La </em>Resolue, Capt. Anthony Friol. When the brig\u2019s papers were handed to the captain of the privateer, the first that he came across was the role d\u2019\u00e9quipage, and finding the brig to be American property, he took no more pains to examine the rest of the papers, but placed a prize master and crew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>on board and carried the vessel into Guadaloupe. Both vessel and cargo were condemned on December 12, 1798, by the commercial tribunal in the island of Guadaloupe, whereby both vessel and cargo became a total loss to the owners thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-6\">The grounds of condemnation in the decree were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-7\">\u201c Considering that the American schooner <em>Bee's </em>expeditions are not conformable to the formalities prescribed by law; that the invoice is not signed by any constituted authorities; that the bill of lading is not signed at all; that the role of equipage is not made before witnesses nor attested by a naval officer; that the notary\u2019s signature, only one, is not even attested; considering in fine that he has no register; that two persons only have given a light certificate at the foot of the role of equipage; -informed that the said schooner was the property of Benjamin Coakley; that those two signatures are not attested; and that the body of that certificate is not equivalent to a register.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-8\">II. The brig <em>Bee </em>was a vessel of he United States carrying a certificate of ownership but without a register.

The vessel at the time of capture was v orth at least the sum insured thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-9\">III. The cargo of the <em>Bee </em>at the time of capture consisted of shingles, staves, and headings, and was owned solely by Benj amin Coakley, the owner of the vessel. But it does not appear that the vessel carried any competent documents to establish the neutrality of said cargo before the French court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-10\">IY.

It appears from the decree of condemnation that \u201cthe invoice is not signed by any constituted authorities \u201d and that \u201c the bill of lading is not signed at all.\u201d There appears in the record a copy of a bill of lading which is signed and a. copy of an invoice which is not signed. This makes some incongruity in the evidence in the case, but, taken together, we think it comes within the case of the Betsey, 36 C. Cls., 256, and that it must be held that the cargo was properly condemned.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">As to the vessel, another question is presented. As to her indentity, the decree recites \u201c that two persons only have given a light certificate at the foot of the role of equipage; informed that the said schooner was the property of Benjamin Coakley; that those two signatures are not attested; and that the body of the certificate is not equivalent to a register.\u201d It thus appears that the <em>Bee </em>was a foreign-built vessel not entitled to registry and.carried some paper purporting to be a certificate of American ownership. In several places in the decree the vessel is mentioned as the \u201cAmerican schooner <em>Bee\u201d </em>and in the protest it is stated that the captain of the French privateer found her to be \u201cAmerican property.\u201d It appears in the record that Benjamin Coakley, at Edenton, N. C., the port from whence the <em>Bee </em>sailed, on the 13th of April, 1799, made oath that he was an American citizen and the sole owner of the schooner <em>Bee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">In the case of the <em>Amiable </em>Nancy, 3 Wheat., 561, the Supreme Court held that the mere absence of all papers affords no just cause of condemnation, but is only a just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>cause of suspicion which may be explained on the preparatory examination. The same doctrine was laid down in an opinion by Howry, J., in the case of the <em>Schooner Hazard. </em>39 C. Cls., 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">In the case before us the decree of condemnation states no claim that the vessel carried contraband goods or had in anywise violated any of the duties of a neutral. She was condemned on the sole ground that the certificate of ownership was not satisfactory to the court, and yet in the very decree of condemnation she is three times declared to be an American vessel. In the same instrument the tribunal acknowledges information that she is the property of Benjamin Coakley, who, as before stated, is shown to have been an American citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">It thus appears that the French tribunal which condemned this vessel had before it proof that the vessel was the property of an American citizen, and had in no manner violated any of the obligations of a neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Taking these items of proof together we are inclined to hold that the <em>Bee </em>carried a certificate which sufficiently identified her as being the property of an American citizen. The decree (as translated) says that it was a \u201clight\u201d certificate, doubtless thereby meaning that a certificate of that character was not equivalent to a register, as afterwards stated. But, as stated, they obtained from it the information that she was owned by Benjamin Coakley, who appears to have been an American citizen, and that was all the information it was necessary for it to convey.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-9\">\u201cA certificate or passport, therefore, from the sovereign of the flag, or a certificate from one of his consuls, that the vessel is owned by one of his citizens or subjects will be a sufficient assurance that the flag, for international purposes, is rightfully carried. * * * Nonregistered ships on the high seas owned by citizens of the United States will be protected by the Government of the United States, so far as concerns their relations to foreign States.\u201d 3 <em>Wharton\u2019s International </em>Law, sec. 410, p. 663.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">Alexander Hamilton, in a letter to the collector of the port of New York, May 13, 1793, said: \u201c Our property, whether in the form of vessels, cargoes, or anything else, has a right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>to pass the seas untouched by any nation by the law of nations; and no one has a right to ask where a vessel is built, but where is she owned? \u201d Id., same section, p. 665.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-4\">\u201cA vessel owned by a citizen of the United States may carry its flag and enjoy the protection of its Government on the high seas, although from the fact that she is foreign built or for some other cause she can not become a registered vessel of the county.\u201d <em>Taylor\u2019s International </em>Law, sec. 264.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The conclusion of the court is that the insurers of the vessel are entitled to indemnity for the insurance paid upon the vessel, but not for insurance paid upon the cargo, and the case will be so reported to Congress, together with a copy of this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
