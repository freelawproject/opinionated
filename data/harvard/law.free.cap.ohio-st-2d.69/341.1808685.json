See <em>State, ex rel. Ruggles, </em>v. <em>Stebbins </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St. 2d 228, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">In interpreting Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-19-02 (formerly IC-19-02), the Industrial Commission determined that it \u201cdoes not apply to this employer and the work in which this employer was engaged * * * .\u201d This interpretation appears reasonable. Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-19-01 (B) provides that \u201c[t]he terms used in these rules shall be interpreted in the most commonly accepted sense consistent with the electric utility industry.\u201d The clear import of this provision is that the rules, themselves, are applicable only to the electric utility industry. The phrase \u201celectric utility industry\u201d is not defined in the Revised Code. However, \u201cthe word \u2018industry\u2019 [has been] defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-11\">\u201c \u20183b. A department or branch of a craft, art, business, or manufacture: a division of productive or profit-making labor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>esp. one that employs a large personnel and capital, esp. in manufacturing, c. a group of productive or profit making enterprises or organizations that have a similar technological structure of production and that produce or supply technically substitutable goods, services or sources of income * * * [Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, Unabridged (1961) ].\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacksonville Port Authority </em>(Fla. 1974), 305 So. 2d 166, 168-69. Similarly, \u201c \u2018Industry\u2019 has been defined as \u2018any department or branch of art, occupation, or business conducted as a means of livelihood or for profit; especially, one which employs much labor and capital and is a distinct branch of trade.\u2019 Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, (4th Ed. 1968) pg. 916.\u201d <em>Development Authority of DeKalb County </em>v. <em>Beverly Enterprises </em>(1981), 247 Ga. 64, 66, 274 S.E. 2d 324.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Utilizing the foregoing definitions, we find that the phrase \u201celectric utility industry\u201d means that industry which is concerned with the production and distribution of electric power. Also, as noted by the Court of Appeals below, the \u201c[specific safety] standards refer to insulative and other requirements that an electric company uses when its employees are working on high voltage electric lines. Tree trimmers do not work on deenergized circuits and do not use equipment like hot tools, plastic line hose, or insulated blankets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">\u201cThis court has held on many occasions that the determination of disputed factual situations as well as the interpretation of a specific safety requirement is within the final jurisdiction of the Industrial Commission. * * * [Citations omitted.]\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Allied Wheel Products, Inc., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1956), 166 Ohio St. 47, 50. Under the circumstances present in this case, we cannot say that the Industrial Commission has abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b379-8\">Celebrezze, C. J., W. Brown, Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown and Krupansky, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
