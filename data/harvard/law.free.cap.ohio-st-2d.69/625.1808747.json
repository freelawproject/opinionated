Util. Comm. </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St. 2d 209, we ruled, at page 215, that the federal government has preempted state regulation of the operational safety of nuclear power plants. Therefore, the commission clearly did not abuse its discretion in refusing to permit North Shore Alert to intervene in the proceedings to raise issues over which the commission has no jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">In reviewing the intervention arguments advanced by the three remaining appellants, we receive precedential guidance from the companion case of <em>Toledo Coalition for Safe Energy </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 559, in which we ruled that the commission, as part of its inherent power to manage the orderly flow of its business, has the discretionary power to permit or deny intervention in its proceedings. See, also, <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St. 2d 220; <em>Dworken </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1938), 133 Ohio St. 208. See, generally, <em>Sanders Transfer, Inc., </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St. 2d 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">In <em>Toledo Coalition for Safe Energy, supra, </em>this court identified those factors which are legally significant in evaluating the commission\u2019s discretionary decisions on permissive intervention. The critical factors include, <em>inter alia: </em>the nature and extent of the prospective intervenor\u2019s interest; the legal position advanced by the prospective intervenor and its probable relation to the merits of the case; whether the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>spective intervenor\u2019s interests are adequately represented by other parties; whether intervention will prolong or unduly delay the case; and whether the party seeking intervention will significantly contribute to full development and equitable resolution of the underlying factual issues in the case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Applying these criteria to the appellants, we find that the commission correctly decided to prohibit their intervention on the rate base and operating expense issues because (1) appellants failed to demonstrate any limited, identifiable interest which differentiated them from ordinary residential customers of CEI who were already represented in this proceeding by Consumers\u2019 Counsel and, to a lesser extent, the city of Cleveland, and (2) failed to demonstrate that Consumers\u2019 Counsel and the city of Cleveland did not adequately represent appellants\u2019 interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">As such, appellants failed to make the \u201ccompelling showing,\u201d which we required in <em>Toledo Coalition for Safe Energy, supra, </em>as a prerequisite to intervention in cases where the interest of a party and a prospective intervenor are virtually identical. Limiting intervention in these situations enables the commission to avoid undue delay and unnecessary duplication of effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">By the same reasoning, however, the commission properly allowed the Coalition to intervene on the rate and tariff design issues because the resolution of these issues necessarily entails some groups of customers having specific interests that conflict with the residential class as a whole.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">In reviewing the commission\u2019s decision on the distribution of the revenue increase among the various CEI customer classes, this court will not disturb the findings and order of the commission unless it appears from the record that such findings and order are manifestly against the weight of the evidence and are so clearly unsupported by the record as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>show misapprehension or mistake or willful disregard of duty. <em>Cleveland Elec. Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St. 2d 403, paragraph eight of the syllabus, certiorari denied 423 U. S. 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">In deciding how to distribute the revenue increase the commission adopted the \u201cbase-rates-excluding-fuel\u201d method. A review of the record reveals that: (1) this was the method recommended, at the outset of the proceedings, by the commission\u2019s staff; (2) several expert witnesses testified in favor of this method; and (3) a stipulation<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> entered into by CEI, the city of Cleveland, and the IEC supported this method.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Furthermore, the record reflects that appellants did not object to the aforementioned stipulation and did not present any evidence challenging the commission\u2019s revenue distribution, despite the fact that appellants had been granted limited intervention on this precise issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">After assessing the voluminous documents, evidence, testimony, and competing inferences in this case, the commission decided to adopt the \u201cbase-rates-excluding-fuel\u201d method of distributing the revenue increase. After a careful review of the record in this case, we conclude that the commission\u2019s adoption of the \u201cbase-rates-excluding-fuel\u201d method of distributing the revenue increase is consistent with the manifest weight of the evidence and is clearly supported by the record. <em>Cleveland Elec. Illuminating Co., supra. </em>See, also, <em>Sanders Transfer, Inc., supra, </em>at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Accordingly, for all the foregoing reasons, the order of the commission is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b665-10\">Celebrezze, C. J., W. Brown, Sweeney, Holmes, C.

Therefore, since the abuse of discretion test is essentially one of reasonableness, it is unnecessary for this court to decide whether Ohio Adm. Code 4901-1-04 or 4901-1-11 applies to appellants\u2019 petition for leave to intervene.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b664-10\"> See <em>Toledo Coalition for Safe Energy </em>v. <em>Pub.
