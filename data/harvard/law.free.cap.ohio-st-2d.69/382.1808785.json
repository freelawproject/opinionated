Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsC\">In any action seeking construction of a will the court\u2019s sole purpose is to ascertain and carry out the intention of the testator. Such intention must be ascertained from the words contained in the will. <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Stradley </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St. 2d 220, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>Townsend\u2019s Exrs. </em>v. <em>Townsend </em>(1874), 25 Ohio St. 477, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus. In this case, there is no question Sampson intended to exercise the power of appointment in favor of defendant-appellant charities. The issue is whether he effectively carried out that intent by the language he employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">Our duty to ascertain and carry out the intention of the testator requires us to consider the language used by the two testators in the two instruments under consideration. Mrs. Kirkpatrick, who created the testamentary trust, the assets of which are now in dispute, intended to create a special testa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>mentary power of appointment in her son over the trust assets. A \u201cspecial power\u201d is one limited by excluding certain persons from taking under the power of disposition given the appointee. See 43A Ohio Jurisprudence 2d 408-409, Powers, Section 5, and cases cited therein. Here, Mrs. Kirkpatrick limited her son\u2019s power of appointment by excluding as beneficiaries of the trust both his estate and creditors of his estate. By creating a special power of appointment Mrs. Kirkpatrick intended to avoid inclusion of her trust property in her son\u2019s estate, thereby protecting the assets from depletion by creditors and avoiding imposition of an estate tax on the Kirkpatrick trust assets at the time of Sampson\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">When Sampson attempted to exercise his limited power of appointment, he specified the source of the power and complied with the command that the power be exercised through his last will and testament. If the power is deemed not effectively exercised, it is due to his choice of language commanding the property \u201cbe made a part of my estate,\u201d in apparent contradiction of the donor\u2019s express limitation on permissible beneficiaries. However, neither creditors nor the taxing authorities reached the assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Precedent with considerable vintage establishes that a power must be strictly pursued, and must be executed according to the manifest intent of the testator. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Galloway </em>(1823), 1 Ohio 232, 234. The lower courts chose to take the narrowest view possible of the attempted exercise, and concluded that Sampson violated an express limitation on the power of appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Appellant charities contend that the term \u201cbe made a part of my estate\u201d referred not to Sampson\u2019s probate estate, but rather, the term was used to permit use of the trust funds to satisfy the specific bequests made by Sampson to his lineal descendants, should his probate estate be insufficient for such purposes. The remainder of the trust funds would then be available for disposition \u201cunder the terms\u201d of the residuary clause to the named charities.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Under Ohio law, gifts for charitable purposes are favored, and are construed to give them effect, if possible. <em>Gearhart </em>v. <em>Richardson </em>(1924), 109 Ohio St. 418. It is apparent that the donee of the power of appointment intended the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>charities to receive the assets of the Kirkpatrick trust. But for the ill-advised use of the term \u201cbe made a part of my estate\u201d in Item IV of his will, such intent would clearly be effectuated.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Where a testator, by his will, expressly exercises a power of appointment, it is presumed that he intended to exercise it effectively and a court must construe the language used by the testator in exercising such power to give effect to the exercise if such a construction is possible. <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Hrobon </em>(1953), 158 Ohio St. 508, 518; <em>McMerriman </em>v. <em>Schiel </em>(1923), 108 Ohio St. 334; <em>Banning </em>v. <em>Banning </em>(1861), 12 Ohio St. 437; <em>Pruden </em>v. <em>Pruden </em>(1862), 14 Ohio St. 251; 56 Ohio Jurisprudence 2d Wills, Sections 510, 523, 524, 535 and 583. See 4 Page on Wills, Sections 30.10 and 32.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The reasonable meaning that should be given to the words \u201cmy estate\u201d as used in Item IV, consistent with Sampson\u2019s overall dispositive plan, is the total property over which the decedent had a power of testamentary disposition, both probate and non-probate. The words \u201cand disposed of under the terms of this my Last Will and Testament\u201d in Item IV incorporate by reference the dispositive \u201cterms\u201d of Item V1 of Sampson\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">We find that the term \u201cestate\u201d, as used in Sampson\u2019s will, is susceptible to various meanings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the words used in a will are to be taken in their primary or ordinary sense, there are situations when it is manifest from the context of the entire will or the subject matter that the testator intended to use them in a different sense. <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Hrobon, supra </em>at 518. In such a case, it is incumbent on the courts to arrive at a construction consistent with the overall intent of the testator, so as to uphold all parts of the will. Such a construction requires the courts to consider the circumstances surrounding the drafting of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">As Judge Ranney observed many years ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-9\">\u201cBut language, at best and when used with propriety, is a very imperfect vehicle of thought, and we seldom appreciate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>correctly its nicer shades of meaning, without an accurate knowledge of the persons and things to which it is applied. It is in view of this fact, that the law not only allows but requires the instrument to be read in the light of the surrounding circumstances, and permits the introduction of such extrinsic evidence as will enable the court to place itself in his situation, to see things as he saw them, and to apply his language as he understood and intended it.\u201d <em>Pruden </em>v. <em>Pruden, supra, </em>at 256-257.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Evidence introduced at the trial indicates the testator\u2019s fear that his estate was insufficient to satisfy the specific bequest made to his children. For this reason, the language requiring the trust \u201cbe made a part of my estate\u201d was included. Given this circumstance, the reasonable meaning of the phrase is that the trust assets would become part of the estate only in the event of a shortfall in the property available for the specific bequests. No such shortfall occurred. Therefore, the trust property need not have passed into Sampson\u2019s probate estate, but was used entirely as a charitable bequest, under his residuary clause. This is the reasonable meaning we attach to the phrase, thereby upholding all parts of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The Probate Court, as a court of equity, had the power to supply any defect in the execution of a power granted a donee. <em>Barr </em>v. <em>Hatch </em>(1829), 3 Ohio 527, 529. \u201c * * * But if by reason of mistake, accident or ignorance the power was defectively executed, it is within the power of the court in this case to make it effectual. \u2018Whenever a man, having power over an estate, whether of ownership or not, in discharge of his moral or natural obligations, shows an intention to execute such power, the court will operate upon the conscience of the heir or other person benefited by the default to make him perfect this intention.\u2019 <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>3 Brown Ch., 229; <em>Barr </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>3 Ohio 527; Bispham, Eq., Secs. 193, 195.\u201d <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Trustees of Ohio State University </em>(1904), 70 Ohio St. 92, 110. See 43A Ohio Jurisprudence 2d, 438-439 Powers, Section 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Given the expressed intent of the donee to exercise his power of appointment, and his designation of various charitable institutions as recipients of this bounty, this court finds and determines that the Probate Court should have exercised its inherent equitable powers to give effect to the attempted exercise at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed. The power of appointment was clearly expressed and exercised by Sampson in Item IV of his will to the named beneficiaries in Item V thereof, and this cause is remanded to the Probate Court for disposition consistent with this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b425-5\">Sweeney, Locher, Holmes and Krupansky, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b425-6\">Celebrezze, C. J., and W. Brown, J., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b423-10\"> Sampson referred variously to \u201cthe principal of my estate,\u201d \u201cmy residuary estate,\u201d and \u201cthe adjusted gross estate\u201d in Item I of his will, while in Item III, he referred not only to \u201cmy estate\" and \u201cmy adjusted gross estate,\u201d but also to <em>\u201cmy </em>estate for purposes of Federal Estate Tax.\u201d All these uses of \u201cestate\u201d may have different meanings in their various contexts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
