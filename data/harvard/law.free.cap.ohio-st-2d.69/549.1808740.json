R. C. Chapter 1303 (Article 3, U.C.C.) provides that a holder in due course takes the instrument free from most defenses and claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> One such defense which is of no avail when raised against a holder in due course is want of consideration, the defense raised by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">Whether one is a holder in due course is an issue which does not arise unless it is shown a defense exists. Once it is established a defense exists, the holder has the full burden of proving holder in due course status in all respects.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>There are five requirements which, under R. C. 1303.31 (UCC 3-302),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> one must meet in order to establish holder in due course status: viz., (1) one must be a \u201cholder\u201d as defined in R. C. 1301.01(T) (UCC 1-201); (2) one must be in possession of an \u201cinstrument,\u201d as explained in R. C. 1303.01(A)(5) (UCC 3-102[A] [5]; (3) \u201cvalue,\u201d as set forth in R. C. 1303.32 (UCC 3-303), must have been given for the instrument; (4) the instrument must have been taken in \u201cgood faith,\u201d as defined at R. C. 1301.01(S) (UCC 1-201); and (5) the purchaser must take the instrument without notice that it is overdue or has been dishonored or of any defense against or claim to it on the part of any person, as detailed at R. C. 1303.33 (UCC 3-304). All five of these requirements must be met to qualify as a holder in due course. A transferee who otherwise qualifies as a holder in due course, but who takes an instrument with notice of a defense to it on the part of any person is therefore not a holder in due course. Likewise, one who does not take an instrument in good faith is not a holder in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Appellant contends appellee has not established holder in due course status because appellee took the instrument with notice of a defense against it. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The requirement that the purchaser take the instrument without notice of a claim or defense in order to qualify as a holder in due course is explained, under the heading of \u201cNotice to Purchaser,\u201d at R. C. 1303.33 (UCC 3-304), which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">\u201c(A) The purchaser has notice of a claim or defense if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\">\u201c(1) The instrument is so incomplete, bears such visible evidence of forgery or alteration, or is otherwise so irregular as to call into question its validity, terms, or ownership or to create an ambiguity as to the party to pay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Whether a transferee has taken an instrument with notice of a defense depends upon all the facts and circumstances of a particular situation and is generally a question of fact to be determined by the trier of fact. <em>Rood </em>v. <em>McCann </em>(1957), 103 Ohio App. 55; <em>Wakem </em>v. <em>Leroy </em>(1928), 33 Ohio App. 265; <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>The Ohio Contract Purchase Co. </em>(1926), 23 Ohio App. 445. One situation when a bank was denied holder in due course status was found in <em>First National Bank of Linton </em>v. <em>Otto Huber and Sons, Inc. </em>(D. C. S. D. 1975), 394 F. Supp. 1284. This case held the bank had notice of a defense because of an ambiguity involving the due date; the note was considered irregular on its face. Similarly, when a transferee receives a note which is blank except for the maker\u2019s signature, the note is irregular on its face. The transferee takes with notice of a defense and is therefore not a holder in due course of the note. <em>Salter </em>v. <em>Mutual Finance Co. </em>(1957), 106 Ohio App. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">In the case <em>subjudice, </em>the trial court, sitting as fact finder, weighed the evidence of the relationship between appellee and appellant and reasoned: \u201cThe defect on the promissory note is that the signature of Carla Hessler was added by Kenneth Hessler and, since the Arcanum National Bank handled the Hesslers\u2019 personal finances,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it should have noticed that there was a defect on the face of the instrument. * * * The note also bears the initials \u2018K.H.\u2019 indicating that Kenneth Hessler had signed Carla Hessler\u2019s name.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court specifically found \u201cthis \u2018irregularity\u2019 does call into question the validity of the note, the terms of the note, the ownership of the note or create an ambiguity as to the party who is to pay the note.\u201d Thus, the trial court, while specifically finding appellee took the note with notice of a defense, nonetheless erroneously held appellee bank qualified as a holder in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">We hold, therefore, when the trier of fact finds a transferee took a note with notice of a defense, the legal conclusion which follows from such finding is the transferee cannot benefit from holder in due course status<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the maker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>may assert all valid defenses. Since the fact finder in this case specifically found appellee bank took the note with notice of a defense, appellee cannot qualify as a holder in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Appellant also contends, in essence, appellee bank failed in its burden of proving holder in due course status because appellee failed to establish it took the note in good faith as required under R. C. 1303.31(A)(2) [UCC 3-302(A)(2) ].</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">\u201cGood faith\u201d is defined as \u201chonesty in fact in the conduct or transaction concerned.\u201d R. C. 1301.01(S) [UCC 1-201(19) ]. Under the \u201cclose connectedness\u201d doctrine, which was established by the Supreme Court of New Jersey in <em>Unico </em>v. <em>Owen </em>(1967), 50 N. J. 101, 232 A. 2d 405, a transferee does not take an instrument in good faith when the transferee is so closely connected with the transferor that the transferee may be charged with knowledge of an infirmity in the underlying transaction. The rationale for the close connectedness doctrine was enunciated in <em>Unico, </em>at pages 109-110, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">\u201cIn the field of negotiable instruments, good faith is a broad concept. The basic philosophy of the holder in due course status is to encourage free negotiability of commercial paper by removing certain anxieties of one who takes the paper as an innocent purchaser knowing no reason why the paper is not sound as its face would indicate. It would seem to follow, therefore, that the more the holder knows about the underlying transaction, and particularly the more he controls or participates or becomes involved in it, the less he fits the role of a good faith purchaser for value; the closer his relationship to the underlying agreement which is the source of the note, the less need there is for giving him the tension-free rights considered necessary in a fast-moving, credit-extending world.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHE\">Soon after the decision in <em>Unico </em>was reached, the close connectedness doctrine was adopted by Ohio courts. Headnote No. 2 in <em>American Plan Corp. </em>v. Woods (1968), 16 Ohio App. 2d 1, announced the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-8\">\u201cA transferee of a negotiable note does not take in \u2018good faith\u2019 and is not a holder in due course of a note given in the sale of consumer goods where the transferee is a finance company involved with the seller of the goods, and which has a per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>vasive knowledge of factors relating to the terms of the sale.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Similarly, in <em>Security Central Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1976), 52 Ohio App. 2d 175, a finding that the transferee did not take the note in good faith was justified when the transferee-bank was alerted to the possibility that the underlying transaction which generated the note was not a completely above-board transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">According to White and Summers, noted authorities on the Uniform Commercial Code, the following five factors are indicative of a close connection between the transferee and transferor:</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">(1) Drafting by the transferee of forms for the transferor; (2) approval or establishment or both of the transferor\u2019s procedures by the transferee <em>(e.g., </em>setting the interest rate, approval of a referral sales plan); (3) an independent check by the transferee on the credit of the debtor or some other direct contact between the transferee and the debtor; (4) heavy reliance by the transferor upon the transferee <em>(e.g., </em>transfer by the transferor of all or substantial part of his paper to the transferee) and; (5) common or connected ownership or management of the transferor and transferee. <em>White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code </em>481 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">An analysis of the above factors in relation to the facts of this case, as set forth in the trial court\u2019s findings, reveals an unusually close relationship between appellee bank (the transferee), the John Smith Grain Company (the transferorpayee) and J &amp; J Farms, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">Appellee provided John Smith Grain Company with the forms used in the transaction and supplied the interest rate to be charged. At the time of the purchase of the first note, appellee bank ran an independent credit check on appellant. There is evidence of a heavy reliance by John Smith Grain Company upon appellee bank insofar as it was customary for the grain company to transfer substantially all of its commercial paper to appellee bank. There was not only a common director of appellee and John Smith Grain Company, but also common directors or management between John Smith Grain Company and J &amp; J Farms, Inc. H. K. Smith was a director of appellee bank and the president and director of John Smith Grain Company. C. North, Jr., was an officer and director of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>both John Smith Grain Company and J &amp; J Farms, Inc. John Milton Smith was officer and director of John Smith Grain Company and officer of J &amp; J Farms, Inc. In addition, the trial court found that B. Henninger, the executive vice-president of appellee who had previously been employed by John Smith Grain Company, frequented John Smith Grain Company several times a week between November 1976 and January 1977 to advise the officers of John Smith Grain Company on business practices. During that time, John Smith Grain Company was experiencing serious financial difficulties.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The facts of this case clearly indicate such close connectedness between appellee bank and John Smith Grain Company as to impute knowledge by appellee bank of infirmities in the underlying transaction. The trial court specifically found, in its separate findings of fact and conclusions of law, the relationship between appellee bank and J &amp; J Farms was not an arm\u2019s length relationship. In spite of this finding, the trial court erroneously concluded \u201cthe facts do not permit the court to void the holder in due course protections under these circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The trial court reasoned as follows: \u201cEven if the bank were aware, through its Director, Tim [H. K.] Smith, of the perilous financial condition of John Smith Grain Company, the bank had every right to anticipate that the note could be paid by J &amp; J Farms when the pigs were sold.\u201d Given the circumstances of this case, <em>i.e., </em>the common directors or management between appellee bank, John Smith Grain Company and J &amp; J Farms, Inc., the trial court as fact finder could quite reasonably conclude appellee was aware, at the time it bought the note, of the troubled financial situation of John Smith Grain Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The trial court, however, missed the point. Not only do the facts indicate appellee bank was aware of the impending bankruptcy of John Smith Grain Company, but they also show appellee had reason to know of a fatal infirmity in the underlying transaction, viz., there was no consideration given by John Smith Grain Company for the note. C. North, Jr., an officer and director of both John Smith Grain Company and J &amp; J Farms, Inc., obtained appellant's signature and advised appellant to sign his wife\u2019s name on the note. As an officer and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>director of J &amp; J Farms, Inc., C. North, Jr., undoubtedly was aware that at the time he obtained appellant\u2019s signature, the hogs had already been mortgaged by J &amp; J Farms, Inc. It is well-established in Ohio a corporation can act only through its officer and agents, and the knowledge of the officers of a corporation is at once the knowledge of the corporation. <em>The First Nat\u2019l Bank of New Bremen </em>v. <em>Burns </em>(1913), 88 Ohio St. 434. If North, as officer and director of both John Smith Grain Company and J &amp; J Farms, Inc., knew there was no consideration for the note, then such knowledge is imputed to both corporations. Thus, H. K. Smith, as president and director of John Smith Grain Company, had ample reason to know of the failure of consideration; and since H. K. Smith was also a director of appellee bank, his knowledge is imputed to appellee bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The executive vice-president of appellee bank, B. Henninger, who had previously been employed by John Smith Grain Company, was also in close contact with John Smith Grain Company at the time appellant signed the note. According to the trial court\u2019s conclusions, at the time appellant\u2019s signature was obtained on the note, B. Henninger was meeting several times a week with the officers of John Smith Grain Company to advise them on business practices. At that time, the officers of John Smith Grain Company included H. K. Smith, who was also a director of appellee bank, and C. North, Jr., who was also an officer and director of J &amp; J Farms, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Given these facts, one cannot conclude with absolute certainty that appellee bank had actual knowledge of the failure of consideration. As appellant correctly states in his brief, however, the doctrine of close connectedness was developed in part because of the difficulty of proving the transferee\u2019s actual knowledge of problems in the underlying transaction. The doctrine allows the court to imply knowledge by the transferee when the relationship between the transferee and transferor is sufficiently close to warrant such an implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Under the circumstances of this case, we find the relationship between appellee bank and John Smith Grain Company was so entwined that it was error for the trial court not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>apply the doctrine of close connectedness to find appellee bank failed to carry its burden of proving good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">If we accept the trial court\u2019s findings of fact and apply the close connectedness doctrine, we can reach only one conclusion, viz., appellee bank did not take the note in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Upon either one or both of the above reasoned theories, <em>i.e., </em>(1) notice of a defense and (2) close connectedness doctrine, we find the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial court\u2019s finding that appellee bank was a holder in due course. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is, therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b594-7\">Sweeney, Locher, Holmes and C.
