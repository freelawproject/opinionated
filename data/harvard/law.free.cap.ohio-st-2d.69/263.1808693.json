C. 5739.02(B)(17).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This provision, commonly referred to as the \u201cuse on use\u201d exemption, created \u201ca tax exemption for machinery being used, not to transform raw materials into a part of the product produced for sale, but rather to produce still further \u2018machinery\u2019 to be used in manufacturing the ultimate product.\u201d <em>Interlake </em>v. <em>Kosydar </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St. 2d 457, at page 468 (Paul W. Brown, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">The \u201cuse on use\u201d exemption was enacted in 1962, re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>pealed in 1967, and reenacted in 1978 as R. C. 5739.02(B)(25). The commissioner argues that appellee\u2019s 1965 direct pay permit was issued pursuant to former R. C. 5739.02(B)(17), and, that in 1967, when the \u201cuse on use\u201d exemption was repealed, so too was appellee\u2019s permit. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Appellee\u2019s direct pay permit, issued in 1960, and premised upon the direct use exemption provided in R. C. 5739.01(E)(2), predated the enactment of the \u201cuse on use\u201d exemption. Further, the evidence adduced before the board unequivocally demonstrates that subsequent permit revisions, in 1962, and 1965, continued to exempt the carbon anode plant under the direct use exemption. Accordingly, we view the repeal of R. C. 5739.02(B)(17) as having no impact upon appellee\u2019s permit, since the permit was never predicated upon that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Additionally, the commissioner contends that the board erred in its determination that the subject permit was canceled \u201cwithout cause.\u201d We agree. R. C. 5739.031 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">\u201cA permit granted pursuant to this section shall continue to be valid until surrendered by the holder or canceled for cause by the commissioner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">We view this language as providing sufficient cause for cancellation where, as in the cause <em>sub judice, </em>the commissioner discovers that a taxpayer has been extended an exemption due to a mistake of law. Accordingly, the commissioner\u2019s letter, dated February 25, 1977, in which appellee was notified that the \u201c1965 [permit] is no longer approved or accepted,\u201d operated as a cancellation of the permit for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">The question remains, however, whether the commissioner may retroactively assess appellee. The commissioner argues that to prohibit the subject assessment of sales and use taxes would, in effect, constitute estoppel. It is well-established that \u201cthe principle of estoppel does not apply against the state with regard to a taxing statute.\u201d <em>American Handling Equipment Co. </em>v. <em>Kosydar </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St. 2d 150, 153; <em>H. C. Albring Co. </em>v. <em>Kosydar </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St. 2d 343, 345; <em>Switzer </em>v. <em>Kosydar </em>(1973), 36 Ohio St. 2d 65, 67. However, this court has recognized an exception to that general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">In <em>Recording Devices </em>v. <em>Bowers </em>(1963), 174 Ohio St. 518, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>the taxpayer relied upon a letter from the commissioner stating that it was not responsible for the collection of sales tax in conjunction with the installation of time lock systems. In affirming the denial of an assessment, this court stated, at page 520:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">\u201c * * * [Ajlthough the equitable principle of estoppel cannot operate against the state of Ohio, and * * * the Tax Commissioner cannot be bound in all cases by acts or opinions of employees, yet where a long-established practice has been followed, such administrative practice does have much persuasive weight especially where the practice has gone on unchallenged for a quarter of a century.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">We find this rationale both persuasive and controlling. The differences between the present cause and <em>Recording Devices, supra, </em>are minimal. In both instances an exemption was granted, in writing, by the commissioner. Further, the error continued for an extended period of time. In <em>Recording Devices </em>the practice continued for 25 years. In the instant case, appellee consulted with the commissioner\u2019s office during the construction of the plant to ascertain sales and use tax liability on each item of machinery acquired for use in the plant. Mr. Jack W. Winner, a tax agent, was assigned to work with appellee on this project, which began in the mid 1950\u2019s. In 1977, Winner, then a supervisor of the audit review section of the commissioner\u2019s office, issued the letter canceling appellee\u2019s permit. Thus, while the initial permit arose in 1960, the commissioner\u2019s office viewed the carbon anode plant as exempt from the beginning of its construction \u2014 over 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Moreover, the present cause is distinguishable from those cases in which the taxpayer relies \u201csolely upon an alleged verbal statement by an unidentified agent of the Department of Taxation.\u201d <em>Switzer, supra, </em>at page 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, as modified, is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b302-10\">Celebrezze, C.
