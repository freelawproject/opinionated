Appellee correctly observes that we should apply the usual and ordinary meaning for this term unless its meaning is ambiguous. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St. 2d 138, 140, quoting, with approval, <em>Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Hartzell Bros. Co. </em>(1924), 109 Ohio St. 566, 569. Therefore, appellee urges us to adopt the ordinary definition of \u201centitled.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Yet, we must read the word \u201centitled\u201d in context. That is, Section 7F refers to the insured\u2019s being \u201centitled under the Hospital Insurance portion * * * of Title One of Public Law 89-97 cited as \u2018Health Insurance for the Aged Act\u2019 * * Title 42 of the United States Code codifies the relevant portions of Public Law 89-97. At the time of appellant\u2019s hospitalization, Section 426, Title 42, U. S. Code, provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">\u201c(a) Every individual who\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">\u201c(1) has attained age 65, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">\u201c(2) is <em>entitled </em>to monthly insurance benefits under section 402 of this title or is a qualified railroad retirement beneficiary, shall be <em>entitled </em>to hospital insurance benefits* * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">At the same time, Section 402 of Title 42 provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-10\">\u201c(a) Every individual who\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-11\">\u201c(1) is a fully insured individual (as defined in section 414 [a] of this title),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-12\">\u201c(2) has attained age 62, <em>and</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-13\">\u201c(3) <em>has filed application </em>for old-age insurance benefits or was entitled to disability insurance benefits for the month preceding the month in which he attained the age of 65, shall be <em>entitled </em>to an old-age insurance benefit * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Clearly, one of the prerequisites to being \u201centitled\u201d to Medicare is filing an application in accordance with Section 402(a)(3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We must impute knowledge (or at least constructive knowledge) of the provisions of Public Law 89-97 to appellee, because agents for appellee drafted the Employee Certificate. Likewise, we must construe the ambiguity arising from any difference between the dictionary definition of \u201centitled\u201d and its definition in Public Law 89-97 against appellee. \u201cA contract of insurance prepared and phrased by the insurer is to be construed liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer, where the meaning of the language used is doubtful, uncertain or ambiguous. (Paragraph one of the syllabus of <em>Toms </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>146 Ohio St. 39, approved and followed.)\u201d <em>Munchick </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co. </em>(1965), 2 Ohio St. 2d 303, paragraph one of the syllabus. This rationale coincides with the previous statements of this court that exclusions in an insurance contract are not preferred. See <em>Home Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Plymouth </em>(1945), 146 Ohio St. 96, paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>American Financial Corp. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St. 2d 171, 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and remand the cause to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b341-5\">Celebrezze, C. J., W. Brown, Sweeney, Locher and C. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b341-6\">Holmes and Krupansky, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-14\"> The Court of Appeals, in its opinion, used the definition of the verb \u201centitle\u201d found in Webster\u2019s New Internationa] Dictionary, Second Edition: \u201c[t]o give a right or legal title to * * We note, however, that the right to something may be different than the legal title. For example, a purchaser under a contract for sale of real property acquires various rights but <em>not legal title. </em>See <em>Churchill </em>v. <em>Little </em>(1872), 23 Ohio St. 301, 307. Whether this nuance is consciously or otherwise part of the usual and ordinary meaning is, of course, uncertain. Nevertheless, this uncertainty demonstrates that the use of the word \u201centitled\u201d in Section 7F is ambiguous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b340-6\"> Paul T. Jones, District Manager of the Social Security Administration, testified on direct examination by appellant that one must apply for Medicare to be entitled to benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">\"Q. Mr. Jones, how does a person get a hospital bill covered by Medicare?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">\u201cA. He files a claim for benefits, and if he is insured and meets the other conditions, he would be entitled to Medicare benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-9\">\u201cQ. A person must apply for the coverage in order to become entitled to the benefits?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-10\">\u201cA. Yes. The basic conditions would be age 65, file an application, and be insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-11\">\u201cQ. It is not enough then just to be 65 and fully insured?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-12\">\u201cA. No. You must file an application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-13\">\u201cQ. So, a person must apply to become entitled to the benefits?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-14\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-15\"><em>U </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-16\">\u201cQ. So, Mr. Jones, a person must apply to become entitled to these benefits?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-17\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-18\">\u201cQ. Can a person get the benefits without applying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-19\">\u201cA. No. You mean by \u2018without applying,\u2019 without a formal application? No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-20\">\u201cQ. What if the person is eligible for the benefits but he hasn\u2019t applied for them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-21\">\u201cA. Wouldn\u2019t be entitled.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b340-22\"> Our determination as to the meaning of the word \u201centitled\u201d is a sufficient basis for reversal. Therefore, we need not review appellant\u2019s other propositions of law: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>whether appellee\u2019s acceptance of premiums operates as an estoppel and whether the trial court erred by denying appellant\u2019s request for a jury trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b341-7\">Krupansky, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AzI\">dissenting. In my opinion, the majority decision creates an ambiguity in the meaning of the contract by assigning a highly technical definition to a common English word. I must, therefore, respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">It is well-established that words in an insurance contract are to be read according to their common ordinary meaning, unless there is an ambiguity. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St. 2d 138; <em>Olmstead </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mutl. Ins. Co. </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St. 2d 212. As stated in <em>Yeager </em>v. <em>Pacific Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>(1956), 166 Ohio St. 71, paragraph two of the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">\u201cAn insurance policy constitutes a contract, its terms must be given a reasonable construction, and an ambiguity which is created by giving a strained or unnatural meaning to phrases or by mere casuistry does not constitute an ambiguity requiring construction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">In the majority\u2019s opinion, \u201centitled\u201d should be construed according to the highly technical meaning of that term as used in Section 426, Title 42, U. S. Code. The result is a strained construction given to an otherwise unambiguous word.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">As the Court of Appeals correctly noted, when \u201centitle\u201d is given its common ordinary meaning, it is clear appellant was entitled to receive Medicare benefits. It is undisputed that appellant had a right to have his hospital expenses covered under Medicare, but in refusing to apply, he elected not to receive Medicare benefits. The record reveals appellant could have recovered under Medicare even if he had delayed applying for 12 months after the hospital expenses were incurred. Appellant however voluntarily declined to avail himself of the Medicare benefits to which he was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">The necessity of applying for Medicare was made known to appellant when he received the following message in a letter from Suburban Community Hospital: \u201cBlue Cross has refused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>payment until you sign up for Medicare. Since you refuse to do this we have no other choice but to transfer your account to self pay.\u201d Regarding this letter, appellant testified \u201cI didn\u2019t think this was legitimate.\u201d Yet, according to appellant\u2019s testimony, he never contacted Blue Cross to inquire about the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Thus, appellant was notified by Suburban Community Hospital to apply for Medicare, and although he still had six months within which to apply after receiving this notice, he refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The majority decision permits appellant to choose between coverage under the Blue Cross policy and Medicare when the clear language of Section 7F of the Blue Cross policy provides that it does not insure for services which can be furnished under Medicare. Section 7F cannot mean appellant has the option of avoiding its effects indefinitely simply by refusing to apply for Medicare; such an interpretation renders Section 7F meaningless and penalizes Blue Cross for appellant\u2019s failure to excercise his rights under Medicare. As stated in <em>Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Hartzell Bros. Co. </em>(1924), 109 Ohio St. 566, 569, \u201cthis court cannot make a new contract for the parties where they themselves have employed express and unambiguous terms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Appellant argues Blue Cross should be estopped from asserting Section 7F as a defense because Blue Cross continued to accept premiums from appellant after it knew appellant was entitled to Medicare. The gist of appellant\u2019s argument is, because appellant was paying premiums for full coverage, Section 7F should be read out of the policy. This argument ignores Section 10F of appellant\u2019s policy which gave appellant the option of electing coverage under a policy designed for persons eligible for Medicare benefits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If appellant had chosen to enroll under such a policy, his premiums would have been less expensive. According to his testimony, however, appellant neglected to read his policy, and he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>unaware of this option. He, therefore, continued to pay the higher premiums, and he now claims Blue Cross\u2019 acceptance of those premiums somehow induced him to continue paying them. It is difficult to see how Blue Cross should be held responsible for appellant\u2019s failure to choose a policy with reduced premiums when appellant\u2019s policy clearly informed him of his option to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Appellant\u2019s final argument is that the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for \u201cJury Trial Notwithstanding Waiver.\u201d The Court of Appeals found appellant\u2019s motion for a jury trial, which was filed some eight months after the complaint was filed, failed to show the denial of a jury trial would prejudice his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Appellant argues the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to order a jury trial. A party claiming abuse of discretion carries a heavy burden. Indeed, as one Ohio appellate court has stated: \u201cTo constitute an abuse of discretion, an unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable attitute on the part of the trial court must be shown by the party asserting a claimed abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Jennings Transfer Co. </em>(1967), 14 Ohio App. 2d 221, 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">In his \u201cBrief in Support of Motion for Jury Trial,\u201d appellant\u2019s counsel explained that subsequent to filing the complaint, he learned through discovery that certain questions of fact would be crucial in the case. The trial court, upon denying appellant\u2019s motion, found counsel\u2019s delay in discovery was not good cause. There appears to be nothing unreasonable in the trial court\u2019s finding. In my opinion, there was no abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion nor reversible error in the denial of appellant\u2019s untimely request for a jury trial. The Court of Appeals correctly found appellant failed to demonstrate abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b343-9\">Holmes, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b342-7\"> Section 10F of appellant\u2019s Blue Cross policy provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">\u201cAny Certificate Holder, or his spouse if enrolled under this Certificate becoming eligible for coverage under the Hospital Insurance Portion of Title One of Public Law 89-97 (Medicare), by reason of reaching the age of sixty-five (65) or otherwise, shall be entitled to enroll for a Certificate then being issued by the Plan specifically for persons eligible for Medicare of the same general class as this Certificate. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
