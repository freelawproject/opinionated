C. 2305.11(A) bars the appellants\u2019 actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>R. C. 2305.11(A) provides, in pertinent part: \u201cAn action for * * * malpractice, including an action for malpractice against a physician, podiatrist, or a hospital * * * shall be brought within one year after the cause thereof accrued * * <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This provision has limited applicability. \u201cThe statute of limitations contained in R. C. 2305.11(A) is limited to the areas specifically enumerated therein and to the common-law definition of \u2018malpractice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hocking Conservancy Disk </em>v. <em>Dodson-Lindblom Assoc. </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Likewise, the term \u201cmalpractice\u201d has a limited definition. \u201cToday, the term, malpractice, is sometimes used loosely to refer to the negligence of a member of any professional group. However, legally and technically, it is still subject to the limited common-law definition. It is well established that where a statute uses a word which has a definite meaning at common law, it will be presumed to be used in that sense and not in the loose popular sense. <em>Grogan </em>v. <em>Garrison </em>[1875], 27 Ohio St. 50, 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">\u201cIf the General Assembly had wished to protect groups other than those traditionally associated with malpractice, it should have listed the ones to be covered * * * .</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">\u201cThere is no compelling reason for a nurse to be given the protection of a one-year statute of limitations. A nurse, although obviously skilled and well trained, is not in the same category as a physician who is required to exercise his independent judgment on matters which may mean the difference between life and death * * * .\u201d <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Doe </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 370, 372-373. Nor does the definition of malpractice encompass the conduct of laboratory technicians. Although they too are skilled and trained, the General Assembly has not singled them out for the special protection provided by the one-year statute of limitations in R. C. 2305.11(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">Accordingly, neither of these cases presents an action in malpractice. Rather, appellants have alleged negligence against individuals whose occupations are not among those enumerated in R. C. 2305.11(A) or within the common-law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>definition of \u201cmalpractice.\u201d Therefore, R. C. 2305.11(A) may not bar an action against the hospitals who are their employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Appellees argue, however, that (1) these cases present \u201cmedical claims\u201d;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) the General Assembly intended that the terms \u201cmalpractice\u201d and \u201cmedical claims\u201d be used interchangeably; and, therefore, (3) R. C. 2305.11(A) bars all medical claims filed more than one year after the cause of action arose. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">R. C. 2305.11(B) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">\u201cIn no event shall any <em>medical claim </em>against a physician, podiatrist, or a hospital be brought more than four years after the act or omission constituting the alleged <em>malpractice </em>occured * * * .\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">We admit that this sentence is confusing. Yet, the operative limitation provision of R. C. 2305.11(A) expressly mentions \u201cmalpractice\u201d without including \u201cmedical claims.\u201d As discussed above, our holding in <em>Hocking Conservancy Disk, supra, </em>requires that we continue to apply the common-law definition of \u201cmalpractice\u201d when construing this statute of limitations. We find nothing in the statute to suggest that the General Assembly accepted the invitation of Judge Matthias in <em>Richardson, supra, </em>at 373, to extend the applicability of R. C. 2305.11(A) to the groups of people and the kind of conduct involved in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Accordingly, as to case No. 81-686, we reverse the Court of Appeals and remand the cause for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and App. R. 12(A). As to case No. 81-688, we reverse the Court of Appeals and remand the cause for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b510-11\">Celebrezze, C.

Since I fundamentally disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis of R. C. 2305.11, as amended by Am. Sub. H. B. No. 682, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">As a starting point of analysis, courts must look to the legislative intent of the statute. In <em>Vanc\u00e9 </em>v. <em>St. Vincent Hospital </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St. 2d 36, 40, this court discussed the legislative purpose of Am. Sub. H. B. No. 682, and stated that it was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">\u201c * * * legislation declared to be \u2018an emergency measure necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety\u2019 due to \u2018the fact that immediate action is necessary to insure a continuance of health care delivery to the citizens of Ohio.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at Section 8. The legislation was comprehensive in nature and consisted of a response to what was largely perceived throughout the country to be a medical malpractice \u2018crisis\u2019 manifested by sharply increased medical malpractice insurance premiums, cancellation of policies, and physician work slowdowns or stoppages.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) See, also, <em>Beatty </em>v. <em>Akron City Hospital </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St. 2d 483.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">As a tool to advance this purpose, the General Assembly adopted the concept of \u201cmedical claim.\u201d \u201cMedical claim\u201d is defined by R. C. 2305.11(D)(3) as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-9\"><em>\u201c[a]ny </em>claim asserted in any civil action against a physician, podiatrist, or hospital arising out of the diagnosis, care, or treatment of any person.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">Each of the present cases involves a claim in a civil action against a hospital which arose out of \u201cthe diagnosis, care, or treatment\u201d of a person. Hence, each is a \u201cmedical claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">The next question is: does the one-year limitation period contained in R. C. 2305.11(A) apply to all medical claims? Keeping in mind the legislative purpose of Am. Sub. H. B. No. 682, and that its provisions must be read <em>in pari materia (Denicola </em>v. <em>Providence Hospital </em>[1979], 57 Ohio St. 2d 115), I feel that this question must be answered affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">An examination of R. C. 2305.11 leads to the conclusion that the General Assembly used the words \u201cmalpractice\u201d and \u201cmedical claim\u201d interchangeably. The second paragraph of R. C. 2305.11(A) allows one to serve written notice, prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>expiration of the time in R. C. 2305.11(A), upon a person and extend the time in which a suit may be brought against that person by up to 180 days from the time notice is given. This paragraph does not refer at all to malpractice. Rather, it uses the phrase \u201cmedical claim.\u201d This is evidence that the General Assembly considered the words \u201cmalpractice\u201d and \u201cmedical claim\u201d to be synonymous, for if the legislative intent was to give these words different meanings, it would make little sense to include actions such as the present one in a subsection that did not apply to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Likewise, in subsection (B) of R. C. 2305.11, there is an absolute four-year limitation placed upon all medical claims. This four-year period runs from the date \u201cthe act or omission constituting the alleged malpractice occurred.\u201d Once again, the General Assembly has used the words interchangeably.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Finally, I feel the majority\u2019s reliance upon <em>Hocking Conservancy Disk </em>v. <em>Dodson-Lindblom Assoc. </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 195, is misplaced. The' precise question before the court in <em>Hocking </em>was whether professional engineers should be included within the definition of malpractice in R. C. 2305.11(A). Consequently, would engineers be afforded the protection of the one-year statute of limitations? Here, the question is what claims asserted against a hospital, which is an area specifically enumerated in R. C. 2305.11(A), are within the coverage of that section.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">As I would hold that R. C. 2305.11(A) applies to all medical claims, the judgments of the Courts of Appeals should be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b512-7\">Sweeney and Krupansky, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b512-8\"> The hospitals were the defendants in these cases, not their employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
