We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">R. C. 2721.03 permits a court to issue a declaratory judgment regarding \u201crights, status, or other legal relations\u201d under a statute. Boards of education must function within the limited powers granted to them by statute. See <em>Schwing </em>v. <em>McClure </em>(1929), 120 Ohio St. 335; <em>Verberg </em>v. <em>Bd. of Edn. </em>(1939), 135 Ohio St. 246. The trial court reviewed the rights of appellees to receive school transportation for their children under R. C. Chapter 3327, the \u201cFair Busing Law.\u201d R. C. 3327.01 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-10\">\u201cIn all city, exempted village, and local school districts where resident school pupils in grades kindergarten through eight live more than two miles from the school for which the state board of education prescribes minimum standards pursuant to division (D) of section 3301.07 of the Revised Code and to which they are assigned by the board of education of the district of residence or to and from the non-public school which they attend the board of education <em>shall </em>provide transportation for such pupils to and from such school <em>except when, </em>in the judgment of such board, <em>confirmed by the state board of education, </em>such transportation is unnecessary or unreasonable.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">Under R. C. 3327.01, therefore, transportation is the rule and payment is the exception.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The local school board may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>make this judgment unilaterally. Rather, R. C. 3327.01 requires that the State Board of Education confirm the decision to make payment in lieu of transportation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In this case, the local school board did not receive a confirmation from the state board.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Having failed to do so, the local board did not satisfy one of the conditions for payment in lieu of transportation. Likewise, the trial court found that the other requirements for payment in lieu of transportation had not been met: \u201cPlaintiffs live in homes along the present bus routes; the statutory time, distance, accreditation, and nondiscriminatory conditions have been satisfied by Plaintiffs. The School Board * * * cannot be excused from providing busing to the Plaintiffs since the facts herein demonstrate that it is not impractical nor impracticable to provide busing to Plaintiff-children. The School Board\u2019s decision not to bus the children does not fall within the exceptions allowed by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed the trial court\u2019s factual finding as being supported by the manifest weight of the evidence. In accordance with R. C. 2505.31, we will not weigh the evidence. See <em>G.S.T. </em>v. <em>Avon Lake </em>(1976), 48 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Ohio St. 2d 63, fn. 2, at page 65; <em>State, ex rel. Pomeroy, </em>v. <em>Webber </em>(1965), 2 Ohio St. 2d 84, 85-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the trial court\u2019s granting of a declaratory judgment and injunction in favor of appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Appellants argue that the trial court erred by refusing to join the parents of children residing in the Berlin-Milan School District and attending other non-public schools. We disagree.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Civ. R. 19(A) provides, in pertinent part: \u201cA person who is subject to service of process shall be joined as a party in the action if (1) in his absence complete relief cannot be accorded among the parties * * * .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We agree with the Court of Appeals that the trial court could (and did) fashion \u201ca complete and appropriate remedy among those already [a] party.\u201d Transportation to and from the other schools would provide unique problems. The parents of children attending these other schools, therefore, were not necessary to provide relief in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b454-11\">Celebrezze, C. J., W. Brown, Sweeney and Patton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b454-12\">Holmes, J., concurs in the judgment.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b454-13\">Krupansky, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b454-14\">Patton, J., of the Eighth Appellate District, sitting for C. Brown, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b452-12\"> This ground for providing students with transportation clearly differs from the constitutional basis found in <em>Swann </em>v. <em>Chartotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Edn. </em>(1971), 402 U. S. 1, and its progeny.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b452-13\"> Contrary to appellants\u2019 first proposition of law, this preference for transporta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>tion may extend beyond school district boundaries. R. C. 3327.01 requires that the board of education for the local school district provide transportation \u201cto and from the non-public school which * * * [the students] attend * * * .\u201d The General Assembly did not limit this requirement to intra-district transportation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b453-9\"> Similarly, R. C. 3327.02 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-10\">\u201cIf the board of education of a local school district deems the transportation, required under any law, of certain children to school by school conveyances impracticable and if it is unable to secure a reasonable offer for the transportation of such children the local board <em>shall so report to the county board. If the county board deems </em>such <em>transportation </em>by school conveyance <em>practicable </em>or the offers reasonable it shall so inform the local board and <em>transportation shall be provided </em>by such local board. If the county board agrees with the view of the local board it is compliance with section 3327.01 of the Revised Code, by such local board if such board agrees to pay the parent or other person in charge of the child for the transportation of such child to school at a rate determined for the particular case by the local board for each day of actual transportation.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">The record does not reflect any report to or response from the county board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b453-13\"> The local school board passed a resolution regarding its decision to make payment in lieu of transportation in compliance with Ohio Adm. Code 3301-83-01. Appellants argue, without authority, that this resolution satisfies the statutory requirement for confirmation. We reject this conclusion, however, because neither R. C. 3327.01 nor Ohio Adm. Code 3301-83-01, on their face, suggests this result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b454-16\"> Appellants argue that the State Board of Education should be a party to this action. Appellants\u2019 written motion in the trial court merely requested joinder of the parents of children attending other non-public schools. Therefore, we need not review this issue. See, <em>e.g., State </em>v. <em>Draggo </em>(1981), 65 Ohio St. 2d 88, 93.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b454-20\"> The record does not indicate that the parents, whom appellants wished to join, affirmatively asserted a claim. Therefore, Civ. R. 19(A)(2) could not serve as a basis for requiring joinder.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b454-15\">Sweeney, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAs\">I concur wholeheartedly in the foregoing judgment and opinion. I write separately solely for the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>of speaking to what I perceive to be an important question not specifically addressed in the majority opinion. This question relates to how a school board is to determine impracticality for purposes of R. C. Chapter 3327.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Appellants and the amicus, Ohio School Boards Association, take the position that the courts below effectively divested the local board of its discretionary authority to determine whether transportation to non-public school pupils is ever impractical if the statutory pre-conditions \u2014 accreditation, nondiscrimination, and time and distance requirements \u2014 are met. I can accept the amicus\u2019 proposition that a board may consider factors other than statutory conditions, and appellants\u2019 second proposition that a practicality determination includes consideration of economic and logistic feasibility, without disturbing the judgments below because the trial court implicitly and the Court of Appeals explicitly found that the board had abused its discretion in this particular instance. Neither of the lower courts, however, established an analytic framework to determine whether transporting non-public school pupils may ever be impractical. The appropriate test for impracticality, assuming the other statutory pre-conditions are met, should include consideration of, <em>inter alia: </em>(1) the cost of providing transportation in terms of equipment, maintenance, personnel, and administration; (2) the number of pupils to be transported to nonpublic schools; (3) whether the board provides similar or equivalent service to public school pupils, <em>e.g., </em>it may be impractical for a school district operating neighborhood schools to provide bus service for non-public school pupils when it does not provide such service for public school pupils; (4) whether and to what extent the additional service to non-public school pupils unavoidably disrupts current transportation schedules.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The above test for impracticality is consistent with the (in-artful) statutory language and provides school boards a modicum of flexibility in transportation matters without losing sight of the underlying proposition, well-stated in the majority opinion, that \u201ctransportation is the rule and payment is the exception.\u201d</p>\n<judges id=\"b455-7\">Celebrezze, C. J., W. Brown and Patton, JJ., concur in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Holmes, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AGW\">concurring in judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">I concur in the judgment for the following reasons. R. C. 3327.01 and 3327.02 reasonably must be read in <em>pari materia </em>in order to provide an understandable legislative scheme for providing school bus transportation, or monetary payment to the parents in lieu of transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">We must start with the premise that, pursuant to R. C. 3327.01, transportation of non-public school pupils in kindergarten through the eighth grade is mandated where such transportation would require no more than 30 minutes travel time from point of collection. The exception to the provision of the actual transportation, or payments in lieu thereof, is \u201cwhen, in the judgment of such board, confirmed by the state board of education, such transportation is unnecessary or unreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Where the local board determines that no provision shall be provided for transportation because such, in its view, is unnecessary, the statute provides that the \u201cavailability of facilities and distance to the school <em>shall </em>be considered.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In my view, other factors, including economic feasibility, <em>may </em>be considered by the local board, and the state board of education upon review of both the question of the necessity and the reasonableness of making provision for the transportation of the pupils.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">R. C. 3327.01 further provides that when a board of education intends to make provision for transportation of pupils, but determines \u201cit is impractical to transport a pupil by school conveyance * * * ,\u201d it may pay a parent a sum in lieu of providing such transportation. Following this legislative scheme, R. C. 3327.02 provides that when the board of education deems it to be \u201cimpracticable\u201d to provide transportation by school conveyances, and if it is unable to secure a reasonable offer for the transportation of such children, \u201cthe local-board shall so report to the county board.\u201d The section then provides that \u201cif the county board agrees with the view of the local board\u201d payment in lieu of transportation would then be in compliance with R. C. 3327.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">Here, it is agreed that the Berlin-Milan Local School District board made its independent determination of the impracticality or impracticability (whichever word may be util<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>ized would make no difference in this determination since, in my view, the use of the two words was a legislative drafting oversight and the two words should be read and interpreted synonymously). The county board received no report of the local board\u2019s determination for its review according to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">This being a declaratory judgment action, the trial court could well have determined that the local board\u2019s determination to make payments in lieu of transportation without reporting such determination to the county board would constitute an action contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Additionally, the trial court had the original action jurisdiction to take all testimony on the issue of impracticality or impracticability of the local board to provide actual transportation of the pupils. The trial court should never usurp the authority of the school board to make the initial administrative determination, but by statute the court may determine whether the acts of the board were lawful and reasonable and whether the board had abused its discretion. It would appear here that the trial court carried out its allowable statutory function, and that there was no reversible error present.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
