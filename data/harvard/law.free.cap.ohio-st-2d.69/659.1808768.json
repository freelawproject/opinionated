C. Title 7 and which has combined executive and judicial powers may hear and decide a contested misdemeanor case without violating the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>law. Appellant village argues that there was no due process violation in this case. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">R. C. 1905.01 establishes jurisdiction for mayor\u2019s courts and provides, in pertinent part: \u201cIn all municipal corporations not being the site of a municipal court nor a place where a judge of the * * * Miami county * * * municipal court sits * * * , the mayor of the municipal corporation has jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of an ordinance of the municipal corporation * * * , subject to the limitations of sections 2937.08 and 2938.04 of the Revised Code.\u201d Section 1 of Article IV of the Ohio Constitution authorizes the General Assembly to establish courts. \u201cThe accepted rule is: An enactment of the General Assembly is presumed to be constitutional, and before a court may declare it unconstitutional it must appear beyond a reasonable doubt that the legislation and the constitutional provisions are clearly incompatible. <em>State, ex rel. Dickman, </em>v. <em>Defenbacher </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 142, 128 N. E. 2d 59.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Brockman, </em>v. <em>Proctor </em>(1973), 35 Ohio St. 2d 79, 84. We begin our analysis, therefore, with the presumption that the \u201cstatutory form\u201d of village government is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Mayor\u2019s courts which decide misdemeanor or traffic cases have received constitutional scrutiny, because the mayor may possess a combination of executive and judicial powers. <em>\u201c * * * </em>[T]he mere union of the executive power and the judicial power in * * * [the mayor] can not be said to violate due process of law.\u201d <em>Tumey </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1927), 273 U. S. 510, 534, quoted with approval in <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Monroeville </em>(1972), 409 U. S. 57, 60. Therefore, the \u201cstatutory form\u201d of village government is not unconstitutional on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Rather, due process analysis requires that we examine the interaction of whatever financial interest the mayor may have in a particular case with the nature and extent of his executive powers. Neither of these considerations is necessarily controlling, however. In some cases, a substantial financial interest of the mayor has been a significant factor. See <em>Tumey, supra </em>(mayor\u2019s compensation directly tied to revenue from mayor\u2019s court); <em>Monroeville, supra </em>(substantial portion of village income provided by mayor\u2019s court). In other cases, the lack of executive power in the mayor had a bearing on consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>tutionality. See <em>Dugan </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1928), 277 U. S. 61 (city manager as active executive); <em>State, ex rel. Brockman, </em>v. <em>Proctor, supra </em>(city manager with all executive power and administrative responsibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">None of these cases provides the same factual situation as this case, however. We must undertake constitutional analysis anew. \u201c * * * [T]he test is whether the mayor\u2019s situation is one \u2018which would offer a possible temptation to the average man as a judge to forget the burden of proof required to convict the defendant, or which might lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true between the State and the accused . . . .\u2019 <em>[Turney, supra], </em>at 532.\u201d <em>Monroeville, supra, </em>at 60. In order to examine \u201cthe mayor\u2019s situation,\u201d therefore, we must look at the particular circumstances of this case, <em>id., </em>at 62 (White, J., dissenting), and examine the \u201cstatutory form\u201d of village government as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The Municipal Court took judicial notice that \u201c[r]evenue from the Mayor\u2019s Court does <em>not </em>constitute a <em>substantial portion </em>of the revenue for the Village of Covington.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This fact distinguishes this case from <em>Monroeville, supra. </em>R. C. 1905.21 prohibits the mayor from receiving a direct benefit from any monies paid to the court and distinguishes this case from <em>Turney, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">On the other hand, R. C. 1905.21 provides that the legislative authority must fix the mayor\u2019s annual salary; and R. C. 733.40 requires that the mayor pay all monies received by the court into the municipal treasury. \u201cThe mayor * * * receives a salary which is not dependent on whether he convicts in any case or not. While it is true that his salary is paid out of a fund to which fines accumulated from his court under all laws contribute, it is a general fund, and he receives a salary in any event, whether he convicts or acquits. There is no reason to infer on any showing that failure to convict in any case or cases would deprive him of or affect his fixed compensation.\u201d <em>Dugan, supra, </em>at 65. As a result, the \u201cstatutory form\u201d of village government does not create a financial \u201ctemptation\u201d for a mayor presiding at a village mayor\u2019s court.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">Village mayors working within the \u201cstatutory form\u201d of government are not autonomous executives. \u201cThe executive power of villages shall be vested in a mayor, clerk, treasurer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>marshal, street commissioner, and such other officers and departments thereof as are created by law.\u201d R. C. 733.23. The legislative authority controls compensation for public servants of the village and supervises financial matters. See R. C. 731.13, 733.32, 733.33 and 733.41, respectively. The mayor has limited powers of appointment. See, <em>e.g., </em>R. C. 733.31 (filling vacancies in elective office); 737.15 (village marshal \u201cwith the advice and consent of the legislative authority of the village\u201d); 737.16 (deputy marshal, policemen, etc., subject to confirmation by the legislative authority of the village). On balance, therefore, the \u201cstatutory form\u201d of village government \u201csatisfies] the appearance of justice,\u201d <em>Offutt </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1954), 348 U. S. 11, 14, and does not necessarily create a judicial \u201ctemptation\u201d because of the mayor\u2019s diluted executive authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">A mayor\u2019s judicial decisions are not without scrutiny either. R. C. 1905.22 provides for appeals from the mayor\u2019s court to the municipal or county court with jurisdiction. R. C. 1905.25 requires that each of these appeals \u201cshall proceed as a trial de novo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">This opportunity for review of the legal issues and facts enhances the credibility of the mayor\u2019s court system. The United States Supreme Court observed, in <em>North </em>v. <em>Russell </em>(1976), 427 U. S. 328, 335-336: \u201cIn <em>Colten </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>407 U. S. 104 (1972), we considered Kentucky\u2019s two-tier system there challenged on other grounds. We noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">\u201c \u2018The right to a new trial is absolute. A defendant need not allege error in the inferior court proceeding. If he seeks a new trial, the Kentucky statutory scheme contemplates that the slate be wiped clean. Ky. Rule Crim. Proc. 12.06. Prosecution and defense begin anew .... The case is to be regarded exactly as if it had been brought there in the first instance.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 113. We went on to note that the justifications urged by States for continuing such tribunals are the \u2018increasing burdens on state judiciaries\u2019 and the \u2018interest of both the defendant and the State, to provide speedier and less costly adjudications\u2019 than those provided in courts \u2018where the full range of constitutional guarantees is available . . . .\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 114. Moreover, state policy takes into account that it is a convenience to those charged to be tried in or near their own com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>munity, rather than travel to a distant court where a law-trained judge is provided, and to have the option, as here, of a trial after regular business hours. We took note of these practical considerations in <em>Colten:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">\u201c \u2018We are not persuaded, however, that the Kentucky arrangement for dealing with the less serious offenses disadvantages defendants any more or any less than trials conducted in a court of general jurisdiction in the first instance, as long as the latter are always available. Proceedings in the inferior courts are simple and speedy, and, if the results in Colten\u2019s case are any evidence, the penalty is not characteristically severe. Such proceedings offer a defendant the opportunity to learn about the prosecution\u2019s case and, if he chooses, he need not reveal his own. He may also plead guilty without a trial and promptly secure a <em>de novo </em>trial * * * .\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 118-119.\u201d The trial <em>de novo </em>provision of R. C. 1905.25 serves the same purpose as that in <em>Colten </em>and <em>North.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">We also note that the <em>North </em>court, at page 337, distinguished <em>Monroeville </em>by observing that the fines recovered were a substantial portion of village income. That court also distinguished <em>Tumey </em>by pointing out that the direct relationship between the fines assessed and the mayor\u2019s compensation might result in bias to the defendant. In light of these remarks and the <em>North </em>court\u2019s approval of <em>Colten, </em>we view any remarks in <em>Monroeville </em>minimizing the importance of trial <em>de novo </em>after a judgment from a village mayor\u2019s court as <em>obiter dicta.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">We hold, therefore, that the structure of the \u201cstatutory form\u201d of village government does not violate appellee\u2019s right to due process of law under either the Ohio Constitution or the United States Constitution. \u201cThere is nothing in the record from which it may be inferred that the mayor, as judge, has any, direct or indirect, personal or official substantial pecuniary interest in reaching a conclusion against * * * [appellee].\u201d <em>Brockman, supra, </em>at 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b699-10\">W.

Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Af0\">concurring. I concur in the well-crafted majority opinion authored by Justice Ralph Locher. In my view, the instant case is distinguishable from that presented in <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Monroeville </em>(1972), 409 U. S. 57, on two critical issues. First, the Municipal 'Court took judicial notice that the village of Covington mayor did not have a substantial financial interest in the revenues generated by the Mayor\u2019s Court. In <em>Monroeville, </em>by contrast, a substantial portion of the revenue for the village derived from fines levied by the Mayor\u2019s Court. Second, under R. C. 1905.25, effective June 12, 1970, an appeal from the Mayor\u2019s Court to the Municipal or County Court proceeds <em>de novo, </em>thereby removing any danger of prejudice suffered by the defendant in the Mayor\u2019s Court. This statute was not in effect at the time the defendant Ward appeared before the Monroeville Mayor\u2019s Court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Even though I find the Mayor\u2019s Court constitutional, I believe it serves no useful purpose in the administration of justice in Ohio. In my view, the Mayor\u2019s Court should be eliminated altogether, with county or municipal courts assuming jurisdiction over cases such as this.</p>\n<judges id=\"b701-5\">W. Brown, J., concurs in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b700-6\"> At the time defendant Ward was convicted in the Mayor\u2019s Court at Monroeville his conviction was appealable only to the Court of Common Pleas on questions of law only, and not by trial <em>de novo, </em>pursuant to R. C. 1905.22 effective October 19, 1961 (129 Ohio Laws 425), which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-7\">\u201cA conviction under an ordinance of any municipal corporation may be reviewed on appeal in the same manner as appeals on questions of law from a county court, and the judgment of affirmance or reversal may be reviewed in the same manner, and for this purpose a bill of exceptions may be taken, or a statement of facts embodied in the record on the application of any party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Extant in 1969, in <em>pari materia </em>with R.

The day of the Mayors\u2019 Courts, as part of our system of justice, should be behind us in Ohio. However, that is a legislative matter yet to be determined. In the interim period, it becomes this court\u2019s duty, in the appropriate case presented, to pronounce the latitude of the jurisdiction of such courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">It is my belief that the Supreme Court of the United States has spelled out the jurisdictional limits of the mayor\u2019s court in <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Monroeville </em>(1972), 409 U. S. 57. In that case the Supreme Court held it unconstitutional for a mayor\u2019s court to be the fact-finder in a disputed case where the mayor was both the chief executive and the administrative officer of the village responsible for the village\u2019s financial condition. Additionally, in <em>Monroeville, </em>the court recognized that the Mayor\u2019s Court contributed a \u201csubstantial\u201d amount of revenue to the village.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">In this case, the village of Covington has the same statutory form of government as did the village of Monroeville in <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Monroeville. </em>Thus, the question becomes whether the key factor in a challenge to a mayor\u2019s court such as the present one is whether the village derives a \u201csubstantial\u201d portion of its funds from the mayor\u2019s court.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>In my opinion, that is not the determining factor. I feel that this court previously recognized this in <em>State, ex rel. Brockman, </em>v. <em>Proctor </em>(1973), 35 Ohio St. 2d 79. In <em>State, ex rel. Brockman, </em>the court stated, in paragraph two of the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-4\">\u201cThe trial of a defendant charged with a traffic offense by a mayor acting as judge, who is also chief executive and administrative officer of the municipality, and who as such officer is responsible for the financial condition of the municipality, violates due process of law. <em>(Tumey </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>[1927], 273 U. S. 510; and <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Monroeville </em>[1972], 409 U. S. 57, followed.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">As can be seen from the quoted language, the court, in <em>State, ex rel. Brockman, </em>did not feel that the deriving of a substantial portion of revenue was the determining factor. Rather, it was the relationship between the mayor as judge and as chief executive and administrative officer of the municipality which was the key factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">It is my determination that this court should follow the holding of <em>State, ex rel. Brockman, </em>and preclude a mayor of a village with the statutory form of government from trying contested cases. This solution to the problem will avoid endless challenges to trials held by mayors in which the key question will be whether a substantial portion of the village\u2019s funds is derived from the mayor\u2019s court.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">It would appear that my position here is supported by the approach developed by this court in the adoption of the Traffic Rules. If this case were a traffic offense, Traf. R. 9(B) would preclude the mayor from having tried the case.' Rule 9(B) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-8\">\u201cIf a jury demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and the defendant waives his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the municipality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">In order for the result here to be consistent with Rule 9(B), this court should affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b702-10\">Celebrezze, C.
