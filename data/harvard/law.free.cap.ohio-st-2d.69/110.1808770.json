In the case at bar, this constitutional requirement was not satisfied. Although Judge Bettman may have indicated to his colleagues an opinion that the appellee\u2019s conviction should be reversed, on the date of disposition he no longer was a judge of the Court of Appeals and was not qualified to participate in that court\u2019s decision. The remaining two judges differed as to the proper disposition of the cause. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sioux Falls Brewing Co. </em>(1894), 5 S.D. 360, 58 N.W. 928.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">The constitutional requirement that a majority of the Court of Appeals judges hearing a cause concur in the judgment was not met in this case. Therefore, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the cause remanded to that court for a rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b147-12\">Celebrezze, C.
