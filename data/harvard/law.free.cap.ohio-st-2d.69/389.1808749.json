Furthermore, the court should give the reasons for its decision on each assignment of error. Reasons for a decision are necessary \u2014 otherwise all parties concerned must speculate on the obstacles, legal or other, which need be overcome in an appeal to this court. <em>Id. </em>at page 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-15\">In this case, the Court of Appeals did not rule on all errors assigned contrary to the mandate of App. R. 12(A). Therefore, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to that court for compliance with the provisions of App. R. 12(A), that all errors assigned and briefed be passed upon in writing, stating the reasons for the court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b427-6\">Celebrezze, C.
