HI. Plaintiff\u2019s cause of action based on deprivation of constitutional rights was properly dismissed. The constitutional duty of the Legislature to provide for the maintenance and support of a system of free common schools, wherein all eMMxem may be educated, does not impose a duty flowing directly from a local school district to individual pupils to ensure that each pupil receives a minimum level of education. <em>(Donohue v Copiague Union Free School Dist., </em>47 NY2d 440; <em>Patton v Dumpson, </em>425 F Supp 621.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b189-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b189-6\">Kaye, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">In <em>Hoffman v Board of Educ. </em>(49 NY2d 121) and <em>Donohue v Copiague Union Free School Dist. </em>(47 NY2d 440), we dismissed complaints for educational malpractice, holding that as a matter of public policy the courts would not second-guess the professional judgments of public school educators and administrators in selecting programs for particular students. In the appeal before us plaintiff, who never learned to read despite a public school education, seeks damages from his legal custodians for his failure to receive an appropriate education. While he urges that there are material differences from <em>Hoffman </em>and <em>Donohue, </em>we conclude that the same policy considerations bar recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">In 1964, when plaintiff, Frank Torres, was seven years old, his mother abandoned him and defendant New York City Department of Social Services (DSS) assumed responsibility for his care. DSS placed him with defendant Little Flower Children\u2019s Services, an authorized child care agency (Social Services Law, \u00a7371, subd 10), which assumed a contractual obligation to provide him basic care, including room and board, and \u201cthe arrangement, as needed, of religious training, education and vocational training.\u201d At the time, plaintiff was fluent in Spanish but spoke and understood little English. Little Flower enrolled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>him in a public school operated by the New York City Board of Education on the agency\u2019s premises. Plaintiff admitted that he started to understand English \u201caround the third grade.\u201d While he was capable of doing math work at a normal level, he began doing poorly in reading. According to a report submitted by Little Flower to DSS, plaintiff was determined in a 1967 psychological study to suffer from borderline retardation. In light of his perceived condition, teachers at the public school assigned him a lesser work load but for the most part kept him in the regular classes, allowing him to sit in back of the classroom without participating in the instruction. Plaintiff\u2019s reading problem was regularly discussed at conferences attended by Little Flower staff members as well as the school principal and teachers. Little Flower felt that the public school was equipped to deal with th is type of learning disability and did not attempt to provide supplemental reading instruction, except for a short period after seventh grade when plaintiff attended a special class.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">In March 1972, a Little Flower social worker took plaintiff to a reading specialist who administered a series of tests with a view toward establishing an education plan to be initiated after plaintiff\u2019s graduation from eighth grade in June 1972. The reading specialist concluded that plaintiff was not retarded but suffered from an \u201cextremely complex reading disability.\u201d He said, \u201cTo outline a remedial approach for Frank would be synonymous with writing a textbook.\u201d However, he did recommend a method which had been described in detail in a designated publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Following the testing, plaintiff was tutored through the use of reading machines but he graduated from the eighth grade unable to read. The method recommended by the reading specialist was never implemented. However, Little Flower did arrange for further tutoring upon plaintiff\u2019s graduation from grammar school. After some months, plaintiff stopped attending the tutoring sessions because no transportation was provided and the walk took approximately 45 minutes each way. In October 1972, plaintiff was enrolled in a BOCES school and placed in a class for the educable retarded, but he was expelled, after various difficulties in March 1973. Little Flower discharged plaintiff from its care in 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Alleging that he was functionally illiterate, plaintiff brought this action against DSS, Little Flower, several individuals associated with them, and the Board of Education and school principal (the last two since dropped from the suit). He charged that defendants were negligent and violated the contract between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>DSS and Little Flower in failing to provide him with an appropriate education, and asserted a cause of action based on 42 USC \u00a7 1983 because he was not afforded a hearing with respect to the deprivation of an appropriate education. On defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, Special Term dismissed the complaint, characterizing the negligence claim as educational malpractice and finding the contractual duties met by the placement of plaintiff in a public school. The court did not address the constitutional claim. The Appellate Division affirmed, without opinion, and this court granted leave to appeal. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">In <em>Donohue v Copiague Union Free School Dist. </em>(47 NY2d 440, <em>supra), </em>plaintiff brought an action against the school district because he was graduated from high school unable to comprehend written English. He alleged that the school failed to evaluate his mental ability or take adequate remedial measures to deal with his learning disability. The court assumed that a tort action for educational malpractice could be stated, but nonetheless held as a matter of public policy that courts should not entertain such claims because to do so \u201cwould require the courts not merely to make judgments as to the validity of broad educational policies \u2014 a course we have unalteringly eschewed in the past \u2014 but, more importantly, to sit in review of the day-to-day implementation of these policies.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p 445.) In <em>Hoffman v Board of Educ. </em>(49 NY2d 121, <em>supra), </em>plaintiff was mistakenly diagnosed as retarded by a psychologist whose recommendation for retesting was ignored. As a result, plaintiff, a person of normal intelligence, was educated in a class for children with retarded mental development. The court found the negligence cause of action grounded in educational malpractice and therefore barred by <em>Donohue, </em>stating \u201cthe courts of this State may not substitute their judgment, or the judgment of a jury, for the professional judgment of educators and government officials actually engaged in the complex and often delicate process of educating the many thousands of children in our schools\u201d <em>(id., </em>at pp 125-126). As we noted, \u201cthe court system is not the proper forum to test the validity of the educational decision to place a particular student in one of the many educational programs offered by the schools of this State\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p 127).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Plaintiff advances several arguments in an effort to distinguish <em>Hoffman </em>and <em>Donohue. </em>First, he asserts that those decisions prevented only suits against educators whereas here the charges are asserted against those responsible for his upbringing. Second, drawing an analogy to <em>Klostermann v Cuomo </em>(61 NY2d 525), he argues that he is not asking the court to evaluate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>different educational approaches but rather to enforce duties imposed on defendants principally by statute and common law. Those arising from statute \u2014 the Social Services Law and the Education Law \u2014 in general (1) require DSS to care for abandoned children and supervise child care agencies, which in turn must arrange for appropriate education, and (2) allow DSS or the agency to obtain administrative review of decisions made by the school regarding a variety of programs available to needy children.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The common-law duties, it is argued, stem from DSS\u2019s <em>parens patriae </em>function and from Little Flower\u2019s responsibility for plaintiff\u2019s daily care. A third distinction offered is that defendants breached their contract, which obligated Little Flower to provide education \u201cas needed,\u201d to comply with the Social Services Law, and to submit to DSS a detailed service plan concerning plaintiff\u2019s care. The contract also required DSS to supervise plaintiff\u2019s treatment. Finally, plaintiff asserts a deprivation of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">We cannot accept plaintiff\u2019s initial argument that even if an action grounded in educational malpractice may be barred by public policy considerations when brought against the school, a different result should obtain when this same claim is lodged against the child\u2019s legal custodians. What is at the root of the policy enunciated in <em>Hoffman </em>and <em>Donohue </em>is not the identity of the defendant but the nature of the determinations courts would be called upon to make. This policy is equally applicable whether the student challenges educational decisions made by the Board of Education or by his guardians in response to actions taken by school officials, for in either situation the court would be thrust into the position of reviewing the wisdom of educators\u2019 choices and evaluations. Here, for example, plaintiff\u2019s allegations would require the courts to assess the nature of his difficulty in learning, including such elusive factors as his own attitude, motivation, temperament, past experience and home environment (see <em>Donohue v Copiague Union Free School Dist., </em>47 NY2d 440, 446 [Wachtler, J., concurring], <em>supra), </em>to examine Board of Education policies and their implementation by school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>officials \u2014 the very role we have already declined to assume \u2014 and then in addition to determine whether the guardians\u2019 responses to these policies and decisions constituted negligence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While we have noted the right of students and parents to question choices made by educators <em>(id., </em>at p 445; <em>Hoffman v Board of Educ., </em>49 NY2d 121,127, <em>supra), </em>we did not imply that the exercise of such a right would give rise to damage suits for negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s reliance on <em>Klostermann v Cuomo </em>(61 NY2d 525, <em>supra) </em>is misplaced. There, we held that courts would entertain mandamus proceedings and declaratory judgment actions brought to compel administrative agencies to carry out clearly defined, ministerial acts mandated by the Legislature \u2014 furnishing written service plans \u2014 even where in determining <em>how </em>to act \u2014 i.e., the content of those plans \u2014 agencies may have unreviewable discretion. Plaintiff points to no clearly defined, ministerial act mandated by the Legislature which defendants failed to perform. The statutes here require DSS and Little Flower to provide for a suitable or appropriate education and allow them to challenge the school\u2019s decisions regarding the programs in which the student is enrolled. Contrary to plaintiff\u2019s claim, defendants did act pursuant to their duty to provide for plaintiff\u2019s education by placing him in a public school maintained by the Board of Education. What is challenged by plaintiff, but not subject to review, is the agency discretion in the manner in which the statutory duty was fulfilled.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Nor are more specific duties imposed by the government\u2019s <em>parens patriae </em>function to safeguard the best interests of children placed in its care, or Little Flower\u2019s responsibility to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>exercise reasonable care for their protection. Social service agencies or foster parents have been found liable in instances where abandoned children placed in foster care have been physically injured due to abuse or neglect (see, e.g., <em>Bartels v County of Westchester, </em>76 AD2d 517; <em>Andrews v County of Otsego, </em>112 Misc 2d 37), but liability has not been extended to judgments concerning a child\u2019s education. On this question, defendants urge that the only duty of those in a parental relation is to cause the child to \u201cattend upon instruction\u201d (Education Law, \u00a7 3212, subd 2, par b). We need not define the responsibility of a legal custodian with respect to a child\u2019s education, however, for we assume, as we did in <em>Donohue, </em>that under traditional tort law concepts defendants could be held answerable for their failure to assure plaintiff an appropriate education. Even accepting plaintiff\u2019s argument that defendants have such a responsibility, still his claim must fail because of the public policy against educational malpractice claims. Whatever the precise statutory and common-law duties of a child\u2019s governmental guardians may be, they do not support an action stemming from the alleged malpractice of public school educators and administrators because such an action is not cognizable in our courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">For the same reason, plaintiff\u2019s cause of action based on contract must also fail; enforcement of the contract as requested would require the court to decide which educational programs might have been preferable. That the source of such a duty was imposed by contract, rather than common law or statute, could not overcome the policy objections to the courts\u2019 involvement in these matters <em>(Paladino v Adelphi Univ., </em>89 AD2d 85). A different question would be posed if the contract required specified services, for instance, a designated number of hours of instruction <em>(id., </em>at p 92).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Finally, plaintiff cannot succeed on his constitutional claim that he was deprived of his State-created entitlement to an \u201cappropriate\u201d education without a hearing. Plaintiff does not complain that he was deprived of any particular program he was then enjoying (see <em>Board of Regents v Roth, </em>408 US 564; compare <em>Goss v Lopez, </em>419 US 565). Further, the \u201centitlement\u201d at issue cannot be determined through the application of objective criteria. Rather, it depends upon the decisions of professional educators as to the needs of a particular student. Such nebulous entitlements do not lend themselves to protection through the procedural due process requirement. Indeed, they do not even come into existence until the discretionary determination as to what is appropriate is made. Though a due process protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>may well apply when the child is not placed in school at all (see <em>Patton v Dumpson, </em>425 F Supp 621, 625), no such claim may be advanced here. (See, also, <em>Donohue v Copiague Union Free School Dist., </em>47 NY2d 440, 443, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Plaintiff acknowledges that recovery is precluded against the Board of Education, the party charged with actually furnishing his public school education and thus primarily at fault if he indeed received a deficient education. For the reasons set forth in <em>Hoffman </em>and <em>Donohue </em>recovery for this same alleged injury cannot be permitted against plaintiff\u2019s legal custodians. The order of the Appellate Division dismissing the complaint should therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-6\">., For example, DSS has the duty to care for abandoned children (Social Services Law, \u00a7 398, subd 2, par [b]), to provide suitable vocational training in certain circumstances (Social Services Law, \u00a7 398, subd 6, par [k]) and to supervise the institution in which the child is placed (Social Services Law, \u00a7 398, subd 6, par [g]). The child care agency must arrange for the child to receive a suitable education (18 NYCRR 441.13 [formerly 5.19]). Either organization may seek administrative review of any decision made by school officials (Education Law, \u00a7 310), including those with respect to special services available for handicapped children (current version codified at Education Law, \u00a7 4402).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b193-6\">. Contrast <em>Snow v State of New York </em>(64 NY2d 745). In <em>Snow, </em>plaintiff was under three years of age when he was admitted to the Willowbrook State School, an institution where the \u201cpatients\u201d received continuous medical and psychological treatment, where plaintiff\u2019s record resembled a hospital or medical record rather than a school report, and where payment for treatment was made under his father\u2019s medical plan. Plaintiff was deaf, but his condition was not diagnosed. Instead, he was given an intelligence test inappropriate for deaf children, resulting in his mistaken institutionalization and consequent injury. The Appellate Division upheld plaintiff\u2019s cause of action as grounded in medical, rather than educational, malpractice. While mistaken evaluations are central to both <em>Snow </em>and <em>Torres, </em>such factors as age of the child upon entry, nature of the institution and kind of care administered mark the difference between medical and educational malpractice claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b193-7\">. The dissent points to the various obligations the law imposes on defen- . dants to determine a child\u2019s special needs (dissenting opn, at pp 131-132). Plaintiff\u2019s underlying contention is not that defendants ignored any specific statutory direction to conduct reviews, for the record indicates that they conferred periodically about plaintiff\u2019s problem, but that they erroneously concluded that the public school was equipped to deal with him.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b195-5\">Meyer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AB6\">(dissenting). Because I cannot accept the distinctions drawn by the majority between this case and <em>Klostermann v Cuomo </em>(61 NY2d 525) and <em>Snow v State of New York </em>(64 NY2d 745), I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\"><em>Klostermann v Cuomo </em>(61 NY2d, at p 531, <em>supra) </em>held that \u201cif a statutory directive is mandatory, not precatory, it is within the courts\u2019 competence to ascertain whether an administrative agency has satisfied the duty that has been imposed on it by the Legislature\u201d and that plaintiffs in that case had (at p 541) \u201cproperly petitioned the courts for a declaration of their rights, whether derived from the Federal or State Constitutions, statutes, or regulations.\u201d Plaintiff Torres seeks damages from the city and its employees,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and from Little Flower Children\u2019s Services, the child-care institution with which the city contracted, for failure of the city to satisfy duties imposed upon it by statute and regulations, and for failure of defendant Little Flower to satisfy the duties imposed upon it by statute and regulation as well as by its contract with the municipality. The majority, because the dereliction from duty has resulted in plaintiff\u2019s illiteracy, an educational lack, concludes that the policy against involving courts in the selection of educational programs enunciated in <em>Hoffman v Board of Educ. </em>(49 NY2d 121) and <em>Donohue v Copiague Union Free School Dist. </em>(47 NY2d 440) forecloses plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Educational policy is no more involved in Frank Torres\u2019 illiteracy than it was in Donald Snow\u2019s stunted intellectual growth. In Snow\u2019s case those in charge of his custody breached their duty by failing to ascertain that he was totally deaf; in Torres\u2019, what defendants failed to ascertain, though obliged to do so, was that he had no understanding of, or ability to speak in, any language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>but Spanish while he was being raised in an almost entirely English speaking environment. In Snow\u2019s case the action has been held maintainable because predicated on medical, rather than educational, malpractice; in like manner Torres\u2019 claim should be held maintainable because based on custodial, rather than educational, breach of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Special Term did not discuss the duties of the city at all and as to Little Flower said only that, \u201cThe contract required for the arrangement for education, and plaintiff admits he was placed in a public school. As such defendant did not breach its contractual obligation.\u201d The Appellate Division affirmed, without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Summary judgment may not be granted if there is a triable issue of fact and in determining whether there is the evidence presented must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party moved against (Siegel, NY Prac, \u00a7 281, p 338). On that basis, there is ample proof, when measured against the obligations of the municipal defendants under statute and regulation, and of defendant Little Flower, under statute, regulation and contract of which plaintiff was the third-party beneficiary, to require denial of defendants\u2019 motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">As we have made clear in <em>Tucker v Toia </em>(43 NY2d 1) and <em>Matter of Lee v Smith </em>(43 NY2d 453), section 1 of article XVII of the State Constitution imposes upon the State an affirmative duty to aid the needy, which clothes the Legislature with discretion to determine the means by which aid is to be provided, but \u201cunequivocally prevents the Legislature from simply refusing to aid those whom it has classified as needy\u201d <em>(Tucker v Toia, </em>43 NY2d, at p 8, <em>supra). </em>What distinguishes this case from the <em>Hoffman </em>and <em>Donohue </em>cases is that we deal here with whether the agencies chosen to carry out the State\u2019s obligation to a needy foster child have carried out the duties imposed upon them by the Legislature and the governmental agencies acting under its aegis, not with whether the educational institution itself followed its separate, though incidentally related, obligations. And what distinguishes the obligation of defendants in this case from those of natural parents and other persons in parental relation to a child is that, although section 3212 (subd 2, par b) of the Education Law imposes upon both the duty to \u201ccause such individual to attend upon instruction\u201d, the Social Services Law imposes upon defendants obligations not imposed upon natural parents by that or any other statute, or (if, for purposes of argument we accept a broad view of the parental immunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>declared in <em>Holodook v Spencer, </em>36 NY2d 35)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by common law. The overly simplistic view of Special Term, apparently accepted by the Appellate Division, that defendants had discharged their full obligation to Frank Torres by causing him to attend the public school maintained by the City Board of Education on Little Flowers\u2019 premises fails to consider the pertinent constitutional, statutory, regulatory and contractual provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Section 398 of the Social Services Law provides that the city\u2019s public welfare officers \u201cshall have powers and perform duties\u201d including with respect to defective children to \u201c[o]btain admission to state or other suitable schools, hospitals, other institutions *** in accordance with the provisions of the mental hygiene law, education law and acts relating to the family court\u201d (subd 4, par [a]) and with respect to all children within their care to \u201c[plrovide for expert mental and physical examination of any child whom he [sic] has reason to suspect of mental or physical defect or disease\u201d (subd 6, par [b]) and to \u201cprovide suitable vocational training\u201d (subd 6, par [k]).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Section 395 of the Social Services Law permits the public official charged with those duties to administer them either directly or through an authorized agency, but the institution in which a child is placed must be conducted in accordance with applicable regulations and the placement is to be supervised by the public official (Social Services Law, \u00a7 398, subd 6, par [g]). As the supervision requirement indicates, administration through an agency or institution such as Little Flower does not relieve the public official of his or her statutory obligations. Those obligations are nondelegable <em>(Bartels v County of Westchester, </em>76 AD2d 517, 523) as was indeed recognized in the preamble to section VII and in section X (par A) of the contract between the city and Little Flower.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The regulations adopted pursuant to that authority required not only that children in the care of the institution receive suitable education as required by law (18 NYCRR 5.19 [in effect at times pertinent to this case], now 18 NYCRR 441.13) but also that a plan of service be developed for such child (18 NYCRR 5.22, now 18 NYCRR 441.14 [b]) and that psychiatric and psychological services, including tests and examinations, be made available to children under care of the institution (18 NYCRR 5.20 [b], now 18 NYCRR 441.15). Moreover, as to the plan of service, the State Board\u2019s Commentary to section 5.22 not only required a preliminary plan on intake which was to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>include \u201cproper placement in school\u201d and \u201cspecial services needed, e.g., remedial reading, speech therapy\u201d, but also required that the plan of service \u201cbe subject to constant evaluation and formally reviewed annually,\u201d and the Commentary to section 5.20 (b) recommended appropriate use of psychological services, including direction of a remedial program.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Little Flower does not dispute that it is an authorized agency governed by the above provision and that its contract with the municipal defendants required it to arrange, \u201cas needed, religious training, education and vocational training.\u201d Its argument that its obligation is limited solely to such arrangement overlooks the facts that (1) the quoted words simply define the \u201cBasic Care\u201d to be provided under the contract, (2) the contract required it to provide foster care services, (3) under section III of the contract it agreed to provide those services \u201cin accordance with the Social Services Law, Rules of the State Board of Social Welfare, the Regulations of the New York State Department of Social Services, the Inter-Agency Manual and the policies and procedures of the Department\u201d and (4) section VII of the contract required that it provide an initial service plan within 60 days of the placement of a child, submit a semiannual review at the end of six months and obtain reauthorization of the placement annually.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">As one of the foster care children for whose benefit the contract with Little Flower was made, Frank Torres would be entitled, as a third-party beneficiary, to recover for its breach (see <em>Seaver v Ransom, </em>224 NY 233).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And as <em>Snow v State of New York (supra), </em>makes clear, the negligent failure of defendants, including Little Flower, to carry out the obligations imposed by statute or regulation may give rise to liability (see, also, <em>Doe v New York City Dept. of Social Servs., </em>649 F2d 134, on second app 709 F2d 782, cert den _ US _, 104 S Ct 195).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Considered in light of the foregoing, the record, without question, presents triable issues of fact. The claim simply is that the defendants were aware of Frank Torres\u2019 language problem but did nothing at all to remedy it. Thus it was known to defendants when he entered Little Flower that he spoke only Spanish, and an entry in his case record made a year later noted that, \u201cBecause of a language problem, communication with Frank has been minimal. He does not appear to understand the drift of a question and his answers are confused arid inappropriate.\u201d Yet no steps were taken by defendants to assist him in overcoming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>his language problem. The Learning Diagnostic Center later noted that Frank\u2019s \u201cearly attempts to learn to read and write were therefore surrounded by anxiety and confusion, due to his struggle with English.\u201d Instead, based on tests administered in English, he was placed in classes for the retarded, and this despite the fact that his achievements in mathematics were inconsistent with retardation. Then when finally referred to a reading specialist, who recommended specific steps to remedy plaintiff\u2019s reading problem, nothing was done during the ensuing four years that plaintiff remained in defendant\u2019s custody. And of all this the city defendants received regular reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Donald Snow was misdiagnosed as retarded and will recover $1,500,000 because Willowbrook\u2019s care included medical and psychiatric services and its failure can be labeled medical, rather than educational, malpractice. Yet Frank Torres, also misdiagnosed as retarded by those who had charge of his custody and were obligated to obtain for him instruction, including the ability to read and write in English, necessary reasonably to prepare him for later life, receives nothing because the issue is said to involve educational policy. If a label is necessary, defendants\u2019 failures can properly be designated custodial malpractice. But in truth what is here involved, so the trier of fact could find, is a simple failure to carry out obligations imposed by Constitution, statute, regulation and contract, which has resulted in plaintiff\u2019s illiteracy, but is wholly distinct from matters of educational policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Judges Jasen, Jones and Simons concur with Judge Kaye; Judge Meyer dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion in which Chief Judge Cooke and Judge Wachtler concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b195-8\">.
