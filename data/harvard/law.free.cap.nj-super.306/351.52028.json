Judge Oles, in the Law Division, granted summary judgment in Liberty\u2019s favor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>concluding that Healey was not acting within the course of her employment with Liberty at the time of the accident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm. We hold that generally an employee\u2019s commutation to and from work is not within the scope of employment for the purposes of imposing liability upon the employer for the negligence of the employee-driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Considering the evidentiary material in a light most favorable to plaintiff, <em>see Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995), these are the facts. Healey was employed as a part-time loan officer with Liberty at its offices in Little Egg Harbor, Ocean County. She did not keep regular business hours. She had a key to the office and access to it at any time during the day or night. She often stopped at the Liberty office after its regular business hours to pick up rate sheets, application forms, or make photocopies and business calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The accident occurred at 8:30 p.m. while Healey was en route from her home to the Liberty office to pick up mortgage application forms. Plaintiff, a pedestrian, was struck by Healey\u2019s vehicle when it turned from Radio Road into the entrance of the Liberty office parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">\u201cConduct is generally considered to be within the scope of employment if, \u2018it is of the kind [that the servant] is employed to perform; it occurs substantially within the authorized time and space limits; [and] it is actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the master.\u2019 \u201d <em>Di Cosala v. Kay, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>159,169, 450 A.2d 508 (1982) (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Agency, </em>\u00a7 228 (1957); <em>see also Abbamont v. Piscataway Tp. Bd. of Educ., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>405, 416, 650 A.2d 958 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">Most courts endorse the general rule that an employee driving his or her own vehicle to and from the employee\u2019s workplace is not within the scope of employment for the purpose of imposing vicarious liability upon the employer for the negligence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>employee-driver. <em>Weaver v. United States Coast Guard, </em>857 <em>F.Supp. </em>539, 545 (S.D.Tex.1994), <em>aff'd, </em>53 F.3d 1282 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Skinner v. Braum\u2019s Ice Cream Store, </em>890 P.2d 922, 924 (Okla. 1995); <em>Logan v. Phillips, </em>891 S.W.2d 542, 544 (Mo.Ct.App.1995); <em>Faverty v. McDonald\u2019s Restaurants of Oregon, Inc., </em>133 <em>Or.App. </em>514, 892 P.2d 703, 708 (1995); <em>Dillman v. Great Dane Trailers, Inc., </em>649 N.E.2d 665, 667 (Ind.Ct.App.1995); <em>Vaughan v. Hair, </em>645 So.2d 1177,1179 (La.Ct.App.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>650 So.2d 1186 (1995); <em>Kimball v. United States, </em>262 <em>F.Supp. </em>509, 513 (D.N.J. 1967); <em>see also </em>cases cited by Christopher Vaeth, Annotation, <em>Employer\u2019s Liability for Negligence of Employee in Driving His or Her Own Automobile, </em>27 <em>ALR </em>5th \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3 at 218-38 (1995). This general rule is sometimes ascribed to the theory that employment is suspended from the time the employee leaves the workplace until he or she returns, or that in traveling to and from work, the employee is not rendering service to the employer. <em>Hinman v. Westinghouse Elec. Co., 2 </em>Cal.3d 956, 88 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>188, 190-91, 471 P.2d 988, 990-91 (1970). Other courts focus on the fact that, while the commute is work motivated, the element of \u201ccontrol\u201d by the employer is lacking. <em>Jones v. Blair, </em>387 <em>N.W.2d </em>349,355 (Iowa 1986); <em>Logan, supra, </em>891 S.W.2d at 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">There are several recognized exceptions to this general rule, none of which apply here. For example, courts have imposed <em>respondeat superior </em>liability upon the employer when the employee is engaged in a special errand or mission. <em>Chevron v. Lee, </em>847 S.W.2d 354, 356 (Tex.Ct.App.1993); <em>Studebaker v. Nettie\u2019s Flower Garden, Inc., </em>842 S.W.2d 227, 229 (Mo.Ct.App.1992); <em>Burger Chef Sys. v. Govro, </em>407 F.2d 921, 927 (8th Cir.1969). Another exception is where an employer requires the employee to drive his or her vehicle to work so that the vehicle is available for use in fulfilling the employee\u2019s work-related responsibilities. <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 <em>Md. </em>24, 660 A.2d 423, 426-27 (1995). As a corollary to this rule, an employer may be held liable if the employee is \u201con call\u201d and is involved in an accident while travelling to a work site in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>response to an employer\u2019s request for his service. <em>Evington v. Forbes, </em>742 F.2d 834, 836-37 (4th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Here, the general rule applies. Healey was simply driving from her home to the Liberty office to obtain mortgage application forms. The fact that Healey was on her way to the office to perform some work-related duty is not sufficient in and of itself to constitute a mission undertaken on Liberty\u2019s behalf. Further, the commute was not controlled by Liberty. Healey was operating her own car; Liberty did not dictate the manner by which Healey operated it, the route of travel, or when she chose to commute to the Liberty office for work-related purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The thrust of plaintiffs argument is that the general rule should apply only to \u201cnine to five\u201d employees, \u201cwhose services do not .begin until they arrive at work and end when they leave to go home.\u201d Plaintiff reasons that because of the undefined and flexible nature of the time and space parameters of Healey\u2019s employment, she acts within the course of her employment with Liberty any time she commutes to the office to perform a work-related task before travelling \u201cto other locations.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The fact that Healey commutes to and from the Liberty office at her convenience renders the commute no more work-connected than if she had been a \u201cnine to five\u201d employee. That Liberty may have benefitted from the flexibility of Healey\u2019s work schedule is not dispositive. Indeed, the flexible work schedule inured more to her benefit than to the benefit of her employer. Moreover, Healey\u2019s varying hours and unrestricted access to the Liberty office underscores the absence of control by Liberty as to the manner by which she chose to carry out her work-related tasks.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Plaintiff also points to the fact that the accident occurred at the entrance to Liberty\u2019s parking lot, and cites <em>Livingstone v. Abraham &amp; Straus, Inc., </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>89, 543 A.2d 45 (1988), for the proposition that liability should be imposed against Liberty because Healey had reached her \u201cplace of employment,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\"><em>Livingstone </em>is a workers\u2019 compensation case. Under N.J.S.A 34:15-7, compensation is allowed when an employee is injured in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>an accident \u201carising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d In <em>Livingstone, </em>an employee had parked her vehicle in a far comer of a shopping mall parking lot designated for Abraham &amp; Straus employees. <em>Id. </em>at 91, 543 A.2d 45. While walking from her car to the employee entrance, she was struck by a car and sustained injuries. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court was called upon to interpret <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-36, added to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act by <em>P.L. </em>1979, c. 283 \u00a7 12, which provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">Employment shall be deemed to commence when <em>an employee arrives at the employer's place of employment </em>to report for work and shall terminate when the employee leaves the employer\u2019s place of employment, <em>excluding areas not under the control of the </em>employer____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The Court found that petitioner\u2019s injury was compensable because she had arrived at her \u201cemployer\u2019s place of employment.\u201d <em>Livingstone, supra, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>at 104, 543 A.2d 45. Although the employer did not own the parking lot, the employee-designated portion of the lot where petitioner had parked \u201cwas under the control of\u2019 Abraham &amp; Straus, first because the designated area of the lot was used by the employees in the conduct of its business, and petitioner\u2019s accident \u201carose out of a risk incidental to [her] employment.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Second, by requiring its employees to park in a distant section of the lot in order that customers can enjoy'the convenience of parking adjacent to the store, Abraham &amp; Straus caused petitioner to be \u201cexposed to an added hazard ... in order to enhance its business interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105-06, 543 A.2d 45. <em>Cf. Novis v. Rosenbluth Travel, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>92, 96, 649 A.2d 69 (1994) (holding that employee had not arrived at \u201cemployer\u2019s place of employment\u201d when employer exercised no control over parking lot where petitioner fell).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\"><em>Livingstone </em>is clearly distinguishable because it defines the parameters of the \u201cemployer\u2019s place of employment\u201d in the context of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, and endorses a flexible ease-by-case analysis of the concept of \u201ccontrol\u201d in a manner consistent with the remedial purposes and spirit of the Act. 111 <em>N.J. </em>at 102-05, 543 A.2d 45. No New Jersey case has equated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>tort concept \u201cwithin the scope of employment\u201d with the workers\u2019 compensation concept of \u201carising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d As stated, the latter is applied in such a way as to effect the humane purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act in providing compensation to injured employees. <em>See Sheffield v. Sobering Plough Corp., </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>442, 461, 680 A.2d 750 (1996). The former involves application of the <em>Restatement (Seco-nd) of Agency \u00a7 228 </em>criteria in deciding whether an employer is liable for the injuries to a third party caused by the negligence of the employee. <em>See Government Employees Ins. Co. v. United States, </em>678 <em>F.Supp. </em>454, 456 (D.N.J.1988) (holding that the New Jersey workers\u2019 compensation eases do not govern the scope of employment doctrine for purposes of <em>respondeat superior </em>liability).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Consequently, it is of no legal significance here that the accident occurred at the entrance of the Liberty parking lot. Healey\u2019s turn into the entrance was merely the tail end of her commute to the Liberty office, and therefore did not fall within the course of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b375-10\"> Plaintiff settled his claim against Healey.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
