On October 13, 1993, the State filed a motion to transfer the pending Family Part complaint to the Law Division where defendant, subsequent to indictment, would stand trial as an adult. The State\u2019s motion was ultimately granted on March 29,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-12\">Thereafter, defendant and Rudy Perdomo were indicted and charged as follows: first-degree carjacking, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-2a(l), (count one); first-degree armed robbery, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-la(l), (count two); first-degree kidnapping, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:13-lb(l) and (2), (count three); third-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>degree aggravated criminal sexual contact, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:14-3a, (count four); third-degree terroristic threats, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:12-3b, (count five); third-degree possession of a weapon, a T-bar auto stick shift, for purposes to use same against the person of another, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:39-4d, (count sue); and fourth-degree unlawful possession of a weapon under circumstances not manifestly appropriate for such lawful uses as it may have, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:39-5d, (count seven).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Tried to a jury, defendant was convicted on all counts with the exception of count four, charging aggravated criminal sexual contact.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Defendant was sentenced on count one, carjacking, to a custodial term of twenty years with a five-year period of parole ineligibility.

Both issues require discussion. However, after a thorough review of the record, we conclude that defendant\u2019s arguments lack merit, and thus we affirm defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">After attending a party at the home of a relative, Flora Gonzalez arrived at her residence, near the intersection of 64th Street and Boulevard East, in West New York, New Jersey, at 3:45 a.m. on September 11, 1993. Gonzalez parked her automobile, placed her automobile keys in her back pocket, and proceeded toward her front door with her house keys in her hand. As she neared her front door, a man, later identified as defendant, stepped in front of Gonzalez and demanded that she give her keys to him. Gonzalez screamed. Her assailant struck the right side of her forehead with a metal object. Gonzalez attempted to struggle with her assailant but was struck again and fell to the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">A second man, later identified as Perdomo, approached and began to rifle through Gonzalez\u2019s pockets. He demanded, \u201cGive me the car keys or we\u2019ll kill you.\u201d This assailant then tore Gonzalez\u2019s blouse, and pulled her bra up around her neck, exposing her breast. During the struggle, Gonzalez\u2019s house keys were taken from her.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">The first assailant dragged Gonzalez to the end of her building into a small alley. The assailant then fled. Gonzalez ultimately testified that after her assailant fled, she immediately saw a police officer approaching her.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">According to Officer Conversano, while on routine patrol, he was flagged down by a passing motorist. He immediately proceeded to the intersection of 64th and Boulevard East. He observed a woman being assaulted by two men. He dispatched this information to police headquarters, exited his vehicle, and approached the scene. He described the lighting in the area as \u201cvery good.\u201d He noted that one assailant was holding an object in his fist, which \u201clooked a little like a stick or a bar or something.\u201d When Conversano was ten to fifteen feet from the assailants, they noticed him and fled through the alleyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">As a result of Conversano\u2019s radio dispatch, a number of officers arrived at the scene. Conversano provided the officers with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>description of the assailants. The details of the ensuing investigation in the neighborhood were explained at trial. We need not review these extensive details.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Suffice to say, one detective saw a male running on 65th Street. That detective exited his vehicle and caught the male, defendant, who immediately said, \u201cI didn\u2019t do nothing to the lady, what are you charging me with.\u201d Defendant was searched and the detective found a metal gear shift in his pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Another officer climbed a fire escape to the roof of a nearby building. He observed a barefoot<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> male crouched in a corner of the roof. This individual, co-defendant Perdomo, was apprehended and searched. A set of keys were found in his front left pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">Both assailants were brought to a location near the crime scene, as was the victim who had been badly bruised. Gonzalez was unable to identify either man. She was shown two sets of keys, and identified one set as her house keys. Gonzalez\u2019s automobile keys were not located.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">Defendant\u2019s first two points of error raise legal issues regarding his referral from the Family Part to the Law Division pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-26. <em>See R. </em>5:22-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">In his first point, defendant contends that the motion judge erred when: (1) he denied defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s request for a third postponement of the referral hearing to allow additional time to secure expert testimony; (2) he concluded that the interests of the public required referral despite the absence of evidence clearly defining defendant\u2019s role or defendant\u2019s dangerousness; (3) he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>concluded that the reasons for referral to the Law Division outweighed the possibility that defendant could be rehabilitated; and (4) he concluded that the basis for referral was probable cause that defendant had committed second-degree robbery although defendant had been charged with juvenile delinquency, characterized as carjacking,</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">In his second point, defendant contends he was denied effective assistance of counsel at the referral hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">We find both arguments completely without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11\u2014 3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">After the State filed its motion seeking referral to the Law Division, defendant\u2019s counsel scheduled a psychological evaluation. The evaluation was twice postponed, as defendant\u2019s mother failed to appear. That delay necessitated rescheduling of the referral hearing. After the evaluation was performed, defense counsel sought a second postponement to await receipt of the written evaluation. Ultimately, a written psychological evaluation was received; however, according to defense counsel, the psychologist\u2019s opinion was not helpful to defendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> His counsel then sought a third postponement of the referral hearing to obtain a second psychological opinion. That request was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">A judge has discretion to allow a party additional time to secure witnesses. Only when the factual record demonstrates that the judge abused his discretion will we reverse. <em>See State v. Kyles, </em>132 <em>N.J.Super. </em>397, 402, 334 A.2d 44 (App.Div.1975); <em>see also State v. Barron, </em>214 <em>N.J.Super. </em>46, 50-51, 518 A.2d 484 (App.Div.1986) (finding no abuse of discretion in trial court\u2019s denial of an adjournment where there was no evidence that defendant\u2019s counsel failed to function as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment). Here, counsel was unable to demonstrate that a further postponement would prove beneficial to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>defendant. Without some proffer that an additional postponement would prove beneficial to defendant, we conclude the motion judge did not abuse his discretion in denying defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">At the referral hearing, the State relied on the testimony of Officer Conversano, who witnessed two assailants beating a fifty five-year-old woman who was laying on the ground. He testified that one assailant, the defendant, held a metal object in his fist as he beat his victim. The victim was injured and required medical attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Although defendant was charged with delinquency characterized as carjacking within the complaint filed in the Family Part, the judge concluded that there was probable cause to believe that the conduct of the defendant, if committed by an adult, would constitute second-degree robbery. Additionally, the judge concluded that the crime was committed in \u201can aggressive, violent and willful manner\u201d and that \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the charge are sufficiently serious that the interests of the [public] require waiver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">The judge\u2019s detailed findings of fact and conclusions mirror the referral statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-26, which states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-9\">a. On motion of the prosecutor, the court shall, without the consent of the juvenile, waive jurisdiction over a ease and refer that case from the Superior Court, Chancery Division, Family Part to the appropriate court and prosecuting authority having jurisdiction if it finds, after hearing that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-10\">(1) The juvenile was 14 years of age or older at the time of the charged delinquent act; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-11\">(2) There is probable cause to believe that the juvenile committed a delinquent act or acts which if committed by an adult would constitute:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9\">(a) Criminal homicide other than death by auto, strict liability for drug induced deaths, pursuant to N.J.S. 2C:35-9, robbery which would constitute a crime of the first degree, aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault, aggravated assault which would constitute a crime of the second degree, kidnapping or aggravated arson; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-13\">(d) An offense against a person committed in an aggressive, violent and willful manner____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>(3) Except with respect to [enumerated offenses], the State has shown that the nature and circumstances of the charge or the prior record of the juvenile are sufficiently serious that the interests of the public require waiver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\">However, if in any case the juvenile can show that the probability of his rehabilitation by the use of the procedures, services and facilities available to the court prior to the juvenile reaching the age of 19 substantially outweighs the reasons for waiver, waiver shall not be granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The waiver of jurisdiction by the Family Part is governed by principles enunciated in <em>State v. R.G.D., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>1, 4, 527 A.2d 834 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">The waiver of jurisdiction procedure is divided into two phases commonly referred to as Phase I and Phase II. <em>See State in the Interest of A.L., </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>192, 202-03, 638 A.2d 814 (App.Div.1994); <em>State in the Interest of A.J., </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>274, 556 A.2d 1283 (App.Div.1989). Here, the State clearly met its burden in each phase of the referral hearing. The motion judge cited the applicable statute and judicial precedent, and the testimony of Officer Conversano supportive of the judge\u2019s conclusion that the juvenile committed <em>a </em>delinquent act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-26a(2)(d) (emphasis added). <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:4A-26 does not explicitly require the State to establish probable cause for the very act of delinquency initially charged in the juvenile complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">In affirming the judge\u2019s decision, we recognize that waiver to the Law Division is discretionary. <em>State v. Onque, </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>578, 584, 676 A.2d 560 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>497, 683 A.2d 200 (1996). A discretionary decision to refer a juvenile complaint to the Law Division will not be disturbed unless it is shown that the exercise of discretion was abused. <em>Ibid. </em>Defendant has failed to allege on appeal that the motion judge abused his discretion, and our review of the record on appeal fails to reflect any basis to reach such a conclusion. Additionally, the judge\u2019s findings of fact are clearly supported in the record and deserve great deference. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 162, 199 A.2d 809 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">We particularly note that defendant\u2019s counsel failed to raise an objection to the judge\u2019s decision to refer to the Law Division <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>predicated upon an act of delinquency, characterized as second-degree robbery, rather than the act of delinquency, characterized as carjacking, as cited in the juvenile complaint. As such, defendant may not raise this issue on appeal. <em>R. </em>1:7-2. Defendant also does not contend that the motion judge\u2019s ruling constitutes \u201cplain error.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Moreover, although the motion judge did not find that defendant\u2019s conduct constituted carjacking,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or first-degree robbery, he properly placed defendant\u2019s conduct within <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-26a(2)(d), as \u201can offense against a person committed in an aggressive, violent and willful manner.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The facts underlying the charge of second-degree robbery in this case clearly permitted the judge to transfer jurisdiction to the Law Division, notwithstanding the fact that the judge did not find defendant\u2019s conduct to be within any of the offenses enumerated in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:4A-26a(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">We also conclude that defendant\u2019s contention that his counsel was ineffective lacks merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll~3(e)(2). Defendant claims his counsel was deficient in:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-8\">(1) Neglecting to secure an expert report in the time frame set by the court to demonstrate the possibility that defendant can be rehabilitated by the age of nineteen, or to present evidence on the issue of defendant\u2019s amenability to rehabilitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">(2) Neglecting to adequately explore the possibility of defendant testifying at the referral hearing as to his specific involvement in the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-10\">(3) Neglecting to provide the court with evidence of other rehabilitative programs and services to the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">In evaluating defendant\u2019s claim, we must first consider the standard enunciated in <em>State v. Fritz, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>42, 519 A.2d 336 (1987). In <em>Fritz, </em>our Supreme Court adopted the two-part test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>668,104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). <em>Fritz, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 51-52, 519 A.2d 336. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>To prove ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must first show that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defendant and was so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">In the context of a juvenile referral hearing, we are guided by <em>State v. Jack, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>240, 676 A.2d 545 (1996). To prove a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a juvenile must demonstrate \u201cthat there was evidence of a genuine potential for rehabilitation that counsel did not present to the juvenile court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255, 676 A.2d 545. Defendant makes no such showing here. The record is devoid of any evidence of this type.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Clearly, defendant\u2019s counsel fought diligently for her client. She received two postponements of the referral hearing while awaiting a psychologist\u2019s report. When the report did not support defendant\u2019s position, she sought additional time to seek a new opinion. When this motion was denied, she appealed the issue to this court, to no avail. Counsel cannot be held responsible where an expert report as rendered was unfavorable to her client\u2019s position. We note, however, that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are difficult to evaluate on direct appeal. <em>See State v. Preciose, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>451, 460, 609 A.2d 1280 (1992). We preserve defendant\u2019s right to assert this claim in a petition for post-conviction relief. <em>R. </em>3:22-1 to -11.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">In defendant\u2019s third point of error, he contends for the first time on appeal that the judge\u2019s jury charge predicated upon the carjacking statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-2, was error as the judge directed that the object of a theft in a carjacking can be the car keys, as part of a criminal act intended to result in the theft of an automobile. We disagree. We conclude that the judge\u2019s charge fully comports with the carjacking statute. Additionally, the charge comports with our analysis of this statute as discussed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number><em>State v. Williams, </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>611, 674 A.2d 643 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>375, 678 A.2d 716 (1996). Moreover, the charge does not constitute plain error. <em>See R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Carjacking is defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:15-2 as the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">a.

A person convicted of carjacking shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment and that term of imprisonment shall include the imposition of a minimum term of at least five years during which the defendant shall be ineligible for parole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-13\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-14\">Defendant urges that the trial judge erred in his charge<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> because \u201c[ojnly a finding of purposeful state of mind, i.e., that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>was the conscious object to take the motor vehicle, could support a conviction of carjacking.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Part of the judge\u2019s charge included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">[T]he only scenario by which you may find the defendant individually by his own conduct or as an accomplice of each other with shared criminal intent guilt is if the State has proven to you beyond a reasonable doubt, in addition to all the other elements, that the defendants demanded and attempted to take or did take the car keys and in doing so inflicted injury purposely or used force upon her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">So remember, here, we are talking about the State alleging that the defendants] by their own conduct or as accomplices of each other with shared criminal intent committed an attempt, that is, a substantial step in furtherance of the crime charged, to commit an unlawful taking, as I have defined unlawful, without permission or consent, of a motor vehicle, that at the time they did this they inflicted bodily injury or used force upon Flora Gonzalez as I have defined it, as to the effort, the attempt to secure her car keys, not house keys, not general keys, car keys, for purposes of exercising control and dominion over the automobile____ If you do not find that the defendant\u2019s purpose either ... individually or with shared criminal intent as accomplices was not to take the car keys for purposes of taking the car, for example, then you ... must find the defendants not guilty____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">In <em>State v.

The broad aim of the statute is to enhance the punishment applicable to persons who use force or intimidation \u201cto gain possession of [a] motor vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-13\">In <em>Williams, </em>the defendant sought reversal of his carjacking conviction because the victim had already exited the vehicle when the defendant took the victim\u2019s keys and car. <em>Id. </em>at 615, 674 A.2d 643. We rejected that assertion based on the above reading of the carjacking statute, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-14\">We add that defendant\u2019s strained reading of the law would yield anomalous results. It would mean that a criminal who places a gun to the head of an unsuspecting victim who is loading groceries into his or her car would not fall within the reach of the statute. We need not describe a litany of similar factual scenarios to illustrate the absurdity of defendant\u2019s argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-15\"><em>[Id. </em>at 617, 674 A.2d 643.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-16\">The circumstances here clearly present a scenario which is proscribed by the carjacking statute. A victim alights from her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>vehicle in front of her house and two men use force in an attempt to take her car keys intending to steal her car. As noted, the victim testified that her second assailant demanded, \u201cGive me the car keys or we\u2019ll kill you.\u201d Those threatening words were uttered after the victim was struck twice with a metal object by the first assailant and after she had fallen to the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">We expressly reject defendant\u2019s additional argument that the trial judge erred when he failed to charge robbery, assault and theft from the person as lesser-included offenses, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-8, under the carjacking statute. Defendant did not request any charge encompassing a lesser-included offense. As noted in <em>State v. Scherzer, </em>301 <em>N.J.Super. </em>363, 481, 694 A.2d 196 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>466, 700 A.2d 878 (1997),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">When a defendant requests a lesser included offense charge, the judge is obligated to examine the record thoroughly to determine if the rational basis test of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-8e has been satisfied. However, when the defendant does not request such a charge, as is the case here, the trial judge does not \u201chave the obligation on its own meticulously to sift through the entire record\u201d to see if the tacts and inferences might sustain a particular charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-8\"><em>[Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Choice, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>295, 299, 486 A.2d 833 (1985)) (other citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">Examining the charge as a whole, <em>see State v. Concepcion, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>373, 376, 545 A.2d 119 (1988); <em>State v. Maldonado, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>536, 579, 645 A.2d 1165 (1994), there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, defendant moved, pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:18-1, for acquittal on the charge of kidnapping, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:13-1, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-12\">b. Holding for other purposes. A person is guilty of Mdnapping if he unlawfully removes another from his place of residence or business, or a substantial distance from the vicinity where ho is found, or if he unlawfully confines another for a substantial period, with any of the following purposes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-13\">(1) To facilitate commission of any crime or flight thereafter.. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-14\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:13-1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-15\">Defendant argues that he \u201ccould not have been found guilty of kidnapping because the victim was neither removed a substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>distance nor confined for a substantial period of time.\u201d We disagree. We are guided by our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Masino, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>436, 466 A.2d 955 (1983), in which the Court upheld an asportation kidnapping conviction where the victim was dragged out of her car, across a street, and a short distance to a pond. The Court concluded that the \u201csubstantial distance\u201d requirement of the statute addresses the risk of increased harm occasioned by the abduction. <em>Id. </em>at 438, 466 A.2d 955. The Court specifically concluded: \u201cMore sensible is the interpretation that views a \u2018substantial distance\u2019 as one that isolates the victim and exposes him or her to an increased risk of harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445,466 A.2d 955.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Here, the evidence shows that the victim was dragged twenty-three feet to the end of her building to a small alley. Like <em>Masino, </em>the victim here was taken to a more secluded place where the assailants could more easily attack her without being seen. Certainly, giving the State every favorable inference, <em>see State v. Muniz, </em>150 <em>N.J.Super. </em>436, 440, 375 A.2d 1234 (App.Div.1977), <em>certif. denied, 77 N.J. </em>473, 391 A.2d 488 (1978), the motion for acquittal on this count was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">On appeal, defendant contends, for the first time that certain comments by the prosecutor in his summation were improper and require reversal as plain error. <em>R. </em>2:10-2. We find this argument totally without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">Defendant also refers to a separate section in the prosecutor\u2019s summation as error requiring reversal. We note that defendant did offer a timely objection, which was sustained. In fact, the trial judge specifically and immediately instructed the jury to disregard the prosecutor\u2019s comment. Defendant\u2019s objection, coupled with the judge\u2019s response and specific instruction to the jury, was sufficient to cure any prejudicial impact upon the jury. <em>See State v. Marshall, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>1,159, 586 A.2d 85 (1991); <em>State v. Darrian, </em>255 <em>N.J.Super. </em>435, 453, 605 A.2d 716 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>130 <em>N.J. </em>13, 611 A.2d 651 (1992); <em>State v. Reese, </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>133,138, 671 A.2d 1112 (App.Div.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Defendant contends that the trial judge erred when he failed to merge the kidnapping conviction into the carjacking conviction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">The criteria for determining issues of merger are set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-8, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-9\">a. Prosecution for multiple offenses; limitation on convictions. When the same conduct of a defendant may establish the commission of more than one offense, the defendant may be prosecuted for each such offense. He may not, however, be convicted of more than one offense if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-10\">(1) One offense is included in the other, as defined in subsection d. of this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-11\">(2) One offense consists only of a conspiracy or other form of preparation to commit the other;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-12\">(3) Inconsistent findings of fact are required to establish the commission of the offenses; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-13\">(4) The offenses differ only in that one is defined to prohibit a designated kind of conduct generally and the other to prohibit a specific instance of such conduct. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-14\">A determination' barring multiple convictions shall be made by the court after verdict or finding of guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-15\">The underlying issue concerning merger is whether a defendant is placed in double jeopardy, or punished twice for the same crime. <em>State v. Dillihay, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>42, 48, 601 A.2d 1149 (1992). <em>Dillihay </em>instructs that the first step in the test of merger is whether the Legislature intended to impose multiple punishments. <em>Ibid. </em>If, however, the Legislature\u2019s intent is unclear, the next step is to determine whether each offense requires proof of an additional fact that the other does not. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-16\">Here, defendant was not placed in double jeopardy or punished twice for the same crime. Clearly, the Legislature intended to impose separate punishments for these two crimes. Kidnapping and carjacking, under the facts of this case, require proof of an additional fact that the other does not have, that is, they include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>unique elements.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See generally State v. Miller, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>112,116, 527 A.2d 1362 (1987). Merger was not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Defendant also contends that his sentence was excessive and that the court erred in concluding that the aggravating factors clearly outweighed the mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">The standard for reviewing sentencing determinations is defined in <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334,471 A.2d 370 (1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">First, we will always require that an exercise of discretion be based upon findings of fact that are grounded in competent, reasonably credible evidence____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\">Second, we will always require that the factfinder apply correct legal principles in exercising its discretion____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-10\">Third, we will exercise that reserve of judicial power to modify sentences when the application of the facts to the law is such a deal- error of judgment that it shocks the judicial conscience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-11\"><em>[Id. </em>at 363-64,471 A.2d 370 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-12\">Here the judge carefully considered the facts adduced at trial and contained in defendant\u2019s pre-sentence report. The judge correctly concluded that three aggravating factors applied: <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-la(l), \u201cThe nature and circumstances of the offense, and the role of the actor therein, including whether or not it was committed in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner\u201d; <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-la(3), \u201cThe risk that the defendant will commit another offense\u201d; and <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-la(9), \u201cThe need for deterring the defendant and others from violating the law,\u201d and that those aggravating factors clearly outweighed the one mitigating factor, defendant\u2019s age.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-13\">The judge fully appreciated that carjacking, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:15-2(b), is a crime in the first-degree and requires a court to impose a term of imprisonment which <em>shall </em>include a minimum term of at least five years during which a defendant shall be ineligible for parole. Additionally, the court noted that kidnapping, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:13-l(c)(l), is a crime of the first-degree requiring the imposition of an ordinary term of between fifteen and thirty years, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>a presumptive sentence of twenty years. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1(f)(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Here, the judge made correct findings of fact and correctly applied the law. We specifically find that the sentence does not shock the judicial conscience. <em>See Roth, supra, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>at 363-64, 471 A.2d 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-13\"> Defendant's companion, Rudy Perdomo, an adult, was also arrested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b38-10\"> The indictment also charged Perdomo with one additional crime, assault upon a police officer, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-lb(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b38-11\"> Perdomo was also convicted on counts one, two, three and five. He was acquitted on counts four, six and seven. The trial judge dismissed count eight on defendant's motion at the close of the State's case. Perdomo filed a separate appeal, A-4823-94T4. We have filed a separate opinion affirming Perdomo's conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b38-12\"> The State admits that the written judgment of conviction does not conform with the oral sentence imposed by the trial judge. As written, the judgment of conviction reflects the imposition of a fine of $100 on count one. The trial judge did not impose a fine, but did impose a penalty of $100 payable to the Violent Crimes Compensation Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b41-12\"> During the initial investigation, Conversano found a brown leather moccasin at the crime scene. Conversano testified that later that same evening Perdomo tried on the moccasin and it fit. The State also produced as a witness another resident of the neighborhood, who found a matching brown moccasin the following morning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b42-10\"> Counsel did not provide the motion judge with a copy of the psychological evaluation, nor was the evaluation provided to this court in the record on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b45-12\"> The judge's decision pre-dated our decision in <em>State v. Williams, </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>611, 674 A.2d 643 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>375, 678 A.2d 716 (1996), discussed <em>infra </em>in Part III of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b47-15\"> We note that the trial judge was requested by the jury to recharge on carjacking. As part of the recharge, the judge stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b47-16\">So, ladies and gentlemen, the only scenario by which you may find the defendants either individually or as accomplices of each other with shared criminal intent guilty of carjacking is if the State has proven to you beyond a reasonable doubt, in addition to all the other elements, that the defendant did demand the car keys of Miss Gonzalez and did inflict bodily injury or use force upon her in getting the car keys, it was their purpose to get her car keys to obtain possession of the car.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b52-14\"> There are factual scenarios where kidnapping and carjacking would merge, e.g. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-2a(4).
