Ledon<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, a physician who performed a procedure known as endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) on Kim Tyndall. After undergoing the ERCP, she developed pancreatitis. Kim Tyndall testified at depositions that although she signed a consent form acknowledging generally that the doctor had explained the risks of the procedure and that she understood those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>risks, he never informed her that pancreatitis was one of those risks. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was dismissed because they failed to produce an expert report in support of a required element of the informed consent cause of action: that pancreatitis, the condition Kim Tyndall developed within a day after the procedure, was a risk of ERCP that was known to practitioners at the time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">On March 15, 1996, as a result of defendant\u2019s motion to fix a date certain for production of plaintiffs\u2019 expert reports, the court entered an order allowing plaintiffs 90 days to serve such a report. On October 11, 1996, the judge heard argument on defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. At argument on the motion, the judge told counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">... in order to avoid summary judgment, you do have to come forward with evidence that, one, this was a known risk. And two, it was a known risk that came to fruition. You can do that by an expert testimony. Or you can do it by an admission by the defendant. You have to have one or the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">Are you saying, you think there\u2019s an admission in there, but you haven\u2019t been able to find it yet <em>.. .1</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">Plaintiffs were represented at argument by an attorney who admitted that he did not know the file but thought the defendant had admitted at his deposition that pancreatitis was a rare but known risk of the procedure. The motion judge gave plaintiffs several days to submit the supporting portions of the deposition transcript, but they were not forthcoming. Instead, plaintiffs\u2019 attorney wrote to the court and enclosed what he described as a portion of \u201cHarrison\u2019s Principles of Internal Medicine which states that Pancreatitis is a known attendant risk of ERCP.\u201d The page enclosed with the letter actually says, with respect to a discussion of ERCP, \u201cPancreatitis occurs in less than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>5 percent<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of patients but is benign and self-limited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The case law is clear. A plaintiff alleging lack of informed consent has the burden of producing expert testimony to establish that the risk cited was one that the defendant should have been aware of because it was known to the medical community at the time. An exception to that rule applies where the defendant concedes that the risk was known, but claims that the patient in fact was informed of that risk. As plaintiffs\u2019 attorney apparently discovered, defendant made no such admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">We addressed virtually the same issue in <em>Febus v. Barot, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>322, 616 A.2d 933 (App.Div.1992). There we affirmed summary judgment for the defendant physician on an informed consent claim because plaintiff failed to produce expert testimony that the surgical complication that she suffered was a \u201crisk ... of which the physician should have been aware, and that it was recognized within the medical community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327, 616 A.2d 933. The plaintiff in <em>Febus, </em>like plaintiff here, relied on <em>Largey v. Rothman, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>204, 540 A.2d 504 (1988) (adopting the \u201cprudent patient\u201d standard for determining whether a risk is material and therefore required to be disclosed) to support the proposition that she did not need an expert to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case. That is a mistaken proposition, as we explained in <em>Febus:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">[t]he sufficiency of disclosure under the prudent patient standard requires that the disclosure be viewed through the mind of the patient, not the physician. Implicit in this shift of emphasis is the recognition that expert testimony is no longer required in order to establish the medical community\u2019s standard for disclosure and whether a physician failed to meet that standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">In our view, however, the prudent patient standard does not always dispense entirely with the need for expert medical testimony in an informed consent case. <em>Although, under this doctrine, no medical expert is required to prove that an undisclosed risk would have been material to the patient\u2019s consent, it must first be shown that the risk was one of which the physician should have been aware, and that it was recognized within the medical community.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number><em>[Febus, supra, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 327, 616 A.2d 933 (emphasis added) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">And as we further explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">... Largey only shifted the focus of inquiry in determining the materiality of a risk from the doctor\u2019s perspective to that of the patient\u2019s. It did not alter the rale of <em>Calabrese [Calabrese v. Trenton State College, </em>162 <em>N.J.Super. </em>145, 392 A.2d 600 (App.Div.1978) <em>aff'd, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>321, 413 A.2d 315 (1980)] that proof of a risk recognized by the professional community must come from a qualified expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 328,616 A.2d 933].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-9\"><em>Accord Frost v. Brenner, </em>300 <em>N.J.Super. </em>394, 406, 693 A.2d 149 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>471, 700 A.2d 883 (1997); <em>Caputa v. Antiles, </em>296 <em>N.J.Super. </em>123,134, 686 A.2d 356 (App.Div. 1996), <em>certif. denied, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>143, 693 A.2d 112 (1997), (\u201cAn expert is required to establish proof of a risk ... recognized by the medical community----\u201d) Plaintiffs claim that the motion judge erred by requiring expert testimony and dismissing the case for lack thereof. Much like the plaintiff in <em>Adamski v. Moss, </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>513, 638 A.2d 1360 (App.Div.1994), plaintiff chose to proceed solely on the basis of a learned treatise, but without a witness to establish the treatise as authoritative. Agreeing with the plaintiff in <em>Adamski </em>\u201cthat her claim [was] governed by the learned treatise exception [of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(e)(18) ] to the hearsay rule,\u201d we nevertheless concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8x\">[t]his rule certainly does not make all reference books admissible as evidence. First, the learned treatise must either be \u201ccalled to the attention of an expert witness upon cross-examination\u201d or be \u201crelied upon by the expert in direct examination.\u201d <em>Ibid </em>The rule thus requires that there must be an expert on the stand either as the party\u2019s witness or as an adverse witness being cross-examined. <em>Tart v. McGann, </em>697 F.2d 75, 78 (2nd Cir.1982). Second, the particular treatise must be \u201cestablished as a reliable authority by testimony or by judicial notice.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-12\"><em>[Adamski, supra, </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 519-20, 638 A.2d 1360.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-13\"><em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(18) includes a learned treatise as one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule, but only under specific conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-14\">To the extent called to the attention of an expert witness upon cross-examination or relied upon by the expert in direct examination, statements contained in published treatises, periodicals, or pamphlets on a subject of history, medicine, or other science or art, established as a reliable authority by testimony or by judicial notiee. If admitted, the statements may not be received as exhibits but may be read into evidence or, if graphics, shown to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number><em>See also Jacober v. St. Peter\u2019s Medical Center, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>475, 608 A.2d 304 (1992) (adopting Federal Rule of Evidence 803(18)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">[W]e adopt a new learned-treatise rule that mirrors the federal rule, permitting a text to be qualified as a learned treatise by expert testimony or by judicial notice rather than solely by the cross-examined expert. Moreover, the contents of learned treatises may be introduced as substantive evidence by experts on both direct and cross examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">[Id. at 478, 608 A.2d 304].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Thus a learned treatise that is either \u201cestablished as a reliable authority by testimony or by judicial notice\u201d is admissible as substantive evidence \u201cto the extent called to the attention of an expert witness upon cross-examination or relied upon by the expert in direct examination____\u201d <em>Id. As </em>we said in <em>Canesi by Canesi v. Wilson, </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>354, 360, 685 A.2d 49 (App.Div. 1996) <em>certif. granted, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>139, 693 A.2d 109 (1997), \u201ca party cannot generally introduce a treatise into evidence as a substitute for expert testimony.\u201d <em>See also Morlino v. Medical Center of Ocean Co., </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>113, 123, 684 A.2d 944 (App.Div.1996), <em>certif. granted, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>34, 692 A.2d 47 (1997) (Physicians\u2019 Desk Reference is admissible <em>\u201calong with expert testimony </em>to determine the appropriate standard of care.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">Even assuming that plaintiff could have persuaded the judge, in a Rule 104(a) hearing, to take judicial notice of the treatise as \u201ca reliable authority,\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it is plain that in their direct case, and in the absence of their own expert, the proffered statement from the treatise could not meet the rule\u2019s second condition: that it either be \u201crelied upon by [an] expert in direct examination,\u201d or \u201cupon cross-examination\u201d of defendant\u2019s witness. Plaintiffs had no expert to examine on direct, having failed to produce any expert report. As we said in <em>Adamski, supra,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-11\">We seriously doubt, however, that ... plaintiff could call defendant at trial and establish that the treatise! ][was] ... \u201creliable authority through defendant\u2019s testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-12\"><em>[271 N.J.Super. </em>at 520, 638 A.2d 1360].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Nor could plaintiffs rely on cross-examination of defendant\u2019s witnesses. The failure of plaintiffs\u2019 prima facie case would necessarily result in a dismissal under <em>R. </em>4:37-2, and defendant\u2019s expert would never have taken the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 535, 666 A.2d 146 (1995),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">Analytically, tying the test for summary judgment determinations to the question of what reasonable conclusions a rational jury can draw from the evidence is similar to an involuntary dismissal under <em>Rule </em>4:37 \u2014 2(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">There is no reason for the parties or the court to incur the expense and time for trial where the result is virtually certain. <em>See id. </em>at 540-41, 666 A.2d 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">We affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b446-14\"> Plaintiffs originally named Michael Zaboski, M.D., and St. Elizabeth Hospital as additional defendants. Both were dismissed on motions for summary judgment that are not the subject of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b447-10\"> The record before us does not reveal whether Dr. Ledon holds himself out as a specialist in any field, such as gastroenterology or internal medicine generally. That fact is not material to the issue raised by this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b448-9\"> We do not imply that a risk known to occur in five percent of patients does not require disclosure as part of obtaining a patient\u2019s informed consent prior to treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b450-13\"><em> </em>Plaintiffs do not contend that the trial judge could have taken judicial notice that pancreatitis is in fact a known risk of the ERCP.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
