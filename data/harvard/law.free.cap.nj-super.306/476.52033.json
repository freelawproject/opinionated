Bennett (\u201cBennett\u201d)) following a multiple vehicle accident that occurred on the Garden State Parkway (\u201cParkway\u201d) at approximately 1:15 a.m. on November 10, 1990. Defendant William R. Hoover (\u201cHoover\u201d or \u201cdefendant\u201d) was operating a 1988 Ford Ranger leased by defendant Energy Solutions, Inc. (\u201cSolutions\u201d) when it struck a 1990 Hyundai automobile owned and operated by Bennett after the Bennett vehicle broke down on the local lanes of the Parkway. Hoover\u2019s vehicle then crossed over the median into the express lane where it collided with a second vehicle operated by Christopher P. Flynn (\u201cFlynn\u201d). Bennett and her passengers, Tamika Hobbs (\u201cHobbs\u201d), Katrina Wiggs (\u201cWiggs\u201d), Tamica Jones (\u201cJones\u201d) and Paul Brown (\u201cBrown\u201d), filed separate actions for the injuries caused by the accident. Flynn also brought an action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">The complaints were consolidated for trial on the issue of liability. Damages were stipulated at $560,000 because Hoover had filed for bankruptcy protection and the automatic bankruptcy stay was released to the extent Solutions\u2019 carrier provided $500,-000 liability insurance coverage for him as an additional insured. In a separate declaratory judgment action, Providence Washington Insurance Co., the carrier for the automobile\u2019s lessor, was ordered to provide an additional $30,000. Bennett\u2019s carrier also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>provided $30,000 of coverage. The plaintiffs stipulated to a percentage division of the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">After the trial judge directed a verdict of liability against Hoover and ruled that the passengers\u2019 comparative negligence was not to be an issue for its consideration, the jury unanimously found no negligence on the part of Bennett. Judgment was entered against defendant in favor of all plaintiffs including Bennett. Prejudgment interest was denied as was a motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Bennett was the owner and operator of an automobile that \u201cbroke down\u201d or \u201cslow[ed] down rapidly\u201d and \u201cshut off\u2019 unexpectedly and \u201ccoasted\u201d to \u201ca complete stop\u201d in the center lane of the three \u201clocal lanes\u201d of the Parkway. Shortly after Bennett\u2019s vehicle came to a stop, it was struck in the rear by a pick-up truck driven by Hoover which had been leased by his employer, Solutions. Plaintiffs Jones, Wiggs, Brown and Hobbs were passengers in Bennett\u2019s vehicle. After striking the Bennett vehicle from behind, Hoover\u2019s truck careened to the left, crossed a grass median, entered the parallel southbound \u201cexpress lanes\u201d of the Parkway, and struck a vehicle being driven by Flynn. Hoover could not recall the accident nor the events that led up to the accident due to the amnesia he sustained from his injuries as a result of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Plaintiffs in the Bennett vehicle recalled the accident and the events leading up to it in varying details. They decided to go to the Amboy Cinemas to watch the last showing of \u201cChild\u2019s Play II\u201d on the evening of November 9, 1990. According to the <em>Asbury Park Press </em>movie table introduced into evidence, the movie\u2019s last showing for that evening was scheduled to start at 12:30 a.m. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>When they arrived, plaintiffs were turned away because \u201cthe tickets were sold out.\u201d Hobbs utilized the theater\u2019s restroom for a few minutes while the others waited. The group then went to a restaurant next door, but it was closed. In total, they \u201cremained at the scene\u201d or in the area of the theater for fifteen to twenty minutes. They then decided to \u201cgo back home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">As she was driving south on the Parkway, Bennett testified that she heard a \u201cgrinding sound coming from the front of [her] car.\u201d Upon hearing the noise, she moved from the left lane to the center lane in an effort to eventually get to the right shoulder. However, because traffic in the right lane was heavy, Bennett remained in the center lane when the vehicle came to a complete stop. Bennett testified that she \u201cnoticed that the ear was having some difficulty. So, immediately I put the flashers on so that I could get all the way over to ... the shoulder.\u201d Other passengers corroborated that the flashers or hazard lights were turned on.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Brown estimated that about \u201cfive seconds\u201d passed between the time the Bennett vehicle came to a complete stop and when it was hit from behind by the Hoover vehicle. Hobbs estimated the time between the stop and accident \u201cwasn\u2019t even a minute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">New Jersey State Trooper Richard Hogan was dispatched to the scene at 1:15 a.m. He indicated that the weather was \u201cclear,\u201d traffic was \u201clight,\u201d and that this particular area where this accident occurred was \u201cdark\u201d due to an absence of highway lights. Hogan further testified that he found Bennett\u2019s vehicle disabled in the southbound left local lane and found the Hoover vehicle in the left express lane adjacent to Flynn\u2019s vehicle which was positioned \u201cagainst the guardrail.\u201d He also said that none of the vehicles appeared to have been moved before he arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Trooper Hogan\u2019s investigation of the accident scene, which included observations of the debris in the roadway, skid marks and statements of the parties, led him to conclude that Bennett\u2019s vehicle was stopped when it was hit by Hoover\u2019s vehicle. Hoover was unable to explain what had happened due to his injuries. Trooper Hogan measured 105 feet of skid marks on the road <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>leading from where Bennett\u2019s vehicle was initially struck to where he observed it. He observed no skid marks prior to the point of impact. He also identified an additional 44 feet of skid marks across the grassy median to the point of Hoover\u2019s collision with the Flynn vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Nicholas Bellizzi, a professional engineer, testified for plaintiffs as a motor vehicle accident reconstruction expert. Bellizzi calculated Hoover\u2019s speed to be approximately 87.46 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">After all the evidence was presented, the trial judge took the issue of the passengers\u2019 comparative negligence from the jury and found that Hoover was negligent as a matter of law. The judge instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">that there is at least some negligence and proximate causation attributable to Mr. Hoover. That under the facts in the ease, that that is a finding of the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">So you need not worry about the issue of whether he was negligent or not. The only issue that you may reach is to what degree he [was] negligent compared with [Ms. Bennett].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-9\">The Court has also ruled that there has been no evidence of negligence by any of the passengers of the vehicle ... [and] no evidence of negligence on their part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-10\">So the only issues you will be considering is whether Ms. Bennett was negligent and if she was negligent what was the relative negligence of the two parties, as between her and Mr. Hoover.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">In his final instructions, the judge charged the jury on its responsibility to decide whether Bennett was negligent and, if so, the \u201crelative percentage of negligence\u201d of Bennett and Hoover.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By a vote of 6-0, the jury responded \u201cno\u201d to the question \u201c[w]as the defendant, LaSharra Bennett negligent, which negligence was a proximate cause of the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-13\">Hoover and Solutions argue that the trial court inappropriately removed from the jury the issue of comparative negligence as it related to the passengers in the Bennett vehicle. They further claim that the issue of proximate cause was also a jury question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>\u201cin that plaintiffs would not have been injured \u2018but for\u2019 their failure to alight from the disabled vehicle.\u201d They cite <em>Polistina v. Polistina, </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>291, 443 A.2d 1086 (App.Div.1982), for the proposition that \u201c[t]he passengers\u2019 duty to attend to their own safety translates into a duty to alight from a vehicle disabled in a location that exposes its occupants to extreme danger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The applicable standard in deciding a motion for directed verdict requires that the trial judge \u201cevaluate all the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Caterinicchio v. Pittsburgh Corning Corp., </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>428, 437, 605 A.2d 1092 (1992) (citing <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>2, 5-6, 258 A.2d 706 (1969)); <em>see also Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 536, 666 A.2d 146(1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Here, defendants argue that the trial judge\u2019s determination that there was no testimony that the Bennett vehicle was stopped long enough to raise a jury issue as to comparative negligence pertaining to the passengers (excluding Bennett) overlooked the fact that plaintiffs gave varying testimony giving rise to different inferences regarding how long the car was stopped on the highway and how long the passengers remained therein before the accident. Defendants point to \u201c[t]he undisputed fact\u201d that places of \u201csafe haven\u201d were close at hand, and that plaintiffs \u201ceasily could have alighted from the disabled vehicle and removed themselves to a place of safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">We agree with the trial judge that the evidence did not present a genuine issue of comparative negligence as applied to the passengers, substantially for the reasons given by the judge. Irrespective of the differences in the testimony as to when the movie was scheduled to start and when the group left the theater area, there was no evidence by which the jury could reasonably conclude that the Bennett vehicle was stranded for any longer than a short period before getting hit by Hoover. Hoover\u2019s amnesia prevented him from testifying and he presented no evidence to the contrary. Moreover, given the fact that Bennett\u2019s vehicle was at a complete stop in the middle of the Garden State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Parkway, it seems unreasonable to expect the passengers to exit the vehicle to get to a \u201csafe haven\u201d in the middle of the night in the time they had. <em>Cf. Polistina, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>291, 443 A.2d 1086 (where the vehicle may have been stopped partially on the shoulder of the highway, the driver exited the vehicle, and the passengers remained therein at least for \u201ca few minutes\u201d on a rainy or \u201cmisty\u201d night). In any event,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">[i]t is elementary that a following car in the same lane of traffic is obligated to maintain a reasonably safe distance behind the car ahead ... [and][f]ailure to do so resulting in a collision, is negligence, and a jury should be so instructed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\"><em>[Dolson, supra, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>at 10, 258 A.2d 706.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">As in <em>Dolson, </em>here \u201cthere was no sufficient evidence of contributory negligence on the part of [the passenger plaintiffs] which proximately contributed to the collision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11, 258 A.2d 706. Like the plaintiff in <em>Dolson, </em>the passengers here did not in any way either contribute to the accident or contribute to their injuries by merely remaining in the vehicle for a short period after the car broke down. Hence, the issue of the comparative negligence of the passengers in the Bennett vehicle was properly removed from the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Defendants also argue that the trial court erroneously directed a verdict against Hoover as to the passengers and improperly charged the jury on Bennett\u2019s claim because there was ample evidence to support the inference that Bennett\u2019s negligence contributed to the accident and because Hoover was confronted with a \u201csudden emergency\u201d caused by Bennett.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">It is well established that \u201cthe violation of motor vehicles statutes is evidence of negligence.\u201d <em>Paiva v. Pfeiffer, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>276, 280, 551 A.2d 201 (App.Div.1988). \u201cHowever, where a motor vehicle statute codifies the common law standard, the violation of the statute is not evidence of negligence, it is negligence.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Dolson, supra, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>at 10, 258 A.2d 706). Thus, the failure to maintain a reasonably safe distance behind the vehicle ahead resulting in a collision is negligence as a matter of law, and a jury should be so instructed. <em>Dolson, supra, </em>at 10, 258 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>A.2d 706; <em>see also Eaton v. Eaton, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>628, 642-43, 575 A.2d 858 (1990); <em>Paiva, supra, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 279-80, 551 A.2d 201. In <em>Paiva </em>we stated that \u201c[i]t is beyond dispute that had [defendant] rear-ended the [vehicle] he was following the <em>Dolson </em>charge would have been totally appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 282, 551 A.2d 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">We thus agree with the trial judge\u2019s conclusion in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">if this isn\u2019t a ease that fits within <em>Dolson versus Anastasia, </em>I don\u2019t know what is____ If [they] were sitting there on the highway, stopped when he came along, flashers or no flashers, he had plenty of time to see them. Even if they stopped in front of him, <em>Dolson ... </em>covers that. You\u2019re supposed to maintain a safe following distance so that even if someone does do a sudden stop, you\u2019re able to avoid them. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">Even two to five seconds for a fully stopped vehicle ... is plenty of time to avoid the vehicle....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-10\">Under <em>Dolson ... </em>there is more than enough time for a following vehicle to avoid them there, especially when there is no traffic in either other lane.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-11\">I can\u2019t see any scenario under which a reasonable jury could not find Mr. Hoover to be negligent. So, therefore, I would have to enter a directed verdict of negligence as to Mr. Hoover and no comparative negligence as to the passengers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">Defendants\u2019 argument that Hoover was confronted with a \u201csudden emergency\u201d caused by Bennett is also unpersuasive. <em>See Finley v. Wiley, </em>103 <em>N.J.Super. </em>95, 103, 246 A.2d 715 (App.Div. 1968) (\u201cdefendant was faced with no more than an everyday traffic problem for which he should have been prepared\u201d). Defendants\u2019 reliance upon <em>La Mandri v. Carr, </em>148 <em>N.J.Super. </em>566, 372 A.2d 1327 (App.Div.1977), is misplaced. There we found \u201cno evidence of any \u2018tailgating\u2019 by plaintiff prior to defendant\u2019s loss of control of his vehicle\u201d and therefore concluded that the trial court improperly instructed the jury about the tailgating statute. <em>Id. </em>at 572-73, 372 A.2d 1327. Here, however, there was evidence Hoover was driving well above the posted speed limit on the Garden State Parkway when he hit a car that broke down in his lane of traffic. \u201cTo invoke the sudden emergency doctrine and to be entitled to that charge to the jury, a party must have been confronted by a sudden emergency over which he had no control, without fault on his part.\u201d <em>Roberts v. Hooper, </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>474, 478, 438 A.2d 351 (App.Div.1981). Accordingly, failure to maintain a reasonable following distance warranted a <em>Dolson </em>charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">On their cross-appeal, plaintiffs argue that defendants\u2019 insurance carrier should have been required to pay prejudgment interest under <em>R. </em>4:42-11(b). The trial judge denied the application, holding that \u201cthis court cannot use policy considerations to override the clear mandate of the Supreme Court decision\u201d in <em>Kotzian v. Barr, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>360, 408 A.2d 131 (1979).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While defendant\u2019s policy provided that \u201cOur payment of the LIABILITY INSURANCE limit ends our duty to defend or settle,\u201d plaintiffs contend that the factual circumstances in this case are \u201cclearly distinguishable\u201d from <em>Kotzian, supra, </em>which held that the payment of prejudgment interest was not required in a ease involving payment of the policy limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">In <em>Kotzian, supra, </em>the plaintiffs made unreasonable settlement demands because they demanded prejudgment interest of about $100,000 while the defendant\u2019s carrier offered a settlement of the $15,000 policy limits. <em>See </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>at 360-61, 364-65, 408 A.2d 131. The Court found that prejudgment interest was not warranted, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">Were policy limits not involved, we would have little difficulty in concluding that prejudgment interest should be assessed in this case. Surely ... [the insurance company] could have immediately deposited the policy limits into court, as it eventually did. However, we are not prepared to say that [the insurance company\u2019s] failure to have made earlier deposit of its full policy limits, having sought early in the proceedings to make the money available to plaintiffs by its offer, should result in the company\u2019s being required to pay over and above the amount contracted for with its assured. This is not to say that the insurance contract is so sacrosanct that misconduct or bad faith on the part of the carrier would protect it against a claim for prejudgment interest over its policy limits; but that is not the case here____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 367,408 A.2d 131 (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Thus, the Supreme Court majority held that there was \u201cno mistaken exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion\u201d by denying prejudgment interest under the circumstances. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Here, we are told the policy limits were ultimately offered in settlement by Hoover\u2019s carrier, but the record before us reveals little regarding what was offered, and when, before the matter was tried as to liability. Apparently, no policy proceeds were paid into court. In fact, it is unclear from what is before us whether the policy limits were offered to settle the case or that the parties merely agreed to stipulate damages and a division of the policy proceeds contingent on the jury\u2019s findings as to liability. Moreover, we have no record as to the impact the bankruptcy proceedings involving Hoover,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the declaratory judgment action regarding which carrier had primary liability, may have had on the timing of a settlement offer. In any event, we do not read the Supreme Court majority in <em>Kotzian </em>as barring prejudgment interest no matter when the policy limits are offered or how late that offer may be made before trial \u2014 irrespective of the merits of the defense \u2014 merely because the verdict exceeded the \u201camount [the carrier] contracted with its assured.\u201d 81 <em>N.J. </em>at 367, 408 A.2d 131.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Heim v. Wolpaw, </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>538, 542-44, 638 A.2d 1373 (App.Div.), (\u201cprejudgment interest should not have been awarded except for the period from the commencement of the action until appellant deposited the limit of its policy in court and offered it to plaintiffs in settlement of them claims against the insureds\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>316, 645 A.2d 143 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number><em>R. </em>4:42-ll(b) provides that prejudgment interest shall be awarded in tort actions except \u201cthat in exceptional cases the court may suspend the running of such prejudgment interest.\u201d On the other hand, the impact of the policy limits, the stay of the bankruptcy court and the declaratory judgment proceedings must be considered in this context.
