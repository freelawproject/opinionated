Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), his Sixth Amendment rights were violated when the district court held him accountable under relevant conduct for three fraudulent checks that were ordered and deposited by others after his arrest based on facts that were not admitted by him or found by a jury. Rob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>inson preserved this issue in the district court. <em>See United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 376 (5th Cir.2005). Therefore, we review Robinson\u2019s claim for harmless error. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 284 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">The district court committed a <em>Booker </em>error by increasing Robinson\u2019s sentence based on facts that were neither admitted by him nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738. The Government has not demonstrated that the district court\u2019s error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d at 285. Accordingly, we vacate Robinson\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Robinson also argues that loss amounts other than the amount to which he pled guilty do not constitute relevant conduct under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3. However, because we are vacating and remanding Robinson\u2019s entire sentence, we need not address this issue. <em>See Akpan, </em>407 F.3d at 377 n. 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b363-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
