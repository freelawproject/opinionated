Texaco, Inc., </em>77 F.3d 126, 129 (5th Cir.1996) (citing cases) (emphasis in original). The distinction appellants seek to draw between 1) the unpaid ERISA benefits and 2) medical expenses which arose after the discovery of the alleged negligent procurement does not help appellant. Some, if not all, of the damages arising under the former are necessarily encompassed by the latter. The district court properly concluded that the negligence claim was conflict preempted under ERISA \u00a7 514.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-25\">2. ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(2) allows a beneficiary to sue for breach of fiduciary duty. ERISA also requires fiduciaries to discharge their duties \u201csolely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries[,]\u201d using \u201ccare, skill, prudence, and diligence.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1). The appellants\u2019 negligent procurement of the failed insurer allegation is covered by this language.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\">3. For the reasons stated by the district court, summary judgment was properly granted in favor of the ap-pellee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b421-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
