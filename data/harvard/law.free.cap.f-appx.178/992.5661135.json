He argues (1) that the district court clearly erred in enhancing his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(B) and (b)(4) (2004) based on its finding that he possessed nine qualifying firearms; and (2) that his sentence, which exceeds the advisory Guidelines range by 15 months, is unreasonable based on the evidence in the record. Finding no reversible error, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-10\">Twenty-year old Dass and his father were arrested at Fort Stewart, Georgia, where they were observed on a restricted artillery range. Three firearms, including a Century Arms rifle and RG Industries revolver, and assorted ammunition were discovered in the back of a truck owned by Dass\u2019s father. In addition, authorities found a video camera in the truck that contained a tape of Dass\u2019s father firing a handgun in numerous restricted areas at Fort Stewart.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-11\">After their arrest, an explosion occurred near the residence that they shared. A truck driver for the Savannah Sanitation Department was emptying a commercial dumpster when a large quantity of military explosives detonated. The driver sustained minor injuries when he jumped from the vehicle. The sanitation truck, the dumpster, and nearby structures were damaged. Other explosives that did not detonate were also found in the dumpster. According to a special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (\u201cATF\u201d) and the range manager at Fort Stewart, the explosives found in the dumpster were commonly fired at the restricted training area where Dass and his father were arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-13\">After the explosion, ATF agents obtained a search warrant for Dass\u2019s residence. They found 18 firearms and 10 types of ammunition in the house. All of the firearms, including a Colt rifle and North Industries rifle, were found in the attic, with the exception of two that were recovered from Dass\u2019s bedroom. The explosives seized from the residence were consistent with the explosives seized from the scene of the dumpster. ATF agents later found a high explosive, anti-tank rocket in the crawl space under the house that was accessible from Dass\u2019s bedroom. In addition, in Dass\u2019s bedroom, they found hand-drawn pictures of weapons and instructions detailing how to convert firearms from semiautomatic to full automatic. ATF agents also found a 30mm HEDP M789 round in a box in the garage. The explosives found in their home were commonly used on the Fort Stewart artillery range.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-14\">Authorities interviewed Dass\u2019s mother and a classmate. His mother relayed concerns over Dass\u2019s mental health and his close relationship with his father. Dass\u2019s former classmate and friend reported that Dass converted a semiautomatic assault rifle into a fully automatic rifle and made parts for firearms, The classmate also stated that Dass reported that he and his father had begun to collect ammunition, casings, and hand grenade parts from Fort Stewart.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>Brandon Dass later pled guilty to possession of a machine gun, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(o)(l). When Dass was interviewed by a probation officer, he admitted that he and his father possessed firearms in the attic of their house and that some of the weapons were assault weapons. He also acknowledged that he knew that the firearms should be registered. He stated that most of the firearms were purchased from flea markets and garage sales and admitted that he purchased an 84mm rocket, anti-personnel rounds, and grenades. In addition, he admitted that he placed explosives in the dumpster. Dass\u2019s father, age 49, is disabled and is currently incarcerated. Until his arrest, Dass lived with his father from 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">The Probation Office prepared a Pre-Sentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) and set Dass\u2019s base offense level at 18, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, which calls for a base offense level of 18 if the offense involved firearms described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a) or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(30). The Probation Office then increased the offense level four levels because the offense involved nine qualifying weapons, which included four illegal explosives, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(B); two levels because the offense involved destructive devices, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(3)(B), and two levels because the offense involved a firearm with an obliterated serial number, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4). Dass was granted a three-level reduction for his acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a)-(b). The Probation Office also noted that an aggravating circumstance (the explosives placed in the dumpster) might warrant an upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.6.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With a total offense level of 23 and a criminal history category of I, the Probation Office calculated Dass\u2019s advisory Guidelines range to be 46 to 57 months of imprisonment and two to three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-8\">After receiving the PSI, Dass filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, which the court denied. In Dass\u2019s objections to the PSI, he objected to being held responsible for five of the qualifying weapons, which included an illegal explosive, for the purpose of increasing his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(B) and (b)(4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, Dass argued that he did not possess the following: (1) Century Arms, Incorporated, Model C15 Sporter, .223 caliber rifle; (2) RG Industries, Model RG23, .22 LR caliber revolver with obliterated serial number; (3) Colt, Model Match Target, .223 caliber semiautomatic rifle; (4) North China Industries, Model MAK-90 short-barrel semiautomatic rifle; and (5) 30mm HEDP M789 anti-material and anti-personnel round. Dass also objected to the PSI\u2019s suggestion that an upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.6 might be warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-11\">At his sentencing hearing, Dass renewed his objections. The district court overruled Dass\u2019s objections and found that Dass had constructive and joint possession of the above-referenced firearms and the 30mm HEDP M789 round. Before imposing a sentence, the district court heard victim impact statements from the garbage truck driver, who was injured in the explosion, and the vehicle maintenance director for the city of Savannah. The garbage truck driver testified that he sought counseling and experienced nightmares after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>the explosion. The vehicle maintenance director testified that the damage to the garbage truck from the explosion totaled <em>$58,000. </em>At the conclusion <em>of </em>the sentencing hearing, Dass\u2019s attorney asked the court to consider Dass\u2019s devotion to his father and his father\u2019s negative influence over him. Dass also addressed the court, admitted that he had made a mistake, and stated that he did not pursue his education because he had to care for his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">The district court sentenced Dass to 72 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. The court explained it sentenced Dass above the Guidelines range because it perceived that Dass would likely reoffend since \u201c[a] sense of value and a sense of duty to others has not been instilled.\u201d R4 at 47. The court noted that placing explosives in a public dumpster was a calculated act done without regard for the consequences, which resulted in harm to the truck driver and the city of Savannah. While the court acknowledged that the advisory Guidelines are an important consideration in every case, it found that Dass\u2019s case warranted a higher sentence. The court did not address the PSI\u2019s upward departure suggestion pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.6. At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, Dass renewed his previous objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ARo\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">The district court is obligated to consult and correctly calculate the Guidelines even though <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), rendered the Guidelines advisory. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005). <em>Booker </em>does not alter our previously established standards of review of the district court\u2019s implementation of the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>419 F.3d 1189, 1192 (11th Cir.2005). We review a sentencing court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and review <em>de novo </em>that court\u2019s application of the sentencing Guidelines to the facts. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>276 F.3d 1231, 1233 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cWhen a defendant objects to a factual finding that is to be used as a basis for sentencing, the government bears the burden to establish the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Agis-Meza, </em>99 F.3d 1052, 1055 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">B. <em>Possession of Firearms and Explosive</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-10\">Dass argues that there was insufficient evidence to prove that five of the illegal firearms were in his possession and that the district court thereby erred in applying the enhancements under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(B) and (b)(4). First, he contends that he did not possess the two eligible firearms found in his father\u2019s truck, which included the revolver with the obliterated serial number, because he was merely a passenger. Second, he contends that he did not possess the two other illegal firearms found in the attic of his residence because he did not occupy that room. Third, he argues that there is no evidence that he possessed the 30mm HEDP M789 round, an illegal explosive device, found in the garage of his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-11\">The Guidelines provide for a four-level increase if the offense involved between 8 and 24 qualifying firearms. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(B). For purposes of calculating the number of firearms in this section, the court can only count those firearms that were \u201cunlawfully sought to be obtained, unlawfully possessed, or unlawfully distributed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(B) cmt. n. 6. The Guidelines also provide for a two-level increase if the firearm was stolen or had an obliterated serial number. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>\u201cPossession may be actual or constructive, joint or sole.\u201d <em>United States v. Gunn, </em>369 F.3d 1229, 1234 (11th Cir.) (per curiam) (considering sufficiency of the evidence regarding an 18 U.S .C. \u00a7 924(c) conviction), <em>cert. denied sub nom., </em>543 U.S. 937, 125 S.Ct. 324, 160 L.Ed.2d 244 (2004). For actual possession, the defendant must have \u201cphysical possession of or personal dominion over the thing allegedly possessed.\u201d <em>United States v. Leonard, </em>138 F.3d 906, 909 (11th Cir.1998). For constructive possession, the defendant must have \u201cownership, dominion, or control over an object itself or dominion or control over the premises or vehicle in which the object is concealed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">Dass primarily relies on <em>Leonard </em>and <em>United States v. Pedro, </em>999 F.2d 497 (11th Cir.1993), to support his argument that he did not have actual or constructive possession of the disputed firearms and destructive device. In <em>Leonard, </em>the defendant at issue was a passenger in the backseat of a station wagon. 138 F.3d at 909. After the police searched the vehicle, they discovered cocaine and a firearm hidden in the tailgate. We reversed that defendant\u2019s conviction because \u201c[t]he record only show[ed] that [the defendant] was a passenger in the back seat of the station wagon when it was stopped\u201d and therefore \u201cthere [was] no evidence to indicate that [the defendant] ever had ownership, dominion or control over the cocaine, the gun, or the vehicle in which they were concealed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">In <em>Pedro, </em>two defendants were arrested in connection with a burglary of an apartment. 999 F.2d at 498. When they were arrested outside the apartment, one of the defendants had a suitcase which contained a firearm that was stolen during the burglary. <em>Id. </em>at 498-99. The other defendant was subsequently convicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon based on the firearm in the suitcase. We reversed the latter\u2019s conviction because \u201cthe record [was] devoid of any evidence of [the defendant\u2019s] knowledge of the firearm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502. We reasoned that even \u201c[accepting the Government\u2019s argument that [the two defendants] were engaged in joint burglary, it would be highly unlikely that both of the men would scour each room side-by-side, aware of what the other was picking up.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">Whether Dass possessed these firearms is a factual finding that we review for clear error. <em>See Jackson, </em>276 F.3d at 1233. Here, there is no clear error. Dass\u2019s reliance on <em>Leonard </em>and <em>Pedro </em>is misplaced because there is sufficient evidence that, although Dass did not own the vehicle and residence where the disputed firearms were seized, he had knowledge of the firearms and exercised control over those areas. <em>See Leonard, </em>138 F.3d at 909. Specifically, Dass admitted to the probation officer that he and his disabled father possessed various firearms in the attic of their residence. He also admitted that he placed explosives in the dumpster, which were similar to the 30mm round found in the garage. These admissions, coupled with the fact that both he and his father were avid gun collectors, are sufficient evidence that Dass exercised control over all the firearms in the house. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>20 F.3d 445, 454 (11th Cir.1994) (concluding that defendant\u2019s \u201cunrestricted access to the home\u201d allowed the jury to infer that \u201che exercised control over the house and therefore maintained constructive possession of the [illegal item] found at the house\u201d). Rather than being a \u201cmere passenger\u201d in his father\u2019s truck, the record also supports that Dass and his father frequented Fort Stewart in the truck to scavenge ordnance and to fire weapons. Therefore, in light of the undisputed illegal firearms that were found in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>his room, the accessibility of the disputed firearms in the residence and truck, Dass\u2019s close relationship with his father, the history of their firearm collecting and joint activities in Fort Stewart, and his admissions that he owned firearms in the attic and disposed of similar explosives in the dumpster, the district court did not commit clear error when it determined that Dass had at least constructive possession of the disputed weapons and enhanced Dass\u2019s offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(B) and (b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">B. <em>Sentence Exceeding the Advisory Guidelines Range</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">Dass also argues that his 72-month sentence, which exceeds the advisory Guidelines by 15 months, is unreasonable because (1) there is nothing to support the district court\u2019s finding that he will likely commit more crimes and (2) he has no prior criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">The district court must correctly calculate the sentencing range prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1178-79. Once the district court has accurately calculated the Guidelines range, it \u201cmay impose a more severe or more lenient sentence\u201d that we review for reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 1179. In crafting a reasonable sentence, the district court must consider the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-8\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\"><em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence and this Court\u2019s reasonableness inquiry are guided by the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). A district court need not explain every \u00a7 3553(a) factor before announcing its sentence. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. \u201c[A]n acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker. </em>\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-12\">Here, the record reveals that the district court adequately and properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense, the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, the need to protect the public, and the history and characteristics of the defendant. Further, the court correctly noted that while the advisory Guidelines are an important consideration, they did not address all of the court\u2019s concerns, including the grave risk to which Dass exposed the public by disposing of explosives in a commercial dumpster. Notwithstanding Dass\u2019s lack of a prior criminal history, we agree with the district court\u2019s observation that there were \u201cserious and peculiarly dangerous events that occurred here.\u201d R4 at 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-13\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-14\">Because of the evidence of Dass\u2019s control over areas where the disputed firearms were seized, we conclude that the district court did not err in increasing Dass\u2019s offense level under the advisory Guidelines pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(B) and (b)(4). We also con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>elude that Dass\u2019s sentence, which exceeds the sentencing range of the advisory Guidelines, is reasonable. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">. According to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.6, \"If a weapon or dangerous instrumentality was used or possessed in the commission of the offense the court may increase the sentence above the authorized guideline range.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1020-12\">.
