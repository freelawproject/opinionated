The district court dismissed his suit and certified that his appeal was not taken in good faith. Villareal challenges the district court\u2019s certification decision pursuant to <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997), and he requests that this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>grant him authorization to proceed IFP on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Villareal maintains that the defendants knew or should have known of his attacker\u2019s violent tendencies and that they violated his constitutional rights by failing to protect him from the other inmate. The record evidence refutes these contentions and supports the district court\u2019s dismissal of Villareal\u2019s suit. <em>See Resident Council v. United States Dep\u2019t of Hous. and Urban Dev., </em>980 F.2d 1043, 1050 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Villareal has failed to show that his appeal involves \u201clegal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous)\u201d. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, his motion for authorization to proceed IFP on appeal is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The dismissal of Villareal\u2019s appeal as frivolous by this court counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Villareal is cautioned that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">\n<em>MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
