Sanders asserts his sentence is unreasonable in light of (1) his age, (2) his role in the offense, (3) his criminal history, and (4) the 100:1 penalty ratio used in the Guidelines for offenses involving crack cocaine compared to similar offenses involving powder cocaine. Sanders\u2019 sentence is reasonable, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-23\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court, in determining a reasonable sentence, must consider the correctly calculated sentencing range under the Guidelines and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). The factors in \u00a7 3553(a) include: \u201c(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment; (4) the need to protect the public; and (5) the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>426 F.3d 1324, 1328-29 (11th Cir.2005) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). \u201c[Njothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has-explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1329. Instead, indications in the record that the district court considered facts and circumstances falling within \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s factors will suffice. <em>Id. </em>at 1329-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">We review a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence for reasonableness in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir. 2005). \u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. \u201c[Wjhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing the sentence is unreasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Sanders has failed to meet his burden of showing his sentence was unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. After correctly calculating the Guidelines range and considering the factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court imposed a sentence within the Guidelines range, and \u201cwe ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. The factors which he argues, such as his age, role in the offense, and criminal history, were all considered by the district court and do not render his sentence unreasonable. Finally, Sanders\u2019 contention his sentence is unreasonable because of the 100:1 penalty ratio for offenses involving crack cocaine compared to similar offenses involving powder cocaine is unavailing. This is the ratio used in the United States Code and in the Guidelines. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. Therefore, in determining Sanders\u2019s sentence, the district court applied the law as it is stated in the statute and the Guidelines, and we cannot say a sentence based on the law is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
