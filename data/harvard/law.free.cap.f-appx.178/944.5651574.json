Smallwood filed this petition after his previous \u00a7 2254 petition was dismissed without prejudice because he failed to pay the appropriate filing fee, submit an affidavit of indigency, or file an <em>in forma pauperis </em>application, as required by the Rules of Civil Procedure. The issue for which Smallwood received a certificate of appealability is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-23\">[wjhether the district court erred by dismissing Smallwood\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition as time-barred when the district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed, without warning, his previous \u00a7 2254 petition for failure to pay the filing fee or move to proceed <em>in forma pauperis? See e.g., Wilson v. Sargent, </em>313 F.3d 1315, 1321 (11th Cir.2002).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b970-24\">When reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition, we review questions of law <em>de novo. Nyland v. Moore, </em>216 F.3d 1264, 1266 (11th Cir.2000). We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that a petition for a writ of habeas corpus is time-barred. <em>Bond v. Moore, </em>309 F.3d 770, 772 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>A one year period of limitation applies to \u201can application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). The limitation period begins on the date on which a judgment of conviction and sentence become final. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). Section 2244(d)(2) states that \u201c[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgement or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this subsection.\u201d The Supreme Court has held that federal habe-as petitions do not constitute \u201cother collateral review\u201d within the meaning of the statute. <em>Duncan v. Walker, </em>533 U.S. 167, 181, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 2129, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001). Consequently, \u00a7 2244(d)(2) \u201cdoes not toll the limitation period during the pendency of [Smallwood\u2019s first] federal ha-beas petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court thus did not err in dismissing Smallwood\u2019s petition as time-barred unless Smallwood is entitled to equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">We have held that \u201cthe AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations may be equitably tolled when a movant untimely files because of extraordinary circumstances that are both beyond his control and unavoidable even with diligence.\u201d <em>Knight v. Schofield, </em>292 F.3d 709, 711 (11th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cEquitable tolling is an extraordinary remedy which is typically applied sparingly.\u201d <em>Lawrence v. Florida, </em>421 F.3d 1221, 1226 (11th Cir. 2005). \u201cEquitable tolling is limited to rare and exceptional circumstances, such as when the State\u2019s conduct prevents the petitioner from timely filing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">Smallwood contends that the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled in his case. He argues that he moved to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>before the district court dismissed his original petition, and promptly refiled his petition after receiving notice of dismissal. He relies on <em>Wilson v. Sargent, </em>313 F.3d 1315 (11th Cir. 2002), to assert that the district court had an obligation to warn him that his original petition was on the verge of dismissal if the filing fee was not paid. Smallwood contends that, based on the lack of notice, the district court abused its discretion when it dismissed his second petition as time-barred, as he did everything required of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">After reviewing the record and both parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that it is unnecessary to decide whether the district court erred in <em>sua sponte </em>dismissing Small-wood\u2019s first federal habeas petition without notice because Smallwood is not entitled to equitable tolling. Smallwood was not the victim of \u201cextraordinary circumstances that are both beyond his control and unavoidable even with diligence,\u201d and, thus, does not qualify for equitable relief. <em>Knight, </em>292 F.3d at 711. Smallwood does not argue that he never received notice that the district court dismissed his initial \u00a7 2254 petition. Instead, Smallwood stated that he received notice and chose to file a new petition. Smallwood did not appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of his initial \u00a7 2254 petition. Since he did not exhaust the options available to him when his first federal habeas petition was dismissed, he did not exercise the level of diligence required to show the \u201crare and exceptional circumstances\u201d that qualify a petitioner for equitable tolling. <em>See Lawrence, </em>421 F.3d at 1226.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
