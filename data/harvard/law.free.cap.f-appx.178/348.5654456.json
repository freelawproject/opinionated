He argues that the district court committed reversible <em>Fanfan</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by sentencing him (prior to Booker) pursuant to a mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines. The Government asserts that he invited the <em>Fanfan </em>error or waived his claim by requesting a sentence at the low end of the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">As this court has construed comments of defense counsel narrowly in applying the invited error doctrine, the Government has not shown that Parajon invited the <em>Fanfan </em>error. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>272 F.3d 748, 754-756 (5th Cir.2001). Furthermore, as the record does not indicate that Parajon intentionally relinquished his <em>Fanfan </em>claim, the Government has not shown that Parajon has waived the claim. <em>See United States v. Reyes-Celestino, </em>443 F.3d 451, 453 (5th Cir.2006) (express consent \u201cto be sentenced pursuant to the applicable Sentencing Guidelines\u201d not waiver of <em>Fanfan </em>error); <em>United States v. Dodson, </em>288 F.3d 153, 160 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">As the Government concedes, Parajon preserved his <em>Fanfan </em>claim for review by raising an objection based upon <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), in the district court. <em>See Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 462-63.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the question before us \u201cis whether the government has met its burden to show harmless error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">The district court erred by sentencing Parajon pursuant to a mandatory application of the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005). After granting his request for a downward departure in criminal history category from V to IV (reducing his guideline range from 46 to 57 months to 37 to 46 months), the district court sentenced Parajon to 40 months, near the middle of the thus calculated guidelines range, and refused Parajon\u2019s request to further reduce the sentence but gave no indication as to the sentence it would impose if the Guidelines were held unconstitutional or advisory. In these circumstances, the Government has not met its \u201carduous burden\u201d of showing that the error was harmless. <em>United States v. Garza, </em>429 F.3d 165, 170 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we vacate Parajon\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-15\">Parajon\u2019s constitutional challenge to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almen-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number><em>darez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Parajon contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Parajon properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b375-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
