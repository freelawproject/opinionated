Coffman first argues that the district court erred by finding that his prior Texas felony conviction for burglary of a habitation was a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.2(a). The district court did not err. <em>See United States v. Hornsby, </em>88 F.3d 336, 339 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005). This court must follow the precedent set by a prior panel unless there is a contrary intervening opinion by the Supreme Court or this court en banc. <em>See Burge v. Parish of St. Tammany, </em>187 F.3d 452, 466 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">While Coffman acknowledges that the district court imposed a non-guideline sentence pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), he argues that the district court erred by making an upward deviation from the guidelines sentence range to the statutory maximum of 120 months of imprisonment because of his prior criminal history without considering the guidelines rules for upward departures based upon criminal history. He contends that had the sentence been an upward departure under the Guidelines, the district court would have abused its discretion because it did not give an adequate reason for making an upward departure of that magnitude and because the extent of the departure was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">The district court followed the proper procedure for imposing a non-guideline sentence by calculating Coffman\u2019s guidelines sentence range, using the guidelines range as a frame of reference, and making an upward deviation based upon Coffman\u2019s prior criminal history without making an upward departure within the Guidelines. See <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006). Whether an upward departure would have been warranted in this case is immaterial as the district court made an upward deviation outside of the guidelines range instead of an upward departure pursuant to the Guidelines. <em>See id. </em>at 708 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">Coffman asserts that the application of the remedial opinion in <em>Booker </em>to him violates the Due Process Clause and Ex Post Facto Clause. He acknowledges that this court rejected a similar argument in <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>411 F.3d 572, 575-76 (5th Cir.2005), but asserts that <em>Scroggins </em>is distinguishable because the defendant in <em>Scroggins </em>wished to receive the benefit of the merits opinion in <em>Booker </em>without the application of the remedial opinion while he simply wishes to be sentenced under the <em>pre-Booker </em>sentencing scheme. Coffman\u2019s argument is without merit. <em>See United States v. Austin, </em>432 F.3d 598, 599-600 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-16\">Coffman additionally states that his sentence is unreasonable. However, beyond his arguments regarding upward departures under the Guidelines and his due process and ex post facto arguments, he offers no further argument as to why his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>sentence is unreasonable. To the extent that Coffman is seeking to argue that his sentence is unreasonable for reasons beyond those discussed above, he has failed to properly brief his arguments and waived them. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Both Coffman and the Government correctly assert that the judgment which provides that Coffman be awarded credit for the time he was in custody on a related state sentence prior to the federal sentencing is ineffectual. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 333-37, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b). To award Coffman credit for this time, the district court should reduce Coffman\u2019s sentence accordingly and note the reason for the reduction in the judgment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3, comment. (n.2). However, when Coffman raised this point at sentencing and in a motion to correct sentence, the district court denied the requests. As the district court sentenced Coffman on the erroneous belief that it could effectively order that Coffman receive credit for this period and the record does not conclusively show that the district court intended to adjust Coffman\u2019s sentence, we vacate the sentence and remand the case for the limited purpose of determining whether the sentence should be reduced to award Coffman credit for the time he spent in state custody prior to his sentencing in federal court. <em>See United States v. Barrera-Saucedo, </em>385 F.3d 533, 536-37 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">For the first time on appeal, Coffman contends that the felon-in-possession-of-a-firearm statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), is unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause because it criminalizes the possession of firearms that do not substantially affect interstate commerce. Coffman correctly concedes that this argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 &amp; n. 12 (5th Cir.2001). He raises the issue to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCED VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
