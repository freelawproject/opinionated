We review the district court\u2019s \u00a7 2A2.2(b)(3)(B) five-level increase for clear error. See <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-25\">Section 2A2.2(b)(3)(B) requires a five-level increase to a base offense level if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>victim of the offense sustained serious bodily injury. \u201c \u2018Serious bodily injury\u2019 means injury involving extreme physical pain or the protracted impairment of a function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; or requiring medical intervention such as surgery, hospitalization, or physical rehabilitation.\u201d \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(L); <em>see </em>\u00a7 2A2.2 cmt. n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The record reflects that Nguyen required medical treatment for the stab wound inflicted by Le. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(L); <em>see </em>\u00a7 2A2.2 cmt. n. 1. Testimony from a treating physician revealed that two layers of sutures were necessary and a Coast Guard medical technician testified that there was a great deal of blood down Nguyen\u2019s back and front side. The district court noted that Nguyen informed the probation officer that the stab wound was the most extreme pain he had ever felt. <em>See United States v. Puig-Infante, </em>19 F.3d 929, 943 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, from the record as a whole, the district court did not commit clear error in applying the five-level increase. <em>See Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203 &amp; n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Le argues that the district court erred in applying a four-level increase for the use of a dangerous weapon. He contends that the element of a dangerous weapon was already accounted for in the statute of conviction, therefore the district court did not need to count it again as part of his offense level. We review this issue for plain error as Le raises it for the first time on appeal. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Le cannot demonstrate plain error as the relevant guideline does not prohibit double-counting. <em>See United States v. Box, </em>50 F.3d 345, 359 (5th Cir.1995); \u00a7 2A2.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Le finally argues that the district court\u2019s five-level increase for \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d constituted a departure from the guidelines. Le further argues that the court\u2019s departure was compounded by the court\u2019s failure to articulate its reasons and its reliance on outside factors such as Le\u2019s criminal history, racial motivations, and prior encounters with Nguyen, to increase Le\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">The district court\u2019s sentence was reasonable as the record reflects that the district court acknowledged that the guidelines were advisory, considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 factors, and sentenced Le within the guideline range. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519; <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b413-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
