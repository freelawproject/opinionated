Perez-Tostado, </em>115 Fed.Appx. 257 (5th Cir.2004) (unpublished). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See de la Cruz-Gonzalez v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 1995, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2005). This court requested and received supplemental letter briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">In his supplemental letter brief, Perez-Tostado contends that the district court committed reversible plain error when it sentenced him pursuant to the mandatory United States Sentencing Guidelines held unconstitutional in <em>Booker. </em>He also argues that his <em>Booker </em>claim is not precluded by the terms of the appellate-waiver provision in his plea agreement. Because Perez-Tostado cannot prevail on his <em>Booker </em>claim, a ruling on the enforceability of his appeal waiver is pretermitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">The district court erred when it sentenced Perez \u2014 Tostado pursuant to the mandatory guidelines system held unconstitutional in <em>Booker. See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005). By challenging his sentence under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), on direct appeal, Perez-Tostado has sufficiently preserved <em>Fanfan </em>error for review on remand from the Supreme Court. <em>See United States v. Cruz, </em>418 F.3d 481, 484 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 770, 163 L.Ed.2d 597 (2005). A <em>Fanfan </em>error is neither structural nor presumptively prejudicial and, instead, is subject to the plain error analysis set forth in <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005); <em>United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560 n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 194, 163 L.Ed.2d 209 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-22\">Perez-Tostado has failed to point to any statements in the record indicating that the same sentence would not have been imposed had the district court known that the Guidelines were advisory. The record itself gives no indication that the district court would have reached a different result under an advisory guidelines system. Further, the fact that Perez-Tostado was sentenced at the lowest end of the guideline range does not demonstrate that the district court would have reached a different conclusion under an advisory sentencing scheme. <em>See United States v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 317 &amp; n. 4 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 264, 163 L.Ed.2d 238 (2005). Given the lack of any indication in the record that the district court would have reached a different conclusion, Perez-Tostado has not demonstrated that his substantial rights were affected, and, thus, he has failed to establish plain error. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 520-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>In his original appeal to this court, Perez-Tostado argued that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826(b) were unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As this court previously held, this issue is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See also United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). <em>Booker </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\"><em>Booker </em>does not require this court to change the prior affirmance in Perez-Tos-tado\u2019s case. Accordingly, we REINSTATE our judgment affirming Perez-Tostado\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b433-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
