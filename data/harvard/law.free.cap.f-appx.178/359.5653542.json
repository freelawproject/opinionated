Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and arguing that her Sixth Amendment rights were violated because her sentence was enhanced based on facts not alleged in the indictment, proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, or admitted by her. Because Smelosky preserved the issue, we review for harmless error, which requires the Government to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would have imposed the same sentence if the Sentencing Guidelines had been advisory. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 286 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-16\">As the Government concedes, because the district court enhanced Smelosky\u2019s sentence based on its own factual determinations, the district court committed error under <em>Booker. See Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d at 286. We also conclude that the error was not harmless. The fact that the court sentenced Smelosky to the maximum sentence within the guidelines range is insufficient to satisfy the Government\u2019s burden. <em>See United States v. Woods, </em>440 F.3d 255, 258-59 (5th Cir.2006). Nor are the district court\u2019s comments at sentencing addressing the issue of an upward departure sufficient to demonstrate that the <em>Booker </em>error was harmless. <em>See Woods, </em>440 F.3d at 260-61 (rejecting Government\u2019s argument that <em>Booker </em>error was harmless in the light of the sentencing court\u2019s narrow rejection of an upward departure).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-17\">The Government has not satisfied its burden of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that the court would have imposed the same sentence but for the <em>Booker </em>error. <em>See Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d at 286-87. Accordingly, we vacate Smelosky\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-18\">Smelosky\u2019s arguments that a greater sentence at resentencing would implicate ex post facto and due process concerns are premature, and we do not address them. <em>See Amar v. Whitley, </em>100 F.3d 22, 23 (5th Cir.1996); <em>In re Talbott Big Foot, Inc., </em>924 F.2d 85, 87 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
