The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Post<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>al Service on Reynolds\u2019 claims. Reynolds asserts the district court erred in considering the Postal Service\u2019s summary judgment motion because, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f), the court should have allowed her to conduct discovery before ruling on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">A district court\u2019s refusal to grant a continuance of a summary judgment motion in order to conduct discovery is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Burks v. Am. Cast Iron Pipe Co., </em>212 F.3d 1333, 1336 (11th Cir.2000). Rule 56(f) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-6\">Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that the party cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify the party\u2019s opposition, the court may refuse the application for judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make such other order as is just.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">\u201cThe availability of a continuance is built into the rules to guard against the premature entry of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Barfield v. Brierton, </em>883 F.2d 923, 931 (11th Cir.1989). Furthermore, Rule 56(f) \u201callows a party who has no specific material contradicting his adversary\u2019s presentation to survive a summary judgment motion if he presents valid reasons justifying his failure of proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). A party requesting such a continuance, however, is required to \u201cpresent an affidavit containing specific facts explaining his failure to respond to the adverse party\u2019s motion for summary judgment via counter affidavits establishing genuine issues of material fact for trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe nonmovant may not simply rely on vague assertions that additional discovery will produce needed, but unspecified, facts, but must show the court how the stay will operate to permit him to rebut, through discovery, the movant\u2019s contentions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-9\">In this case, Reynolds did not file an affidavit in compliance with Rule 56(f), stating why she needed additional time to conduct discovery or why she otherwise was unable to respond to the Postal Service\u2019s summary judgment motion. Although Reynolds explained that, at the time the Postal Service filed its summary judgment motion, the parties had not held a planning meeting, nor had a scheduling order been issued, she did not discuss the nature of her need for additional discovery. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Reynolds\u2019 request for additional time to conduct discovery under Rule 56(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
