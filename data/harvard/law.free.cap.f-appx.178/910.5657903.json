Because the district court did not plainly err in imposing consecutive sentences and because the sentences imposed were reasonable, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">Martin was charged in a two-count indictment with: (1) conspiring to possess heroin with intent to distribute it, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C) (Count 1); and (2) obtaining heroin while serving a sentence in federal prison, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(a)(2), (b)(1), and (d)(1)(C) (Count 2). He pled guilty as to both counts without a plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">At the change-of-plea hearing, the government proffered the following factual basis for the charges. Martin, an inmate at a federal prison in Florida, \u201cassisted another inmate, Eliezer Moreno-Vigo, with obtaining and distributing heroin in the prison by agreeing to receive letters on behalf of Moreno-Vigo that the defendant knew contained heroin. After receiving the letters, the defendant provided them to Moreno-Vigo who then distributed the heroin to other inmates.\u201d R2 at 14. Prison officials intercepted several letters addressed to Martin in which hidden compartments in the pages contained a powdery substance determined to be heroin. <em>Id. </em>Prison officials delivered the remaining pages of one of the letters to Martin, and prison video surveillance showed that Martin gave the contents to Moreno-Vigo. <em>Id. </em>Martin told prison officials that he had agreed to receive the letters in exchange for books of stamps, a form of currency in prison. <em>Id. </em>at 15. He admitted receiving a total of eight letters for Moreno-Vigo. <em>Id. </em>at 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">The probation office classified Martin as a career offender, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 (2004), because Martin had been convicted on three prior occasions of crimes of violence or controlled substance offenses, including armed robbery, wanton endangerment, and possession with intent to distribute cocaine base. Because the statutory maximum penalty for his offense here was 20 years, Martin was assigned a base offense level of 32. He received a three-level reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, for acceptance of responsibility and a timely guilty plea, leaving him with a total offense level of 29. Martin\u2019s career offender status gave him a criminal history category of VI, pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1. Based on these calculations, the applicable guideline range was 151 to 188 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">The probation office noted that, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(c), punishment for the violation of \u00a7 1791(b) must be consecutive to (1) any other sentence imposed for the same controlled substance offense and (2) any sentence that the defendant was serving when the offense was committed. Because Martin\u2019s criminal history gave him a total of twenty points, the probation office also informed the court that an upward departure might be warranted under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l), if the court determined that Martin\u2019s criminal history category did not adequately reflect his past criminal conduct. Neither the government nor Martin objected to the findings by the probation office, but Martin filed a motion seeking a downward departure on the ground that his criminal history category <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>substantially over-represented the seriousness of his criminal history category.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court adopted the PSI\u2019s findings of fact and calculations regarding the appropriate guideline range. In support of his motion for a downward departure, Martin asserted: (1) he had not used the heroin he had received in the mail; (2) he had sent the majority of the money he earned to his daughter; (3) he had cooperated with prison officials and admitted his guilt; (4) his offense involved only a small drug amount; (5) he had accepted responsibility for his involvement in the offense; and (6) other prisoners involved in similar conduct had received either administrative punishment or sentences in the two to four-year range. R3 at 5-8. The government responded that the amount of heroin involved in the offense conduct had been significant, because each gram of heroin contained approximately 75 hits, and noted that a prisoner whose offense was more similar to Martin\u2019s \u2014 distributing heroin- \u2014 -than the offenses of the prisoners whose sentences Martin had used for comparison, had been sentenced to eleven years. <em>Id. </em>at 10-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 13-14. The district court further noted that Martin\u2019s sentences would be more severe than other sentences imposed in controlled substances cases coming out of Coleman prison, because the court regarded the possession and distribution of heroin \u201cas a substantially more serious offense than the distribution of other controlled substances, including cocaine and marijuana in particular.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. The district court then sentenced Martin to 60 months imprisonment as to Count 1 and 60 months imprisonment as to Count 2, to be served consecutively to each other and to the sentence he was serving when he committed the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">The government then objected to the fact that the sentences were below the recommended guideline range, and Martin requested that the district court reconsider, asserting that the court had gone \u201cright back to the career offender guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16. The district court declined to reconsider because it had granted a \u201cdownward departure in [Martin\u2019s] favor of 31 months\u201d from the guideline range even though he was a career offender. <em>Id. </em>The court further stated that any less severe \u201cwould not be a reasonable sentence and would invite criticism of the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">On appeal, Martin argues for the first time that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(b) did not require the sentencing court to sentence him to consecutive sentences for each count in the indictment. He also argues that the sentences imposed were excessive and failed to take into consideration the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">A. <em>Section 1791</em></p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\">Martin\u2019s objection based on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791 was not raised before the district court and so was not timely made. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>We review for plain error those issues for which timely objections were not made in the district court. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>see also </em>Fed. R. Crim.P. 52(b). To prevail under plain error review, an appellant must prove: (1) there was an error; (2) that was plain; and (3) the plain error must affect substantial rights. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732, 113 S. Ct. at 1776. Once the appellant proves these three elements, we may notice the error only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">Section 1791 provides for the punishment of prison inmates who possess or obtain prohibited items, such as heroin. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(a)(2), (d)(1)(C). The statute specifies the imposition of consecutive sentences when the contraband involved is a controlled substance, stating that \u201c[a]ny punishment imposed ... for a violation ... involving a controlled substance shall. <em>be consecutive </em>to any other sentence imposed by any court for an offense involving such a controlled substance.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(c) (emphasis added). Unless Congress explicitly states otherwise, \u201cwe construe a statutory term in accordance with its ordinary or natural meaning.\u201d <em>FDIC v. Meyer, </em>510 U.S. 471, 476, 114 S.Ct. 996, 1001, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994). \u201c \u2018[S]haH\u2019 generally means \u2018must\u2019.\u201d <em>Gutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno, </em>515 U.S. 417, 432 n. 9, 115 S.Ct. 2227, 2235 n. 9, 132 L.Ed.2d 375 (1995) (observing that this is the case except when \u201cshall\u201d is misused by legal authors or used in certain contexts, such as when \u201ccertain of the Federal Rules use the word \u2018shall\u2019 to authorize, but not to require, judicial action\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-11\">Here, Martin pled guilty to both a controlled substance offense and a violation of \u00a7 1791. Under these circumstances, the plain language of \u00a7 1791(c) required the district court to impose consecutive sentences. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(c). Accordingly, Martin\u2019s argument that the district court plainly erred in imposing consecutive sentences for each of the two counts in the indictment fails, as he has shown no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-12\">B. <em>Excessive Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-13\">Although he has not couched it as a separate issue on appeal, Martin also argues that the sentences imposed by the district court were \u201cexcessive\u201d and failed to take into account the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), particularly the sentences of inmates charged with similar conduct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A district court must first correctly calculate the range prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178-79 (11th Cir.2005). Once it has done so, that court \u201cmay impose a more severe or more lenient sentence,\u201d which we will review for reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 1179. Both the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence and our reasonableness inquiry are guided by the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number><em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam); <em>U.S. v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors take into account:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-4\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b940-5\"><em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. A district court need not explain its logic for every \u00a7 3553(a) factor before announcing its sentence. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[A]n acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker.\u201d Id. </em>\u201c[Tjhere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788. The burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">Here, the record reflects that the district court correctly calculated Martin\u2019s guideline range and explicitly stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining Martin\u2019s sentences, specifically including \u201cconsistency in the sentencing of defendants who have been convicted of essentially the same offense.\u201d R3 at 14. Martin conspired to possess heroin in a prison setting, was deemed a career offender, and had such a substantial criminal history that it might have merited an upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l). The correctly calculated guidelines range for his offense was 151 to 188 months. His sentences, taken together, already fall 31 months below the bottom of this range. For these reasons, we conclude that the sentences imposed by the district court were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">Martin appeals his two consecutive 60-month sentences for conspiring to possess heroin with intent to distribute it and obtaining heroin while serving a sentence in federal prison. Because we find that the district court did not err in its application of \u00a7 1791(c) and that the sentences imposed were reasonable, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b939-8\"> . For instance, Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(e) provides that \"[t]he order following a final pretrial conference shall be modified only to prevent manifest injustice.\u201d Rule 16(e) thereby explains where the court\u2019s discretion comes into the decision. There is no similar discretion-invoking factor in \u00a7 1791(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b939-9\"> . Although the government initially asserted an argument to the contrary, we do have jurisdiction to review Martin\u2019s sentence for reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>434 F.3d 1318, 1321-22 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (\"[A] <em>post-Booker </em>appeal based on the 'unreasonableness' of a sentence, whether within or outside the advisory guidelines range, is an appeal asserting that the sentence was imposed in violation of law pursuant to \u00a7 3742(a)(1).\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
