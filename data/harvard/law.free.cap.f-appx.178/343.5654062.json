Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">Garza first argues that his sentence, which was enhanced based on facts determined by the judge, violates the Sixth Amendment rule announced in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Garza did not raise this objection in the district court. Accordingly, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005). Garza cannot show that the error in this case affected his substantial rights because there is nothing in the record to indicate that the district court, operating under advisory Sentencing Guidelines, would have imposed a lower sentence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-18\">Garza next contends that he should have received a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility and that the denial of the reduction constitutes a breach of the plea agreement and rendered his plea involuntary. Garza\u2019s contentions are wholly without merit, if not frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-19\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s finding on acceptance of responsibility with even greater deference than is given under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>See United States v. Angeles-Mendoza, </em>407 F.3d 742, 753 (5th Cir.2005). The district court denied the reduction after finding that Garza engaged in obstruction of justice by attempting to influence the testimony of other inmates so that he could obtain a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 reduction. Garza does not challenge this finding, which is, in any event, amply supported by the evidence. Conduct which results in an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice \u201cordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct\u201d except in \u201cextraordinary cases.\u201d \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.4). The court concluded that this was not an extraordinary case and Garza cites no evidence or law to the contrary. He has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>failed to demonstrate any error by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Garza\u2019s contentions that the plea agreement was breached and that his plea was involuntary are likewise wholly without merit. As for his claim of breach, the terms of the plea agreement made it clear that the recommendation of a three-level reduction was conditioned upon Garza\u2019s truthful rendition of facts at rearraignment, sentencing and during the presentence interview. Further, Garza he was required to refrain from committing any crimes. Garza\u2019s lack of truthfulness at sentencing and his conduct in attempting to obstruct justice negated any obligation of the Government to move for a reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">With respect to the voluntariness of the plea, Garza\u2019s assertion that he reasonably believed that he would receive a reduction for acceptance of responsibility is contrary to his sworn testimony at rearraignment that he understood that the district court was not bound by the plea agreement and that the court would determine his sentence without regard the terms of the plea agreement. His claim that his plea was not voluntary is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Finally, Garza seeks leave to have his counsel relieved and to proceed pro se on appeal. Garza\u2019s motion, filed nine months after his counsel filed a brief on Garza\u2019s behalf, is not timely. <em>See United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 902 (5th Cir.1998). For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. Garza\u2019s motion to proceed pro se is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">AFFIRMED; MOTION TO PROCEED PRO SE DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b370-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
