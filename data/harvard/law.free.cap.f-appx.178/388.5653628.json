Propes, Texas state prisoner number 1178904, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of his pro se, in forma pauperis, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights complaint for failure to state a claim. Liberally construed, Propes reiterates his claim that, on June 23, 2003, in the 366th District Court, Officer Debora Wolf, a Plano, Texas, police officer, knowingly falsely testified at a trial that in 1999 he threatened her with a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">A district court shall dismiss an IFP complaint at any time if it determines that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). Such a dismissal is reviewed de novo under the standard of Fed. R. Crv. P. 12(b)(6). <em>Hart v. Hairston, </em>343 F.3d 762, 763-64 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Police officers are absolutely immune from liability for their allegedly perjurious testimony. <em>Enlow v. Tishomingo County, Miss., </em>962 F.2d 501, 511 (5th Cir.1992). As such, Propes\u2019s claims against Officer Wolf are barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">The district court denied Propes\u2019s motion to supplement his complaint with claims that challenged an unspecified conviction and sentence. Because Propes did not contest the district court\u2019s ruling on appeal, he arguably has waived the right to challenge the denial of his motion to amend. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Assuming that Propes\u2019s reassertion on appeal of the claims raised in his motion to supplement constitutes an implicit challenge to the denial of his motion to supplement, the claims still fail as they are not cognizable under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Accordingly, Propes\u2019s appeal is frivolous and therefore is dismissed. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-15\">In <em>Propes v. Dretke, </em>130 Fed.Appx. 654 (5th Cir.2005), we imposed the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) bar against Propes. We warn Propes that further filing of frivolous complaints or pleadings may result in additional sanctions against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-16\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b415-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
