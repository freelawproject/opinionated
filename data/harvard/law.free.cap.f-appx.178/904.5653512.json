Substantial evidence supports the Immigration Judge\u2019s determination to deny Li-kollari\u2019s application for asylum on the ground that Likollari lacked credibility. Furthermore, because Likollari cannot meet the lower standard for asylum, we also deny his claims for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture. Accordingly, we deny Likollari\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b931-14\">Likollari attempted to enter the United States at Miami, Florida, by using a fraudulent Belgian passport. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> initiated immigration proceedings, placing Li-kollari in \u201casylum only proceedings\u201d pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.2(b) (2001) as a visa waiver pilot program (\u201cVWPP\u201d) applicant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Immigration hearings for Likollari were held following his arrival in the United States, during which he sought relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) and filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal claiming he was a refugee based on his political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-15\">In his application, Likollari stated that he had left Albania in February 2002. To show he was entitled to asylum, he asserted that in October 1999 he had participated in a demonstration organized by the Democratic Party of Albania in his hometown of Korce, Albania. He initially became involved in the party in 1995 as a member of the Youth Forum and became a full member in 1997. Likollari estimated that approximately 1000 people attended the demonstration, during which he and others held signs supporting the Democratic Party and opposing the Socialist Party. Socialist Party supporters stood behind a line of police officers and insulted the Democratic Party demonstrators. As the Democratic Party demonstrators approached the area where its scheduled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>speakers were to address the crowd, the police attacked the demonstrators, including Likollari, with police batons. Likollari eventually escaped from the melee.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Likollari\u2019s application stated that about one week after the demonstration, two men wearing army fatigues and masks arrived at his house at approximately 5:00 or 6:00 a.m. The men forced their way past Likollari\u2019s mother and found Likollari in his bed. They dragged him from his house, beat him, and placed him in a van. Seven men were in the van, and the beatings continued. The men brought Likol-lari to the police station where they placed him in a cell alone, refused to allow him to obtain a lawyer, and beat him two or three times per day. Likollari had to rely on a man in an adjacent cell for food. Likollari stated that his captors did not interrogate him but they asked him why he was involved in the Democratic Party and tried to \u201cscare me and harass me so that I would not be involved with the Democratic Party.\u201d After two days, his captors drove him outside the city and left him in the mountains, from which he walked home in two or three hours. He suffered a broken finger and an injured nose during his imprisonment and because he feared leaving his house, his mother treated his injuries. He remained a member of the Democratic Party following his detention and attended meetings at the party\u2019s headquarters but \u201ctried not to be so involved in demonstrations\u201d or \u201cso much on the front line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">From January 2000 to January 2001, he served his obligatory time in the military. He stated that during his service, the Socialists continually harassed his brother, who was also a member of the Democratic Party, and forced his brother from a position as a police officer. At the time of Likollari\u2019s application, his brother\u2019s application for asylum in the United States was being heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">Likollari\u2019s application also explained his father\u2019s 1989 imprisonment for insulting the former Socialist dictator. At the same time, the police detained and beat Likol-lari, his brother, and his mother. The police again arrested and beat his father in 1998, apparently because his father complained about irregularities in voting for the constitution. Likollari also stated that the Socialists stole his father\u2019s land, which his father recovered when the Democratic Party returned to power.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">At the hearing before the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), Likollari testified as follows: he was twenty-five years old and single and had worked on his family farm until he left Albania in February 2002. He was a member of the Democratic Party since his participation in the Youth Forum, and he became a full party member in 1997. His duties in the party included observing meetings and elections and attending demonstrations. The party held meetings every three or four months. Likollari participated in \u201cmany\u201d demonstrations, including an \u201cimportant one\u201d in October 1999. Approximately 300 or 400 people attended the four or five hour demonstration that included Democratic Party leaders speaking out against the Socialist government. A group of Socialist counter-demonstrators threw things and yelled at the demonstrators, and a line of police officers protected the Socialists from the Democratic Party members. Eventually, the police clashed with the Democratic Party members, and Likollari was beaten before fleeing home.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">Likollari testified that the following day two masked men abducted him from his house, placed him in a jeep or van, and brought him to a jail. Three or four other masked men were also in the vehicle, and the masked men beat Likollari. He was detained for two days at the police station where he was kept in a small cell, beaten with rubber sticks three or four times, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>received food only from a fellow prisoner. His captors also questioned him about the demonstration, called him a \u201cdog\u201d, and asked him how he could be a member of the Democratic Party. After two days, his captors took him to the mountains and left him. He walked home, which took about three hours. On cross examination, he said that the captors left him near his home, and he took three hours to return home because he was traumatized. He further testified that during his imprisonment he sustained small wounds over his body and on his legs that his mother treated. When asked about the statement in his application that he had sustained a broken finger and injured nose, he stated that he had forgotten about those injuries when asked the initial question because the incident happened several years earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">As he stated in his application, Likollari testified that he left Albania in February 2002 when his father obtained the means to send him. Using a false Belgian passport, and after brief stops in Italy and Switzerland, he reached Ecuador, where he spent three months, before going to Colombia, where he spent one month, and eventually arrived in Miami, Florida in June 2002. Finally, he testified that he feared he would be killed if he returned to Albania because of his membership in the Democratic Party.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Likollari also supported his claims with the 2001, 2003, and 2004 State Department Reports on Albania, the 2003 European Communities Report, and a 2000 Amnesty International Report. The reports explained that the political climate in Albania was unstable, that participation in elections resulted in violence, and that police engaged in excessive treatment. The reports clarified, however, that only limited instances of violence occurred after 1998 and that by 2001, members of the Democratic Party had parliamentary seats.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">In his decision, the IJ noted that Likol-lari paused between thirty and sixty seconds several times before answering questions and that his answers were sometimes unresponsive to the questions asked. The IJ also noted Likollari was vague about details of the demonstrations and his involvement in the party and provided inconsistent information about the injuries he incurred during his detention. The IJ acknowledged, however, that the State Department Country Reports listed use of force against protestors, beatings by police, and an unstable political climate. After considering the testimony and other evidence and reciting the applicable law, the IJ denied relief, finding that Likollari was not credible, his testimony had been vague and unresponsive, and he failed to present other witnesses or corroborating evidence. The IJ noted Likollari\u2019s limited political participation and determined that he failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, especially considering that he remained in Albania for more than two years after the beatings and that his parents, who he admitted also faced beatings and participated in the Democratic Party, still lived there. Finally, the IJ concluded that Likollari could not meet the CAT standard because he did not show that he had been singled out for torture. Accordingly, the IJ denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">The Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without an opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">When, as here, the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as adopted by the BIA. <em>Chacona-Botero v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 956 (11th Cir.2005). To the extent that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>IJ\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, we review the decision <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). We review the IJ\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Al Najjar </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation and internal marks omitted). A finding of fact will \u201cbe reversed by this court only when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc). We also review the IJ\u2019s credibility determination under the substantial evidence test, and we should not \u201csubstitute our judgment for that of the [IJ] with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AEl\">The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if an alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). The INA defines \u201crefugee\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-6\">[A]ny person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of ... political opinion....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Acl\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) <em>&amp; </em>(B). The asylum applicant bears the burden of proving refugee status. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. To meet this burden, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b). This court has explained that \u201c \u2018persecution\u2019 is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and ... mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir. 2005) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">If the alien establishes past persecution, he is presumed to have a well-founded fear of future persecution unless the government can rebut the presumption. <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818 (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.12(b)(l)(i), (ii)). If he cannot show past persecution, the alien must demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution that is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. The subjective component can be proved \u201cby the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution,\u201d and the objective component \u201ccan be fulfilled either by es-' tablishing past persecution or that he or she has a good reason to fear future persecution.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1202 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">If an alien\u2019s testimony is credible, it may be sufficient, without corroboration, to satisfy his burden of proof in establishing his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>eligibility for asylum.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Forgue v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), \u00a7 208.16(b). In contrast, an IJ\u2019s denial of an asylum application can be supported solely by an adverse credibility determination, especially if the alien does not produce corroborating evidence. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. If, however, the applicant produces other evidence of persecution, the IJ must consider that evidence and should not rely on an adverse credibility determination in those cases. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">\u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>In re </em>B-, 21 I &amp; N Dec. 66, 70, 1995 WL 326740 (BIA 1995). An adverse credibility finding must go to the heart of the claim, and not be based on minor discrepancies, inconsistencies, and omissions. <em>Lui v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>156 Fed.Appx. 270, 273 (11th Cir.2005) (unpublished) (citing <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir.2002)); <em>(Akinmade v. INS, </em>196 F.3d 951, 954 (9th Cir.1999)). A single inconsistency may be sufficient to support an adverse credibility finding if the inconsistency relates to the alien\u2019s basis for his fear and goes to the heart of his asylum claim. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">Here, the IJ concluded that Likollari\u2019s testimony lacked credibility. Substantial evidence supports this conclusion. The government points to several possible in<em>consistencies </em>\u2014 e.g., the number of men involved in his kidnapping and the vehicle his kidnappers used \u2014 but Likollari\u2019s statements may not be inconsistent and, at least, do not go to the heart of his claim. However, Likollari provided vague information about his involvement in the Democratic Party, gave unresponsive answers to questions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> gave inconsistent testimony about the injuries he sustained during his imprisonment,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> gave drastically different estimates of the number of people involved in the October 1999 demonstration, and often paused for thirty to sixty seconds before answering his attorney\u2019s questions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> These concerns go to the heart of Likol-lari\u2019s claim. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287-88. Even though the Country Reports show that the conduct that Likollari alleges occurs in Albania, he has failed to present evidence supporting <em>Ms </em>claim of persecution. Especially considering this failure by Likollari, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is sufficient alone to deny Likollari\u2019s application for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>Because Likollari failed to meet the lower burden to establish his eligibility for asylum, he cannot meet the higher burden to establish his eligibility for withholding of removal or relief under CAT. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93. Accordingly, the petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b931-11\">. On November 25, 2002, President Bush signed into law the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L. No. 107-296, Stat. 2125.

Under the VWPP, the Attorney General is permitted to allow aliens from certain countries to enter the United States for up to ninety days without a visa. INA \u00a7 217(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1187(a). Aliens who are admitted under this program agree to forfeit any challenge to removal, except on the basis of asylum. INA \u00a7 217(b), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1187(b). By regulation, aliens from Belgium are eligible for admission into the United States under the program. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 217.2(a) (2001). Because Likollari attempted to enter the United States with a Belgian passport, he was classified as a VWPP applicant and was placed in \"asylum only proceedings.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b934-7\">. Congress recently passed the REAL ID Act, which altered this court\u2019s review of immigration appeals. In <em>Huang, </em>this court noted that pursuant to the REAL ID Act, all petitions for review are governed by the permanent rules, and that, under the Act as codified at INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1), the Secretary of Homeland Security, in addition to the Attorney General, has discretion to grant asylum. <em>Huang v.

When initially asked on cross examination about the injuries he sustained during his imprisonment, Likollari failed to mention the broken finger and injured nose that he noted in his application for asylum.
