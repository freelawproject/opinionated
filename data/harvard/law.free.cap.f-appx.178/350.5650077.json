The district court ruled the application was moot due to Moore\u2019s release from prison. Moore contends his claim is not moot. The respondent claims the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider Moore\u2019s successive application.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-22\">Moore\u2019s first \u00a7 2254 application was denied in October 2001. <em>Moore v. Vandel, </em>No. H-99-3739 (S.D. Tex. 30 Oct. 2001) (unpublished). The district court could consider Moore\u2019s successive petition only if he had obtained an order from this court authorizing the district court to do so. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3); <em>United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000). Because Moore did not do so, the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the successive petition. <em>Key, </em>205 F.3d at 774. Consequently, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand this matter with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Crone v.
