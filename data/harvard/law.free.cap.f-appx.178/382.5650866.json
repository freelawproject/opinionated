He contends that the district court erred by (1) failing to award him a third point for acceptance of responsibility, (2) upwardly departing from the applicable advisory Sentencing Guideline range, and (3) imposing a mandatory order of restitution as part of his sentence. We review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Guidelines de novo and its factual determinations for clear error. <em>United States v. Solis-Garcia, </em>420 F.3d 511, 513-14 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-19\">The Guidelines do not permit a district court to grant a third acceptance point under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(b) without a government motion. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.6). As the government did not make such a motion, and the district court imposed a Guidelines sentence, the district court did not err when it declined to award Sanches-Penalosa a third acceptance point. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 n. 7. (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Our review of the basis and extent of the upward departure does not reveal an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Saldana, </em>427 F.3d 298, 308 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-22\">The district court did err, however, by imposing mandatory restitution as part of Sanches-Penalosa\u2019s sentence. Accordingly, the order of restitution is vacated, and the case is remanded for the district court to consider whether to impose restitution as a condition of supervised release. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>All other terms of the judgment are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b409-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
