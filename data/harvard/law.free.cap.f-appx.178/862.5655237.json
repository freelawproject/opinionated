Initially, the district court entered an order granting the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss dismissing Behrman\u2019s recision claims with prejudice and all other claims without prejudice. As part of that ruling, the district court found that Behr-man\u2019s tort claims were barred by the economic loss rule.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court did, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>however, recognize that a true fraud in the inducement claim is not precluded by the economic loss rule and dismissed that count of Behrmaris complaint without prejudice to give Behrman an opportunity to amend his complaint. Subsequently, Behrman amended his complaint but the district court entered a second order granting the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss and dismissed Behrmaris case with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss. <em>Spain v. Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>363 F.3d 1183, 1187 (11th Cir.2004). A motion to dismiss is granted only when the mov-ant demonstrates \u201cbeyond a doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957); Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Moreover, we have in the past affirmed dismissals based upon Florida\u2019s economic loss rule. <em>Airport Rent-A-Car, Inc. v. Prevost, Inc., </em>67 F.3d 901 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">First, we agree with the district court\u2019s ruling that the economic loss rule bars all of Behrmaris tort claims. Behrmaris tort claims are not extraneous to his breach of contract claim. Second, we agree that the district court properly dismissed Behrmaris negligent hiring, supervision, and retention claims because Quigley \u2014 the alleged bad actor \u2014 was an employee of non-party A.G. Edwards, not the defendants. Concerning Behrmaris breach of contract claims, we agree that the district court properly found that all of Behrmaris arguments concerning these claims were baseless and that Behrmaris breach of contract claims were defectively pled and barred by the parol evidence rule and the statute of frauds. Additionally, we agree with the district court\u2019s findings concerning Behrman\u2019s claims of negligent misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement and negligent omission. Finally, because a civil conspiracy claim is not an independent cause of action in Florida, we also conclude that that claim was properly dismissed because all of the predicate claims were properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">In sum, because we conclude from the record that there is no merit to any of the arguments Berman makes in this appeal, we affirm the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b888-17\">. Florida's well-settled economic loss rule prohibits tort claims premised on economic losses flowing from an alleged contractual breach. <em>See Indemnity Ins. Co. of N. Amer. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number><em>American Aviation, </em>891 So.2d 532, 536 (Fla. 2004) (\"the economic loss rule has been applied ... when the parties are in contractual privity and the one party seeks to recover damages in tort for matters arising from contract.\"). \"The prohibition against tort actions to recover solely economic damages for those in contractual privity is designed to prevent parties to a contract from circumventing the allocation of losses set forth in the contract by bringing an action for economic losses in tort.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
