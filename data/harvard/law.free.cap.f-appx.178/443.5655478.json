The district court dismissed the petition pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) for want of prosecution. Houser now appeals that decision in accordance with this court\u2019s grant of a certificate of appealability on the issue whether the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his \u00a7 2254 petition. Houser contends that he did his best to comply with the district court\u2019s order directing him to fill out a questionnaire and that the district court erred in dismissing his suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-17\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 41(b) for abuse of discretion. <em>Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., </em>370 U.S. 626, 633, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962); <em>McNeal v. Papasan, </em>842 F.2d 787, 789-90 (5th Cir.1988). When reviewing a dismissal with prejudice under Rule 41(b), we will find an abuse of discretion unless there is a clear record of delay or \u201ccontumacious\u201d conduct by the plaintiff and the district court has expressly determined that lesser sanctions would not prompt diligent prosecution, or the record shows that the district court employed lesser sanctions that proved to be futile. <em>Berry v. CIGNA/RSI-CIGNA, </em>975 F.2d 1188, 1191 (5th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-18\">The district court abused its discretion in dismissing Houser\u2019s suit. There is no clear record of delay or contumacious conduct in this case. <em>See Berry, </em>975 F.2d at 1191 n. 6; <em>cf. Harrelson v. United States, </em>613 F.2d 114, 116 (5th Cir.1980); <em>see also Morris v. Ocean Systems, Inc., </em>730 F.2d 248, 252 (5th Cir.1984). The district court also erred by not considering lesser sanctions before dismissing Houser\u2019s suit. <em>See Berry, </em>975 F.2d at 1191. Consequently, the judgment of the district court is VA<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>CATED, and this case is REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b470-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
