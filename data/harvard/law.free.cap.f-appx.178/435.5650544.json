Gentry appeals the sentence imposed by the district court on remand. Gentry was sentenced to a 240-month term of imprisonment for bank robbery and to a mandatory consecutive 120-month term for using firearms during a crime of violence. Gentry\u2019s sentence was vacated on appeal and the matter was remanded for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Gentry, </em>118 Fed.Appx. 820, 821 (5th Cir. 2004). On resentencing, which occurred following the intervening decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court again imposed a 240-month sentence of imprisonment on the bank robbery count, which was above the applicable guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">Gentry argues that the district court should have more fully considered his history and characteristics in determining his sentence. Gentry emphasizes that he is only 25 years of age, that he had no felony convictions prior to the instant offense, and that he was gainfully employed and supporting his wife and two children. He contends that he was not one of the \u201cmain players\u201d the robbery, and he asserts that he did not discharge a firearm during the offense. Gentry submits that his sentence should be within the guideline range of 151-88 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-15\">\u201cBoth a district court\u2019s <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing discretion and the reasonableness inquiry on appeal must be guided by the sentencing considerations set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 706 (5th Cir.2006). However, the district court \u201cneed not engage in robotic incantations that each statutory factor has been considered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-16\">At resentencing, the district court stated that it had considered the Sentencing Guidelines and everything in the probation officer\u2019s report, which detailed Gentry\u2019s history and characteristics. The district court also indicated that it had considered the seriousness of Gentry\u2019s conduct, which contributed to the injury to a police officer, the harm to the community, and the sentences imposed on Gentry\u2019s co-defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-17\">The record does not support Gentry\u2019s contention that the district court failed to give adequate consideration to his role in the offense, his history, and his characteristics. The district court carefully considered the sentencing factors and articulated \u201cpermissible reasons for its variance\u201d from the guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at 710. Accordingly, Gentry\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b462-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
