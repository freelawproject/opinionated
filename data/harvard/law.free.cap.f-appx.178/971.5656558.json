After his mother paid the filing fees, McCrary is now proceeding with that frivolous appeal. He contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to correct his 228-month sentence, brought pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based upon Amendments 9 and 599 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-16\">We review a district court\u2019s decision not to resentence a defendant under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 759 n. 3 (11th Cir.1998). Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce the prison term of a defendant who is sentenced within a guideline range that has subsequently been lowered through a retroactive amendment to the guidelines \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1176 (11th Cir.2003). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) lists all of the retroactive amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-17\">Amendment 9 has been in effect since June 15, 1988. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 9 (2004). It was in effect in 1992 when McCrary committed his crimes and in 1995 when the district court sentenced him. Because McCrary could not have been sentenced within a guideline range that was subsequently lowered through the adoption of Amendment 9, he is not entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief on this basis. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying McCrary\u2019s motion to correct his sentence based upon Amendment 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-18\">Amendment 599 became effective on November 1, 2000, and thus was not in effect when McCrary committed his crimes and was sentenced. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 599. The amendment is listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c) as having retroactive applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>tion. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). Amendment 599 expanded the commentary in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4 to clarify under what circumstances a firearms enhancement may be imposed when a defendant has been convicted of a firearms offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). U.S.S.G., App. C, Amend. 599, Reason for Amendment. The amendment states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-6\">[N]o guideline weapon enhancement should be applied when determining the sentence for the crime of violence or drug trafficking offense underlying the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) conviction, nor for any conduct with respect to that offense for which the defendant is accountable under \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). Guideline weapon enhancements may be applied, however, when determining the sentence for counts of conviction outside the scope of relevant conduct for the underlying offense <em>(e.g., </em>a conviction for a second armed bank robbery for which no 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) conviction was obtained).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b999-7\"><em>Id. </em>This Court has stated that the purpose of the amendment was \u201cto prevent \u2018double counting\u2019 for firearms use in any one criminal event.\u201d <em>Pringle, </em>350 F.3d at 1180 (emphasis omitted). Because McCrary received weapons enhancements only in connection with the robberies for which he was not charged and convicted of violating \u00a7 924, his guideline range would not be affected by the amendment. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying McCrary\u2019s motion to correct his sentence based upon Amendment 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
