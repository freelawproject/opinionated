Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 395-397, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 2004-05, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), for failure to state a claim. Nelson sued Jimenez, a federal disciplinary hearing officer, alleging that Jimenez violated his Fifth Amendment due process rights during a disciplinary proceeding that upheld charges against Nelson for possession of marijuana and abuse of the mail system. He argues that his case is cognizable pursuant to United States Supreme Court law because his claim did not challenge the fact of his conviction or duration of his sentence, it fell outside the core of habeas corpus, and success would not necessarily spell immediate or speedier release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">We review a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of a claim as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 for abuse of discretion. <em>Bilal v. Driver, </em>251 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2001). Pursuant to 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1915, a district court may dismiss a case filed <em>in forma pauperis </em>at any time if it is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief. 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i-iii). \u201cA claim is frivolous if it is without arguable merit either in law or fact.\u201d <em>Bilal, </em>251 F.3d at 1349.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">In <em>Bivens, </em>the Supreme Court held that injured plaintiffs can bring a cause of action for damages against federal officers based on violations of the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights. <em>Bivens, </em>403 U.S. at 395-397, 91 S.Ct. at 2004-05. <em>Bivens </em>involved alleged violations of the Fourth Amendment, but the Supreme Court has also allowed <em>Bivens </em>actions for violations of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. <em>Davis v. Passman, </em>442 U.S. 228, 233-249, 99 S.Ct. 2264, 2271-2279, 60 L.Ed.2d 846 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">In <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), the Supreme Court held that \u201cto recover damages for an allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d 512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. If this type of action is brought prior to the invalidation of the challenged conviction or sentence, it must be dismissed as premature. <em>Id. </em>at 487, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. Thus, \u201cthe district court must consider whether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence; if it would, the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">We have held that although <em>Heck </em>dealt with a state prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action, the <em>Heck </em>rule applies with equal force in a <em>Bivens </em>action filed by a federal prisoner. <em>Abella v. Rubino, </em>63 F.3d 1063, 1065 (11th Cir.1995). The Supreme Court has applied the <em>Heck </em>analysis to claims made by prisoners challenging prison disciplinary actions, <em>see Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 643-649, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 1586-89, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997); however, <em>Heck </em>is not categorically applicable to all suits challenging prison disciplinary actions. <em>Muhammad v. Close, </em>540 U.S. 749, 754, 124 S.Ct. 1303, 1306, 158 L.Ed.2d 32 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-8\">In <em>Muhammad, </em>a prisoner filed a \u00a7 1983 action against a prison official, alleging that the official had charged him with threatening behavior and subjected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>him to mandatory prehearing lockup in retaliation for prior lawsuits and grievance proceedings the prisoner had filed against the prison official. <em>Id. </em>at 753-54, 124 S.Ct. at 1305. The Sixth Circuit upheld the dismissal of the suit, finding the action barred by <em>Heck. Id. </em>at 753, 124 S.Ct. at 1306. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that because the suit did not necessarily affect the computation of \u201cgood time\u201d credits, and the magistrate expressly found no good-time credits were affected by the actions challenged in the law suit, \u201c[h]is \u00a7 1983 suit challenging this action could not therefore be construed as seeking a judgment at odds with his conviction or with the State\u2019s calculation of time to be served in accordance with the underlying sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 754-55, 124 S.Ct. at 1306. Therefore, the Supreme Court found that no claim upon which habeas relief could have been granted was raised, \u201cwith the consequence that Heck\u2019s favorable termination requirement was inapplicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 755, 124 S.Ct. at 1306.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">Because Nelson\u2019s complaint did not seek to challenge the validity of his underlying conviction, and did not seek to affect the time he would serve related to that conviction, the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the complaint due to Nelson\u2019s failure to show that the disciplinary proceedings had been rendered invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
