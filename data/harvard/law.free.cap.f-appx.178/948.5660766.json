Patel appeals her sentence of 48 months\u2019 incarceration, imposed after she pled guilty to seven counts of bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. Patel asserts the sentence, which is above the advisory Guidelines range of 33 to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment, is unreasonable in light of her limited criminal history. Patel\u2019s sentence is reasonable, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-12\">In the <em>post-Booker </em>advisory Guidelines system, sentencing requires two steps. <em>United States v. </em>Talley, 431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cFirst, the district court must consult the Guidelines and correctly calculate the range provided by the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, the court must consider the sentencing factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), which include the history and characteristics of the defendant, \u201cthe available sentences, the applicable Guideline range, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, and provide the defendant with needed medical care.\u201d <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-14\">Once the district court has calculated the sentence under the advisory Guidelines and has considered the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a), it can impose a sentence more severe or more lenient than that suggested by the advisory Guidelines range, so long as the sentence is reasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. The party challenging the sentence has the burden of \u201cestablishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b975-15\">In light of the facts in the record and the sentencing factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), Patel\u2019s sentence of 48 months\u2019 imprisonment is reasonable. In determining this sentence, the district court correctly calculated and considered the advisory sentencing range of 33 to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment and the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. The record shows the district court considered the serious nature and the extent of the offense, the need for deterrence, and the need to provide just punishment for the offense in its decision to impose a sentence above the advisory range. Furthermore, despite Patel\u2019s emphasis on her limited criminal history, this is only one of many factors for the court to consider. Accordingly, we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>Patel fails to establish that her sentence is unreasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, and her argument the sentence fails to account for her limited criminal history is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
