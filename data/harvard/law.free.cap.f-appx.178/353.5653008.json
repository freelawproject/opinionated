Gregory waived his argument that the district court erred when it failed to order a mistrial sua sponte because he explicitly waived his right to challenge the juror. <em>United States v. Reveles, </em>190 F.3d 678, 682 (5th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Musquiz, </em>45 F.3d 927, 931-32 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Gregory\u2019s argument that the evidence was not sufficient to support his conviction because the Government failed to prove that he intended to strike Officer Matt is unavailing. Because Gregory was not required to know that he was striking a federal officer to be criminally liable under \u00a7 111(a)(1), that he intended to assault Officer Breaux and instead assaulted Officer Matt does not exonerate him. <em>United States v. Feola, </em>420 U.S. 671, 686, 95 S.Ct. 1255, 43 L.Ed.2d 541 (1975); <em>United States v.
