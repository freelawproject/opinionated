Bustos alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that El Paso Narcotics Division Detective Ruben Trejo initiated a traffic stop of his van on the orders of Detective Cesar Diaz, despite lack of probable cause. He also alleged that Detective John Mas\u00edas made false statements in an affidavit regarding marijuana that was found in his van during the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">By moving to proceed IFP, Bustos is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(3). Our review of the record indicates that Bustos\u2019s allegations state a claim under the Fourth Amendment. <em>See e.g., Estep v. Dallas County, Texas, </em>310 F.3d 353, 356 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir. 2002). Whether the facts ultimately will prove a Fourth Amendment claim is not a question to be answered at this stage of the proceedings. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Accordingly, the motion to proceed IFP is GRANTED. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Bustos\u2019s claims against the El Paso Police Department Narcotics Division and the City of El Paso, and its dismissal of any claims against district attorneys Esparza and Lytle, are affirmed. As to Bustos\u2019s claim that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated when Detectives Trejo and Diaz conducted a traffic stop without probable cause, the judgment and certification decision are VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">IFP GRANTED; AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
