Calderon (Calderon) on appeal, has requested leave to withdraw and has filed a brief as required by <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Calderon, who was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to commit kidnaping and kidnaping and aiding and abetting, received a copy of counsel\u2019s motion and has filed a response. Calderon has also filed a motion for leave to amend his response and has requested that the court appoint new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-24\">Our independent review of counsel\u2019s brief, Calderon\u2019s response, and the record discloses no issue of arguable merit for appeal. Accordingly, Calderon\u2019s motion for leave to amend his response to counsel\u2019s <em>Anders\u2019 </em>brief is GRANTED; Calderon\u2019s motion for appointment of new counsel is DENIED. Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
