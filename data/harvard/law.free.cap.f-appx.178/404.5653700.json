He argues that the sentences imposed, each of which constituted a downward deviation from the advisory guideline range of 78-98 months of imprisonment, are unreasonable. Martinez contends that the district court erroneously refused to consider all the factors mandated by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) when declining to depart further downward based on Martinez\u2019s adverse childhood circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-22\">The district court thoroughly articulated its reasons for imposing non-Guideline sentences in this case. <em>See United States v. Duhon, </em>440 F.3d 711, 715 (5th Cir.2006). In fashioning the sentences, the district court properly considered the advisory guideline range and the sentencing factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>The sentences imposed do not fail to account for any sentencing factor that should have received significant weight. <em>Id. </em>The district court did not rely on any irrelevant or improper factors in determining the appropriate sentences. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the district court\u2019s balancing of the sentencing factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) does not represent a clear error of judgment. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the non-Guideline sentences imposed in this case are reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-23\">Martinez also argues, for the first time on appeal, that the district court lacked jurisdiction to convict and sentence him because 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Martinez acknowledges that he is raising this issue to preserve it for Supreme Court review. This issue is foreclosed by our opinion in <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b430-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
