Rivere avers that the district court erroneously departed upward and that the extent of the departure was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-28\">Rivere has not shown that the district court\u2019s decision to upwardly depart at sentencing was either unreasonable or an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Simkanin, </em>420 F.3d 397, 416 (5th Cir. 2005); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 489 (5th Cir.2005). The district court\u2019s decision to depart was grounded in an acceptable basis. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Further, the departure itself was acceptable with respect to both percentage and magnitude. <em>See Smith, </em>417 F.3d at 492. Consequently, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b471-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
