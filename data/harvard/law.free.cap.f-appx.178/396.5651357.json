Lizama-Diaz moves for appointment of new counsel based on his current court-appointed attorney\u2019s decision not to file a reply brief in this case. The motion is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-23\">Lizama-Diaz argues that his sentence is unreasonable and is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) because the court did not consider his rehabilitation. He does not challenge the district court\u2019s calculation of his guidelines sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-24\">A sentence, such as Lizama-Diaz\u2019s, \u201cwithin a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). In the district court\u2019s written Statement of Reasons it noted that it considered, in part, \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d which would have encompassed any rehabilitation on Lizama-Diaz\u2019s part. Lizama-Diaz has failed to demonstrate that his properly calculated guidelines sentence was unreasonable. <em>See id.; United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-26\">Lizama-Diaz also argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). His constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Lizama-Diaz contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Lizama-Diaz properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b422-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
