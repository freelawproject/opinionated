The only defence argued is that the plaintiff\u2019s automobile was an \u201coutlaw\u201d upon the highway because not registered as required by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 2, in that the application did not contain \u201ca statement of the name, place of residence and address of the applicant.\u201d It was agreed that the motor vehicle owned by the plaintiff was registered under the name \u201cEastman\u2019s Express.\u201d The application showed that in answer to the question \u201cIs this vehicle owned by you individually?\u201d the answer \u201cYes\u201d was made, that it was signed \u201cEastman\u2019s Express H. U. Brewer Prop,\u201d and that the mail address was \u201c93 Myrtle St. Melrose\u201d which is the address of the plaintiff. There was evidence tending to show that the plaintiff conducted business under the name Eastman\u2019s Express, that that was a registered trade name, that the plaintiff came by the business under that trade name, and that it was a name \u201cfrom ancient history.\u201d This evidence as a whole was readily susceptible of the meaning that the business was long and well known in the community by its trade name.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The burden of establishing the defence that the motor vehicle of the plaintiff was being operated upon the highway in violation of the statute respecting registration rested upon the defendant. <em>Conroy </em>v. <em>Mather, </em>217 Mass. 91. <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>217 Mass. 495, 497. <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>282 Mass. 49, 56. The evidence warranted a finding that the motor vehicle was registered under the trade name of the plaintiff as owner. <em>Crompton </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>216 Mass. 184. The plaintiff\u2019s own name as owner of the business conducted under the trade name was\" plainly shown upon the application for registration and therefore was a matter of public record accomplishing thereby the purposes of registration. <em>Koley </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>265 Mass. 601, 603. <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Lang, </em>268 Mass. 407, 409. The finding in favor of the plaintiff was justified by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>evidence. The motion for a directed verdict on the ground of illegal registration was denied rightly. <em>Janusis </em>v. <em>Long, </em>284 Mass. 403, 407-408. The case is distinguishable from <em>Fine </em>v. <em>Kahn, </em>270 Mass. 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
