With the check was delivered a deposit slip furnished by the plaintiff which listed this check and several others deposited at the same time. The deposit slip bore the printed statement: \u201cDepositors are Hereby Notified that Credits Entered in Their Accounts are Conditional and Not Final Until Items Deposited Have Been Collected.\u201d On the same day the defendant ordered the drawee, the Atlantic National Bank, to stop payment on the check. On the following day the drawee bank returned to the plaintiff the check, with a slip marked \u201cPayment stopped,\u201d and the plaintiff notified McReavey &amp; Co., Inc. \u201cWe charge your account and return for reason marked,\u201d the reason being \u201cPayment stopped.\u201d The check for $830 here in question was given by the defendant to McReavey &amp; Co., Inc. in exchange for two checks of that company also dated July 13, 1931, and aggregating $830. One of these checks which was for $50 was paid by the drawee, another bank. The other check which was for $780 and drawn on the plaintiff bank was not paid by it for the stated reason \u201cNot sufficient funds.\u201d The trial judge in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston found for the defendant, refused to give certain rulings requested by the plaintiff and reported his action thereon to the Appellate Division where the report was dismissed. The plaintiff appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s declaration alleges that its depositor, the payee named in the check, \u201cbefore delivery of said check to the plaintiff, for a valuable consideration, endorsed said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>check to the plaintiff.\u201d It has here brought suit not as agent of the payee, so that any defences as between payee and maker would here be open, but as absolute owner of the instrument. The trial judge found that the plaintiff gave no value for the check. He refused to give the plaintiff\u2019s third request: \u201cOn all the evidence, the plaintiff is a holder in due course of the check sued on.\u201d Among the conditions which must exist in order that one be a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument is that the instrument was taken \u201cfor value.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 107, \u00a7 75. On the evidence it could not be found that the other conditions necessary to make the plaintiff a holder in due course were here missing. The report recites that it contains all the evidence material to the questions presented. We treat the third request of the plaintiff as presenting the question whether on the record there was warrant for the finding by the judge that the plaintiff gave no value for the check. <em>(Reid </em>v. <em>Doherty, </em>273 Mass. 388.) What is hereinafter said makes it unnecessary to refer in detail to the other rulings of the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\">After the check here in question was deposited with the plaintiff, but on the same day, there was entered in the account of the depositor on the books of the bank a credit for the amount of the check. At the opening of business on that day the books of the bank showed that the account of the depositor was overdrawn; during that day checks drawn by the depositor were presented at the bank and paid, and at the close of the day the books showed no overdraft of the depositor\u2019s account because of the inclusion as a credit of the amount of the check. In these circumstances the plaintiff contends that the judge should have found that the bank furnished value for the check and became its beneficial as well as its legal owner. But in our opinion the judge was not bound to make such finding and there was evidence which warranted a contrary finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">A bank and its customer may by agreement define and limit the authority of the bank, and its title, in its dealings with a negotiable instrument deposited by the customer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>The ordinary right of a bank to set off a deposited negotiable instrument or its proceeds against a debt due or to become due from a customer, sometimes referred to as a \u201cbanker\u2019s lien,\u201d may be changed or eliminated by a contract between bank and customer. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Boylston National Bank, </em>129 Mass. 358, 359. <em>Furber </em>v. <em>Dane, </em>203 Mass. 108, 117. <em>Prudential Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Banks, </em>241 Mass. 277, 279. <em>Pizer </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>250 Mass. 498, 503. In this Commonwealth, by an agreement that the authority of a bank is limited to the \u201ccollection\u201d of a deposited negotiable instrument, until payment of the instrument its title may be only a legal and not a beneficial title. <em>Moors </em>v. <em>Goddard, </em>147 Mass. 287. <em>Manufacturers\u2019 National Bank </em>v. <em>Continental Bank, </em>148 Mass. 553. <em>Freeman\u2019s National Bank </em>v. <em>National Tube Works Co. </em>151 Mass. 413. <em>Haskell </em>v. <em>Avery, </em>181 Mass. 106. In the absence of any express or implied agreement to the contrary, a bank, upon receiving from its customer as a deposit the check of a third person, may by giving credit therefor to the customer and permitting the credit to be drawn upon become the absolute owner of the check. <em>Salem Elevator Works, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Banks, </em>252 Mass. 366, and cases cited. <em>Shawmut National Bank </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>168 Mass. 425. But the parties concerned, the bank and its customer, may make an agreement to the contrary. \u201cWhere checks are not finally credited to the account of a customer until collected, where the customer cannot as of right draw against checks until collected, and where checks are entered in the accounts of customers subject to payment, the collecting bank acts only as agent of the customer. The relation of debtor and creditor does not arise until the check has been collected.\u201d <em>Salem Elevator Works, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Banks, </em>252 Mass. 366, 371, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\">In the present case the check was indorsed by the payee, the customer, \u201cFor deposit only to the credit\u201d of the customer. It was delivered to the bank with other checks, all listed on a deposit slip furnished by the bank which bore the words: \u201cDepositors are Hereby Notified that Credits Entered in Their Accounts are Conditional and Not Final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Until Items Deposited Have Been Collected.\u201d There was no evidence tending to indicate an intention at the time of deposit that the customer would be permitted as of right to draw checks against, or that the bank might apply to any overdraft on its books, any credit other than a final one after collection, or evidence of any course of dealings between bank and customer, or any usage of banks in a like situation. The credit of $830, the amount of the check, entered on the customer\u2019s account on the day of its deposit was on the following day \u201ccharged off \u201d by the entry of a debit of $830 and the customer was notified that such charge had been made because payment of the check had been stopped. The effect of this is that there never was a final credit to the customer\u2019s account of the amount of the check and, at the time the suit was brought and now, no existing credit of that amount to the customer on the books of the bank. In the circumstances disclosed by the evidence it cannot be said that the judge was obliged to find that this was the ordinary situation where the bank and its customer make no contract with reference to the subject and that there was not warrant for the finding that there was an agreement between the bank and its customer to the effect that the bank took the check for the limited purpose of collecting its proceeds and that it had no authority to charge against the temporary entry of credit the amount of the customer\u2019s overdraft and the checks of the customer which were presented for payment. The findings of the judge that the plaintiff did not have such title to the check as would permit a suit by it as absolute owner and that it did not furnish value for the check were warranted and there was no error in refusing to rule that \u201cOn all the evidence, the plaintiff is a holder in due course of the check sued on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
