Grant, Senior District Judge of the Northern District of Indiana, is sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1039-12\">COFFEY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AWmv\">Defendant-appellant, Janyce Carter, appeals her conviction and sentence in the United States District Court, Northern District of Illinois, for participating in an unauthorized loan of postage stamps and an attempt to conceal such loan, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1711, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2073, 2. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-14\">As of April 15, 1982, Janyce Carter had worked for the United States Postal Service for sixteen years. In August of 1980 Carter was assigned to the Irving Park Postal Station, Chicago, Illinois, as a distribution window clerk. Her responsibilities included the selling of stamps and the performing of other postal transactions with the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-19\">Prior to beginning her duties as a distribution window clerk, Carter attended a two-day training seminar to review the procedure used in conducting window transactions and to learn her responsibilities in accounting for postal funds. As part of the program Carter received and signed a Public Funds Statement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Carter also received a supply of stamps and cash known as her stamp credit. In acknowledgement of this stamp credit, Carter signed a fixed credit receipt which provided, in part, \u201cwithdrawal of fiscal funds for personal use, whether temporary or permanent, may subject employees ... to removal from office, ... and criminal prosecution for violation of Title 18, Section 641 or 1711 United States Code.\u201d Carter also received a Daily Financial Report form which the Postal Service requires each distribution window clerk to use in recording the \u201cstamp sales, ... the various transactions conducted by the window clerk and the cash they have received incident to those transactions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-20\">Though Daily Financial Reports are completed and filed on a daily basis, audits occur periodically. The Postal Service, through its Postal Supervisors, audits each distribution window clerk three or four times a year to determine if their stamp credit is within certain tolerance levels.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If a distribution window clerk\u2019s stamp credit exceeds the tolerance level allowed, the clerk must repay the excess amount to the Postal Service and await a decision by Postal authorities as to whether or not a suspension is in order. Internal audits are also performed by the Chicago Post Office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>through Postal System Examiners on a surprise basis or upon the request of a supervisor. Postal authorities attempt to conduct audits without the knowledge of the various window clerks, but, because the audits are made on a somewhat regular basis and because of the employees\u2019 rumor mill, clerks usually know of the audits in advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">The evidence at trial revealed that on the morning of April 15, 1981, Carter learned that she was to be audited by Postal authorities. Carter immediately phoned Anna Shelby, a distribution window clerk at the Wicker Park Postal Station, Chicago, Illinois, and asked for a stamp loan in order that she (Carter) might cover her stamp credit deficiency.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During the lunch hour on April 15, 1981, Shelby loaned Carter $4,500.00 worth of stamps. That evening, a Postal System Examiner audited Carter\u2019s Daily Financial Report and despite the $4,500.00 \u201cstamp loan\u201d earlier in the day, the Examiner still found that Carter had a deficit of $1,137.48. Carter agreed to repay this amount to the Postal Service. Later that evening Shelby phoned Carter to determine when the stamps would be returned. Carter informed Shelby that because Carter expected more audits in the next few weeks, she could not return the stamps immediately. During the next three months Shelby frequently phoned Carter asking for return of the stamps and was repeatedly told that Carter was unable to return them at that time. Carter on one occasion stated that she was attempting to secure a loan in order to repay the amount in money rather than stamps. During the period in question Shelby was falsifying her Daily Financial Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">In late July of 1981, Shelby learned that Postal Systems Examiners were going to audit the Wicker Park Postal Station. When she informed Carter of this audit, Carter again refused to return Shelby\u2019s stamps. Shelby, in turn, borrowed $4,500.00 worth of stamps from Shirley McNeary and \u201ccame up clear\u201d on the audit. Shortly thereafter, Shelby returned the borrowed stamps to McNeary. A week later the Postal Supervisors conducted their own audit and determined that Shelby\u2019s Daily Financial Report showed a $4,500.00 deficit. Shelby was placed on an immediate emergency suspension (twenty-nine days). On August 24, 1981, Shelby informed Postal Inspector- Hull, an investigator for the United States Postal Service, that the reason for her $4,500.00 deficit was the previous stamp loan to Carter. Shelby, at that time, agreed to cooperate with the Postal Service in an effort to apprehend Carter. Pursuant to the agreement, Postal authorities taped phone conversations between Shelby and Carter on September 1, 2, and 6 of 1981. On September 6, 1981, the following conversation took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-8\">Shelby \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not paying it, okay, okay, then okay. I won\u2019t pay it .... Listen okay, well I won\u2019t pay any attention to them. What I\u2019m saying is tomorrow is even a holiday and they\u2019re even talking about bringing me downtown, okay? What I\u2019m saying to you is I loaned them to you in good faith, right? Huh?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-9\">Carter \u2014 \u201cYes, Ann.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-10\">Shelby \u2014 \u201cHuh?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-11\">Carter \u2014 \u201cYes, yes Ann.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1040-12\">Following this conversation the Government called for a Federal Grand Jury investigation and on April 14, 1982, the Grand Jury issued a three count indictment against Carter for the following: (1) conspiring to participate in the unauthorized loaning of postage stamps in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371; (2) advising and participating in the unauthorized loaning of postage stamps in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1711; and (3) willfully concealing the unauthorized loan in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2073, 2. At trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts. The trial judge sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>fenced Carter to two concurrent seven-year terms in the custody of the Attorney General on counts II and III of the indictment, to be followed by a five year probationary period as to count I of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"APL\">On appeal, Carter contends:</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-4\">(A) That the agreement required to violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1711 precludes a finding of conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1711 as alleged in count I of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">(B) That the Government\u2019s evidence to convict under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2073 failed to show appellant\u2019s knowledge and, therefore, could not support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-6\">(C) That the district court abused its discretion by allowing the Government to elicit testimony concerning a \u201cNSF\u201d check for $1,800.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-7\">(D) That the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, which speculated as to why appellant had changed her previous testimony, constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-8\">(E) That the trial judge\u2019s sentencing constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-9\">We shall consider these issues individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-11\">A. CONSPIRACY AND THE SUBSTANTIVE OFFENSE</p>\n<p id=\"Atu\">Appellant claims that count I of the Government\u2019s indictment alleges that Janyce Carter conspired to participate in the unauthorized loaning of postage stamps in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1711. Appellant reasons that the substantive offense, an unauthorized loaning of postage stamps, requires an agreement between two parties, namely the lender and the borrower, and thus precludes a charge of conspiracy based upon the same agreement. Relying upon <em>Pinkerton v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 640, 643, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 1181, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946), appellant contends that the agreement which is the subject of the substantive offense cannot be used as the basis for a finding of conspiracy where there is no ingredient in the conspiracy not present in the completed crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-18\">We do not reach this issue for two reasons. First, appellant\u2019s failure to present this legal issue to the district court results in a waiver of that issue on appeal. As this court has stated on numerous occasions, \u201cit is a well-established general proposition that a litigant cannot present to this court as a ground for reversal an issue which was not presented to the trial court and which it, therefore, had no opportunity to decide.\u201d <em>Holleman v. Duckworth, </em>700 F.2d 391, 394-95 (7th Cir.1983). <em>See also Textile Banking Co., Inc. v. Rentschler, </em>657 F.2d 844, 853 (7th Cir.1981), <em>United States ex rel. Moore v. Brierton, </em>560 F.2d 288, 291 (7th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1088, 98 S.Ct. 1285, 55 L.Ed.2d 794 (1978). Because the 753 page trial record and accompanying pleadings are void of any argument even resembling appellant\u2019s contention that the substantive offense and the conspiracy merge, we do not reach this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-19\">Second, even if the issue were properly before us a complete reading of count I of the indictment reveals that the conspiracy \u201cto knowingly participate in the unauthorized loaning of ... postage stamps\u201d not only included participation in the unauthorized loaning of postage stamps, but also included concealing the unauthorized loan and thereby defrauding the United States Postal Service.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1042-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>Count I of the indictment, when read in its entirety, thus alleges that Carter agreed to conceal the unauthorized loan by causing Shelby to falsely enter $8,164.02 as the \u201cClosing Balance\u201d on her May 1, 1981 Daily Financial Report. Appellant makes no argument that a conspiracy to conceal a loan cannot exist. In fact, such a conspiracy satisfies the test set forth by the United States Supreme Court for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. <em>Hammerschmidt v. United States, </em>265 U.S. 182, 188, 44 S.Ct. 511, 512, 68 L.Ed. 968 (1924). That being so, we hold that count I of the indictment does allege facts sufficient to fulfill the requirements of a conspiracy and we need not reach appellant\u2019s contention that a conspiracy to make an unauthorized loan merges into the substantive offense of making the unauthorized loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-4\">B. KNOWLEDGE REQUIREMENT FOR 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2073<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1042-5\">Appellant next contends that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to prove that she \u201cwillfully and with intent to deceive\u201d caused Anna Shelby to make a false entry in Shelby\u2019s Daily Financial Report for May 1, 1981, in the amount of $8,164.02. Appellant claims that to prove this allegation the Government had to show that Janyce Carter knew that on May 1, 1981, Anna Shelby covered her stamp credit shortage by entering a false \u201cClosing Bal-anee\u201d on her Daily Financial Report. Appellant further claims that the Government\u2019s failure to prove such knowledge renders the jury\u2019s conviction on this count improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-10\">We conclude, based upon a review of the record, that the evidence does support a conviction for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2073, 2. It is a well-established principle of Federal law that when the sufficiency of evidence in a criminal conviction is questioned, the reviewing tribunal examines the record in the light most favorable to the government. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). It is not our prerogative to retry the case, weigh the evidence, or assess the credibility of witnesses. <em>United States v. Miles, </em>401 F.2d 65, 67 (7th Cir. 1968). The verdict will not be disturbed if substantial evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom support the action of the jury. <em>United States v. Grabiec, </em>563 F.2d 313, 316 (7th Cir.1977); <em>United States v. Isaacs, </em>493 F.2d 1124, 1146 (7th Cir.) <em>cert. denied sub nom. Kerner v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 976, 94 S.Ct. 3183, 41 L.Ed.2d 1146, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>418 U.S. 955, 94 S.Ct. 3234, 41 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-11\">Count III of the indictment charges that Carter did \u201caid, abet and cause Anna Shelby ... to make a false entry in her Daily Financial Report.\u201d Carter\u2019s knowledge of this false entry can be gleaned from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>trial record. Carter was a distribution window clerk and knew that all stamps and sales had to be accounted for in Anna Shelby\u2019s Daily Financial Report. She also knew that the unauthorized loaning of stamps between employees was illegal and carried the threat of criminal prosecution. To prevent Postal authorities from discovering this unauthorized \u201cstamp loan\u201d and possibly pressing criminal charges, Shelby either had to alter her Daily Financial Report or replenish the amount of the deficit in stamps, cash, or a combination thereof from another source. In contrast to appellant\u2019s claim of insufficiency of the evidence, Shelby did not choose to replenish the amount of the deficit, as evidenced by her statement, \u201cWell, Janyce, you know, I\u2019m lying about these forms ever[y] day that I fill them out.\u201d Carter knew of Shelby\u2019s actions as evidenced by her response, \u201cEverything is going to be all right. We are going to get it straight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">Based upon this testimony the jury could have reasonably inferred that defendant Carter knew that Shelby falsified her Daily Financial Report on May 1,1981. Thus, the verdict will not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-6\">We also note that though defense counsel made a motion for judgment of acquittal at the conclusion of the Government\u2019s case-in-chief, he failed to renew that motion at the close of trial, in motions after verdict, or within seven days of the jury\u2019s verdict as provided for in Fed.R.Crim.Pro. 29(c). Thus it was not incumbent upon this Court to review the sufficiency of the evidence presented at trial. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Berardi, </em>675 F.2d 894, 902 n. 16 (7th Cir. 1982); <em>United States v. Moorman, </em>358 F.2d 31, 33-34 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 866, 87 S.Ct. 127, 17 L.Ed.2d 93 (1966); <em>United States v. Childress, </em>347 F.2d 448, 451 (7th Cir.1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>384 U.S. 1012, 86 S.Ct. 1936, 16 L.Ed.2d 1030 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-7\">C. ABUSE OF DISCRETION</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-8\">Appellant next contends that testimony about a $1,800.50 \u201cNSF\u201d check insinuated that Carter fraudulently drafted and forged the \u201cNSF\u201d check. Appellant claims that the trial judge\u2019s admission of Inspector Hull\u2019s testimony and the prosecutor\u2019s questions of Carter on cross-examination prejudiced the jury and deprived her of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-10\">On cross-examination of Inspector Hull, an investigator for the United States Postal Service, defense counsel asked if Carter was ever required to pay back to the United States Postal Service $1,800.50 for a \u201cNSF\u201d check. Inspector Hull answered in the affirmative. On redirect examination, the prosecutor questioned Inspector Hull concerning the circumstances surrounding the \u201cNSF\u201d check. Inspector Hull testified that on January 23, 1981, Carter accepted a check from Mary E. Lee and that \u201cvery seldom do we get a personal check for the purchase of stamp stock of that size.\u201d Due to the abnormal size of the check, Inspector Hull conducted an investigation which revealed that Carter knew Mary E. Lee, the alleged check maker.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-11\">On direct examination of Carter, her defense counsel again made mention of the \u201cNSF\u201d check and questioned Carter about her repayment of the $1,800.50 to the United States Postal Service. On cross-examination, the prosecutor questioned Carter concerning her relationship with Mary E. Lee, the alleged check maker. Carter testified that she knew a \u201cMary Cook\u201d but that she did not know a Mary E. Lee. The prosecutor then asked if \u201cMary Cook is actually Mary Lee?\u201d Carter replied, \u201cThat is what Mr. Hull said.\u201d Finally, the prosecutor, implying that Mary E. Lee and Mary Cook were the same person and that Carter knew of Mary E. Lee\u2019s checkbook, asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t know if she [Mary Cook] left a checkbook ... in the name of Mary Lee?\u201d To this Carter replied \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-12\">Based upon this testimony, appellant claims that the Government insinuated that Carter fraudulently cashed the check, thereby prejudicing the jury and denying appellant a fair trial. Our review of the admissibility of this testimony is guided by the well-established principle that a trial judge has broad discretion in assessing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>relevancy of the testimony proffered. We will reverse a district court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence only upon a clear showing of an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge. <em>United States </em>v. <em>West, </em>670 F.2d 675, 682 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. King v. United States, </em>457 U.S. 1124, 102 S.Ct. 2944, 73 L.Ed.2d 1340 (1982); <em>United States v. Lampson, </em>627 F.2d 62, 66 (7th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">Appellant initially claims that the Government had no right to elicit testimony concerning the \u201cNSF\u201d check. Appellant admits, however, that her defense counsel initiated inquiry into the subject matter of the check while cross-examining a Government witness. In a similar situation, this court stated, \u201cWhen a party opens up a subject, even though it may not be strictly relevant to the case, he cannot complain on appeal if the opposing party introduces evidence on the same subject.\u201d <em>United States v. Bolin, </em>514 F.2d 554, 558 (7th Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">By initiating the inquiry into the $1,800.50 \u201cNSF\u201d check, on cross-examination of a Government witness and on direct examination of Carter, defense counsel \u201copened the door\u201d for the Government to elicit and develop testimony which fully advised the jury of all the facts surrounding the making and cashing of the \u201cNSF\u201d check. <em>United States v. Cavale, </em>688 F.2d 1098, 1112 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 380, 74 L.Ed.2d 513 (1982); <em>United States v. Lynch, </em>699 F.2d 839, 844 (7th Cir.1982). A party cannot be permitted on one hand to introduce evidence which appears favorable and then complain, after the circumstances are fully developed, because that evidence becomes detrimental to his cause.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Clearly the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-9\">Appellant next claims that the \u201cinsinuating\u201d evidence elicited by the Government on redirect examination of Inspector Hull constituted hearsay, and therefore, was inadmissible. On redirect examination Inspector Hull testified that an investigation of the \u201cNSF\u201d check revealed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-14\">\u201c... that the Mary Lee on the check lived in Oak Park, the same city in which Janyce Carter lived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-15\">We investigated and found out, were able to determine that in fact Mary E. Lee knew Janyce Carter. This was corroborated by another witness by the name of Tina Chandler.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-16\">Tina Chandler, Mary Lee and Janyce Carter were all friends.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1044-17\">Appellant takes the position that Inspector Hull had no personal knowledge of Carter\u2019s relationship with Mary E. Lee. The record, in fact, contains no mention of how Inspector Hull obtained this information despite an ample opportunity for the defendant, if tactically chosen, to question Inspector Hull concerning this subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-18\">Pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 801(c), hearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. <em>United States v. Gandara, </em>586 F.2d 1156, 1158 (7th Cir.1978). In the above testimony, the only statement not made by the declarant (Inspector Hull) is Tina Chandler\u2019s corroboration of Inspector Hull\u2019s investigative determination that Mary E. Lee and Carter knew one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-19\">Though Tina Chandler\u2019s statement that Mary E. Lee knew Janyce Carter constitutes hearsay, its admissibility is harmless error due to the cumulative nature of the testimony. <em>United States v. Lee, </em>413 F.2d 910, 914 (7th Cir.1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 1022, 90 S.Ct. 595, 24 L.Ed.2d 515 (1970). First, Tina Chandler\u2019s corroborative statement serves as cumulative testimony to support Inspector Hull\u2019s investigative determination that Carter knew Mary E. Lee. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>Second, Tina Chandler\u2019s corroborative statement could support Carter\u2019s own testimony that she knew a \u201cMary Cook.\u201d When questioned as to whether Mary Cook and Mary E. Lee were the same person, Carter responded, \u201cThat is what Mr. [Inspector] Hull said.\u201d Inspector Hull, however, never stated that \u201cMary Cook\u201d and Mary E. Lee were the same person and he never even referred to a \u201cMary Cook\u201d in his testimony. Carter\u2019s inaccurate response, \u201cThat is what Mr. Hull said,\u201d reveals that Carter herself was associating Mary E. Lee with \u201cMary Cook.\u201d If the jury, based upon Carter\u2019s testimony, believed \u201cMary Cook\u201d and Mary E. Lee to be the same person, then Tina Chandler\u2019s corroborative statement would do nothing more than support that belief. Accordingly, we hold that, in light of the entire record, Tina Chandler\u2019s statement was merely cumulative and its admission does not rise to the level of reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-4\">Appellant finally claims that the cross-examination of Carter concerning the \u201cNSF\u201d check was improper in that it attempted to show that Carter fraudulently drafted and forged the \u201cNSF\u201d check. Defense counsel, however, as we pointed out earlier, initiated the inquiry into the \u201cNSF\u201d check during his direct examination of Carter. On cross-examination, the prosecutor properly reviewed the same subject matter covered on direct examination and questioned Carter concerning the \u201cNSF\u201d check, including her relationship with the check maker, Mary E. Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">The rule is that a witness may not be impeached by a contradiction on collateral matters elicited on cross-examination. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>542 F.2d 1283, 1306 (7th Cir.1976) (citing <em>United States v. Lam</em>bert, 463 F.2d 552, 557 (7th Cir.1972)). In this instance the Government accepted Carter\u2019s answers concerning the collateral matter of Carter\u2019s relationship with Mary E. Lee and proceeded with cross-examination. The Government did not attempt to impeach Carter\u2019s testimony on this issue through the use of its own witness. For this reason, we hold that the Government\u2019s cross-examination of Carter was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-6\">D. CLOSING ARGUMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-7\">Appellant next contends that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, attacking Carter\u2019s credibility and speculating as to why she changed her previous testimony, prejudiced the jury thus constituting reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-8\">To place the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in their proper context we must briefly review the testimony at trial. On direct examination of Carter, defense counsel attempted to establish that Carter used public transportation and that on April 15, 1981, it would have been physically impossible for Carter to have boarded public transportation at the Irving Park Postal Station, travel twenty-two blocks south and thirty-three blocks east to the Wicker Park Postal Station, receive stamps from Anna Shelby, and return on public transportation to her window clerk position all within a one-hour lunch period. To this end Carter testified that during this period she did not drive to work but that she used public transportation, though she did have access to her boyfriend\u2019s automobile on Saturday. Later in her direct examination, Carter attempted to explain her earlier testimony and stated that she had registered the title to her boyfriend\u2019s automobile in her name. She testified that because her boyfriend was changing jobs at the time of purchase, it was easier for her to obtain financing. According to Carter, \u201cHe gave me the down payment and he pays the notes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-9\">In closing argument the prosecutor commented on this testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-10\">\u201cJanyce Carter at lunchtime went over to the Wicker Park Station, picked up the stamps.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-11\">You remember Janyce Carter testified first of all it was impossible for her to get those because she was taking a bus at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-12\">Well, she testified in the morning she was taking the bus. Later on she realized that the government had documents showing she just bought a new car and then she changed her story. She bought a car in her own name with financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>problems, a loan in her own name just for her boyfriend. She had no access to that car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">Think about this testimony, people, and think about who has an interest to lie.\u201d In rebuttal, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-5\">\u201c... she didn\u2019t lie in the morning and say she had no car and then look at her documents and realize I could impeach her on that, and come back and change her story. She didn\u2019t lie about that either, did she?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">Defense counsel failed or decided not to object to these remarks during trial or request any curative instructions. In the absence of any objection, our review of the closing argument is limited to determining whether or not the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were so prejudicial as to amount to plain error.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>United States v. </em>West, 670 F.2d at 688; <em>United States v. Spain, </em>536 F.2d 170, 174 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 833, 97 S.Ct. 96, 50 L.Ed.2d 97 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-7\">To determine whether the prosecutor\u2019s comments were so egregious as to require reversal, we must ask whether the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASyx\">\u201cstatements were so inflammatory and prejudicial to the defendant petitioner as to deprive him of a fair trial and thus deprive him of his liberty without due process of law as proscribed by the Fourteenth' Amendment. The standard for the court to apply in making a determination of whether the petitioner was afforded a fair trial is [by] jurisprudential necessity a broad one.... [E]ach case must be decided on its unique facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A23\"><em>United States v. Zylstra, </em>713 F.2d 1332 at 1339 (7th Cir.1983); <em>United States ex rel. Clark v. Fike, </em>538 F.2d 750, 760 (7th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1064, 97 S.Ct. 791, 50 L.Ed.2d 781 (1977). \u201cIt is thus necessary to examine the allegedly prejudicial remarks of the prosecutor in the context of the trial as a whole.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Garcia v. Lane, </em>698 F.2d 900, 902 (7th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-11\">Placing the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in their proper context, the record reveals that at that point in his closing and rebuttal arguments the prosecutor was impressing upon the jury the credibility of Anna Shelby.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Her \u201cstory\u201d had remained consistent throughout the trial. The prosecutor pointed out that Carter\u2019s \u201cstory\u201d about access to a car had changed and that Shelby was a more believable witness because her testimony was also supported by documents. The thrust of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was that Anna Shelby was a more credible witness than the appellant. <em>See, e.g., United States ex rel. Garcia v. Lane, </em>698 F.2d at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-12\">The prosecutor may in argument suggest reasonable inferences from the evidence previously admitted. <em>United States v. McPartlin, </em>595 F.2d 1321, 1360 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 833, 100 S.Ct. 65, 62 L.Ed.2d 43 (1979). Though the Government never introduced a proof of title evidencing Carter\u2019s car ownership, the prosecutor did ask Carter, \u201cBeginning March of 1981, you had just purchased a new car in your name, hadn\u2019t you, a 1979 Thunderbird?\u201d This question, which was answered in the affirmative, reveals that the Government knew when the automobile was purchased and that it was a 1979 Thunderbird. With these facts before them, a jury could reasonably infer that the Government knew of Carter\u2019s car ownership thus causing Carter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>to change her \u201cstory.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Though we may have tempered our remarks in closing argument so as to avoid even the suggestion of prejudice, the prosecutor\u2019s comments, herein, fail to rise to the level of plain error.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">E. SENTENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">Appellant finally contends that the trial judge imposed an improper sentence. The sentence consisted of the imposition of two concurrent seven year terms under the supervision of the Attorney General for violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1711 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2073, 2, followed by a five year probationary period for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. The statutes in question provide as follows: one who violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1711 is to be fined equal to the sum of the amount of the money embezzled or imprisoned not more than ten years or both; one who violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2073 is to be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years or both; and one who violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 is to be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned five years or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">We deal briefly with this issue, as the law is well-established that a sentence within the statutory maximum provided by Congress is only subject to review on appeal for manifest abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Fleming, </em>671 F.2d 1002, 1004 (7th Cir. 1982); <em>United States v. Madison, </em>689 F.2d 1300, 1312 (7th Cir.1982), <em>cert. </em>denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 754, 74 L.Ed.2d 971 (1983); <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>669 F.2d 446, 466 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Bledsoe v. United States, </em>456 U.S. 934, 102 S.Ct. 1989, 72 L.Ed.2d 454 (1982); <em>United States v. Main, </em>598 F.2d 1086, 1094 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 943, 100 S.Ct. 301, 62 L.Ed.2d 311 (1979). In accord with <em>United States v. Grayson, </em>438 U.S. 41, 98 S.Ct. 2610, 57 L.Ed.2d 582 (1978), the trial judge observed Carter throughout the trial, heard the testimony of witnesses, reviewed and analyzed Carter\u2019s presentence report, and listened to defense counsel\u2019s arguments. Based upon these factors the trial judge, in a detailed and well-reasoned sentencing report, imposed a sentence upon Carter. The sentence imposed is within the statutory maximum, thus there exists no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-16\">We affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence of Janyce Carter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1039-16\">. Inspector Hull, an investigator for the United States Postal Service, testified that \u201cthe purpose [of the Public Funds Statement] is to insure that the employees are aware of their responsibilities relative to the handling of pub-lie funds and to insure that they handle them properly, that they can\u2019t use, [sic] convert them to their own use in any manner.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1039-22\">. The United States Postal Service tolerance levels range from $10.00 to $50.00, depending on the size of the stamp credit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1040-6\">. Shelby testified that Carter had contacted Shelby in early April, claiming that she (Carter) was roughly $5,000.00 short in stamps. The reason for Carter contacting Shelby was that in the fall of 1980 Carter had loaned $900.00 worth of stamps to Shelby, so that she (Shelby) could clear an audit. Shelby testified that she did in fact return the $900.00 worth of stamps to Carter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1041-12\">. Count I of the indictment provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-13\">\u201cOVERT ACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-14\">1. <em>The Grand Jury realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Counts Two and Three of this indictment, each count designated herein as a separate and distinct overt act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1041-15\">2.

At side bar, defense counsel made a motion <em>in limine </em>when the Government, on redirect examination of Inspector Hull, went into the circumstances surrounding the check. The court responded to defense counsel\u2019s motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-20\">\u201cYou asked about this check.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1044-21\">The Government replied,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-22\">\u201cThe Government didn\u2019t bring that up and we had no intention of bringing it up.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1046-8\">. \u201cWe do not hold that the error was waived because we recognize the tactical considerations that militate against interrupting an adversary\u2019s closing argument. We are inclined to believe, however, that if the comment were sufficiently prejudicial to warrant reversal, counsel who was present at the time either would have objected forthwith or else would have requested the trial judge to give a curative instruction. There was opportunity after argument, and before the court instructed the jury, to make such a request. The absence of any such request tends to corroborate our appraisal of the probable impact of the remark as minimal.\u201d <em>United States v. Trutenko, </em>490 F.2d 678, 680 (7th Cir. 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1046-14\">. Unlike the facts in <em>Berger v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 89, 55 S.Ct. 629, 633, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935), the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were confined to a single instance, in closing and in rebuttal, concerning witness credibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1047-11\">. Additionally, the instruction to the jury provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-12\">\u201copening statements, closing arguments, and other statements of counsel should be disregarded by you to the extent that they are not supported by the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1047-13\">. We remind Government counsel of footnote 13 in <em>United States v. Falk, </em>605 F.2d 1005, 1013 (7th Cir.1979). \u201cWhile we have concluded that the Government\u2019s closing argument does not require a reversal in this case, once again we admonish Government counsel to observe recognized standards in their closing arguments. <em>See, e.g. </em>American Bar Association Standards Relating To The Prosecution Function and particularly Section 5.8 Argument to the Jury. Failure of Government counsel to observe proper standards in their closing arguments has resulted, all too frequently, in this court\u2019s devoting substantial time to reviewing the record to determine the probable effect of the improper argument. It may well in some case result in a reversal which could have been avoided by adherence to proper standards.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
