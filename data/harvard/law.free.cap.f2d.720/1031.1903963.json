The Union also contends that the Board abused its discretion by imposing a new back-pay remedy in its order against the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-17\">The National Labor Relations Board\u2019s order is enforced. The Union waived any due process contentions it may have had by failing to raise them in its motion for reconsideration. <em>Garment Workers </em>v. <em>Quality Mfg. Co., </em>420 U.S. 276, 281 n. 3, 95 S.Ct. 972, 975 n. 3, 43 L.Ed.2d 189 (1975). The Board did not abuse its discretion in determining that Butler was refused referral to a different bargaining unit. The Union failed to show that the employer in question unequivocally intended to belong to the multi-employer bargaining unit. <em>See N.L.R.B. </em>v. <em>New York Typographical Union, </em>632 F.2d 171, 183-84 (2d Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-18\">The Board did not abuse its discretion in awarding the back-pay remedy in the adjudication. Any doubt about the change in the back-pay rule was resolved by this court in <em>Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 Intern. Ass\u2019n v. N.L.R.B., </em>716 F.2d 1249 (9th Cir. 1983).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
