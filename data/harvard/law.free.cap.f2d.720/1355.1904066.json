The principal contention of the plaintiffs-appellants is that United States military officials have been introduced into situations in El Salvador where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances and, consequently, the President\u2019s failure to report to Congress is a violation of both the War Powers Resolution (\u201cWPR\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the war powers clause in the Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The appellants also alleged that violations of human rights by the Government of El Salvador are pervasive and that, in the absence of a certification of \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d by the President, United States military assistance to El Salvador violates the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (\u201cFAA\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In pursuing their claims, plaintiffs-appellants have sought, <em>inter alia, </em>an injunction directing that the appellees immediately withdraw all United States Armed Forces, weapons, military equipment and aid from El Salvador and prohibiting any further aid of any nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-20\">The District Court dismissed all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims without resolution of the merits of their suit. <em>Crockett v. Reagan, </em>558 F.Supp. 893 (D.D.C.1982). Judge Joyce Green held that the war powers issue presented a non justiciable political question. In particular, Judge Green found that the trial court did not have the resources or expertise to resolve the particular factual disputes involved in this case, <em>id. </em>at 898, 899, and that Congress had taken no action which would suggest that it viewed our involvement in El Salvador as subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>the WPR. <em>Id. </em>at 899. Judge Green\u2019s dismissal of the FAA claim was based on the equitable discretion doctrine, which counsels judicial restraint where \u00e1 congressional plaintiff\u2019s dispute is primarily with his or her fellow legislators. <em>Riegle v. Federal Open Market Committee, </em>656 F.2d 873, 881 (D.C.Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>454 U.S. 1082, 102 S.Ct. 636, 70 L.Ed.2d 616 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-4\">We have reviewed with care the parties\u2019 contentions and submissions and we can find no error in the judgment of the District Court. We therefore affirm the dismissal of this case for the reasons stated by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1452-13\">. 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1541-1548 (1976).

I continue to believe that an alleged diminution in congressional influence must amount to a disenfranchisement \u2014 a nullification or diminution of a congressman\u2019s vote \u2014 before a congressional plaintiff may claim the requisite injury-in-fact necessary to confer standing to sue. <em>See Vander Jagt v. O\u2019Neill, </em>699 F.2d 1166, 1180-81 &amp; n. 1 (D.C. Cir.1982) (Bork, J., concurring), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 91, 78 L.Ed.2d 98 (1983). <em>See also Goldwater v. Carter, </em>617 F.2d 697, 702 (D.C.Cir.) (en banc), <em>judgment vacated on other grounds, </em>444 U.S. 996, 100 S.Ct. 533, 62 L.Ed.2d 428 (1979). Congressional plaintiffs here have lost no part of their right to vote and thus have not suffered the \u201cjudicially cognizable injury,\u201d <em>Metcalf v. National Petroleum Council, </em>553 F.2d 176, 187 (D.C.Cir.1977), necessary to give them standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-11\">I also adhere to my view that separation-of-powers considerations are properly addressed as part of the standing requirement. In <em>Riegle v. Federal Open Market Committee, </em>656 F.2d 873, 879-80 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1082, 102 S.Ct. 636, 70 L.Ed.2d 616 (1981), a panel of this court concluded that separation-of-powers concerns have no bearing on standing analysis. Instead, the <em>Riegle </em>court created a \u201cdoctrine of equitable discretion\u201d within which those concerns would be addressed. 656 F.2d at 881. In <em>Vander Jagt, </em>the panel majority expanded the doctrine and assumed the virtually \u201cunconfined judicial power to decide or not to decide\u201d cases. 699 F.2d at 1185 (Bork, J., concurring). I do not consider myself bound by the panel decisions in <em>Riegle </em>and <em>Vander Jagt. </em>Prior to those cases, this circuit had worked out a \u201cfairly definite formula to relate separation-of-powers concerns to the problem of legislator standing.\u201d <em>Vander Jagt, </em>699 F.2d at 1180-81 (Bork, J., concurring). <em>Riegle </em>and <em>Vander Jagt </em>purported to change the law of legislator standing in this circuit without submitting the issue to the full court. Under the established practice of this court, that may not be done. <em>See Irons v. Diamond, </em>670 F.2d 265, 268 n. 11 (D.C.Cir. 1981).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
