Daniels (Daniels), an inmate at the Richmond City Jail, brought this section 1983 action against Deputy-Sheriff Andrew Williams (Williams) alleging that he was injured when he slipped and fell on a pillow negligently left on the stairs by Williams. The district court granted Williams\u2019s motion for summary judgment, reasoning that under <em>Parratt </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), Daniels\u2019s allegations failed to state a procedural due process claim because Virginia provided a meaningful postdeprivation remedy in the form of a common law negligence action. Daniels appeals on the grounds that <em>Par-ratt\u2019s </em>analysis concerning the adequacy of a postdeprivation remedy should not be applied to the deprivation of a nonproperty interest, and, even if it does apply, that the Virginia doctrine of sovereign immunity denies him an adequate postdeprivation remedy. We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Daniels\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">The plaintiff in <em>Parratt </em>alleged that he was deprived of property without due process of law when prison officials negligently lost his hobby kit. The Court agreed that the plaintiff had been deprived of property within the meaning of the fourteenth amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 536-537, 101 S.Ct. at 1913-1914. The Court held, however, that the plaintiff had not stated a claim for a violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. Rejecting the proposition that due process always requires a hearing before the initial property deprivation, Justice Rehnquist stated in a plurality opinion that a meaningful postdeprivation hearing satisfies the requirements of procedural due process in situations where the property deprivation does not result from established state procedure and the state cannot practically provide a meaningful predeprivation hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 540-541, 101 S.Ct. at 1915-1916. Applying this principle to the plaintiff\u2019s allegation that he was tortiously deprived of his property as a result of a state employee\u2019s random and unauthorized act, the Court concluded that the plaintiff was not deprived of property without due process of law because the state\u2019s statutory tort procedure provided him with a postdeprivation remedy that satisfied the requirements of procedural due process.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 543-544,101 S.Ct. at 1916-1917.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-14\">Like the plaintiff in <em>Parratt, </em>Daniels alleges that he was injured by the negligence of a state employee. Unlike in <em>Parratt, </em>Daniels\u2019s claim is for bodily injury rather than for the loss of personal property. \u201cLiberty\u201d within the meaning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>fourteenth amendment includes the right to be free from \u201cunjustified intrusions on personal security.\u201d <em>Ingraham v. Wright, </em>430 U.S. 651, 673, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 1413, 51 L.Ed.2d 711 (1977). Bodily injury resulting from a state official\u2019s negligence therefore deprives a person of a liberty interest protected by the fourteenth amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This case thus presents the question whether the <em>Parratt </em>analysis applies to nonproperty deprivations, such as a negligent deprivation of a liberty interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\"><em>Parratt </em>concerned a property interest; its scope, however, \u201ccannot easily be limited to negligent deprivations of property.\u201d <em>Palmer v. Hudson, </em>697 F.2d 1220, 1222 (4th Cir.1983), <em>cert. </em>granted, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 3535, 77 L.Ed.2d 1386 (1983). Because <em>Parratt\u2019s </em>underlying principle is that a postdeprivation hearing will satisfy procedural due process when there is no practical way to provide a predeprivation hearing, logic dictates that <em>Parratt </em>should also apply to a nonproperty deprivation for which a predeprivation hearing was impractical. Justice Rehnquist made no distinction in <em>Parratt </em>between property and nonproperty deprivations. Rather, the relevant distinction is between isolated acts of misconduct which are not amenable to prior control and deprivations resulting from established state procedure; this factor determines whether a meaningful postdeprivation remedy will satisfy the requirements of procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">In addition, application of <em>Parratt </em>to non-property deprivations such as Daniels\u2019s alleged bodily injury is consistent with the Court\u2019s stated goal in <em>Parratt </em>to provide courts with assistance in determining \u201cthe correct manner in which to analyze claims ... which allege facts that are commonly thought to state a claim for a common-law tort normally dealt with by state courts, but instead are couched in terms of constitutional deprivation and relief is sought under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Id. </em>451 U.S. at 533, 101 S.Ct. at 1912.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">The conclusion that <em>Parratt </em>was intended to apply to all types of deprivations resulting from the unauthorized acts of state officials which are not amenable to prior review is further reinforced by the concurring opinion of Justice Powell. Justice Powell argued that the alleged negligent loss of the plaintiff\u2019s property by the state officials did not constitute a deprivation of property within the meaning of the fourteenth amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 546, 101 S.Ct. at 1918. And he criticized the Court\u2019s focus on the adequacy of the postdeprivation remedy because such would make the fourteenth amendment a font of tort law whenever a state failed to provide a remedy. <em>Id. </em>at 550, 101 S.Ct. at 1920. In so doing, however, he recognized that the Court\u2019s analysis applies to \u201cnegligent invasions of liberty or property interests.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Moreover, <em>Ingraham v. Wright, supra, </em>is cited by the Court as being consistent with the approach taken in <em>Parratt. </em>451 U.S. at 542 and 547, n. 1, 101 S.Ct. at 1916 and 1919, n. 1 (Powell, J., concurring in result). In <em>Ingraham, </em>the Court addressed the claim that corporal punishment in public schools violated due process. <em>See </em>430 U.S. at 653, 97 S.Ct. at 1403. The Court held that corporal punishment in public schools did not deprive school children of liberty without due process of law because, among other things, \u201cthe traditional common-law remedies are fully adequate to afford due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 672, 97 S.Ct. at 1413. <em>Parratt\u2019s </em>citation of <em>Ingraham </em>with approval is compelling evidence that the Court intended the <em>Parratt </em>analysis to apply to deprivations of liberty interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">Not all the justices who joined in the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Parratt </em>believed that it applied to nonproperty deprivations. Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice White concurred, did \u201cnot read the Court\u2019s opinion as applicable to a case concerning depriva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>tion of life or of liberty.\u201d 451 U.S. at 545, 101 S.Ct. at 1918. But Justices Blackmun and White offered no persuasive reason for their distinction between property and non-property deprivations. <em>Moore v. City of East Cleveland, Ohio, </em>431 U.S. 494, 97 S.Ct. 1932, 52 L.Ed.2d 531 (1977), cited as different yet analogous precedent supporting this distinction, concerned a substantive due process claim, <em>see id. </em>at 502-03, 97 S.Ct. at 1937-38, and thus is distinguishable from cases, such as this one, involving alleged procedural due process violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Although Daniels concedes that not every liberty deprivation by a state official should be redressed by an action under section 1983, he stresses that the state has an affirmative duty to protect inmates because of the high level of state control in the prison environment. And he argues that <em>Parratt\u2019s </em>analysis should not apply to this case because a section 1983 remedy is the only way to ensure the state\u2019s compliance with this duty. We believe, however, that the Virginia courts are no less diligent than the federal courts in protecting inmates from state inflicted harm. Moreover, there is nothing in <em>Parratt </em>which lends support to</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">the proposition that its rationale applies differently to prisoners than to nonprison-ers. Indeed, the fact that the plaintiff in <em>Parratt </em>was himself an inmate militates against the adoption of Daniels\u2019s proffered distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">Therefore, we hold that the <em>Parratt </em>analysis applies to deprivations of nonproperty interests which do not violate substantive constitutional rights, including negligent deprivations of the liberty interest in freedom from bodily injury. <em>See Ellis v. Hamilton, </em>669 F.2d 510 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 488, 74 L.Ed.2d 631 (1982); <em>Rutledge v. Arizona Board of Regents, </em>660 F.2d 1345 (9th Cir. 1981), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom. Kush v. </em>Rutledge, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 1483, 75 L.Ed.2d 413 (1983).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> :</p>\n<p id=\"b892-14\">Daniels alleges that Williams\u2019s negligence in leaving a pillow on the stairs deprived him of a liberty interest. There is no allegation that Daniels was injured as a result of some established state procedure. Nor was it possible for the state to provide a predeprivation hearing since the state could not predict when the alleged loss would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>occur. Consequently, <em>Parratt </em>applies to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Having decided that <em>Parratt </em>applies to this case, we must next determine whether Daniels has been deprived of liberty without due process of law. This in turn requires an evaluation of whether Virginia law provides him with a meaningful postde-privation remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Virginia law provides Daniels with a common law action for negligence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nevertheless, Daniels strenuously argues that the Virginia doctrine of sovereign immunity denies him an adequate postdeprivation remedy. <em>See Subica v. Hutton, </em>No. 81-328-AM (E.D.Va. Nov. 17, 1982) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">In his answer, Williams invoked the defense of sovereign immunity from liability for his alleged negligence. The Supreme Court of Virginia has \u201clisted certain factors to consider in determining whether a state employee is entitled to immunity when he or she is charged with simple negligence in the performance of some duty.\u201d <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, Dept. of Highways and Transportation, </em>225 Va. 245, 248, 302 S.E.2d 511, 514 (1983).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-9\">Under such circumstances, [a court should] examine the function [the] employee was performing and the extent of the state\u2019s interest and involvement in that function. Whether the act performed involves the use of judgment and discretion is a consideration, but it is not always determinative .... Of equal importance is the degree of control and direction exercised by the state over the employee whose negligence is involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aic\"><em>James v. Jane, </em>221 Va. 43, 53, 282 S.E.2d 864, 869 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">Daniels alleges that Williams negligently left a pillow on the stairway. Applying the ministerial-discretionary factor, a state court could overrule Williams\u2019s plea of immunity because the alleged negligence underlying Daniels\u2019s claim was misfeasance of a ministerial duty. <em>See Phelps </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>700 F.2d 147, 149 (4th Cir.1983); <em>Semler v. Psychiatric Institute, </em>538 F.2d 121, 127 (4th Cir.1976); <em>First Virginia Bank-Colonial </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>225 Va. 72, 301 S.E.2d 8 (1983); <em>Lawhorne v. Harlan, </em>214 Va. 405, 200 S.E.2d 569 (1973). On the other hand, the state\u2019s interest and involvement in prison administration is great, and a state court may thus determine that Williams is entitled to immunity. <em>See Dalson v. Hutto, </em>No. LD 1131, Vol. 8, No. 1 VADA Quarterly 15 (Cir.Ct. Richmond, Nov. 29, 1982). In short, we cannot confidently predict whether sovereign immunity would apply in this case. Consequently, we must determine whether the possibility of a sovereign immunity defense deprives Daniels of an adequate post-deprivation remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-13\">In responding to the argument that Nebraska\u2019s tort claims procedure did not adequately protect the plaintiff\u2019s property interest because it did not provide him with all the relief available in actions brought under section 1983, the Court held in <em>Par-ratt </em>that the state remedies were sufficient to satisfy the requirements of due process because the \u201cremedies provided <em>could have </em>fully compensated the [plaintiff] for the property loss he suffered.\u201d 451 U.S. at 544, 101 S.Ct. at 1917 (emphasis added). Thus, <em>Parratt </em>does not require that a plaintiff actually receive a remedy for the deprivation of his interest. Instead, <em>Parratt </em>holds that procedural due process is satisfied if, in cases where a predeprivation hearing is impractical, the state provides a means by which the plaintiff can be compensated for his loss. In other words, under <em>Parratt </em>the requirements of due process are satisfied by the provision of a hearing before a tribunal with the power to grant a remedy. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number><em>Groves v. Cox, </em>559 F.Supp. 772 (E.D.Va. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Daniels contends, however, that he is denied due process under <em>Parratt </em>because he could be precluded from bringing any claim in any court if his section 1983 action is dismissed and- Williams\u2019s plea of immunity is sustained. While we agree that this result could deprive Daniels of a remedy, it does not follow that it would deprive him of his right to present a claim and be heard. To be sure, Daniels will be unable to litigate the merits of his claim if a state court determines that Williams is entitled to sovereign immunity. But while due process may sometimes require a state to consider the merits of a plaintiff\u2019s charge before deciding whether to terminate his claim, <em>see Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., </em>455 U.S. 422, 102 S.Ct. 1148, 71 L.Ed.2d 265 (1982), it does not entitle \u201cevery civil litigant to a hearing on the merits in every case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438, 102 S.Ct. at 1158. Rather, due process requires \u201can <em>opportunity . . . </em>granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner for [a] hearing appropriate to the nature of the case .... \u201d <em>Id., quoting Boddie v. Connecticut, </em>401 U.S. 371, 378, 91 S.Ct. 780, 786, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971) (citations omitted). And we conclude that Virginia\u2019s common law tort action provides Daniels with a meaningful opportunity for a hearing appropriate to the nature of his claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Nor does sovereign immunity itself violate due process. \u201cFor when a state law creates a cause of action, the State is free to define the defenses to that claim, including the defense of immunity, unless, of course, the state rule is in conflict with federal law.\u201d <em>Ferri v. Ackerman, </em>444 U.S. 193, 198, 100 S.Ct. 402, 406, 62 L.Ed.2d 355 (1979); see <em>Martinez v. California, </em>444 U.S. 277, 280-283, 100 S.Ct. 553, 556-558, 62 L.Ed.2d 481 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Daniels further argues that the doctrine of sovereign immunity deprives him of a postdeprivation remedy at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. <em>See </em>451 U.S. at 540, 101 S.Ct. at 1915. He asserts that, unlike litigation on the question of good faith in a section 1983 action, which is determined only after a full hearing on the merits, litigation on the issue of sovereign immunity precludes a hearing on the merits unless and until the plea of immunity is overruled. This may be true insofar as a determination of whether sovereign immunity applies is compared with a determination of whether qualified immunity applies in a section 1983 action. <em>But see Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 817-819, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738-2739, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). Nevertheless, this argument overlooks the fact that due process is not violated by other affirmative defenses, such as the statute of limitations, which must be decided prior to litigation on the merits. And contrary to Daniels\u2019s assertion, he is no more denied a remedy at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner by the chance that he may be required to litigate the question of sovereign immunity through the entire Virginia court system than he would be by having to appeal an adverse ruling on a plea of the statute of limitations. We therefore see no significant distinction between sovereign immunity and other defenses which persuades us that Daniels is denied an adequate postdeprivation remedy by the possibility that Williams may be entitled to immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">In sum, Virginia\u2019s common law tort action provides Daniels with a remedy which can fully compensate him for the alleged liberty deprivation. Thus, despite the possibility of a sovereign immunity defense, we hold that Daniels possesses a remedy which provides him with a \u201cmeaningful opportunity subsequent to the initial taking for a determination of rights and liabilities.\u201d 451 U.S. at 541, 101 S.Ct. at 1916. Consequently, we conclude that Daniels has failed to state an actionable claim under section 1983 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>because he has not been deprived of liberty without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b890-12\">. Exhaustion of state judicial or administrative remedies is not a prerequisite to section 1983 actions, <em>Monroe v. Pape, </em>365 U.S. 167, 183, 81 S.Ct. 473, 482, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), except for those cases falling under the narrow exhaustion scheme embodied in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997. See <em>Patsy v. Board of Regents of the State of Florida, </em>457 U.S. 496, 102 S.Ct. 2557, 73 L.Ed.2d 172 (1982). <em>Parratt </em>does not change this rule. An exhaustion requirement would merely require a plaintiff to exhaust his state remedies before bringing a section 1983 action in federal court. <em>Parratt, </em>by contrast, stands for the proposition that a plaintiff may sue only in state court if he fails to state a procedural due process claim under section 1983. Unlike an exhaustion requirement, which is based upon principles of comity, the <em>Parratt </em>analysis is based upon the concept that there is no constitutional violation if a plaintiff has not been deprived of a protected interest without due process of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b891-8\">. Some bodily injuries also implicate a protected property interest, as is recognized by the existence of a common law tort action to recover damages for negligently caused personal injuries. However, because <em>Parratt </em>expressly applies to negligent property deprivations, our analysis will focus on Daniels\u2019 claim that he was deprived of liberty without procedural due process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b892-5\">. See <em>also Hickman v. Hudson, </em>557 F.Supp. 1341 (W.D.Va.1983); <em>Juncker v. Tinney, </em>549 F.Supp. 574 (D.Md.1982); <em>Holmes v. Wampler, </em>546 F.Supp. 500 (E.D.Va.1982); <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Counts, </em>544 F.Supp. 149 (E.D.Va.1982); <em>Peery v. Davis, </em>524 F.Supp. 107 (E.D.Va.1981); <em>Eberle v. Baumfalk, </em>524 F.Supp. 515 (N.D.Ill. 1981); <em>Meshkov v. Abington Township, </em>517 F.Supp. 1280 (E.D.Pa.1981); <em>but see Howse v. DeBerry Correctional Institute, </em>537 F.Supp. 1177 (M.D.Tenn.1982); <em>Haygood v. Younger, </em>527 F.Supp. 808 (E.D.Cal.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">We emphasize that our holding today is not intended to expand <em>Parratt\u2019s </em>scope to every section 1983 action which resembles a state tort action. <em>Parratt </em>applies to only procedural due process claims involving deprivations that do not result from established state procedures and for which the state cannot practically provide a predeprivation hearing. Section 1983 still provides a remedy for procedural due process violations resulting from some established state procedure or for which a prior hearing is practical, <em>Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., </em>455 U.S. 422, 434-437, 102 S.Ct. 1148, 1157-1158, 71 L.Ed.2d 265 (1982), and for violations of substantive constitutional rights. <em>See Palmer, </em>697 F.2d at 1222, n. 2. For example, <em>Parratt </em>is inapplicable to eighth amendment claims arising out of a state official\u2019s medical malpractice or negligence which amounts to deliberate indifference to serious health and safety needs of prisoners. <em>See generally Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976); <em>Withers v. Levine, </em>615 F.2d 158 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 849, 101 S.Ct. 136, 66 L.Ed.2d 59 (1980). Similarly, <em>Parratt </em>would not apply to substantive due process violations resulting from a police officer\u2019s unjustified, brutal beating of a suspect, <em>see Henderson v. Counts, </em>544 F.Supp. at 152-153, or grossly negligent shooting of a suspect which amounts to a \u201craw abuse of power.\u201d <em>Jenkins v. Averett, </em>424 F.2d 1228, 1232 (4th Cir.1970). In these kinds of cases involving alleged violations of substantive constitutional rights, therefore, the presence or absence of a state remedy is irrelevant to whether a claim is stated under section 1983. Consequently, before dismissing a section 1983 action under <em>Parratt, </em>a court should scrutinize the complaint to ensure that it does not include allegations of violations of substantive constitutional rights in addition to an allegation of a procedural due process violation. <em>See generally Hickman v. Hudson, supra; Juncker v. Tinney, supra; Holmes v. Wampler, supra; Henderson v. Counts, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b893-11\">.
