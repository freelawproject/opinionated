SKELLY WRIGHT.</p>\n<author id=\"b240-18\">J. SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b240-19\">In Section 207(b) of the 1970 Clean Air Act amendments, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7541(b) (Supp. V 1981) (the Act), Congress first required vehicle manufacturers to warrant that their vehicles will perform in accordance with applicable emission standards throughout their useful lives. For any vehicle that does not comply, the performance warranty requires the manufacturer, instead of the vehicle owner, to pay for such repairs as will bring the vehicle into compliance with applicable emission standards. In 1977 Congress revised Section 207(b) to offset the anticompetitive effects this warranty would have on the aftermarket parts industry.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Congress instructed the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promulgate any regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>tions necessary for effective implementation of this revised performance warranty scheme. The Administrator promulgated such regulations in 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">In this case we review a consolidated set of petitions brought by various segments of the automotive industry challenging the Administrator\u2019s regulations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After careful study of the statute, the legislative history, and the record, we find that the Administrator\u2019s regulations reasonably construe the statute, save in one respect.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, we affirm the performance warranty regulations in their entirety, except as they apply to uncertified parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">In 1970 Congress substantially amended Title II of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7521 <em>et seq. </em>(Supp. V 1981),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to ensure that motor vehicles would maintain compliance with emission standards throughout their useful lives.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As part of this new enactment,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Congress established a performance warranty program which would require vehicle manufacturers to repair, at no cost to the owner, any vehicle that failed to comply with applicable emission standards during the vehicle\u2019s useful life.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7541(b). Vehicle manufacturers would be liable whenever vehicle owners were subject to sanctions because their vehicles had failed state and local emission inspection and maintenance (I/M) tests.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In this fashion the performance warranty program serves as an essential component <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>of Congress\u2019 comprehensive regulatory-scheme to reduce the nation\u2019s air pollution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">In the 1970 amendments to the Act, Congress did not consider that an extended performance warranty might have anticom-petitive effects on the automotive aftermarket parts industry.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In 1974, however, a subcommittee of the House Permanent Select Committee on Small Business conducted extensive hearings on the monopolistic tendencies of the performance warranty provisions. This subcommittee found that the five-year/50,000-mile warranty provisions could harm the automotive aftermarket parts industry if vehicle manufacturers were to condition their warranties on use of their own parts and services or if vehicle owners were to perceive some benefit under the warranty from exclusive use of original equipment parts and repair facilities. Either circumstance, the subcommittee concluded, could create \u201ca psychological and financial tie-in between the new carowner and the vehicle manufacturer\u2019s parts and franchised service outlets for 5 years and 50,000 [miles]\u201d that might drive independent parts manufacturers out of the industry, leaving vehicle manufacturers with a monopoly on repair parts. <em>Monopolistic Tendencies of Auto Emission Warranty Provisions, </em>Report of Subcommittee on Environmental Problems Affecting Small Business, House Permanent Select Committee on Small Business, H.R.Rep. No. 93-1628, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 30 (1974), Joint Appendix (JA) 547. To combat these tendencies, the subcommittee advised EPA to \u201c[p]ursue all administrative remedies [that would] minimize the anticompetitive effects of the warranty,\u201d and recommended that Congress consider reducing the period of the warranty to 12 months or 12,000 miles, the normal commercial warranty for new cars at that time. <em>Id. </em>at 33, JA to No. 81-1047 at 217. Reducing the length of the warranty, the subcommittee concluded, would reduce the potential for development of any psychological or financial ties between vehicle owner and manufacturer. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">EPA was, however, without statutory authority to undertake an effective program,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and Congress could not reach agreement on what measures to enact.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Finally, in 1977, Congress did act to offset the potential anticompetitive effects of the performance warranty. First, it prohibited vehicle manufacturers from voiding warranties for use of aftermarket parts \u201ccertified\u201d as equivalent to original equipment parts, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7541(b)(2), and provided a $10,000 penalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>against those manufacturers who conditioned their warranty coverage upon the use of original equipment parts. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7522(a)(4)(C).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Second, Congress limited the scope of the performance warranty after the first 24 months or 24,000 miles so that it applied only to certain emission control parts. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Finally, Congress expanded the Administrator\u2019s authority to regulate the manufacturers\u2019 instructions for vehicle maintenance and use, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 7541(c)(3),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and added Section 207(g) to require vehicle owners \u201cto replace and to maintain, at [their] expense * * *, [vehicle components which are] related to emission control (but are not designed for emission control * * *) * <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7541(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Following passage of these amendments, the Administrator attempted to implement the revised performance warranty program. Though extensive comments had already been received and proposed regulations already promulgated, <em>see </em>42 Fed.Reg. 26759 (May 25, 1977), JA 001, the Administrator issued a second notice of proposed rulemak-ing so that interested persons could more fully comment on the effects of the 1977 amendments on the performance warranty program. <em>See </em>45 Fed.Reg. 6960 (January 31, 1980), JA to No. 80-1829 at 062. After receiving and considering extensive comments the Administrator concluded that \u201cshort tests,\u201d as well as the equipment and facilities needed to perform such tests, were \u201cavailable.\u201d 45 Fed.Reg. 34802, 34840 (May 22, 1980), JA 410, 482. On May 22, 1980, having made these statutorily required findings, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7541(b), the Administrator promulgated the final emission warranty regulations. 45 Fed.Reg. 34829, JA 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">These final warranty regulations include sundry provisions that greatly expand the vehicle manufacturers\u2019 responsibilities for post-sale emissions control. <em>See </em>45 Fed. Reg. 34802-34843 (May 22, 1982), JA to No. 80-1829 at 224-266. For example, the regulations stipulate that for the first 24 months or 24,000 miles, whichever comes first, vehicle manufacturers must warrant all components that affect vehicle emissions. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 85.2103 (1982). Then, for the remaining useful life of the vehicle,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the regulations require the manufacturer to warrant those components installed for the sole or primary purpose of reducing vehicle emissions and to remedy all noncon-formities which keep those components from working properly. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 85.2107. In addition, the regulations set forth the requirements for maintenance and use instructions upon which the vehicle manufacturers may condition their warranties. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 85.2102(a)(13). Finally, the regulations prohibit a vehicle manufacturer from denying a warranty claim on the basis that a part certified as equivalent was used, <em>id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>\u00a7 85.2105(a), or from avoiding any of their warranty responsibilities because of certain acts of their dealers, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 85.2104(h)(1), 85.2106(f), 85.2107(d), and 85.2111(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">The Automotive Parts Rebuilders Association (APRA)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> filed its petition for judicial review of particular aspects of the emissions performance warranty regulations on July 14, 1980. The Automotive Service Industry Association (ASIA) was allowed to intervene by order of this court on August 25, 1980.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Finally, on July 21, 1980 the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association (MVMA), <em>et al., </em>also sought judicial review of several of the regulations.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This court consolidated petitioners\u2019 and intervenors\u2019 challenges on August 13, 1980.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">II. Statutory Prerequisites to Promulgation</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Section 207(b) provides that when the Administrator makes certain findings:</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">(1) he shall establish [short tests] by regulation, and</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">(2) at such time as he <em>determines that inspection facilities or equipment are available </em>for purposes of carrying out [short tests] established under paragraph (1), <em>he shall prescribe regulations </em>which shall require manufacturers to warrant the emission control device or system of each new motor vehicle or new motor vehicle engine to which a regulation under section [202] applies and which is manufactured in a model year beginning after the Administrator first prescribes warranty regulations under this paragraph (2). The warranty under such regulations shall run to the ultimate purchaser and each subsequent purchaser and <em>shall provide that </em>if\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">(A) the vehicle or engine is maintained and operated <em>in accordance with instructions under subsection (c)(3) of this section,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">(B) it fails to conform at any time during its useful life * * *, and</p>\n<p id=\"b244-13\">(C) such nonconformity results in the ultimate purchaser (or any subsequent purchaser) of such vehicle having to bear any penalty or other sanction * *,</p>\n<p id=\"b244-14\">then such manufacturer shall remedy such nonconformity under such warranty with the cost thereof to be borne by the manufacturer. <em>No such warranty shall be invalid </em>on the basis of any part used in the maintenance or repair of a vehicle or engine <em>if such part was certified as provided under subsection (a)(2) of this section.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-15\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7541(b) (emphasis added). Subsection (c)(3), referred to in Section 207(b)(2)(A), in turn provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-17\">The manufacturer shall furnish with each new motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine written instructions for the proper maintenance and use of the vehicle or engine by the ultimate purchaser and <em>such instructions shall correspond to regulations which the Administrator shall promulgate. </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-20\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7541(c)(3) (emphasis added). Section 207(a)(2), referred to at the end of Section 207(b)(2), provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-21\">In the case of a motor vehicle part or motor vehicle engine part, the manufacturer or rebuilder of such part may certify that use of such part will not result in a failure of the vehicle or engine to comply with emissions standards promulgated under section [202]. <em>Such certification </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number><em>shall be made only under such regulations as may be promulgated by the Administrator to carry out the purposes of subsection (b) of this section. The Administrator shall promulgate such regulations no later than [August 7,1979].</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7541(a)(2) (emphasis added). Petitioners argue that, read together, these provisions require EPA to satisfy four statutory prerequisites before it may impose performance warranty liability on vehicle manufacturers. EPA must: (1) establish vehicle short tests; (2) determine that facilities and equipment exist to administer those tests; and (3) promulgate owner maintenance and use instruction. regulations; and (4) promulgate replacement parts certification regulations. Petitioners concede that EPA has met the first two requirements, but claim that EPA\u2019s failure to promulgate timely<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> parts certification regulations and any maintenance and use instruction regulations renders the performance warranty program unenforceable.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This argument, however, misreads the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">On its face, Section 207(b) imposes <em>two </em>specific prerequisites to performance warranty regulation promulgation: the establishment of short tests and the determination that facilities and equipment exist to administer those tests. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7541(b)(2). Once these specific prerequisites are satisfied, the statute commands that the Administrator \u201cshall prescribe regulations which shall require manufacturers to warrant [their cars] * * *.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The statutory directive is straightforward: once the Administrator makes the required findings, he must issue applicable regulations. This is precisely what the Administrator did when he promulgated regulations applicable to all model year 1981 and subsequent model year vehicles.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">Section 207(b) does, as petitioners assert, make reference to parts certification regulations. It states that no performance warranty shall be invalid on the basis of a part certified under Section 207(a)(2), and Section 207(a)(2) requires the Administrator to promulgate certification regulations \u201cto carry out the purposes\u201d of the performance warranty program. But neither Section 207(a) nor Section 207(b) directly makes promulgation of the certification regulations a prerequisite to promulgation of the performance warranty regulations. By contrast, Congress did set out other <em>specific </em>prerequisites in Section 207(b); Congress easily could have included the certification regulations in this list had it intended them to be necessary prerequisites as well. Indeed, viewing the certification program as an absolute prerequisite to the performance warranty program does not make practical sense: The absence of certification regulations does not change the rights or obligations of any party \u2014 vehicle manufacturers, parts manufacturers, or vehicle owners\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>with respect to the performance warranty.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> No vehicle manufacturer <em>can </em>incur performance warranty liability due to the use of certified parts until certification regulations are promulgated and parts manufacturers actually begin certifying their parts; likewise, parts manufacturers are still free to sell, and vehicle owners free to buy, uncertified parts until such regulations exist.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Petitioners would have us read the statute so as to require a meaningless prerequisite that would serve no rational purpose. This we cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Petitioners also argue that Section 207(b) requires EPA to promulgate <em>new </em>maintenance and use instruction regulations prior to promulgating performance warranty regulations.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Maintenance and use instruction regulations have been codi-</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">fied at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 86.079-39 (1982), but these existing regulations were promulgated in accordance with the original \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d language of Section 207(c)(3).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The 1977 amendments altered the statute to provide that maintenance and use instructions \u201cshall correspond to regulations which the Administrator shall promulgate,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7541(c)(3), and petitioners assert that the performance warranty regulations did not correspondingly change the standard for maintenance and use instructions. In fact, all the Administrator did in the performance warranty regulations was reaffirm that the \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d standard still applied, <em>see </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 85.2102 (1982); 45 Fed.Reg. 34831 (May 22, 1980), and reserve the right to promulgate additional regulations.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>But the Administrator was not required to do more. A viable set of maintenance and use instruction regulations is necessary to implement the statute, but nothing in the statute or its legislative history indicates that Congress thought the existing regulations were inadequate. All the 1977 amendment did was give the Administrator <em>more </em>authority to regulate maintenance and use instructions; it did not condition the viability of the performance warranty on a change in those regulations. The \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d standard adequately instructs manufacturers as to the preparation of maintenance and use instructions. All parties potentially affected by the maintenance and use instruction regulations have been and are now aware of their rights and obligations under this standard, and any claims of uncertainty are therefore totally unwarranted.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">III. Scope of the Performance Warranty</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Section 207(b) requires the vehicle manufacturers to warrant the \u201cemission control device or system\u201d of each vehicle for its full useful life. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7541(b). However, the Act limits the meaning of the term \u201cemission control device or system\u201d after the first 24 months or 24,000 miles. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the performance warranty regulations define the warranty\u2019s scope differently for the periods before and after 24 months or 24,000 miles.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">A. <em>Pre-24 Months/24,000 Miles</em></p>\n<p id=\"Axy\">EPA\u2019s emission performance warranty regulations provide that for the first 24 months or 24,000 miles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-11\">(a) The manufacturer\u2019s obligation under the emission performance warranty shall be to make all adjustments, repairs or replacements necessary to assure that the vehicle complies with applicable emission standards of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, that it will continue to comply for the remainder of its useful life (if proper maintenance and operation are continued), and that it will operate in a safe manner. The manufacturer shall bear all costs incurred as a result of the above obligation * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">40 C.F.R. \u00a7 85.2107(a) (1982). Petitioners claim that EPA exceeded the authority Congress granted it by requiring, in this regulation, that vehicle manufacturers warrant <em>all </em>components affecting emissions for the first 24 months or 24,000 miles. But we think EPA\u2019s regulation is a perfectly reasonable interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">When EPA first proposed the warranty regulations, in March 1977, it suggested that the performance warranty cover \u201cany system, assembly, device, or other component thereof which can affect emissions.\u201d 42 Fed.Reg. 26761 (May 25,1977), JA to No. 80-1829 at 20. The aftermarket parts industry reacted adversely to this suggestion because such broad warranty coverage might well leave vehicle manufacturers with a monopoly in the aftermarket parts market.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Congress agreed, but rather than uniformly reducing the warranty\u2019s scope, it responded by limiting the warranty\u2019s coverage after the first 24 months or 24,000 miles.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Petitioners offer a different interpretation of the statute than does EPA. They argue that Section 207(b) places the more limited burden on manufacturers to warrant only those components that are \u201cintegral,\u201d as opposed to \u201crelated,\u201d to emission control. Joint brief of petitioners and in-tervenor at 36. They derive this interpretation from Section 207(g), which provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\">the owner of any motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine warranted under this section is responsible in the proper maintenance of such vehicle or engine to replace and to maintain at his expense * * *, such items as spark plugs, points, condensers, and any other part, item, or device related to emission control (but not designed for emission control under the terms of the last three sentences of subsection (a)(1) [<footnotemark>32</footnotemark>] of this section, unless such part, item, or device is covered by any warranty not mandated by this Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Adz\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7541(g). According to petitioners, the Administrator\u2019s interpretation of the warranty provision would render Section 207(g) meaningless while their interpretation would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">But petitioners read Section 207(g)\u2019s scope and intended purpose too broadly. That section is designed to deal only with who is responsible for performing \u201cscheduled maintenance\u201d \u2014 that maintenance which the vehicle manufacturer designates as necessary for the proper performance of the vehicle.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> If an owner does not maintain his vehicle properly, the manufacturer is free, under Section 207(g), to deny emission performance warranty coverage. But if the vehicle fails.an I/M test for other reasons \u2014 for example, if components mentioned in Section 207(g) fail prior to the end of their standard design life \u2014 then the performance warranty properly covers them during the first 24 months or 24,000 miles. Section 207(g) addresses only the scope of the emission warranty coverage as it relates to scheduled maintenance, and not to services performed and parts replaced under a valid warranty claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">Petitioners\u2019 proposed interpretation of Section 207(b) would read the 24-month/24,000-mile limitation right out of the statute. Under petitioners\u2019 reading the vehicle manufacturers are responsible only for components \u201cintegral\u201d to emission control. But these are precisely the components that are specified in Section 207(b)(2) as covered for the period <em>after 24 </em>months or 24,000 miles.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Thus, if petitioners are correct, the performance warranty would cover the same components both before and after 24 months or 24,000 miles. Such a conclusion is incompatible with congressional intent. Congress intended for the warranty coverage to differ before and after the first 24 months or 24,000 miles. The Administrator\u2019s interpretation of the statute, not petitioners\u2019, properly implements that intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">B. <em>Post-24 Months/24,000 Miles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">Because Congress was also deeply concerned with the anticompetitive effects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>such broad warranty coverage might have on the aftermarket parts industry,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> it substantially contracted the vehicle manufacturers\u2019 responsibility after the first 24 months or 24,000 miles to cover the \u201ccatalytic converter, thermal reactor, or other component installed * * * for the sole or primary purpose of reducing vehicle emissions.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7541(b). EPA\u2019s regulations similarly limit the manufacturers\u2019 responsibilities after the first 24 months or 24,000 miles to cover only \u201cthose noncon-formities resulting from the failure of components which have been installed in or on the vehicle for the sole or primary purpose of reducing vehicle emissions * * *.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 85.2103(a)(3) (1982). But in defining the <em>remedy </em>that would make this <em>warranty </em>effective, EPA also makes the manufacturer responsible for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\">All other components which must be adjusted, repaired or replaced to enable a component repaired or replaced under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to perform properly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">40 C.F.R. \u00a7 85.2107(a)(2) (1982).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Petitioners claim that this <em>remedy </em>goes beyond the remedial power Congress has authorized and assert .that the net result will be to reduce, not increase, competition in sales of aftermarket repair parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">We think EPA\u2019s interpretation is consistent with the statute, and therefore should be upheld. If the warranty is to mean anything, it must cover secondary parts which fail because of a failed primary part.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Similarly,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-14\">[i]t makes no sense to replace a failed part, such as a catalyst, which fails as a result of a second component, such as a spark plug, and not to replace the second component to prevent the replaced part from failing promptly for- the same reason its predecessor did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-15\">45 Fed.Reg. 34837 (May 22, 1980), JA 417.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> No emission control device operates in a vacuum, and often mere replacement of a device or system will not be enough to prevent a vehicle from polluting.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Congress previously confronted this dilemma and left it to EPA to determine what <em>repairs </em>would be necessary to make the performance warranty an effective component of its comprehensive pollution control pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>gram.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> While Congress wanted EPA to reduce the anticompetitive effects of the warranty after 24 months or 24,000 miles <footnotemark>41</footnotemark> it did not intend for EPA to render the warranty obligation completely meaningless. Congress understood the distinction between the scope of the warranty and the scope of necessary repairs,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> and EPA has properly implemented this congressional understanding by requiring all repairs necessary to make parts installed primarily for emission control work effectively.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Furthermore, EPA has responded \u2014 and we think adequately \u2014 to criticisms that this expansive repair obligation is inconsistent with the goal of reducing the anticompeti-tive potential of the performance warranty. First, EPA quite reasonably indicated that the lack of warranty coverage, in all likelihood, would not benefit the independent aftermarket parts industry.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> 45 Fed.Reg. 34838 (May 22, 1980), JA 418. Second, it indicated that the provision could be \u201cpro-competitive\u201d if it discouraged warranty outlets from performing unnecessary repairs, and thus fraudulently increasing their sales. <em>Id. </em>Both responses are theoretically plausible ones, and they indicate that EPA has properly considered and responded to claims that its regulation is inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>with the thrust of the 1977 amendments. We therefore affirm.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">C. <em>The Parts List</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">At the time EPA published the performance warranty regulations, it also published, as an appendix, a list advising the public of which parts it believed were \u201cinstalled in or on a vehicle solely or primarily for the purpose of reducing vehicle emissions, except those components which were in general use prior to the model year 1968.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> 45 Fed.Reg. 34842, 34843 (May 22, 1980), JA 422-423. The list was explicitly advisory<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> and neither expanded nor narrowed the legal obligations of any party. The list was merely EPA\u2019s attempt to be responsive to industry\u2019s request for guidance in the area.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Petitioners complain that EPA issued its parts list without giving prior notice and opportunity for comments to the public; accordingly, they suggest that this court vacate the parts list and remand it to EPA for a full rulemaking proceeding. But rule-making procedures are not required here. Section 307(d)(l)(N) of the Clean Air Act states that rulemaking procedures are not necessary for rules or circumstances qualifying for exemption under Section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> That section specifically exempts general statements of agency policy \u2014 like this nonbinding parts list \u2014 from normal rulemaking procedures.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Hence, petitioners\u2019 procedural complaint is groundless.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-14\">Petitioners also make general challenges to the substance and length of the parts list. But they do not assert any specific grievances, nor do they indicate how this advisory parts list burdens them in any way.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Since 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 85.2103 (1982) continues to be the exclusive source for all warranty obligations, we can find no legal basis upon which to upset the parts list. Vehicle manufacturer obligations derive from the Act and its implementing regulations, not from this advisory list.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-15\">IV. Manufacturers\u2019 Obligations Extended</p>\n<p id=\"b251-16\">Besides defining which of the vehicle manufacturers\u2019 parts must be warranted, the regulations require the manufacturer to take responsibility, at least in the first instance, for short test failures that result from their dealers\u2019 acts and from the use of their <em>competitors\u2019 </em>parts. Petitioners challenge various aspects of these regulations as exceeding EPA\u2019s statutory grant of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-17\">A. <em>Liability for Dealers\u2019 Acts</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ala\">To begin with, petitioners challenge the sundry regulations that hold vehicle manufacturers responsible for ensuring that warranty repairs are properly and timely made. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>These regulations require vehicle manufacturers to honor warranty claims, valid or not, if the repair facility does not finish or reject (in writing) such claims within 30 days. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 85.2106(f), 85.-2107(d) (1982). Similarly, they prohibit vehicle manufacturers from denying claims on the basis of any work performed by an authorized facility, id \u00a7 85.2104(h), and subject these manufacturers to fines of up to $10,000 per offense for warranty work that cannot reasonably be expected to allow the vehicle to meet applicable emission standards, id \u00a7 85.2111(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">In our view, these regulations simply ensure that vehicle manufacturers assume the responsibilities the Act places upon them. In Section 207(b) Congress identified the vehicle manufacturer as being responsible for a broad performance warranty. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7451(b). In Section 203(a)(4)(D) Congress prohibited these manufacturers from <em>failing or refusing </em>to comply with the terms of the warranty with respect to any vehicle. Id \u00a7 7522(a)(4)(D). And in Section 207(d) Congress specifically prohibited such manufacturers from transferring any of their warranty cost to their dealers. Id \u00a7 7541(d). In these sections of the statute Congress made clear that it wanted vehicle manufacturers to assume full responsibility for the performance warranty. The regulations implement this congressional intent. They do not impose vicarious liability on the vehicle manufacturers or make them responsible for activities they cannot control. Rather, they ensure that the vehicle manufacturers will not be able to escape their performance warranty obligations by delegating the repair work to others.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> So long as vehicle manufacturers choose to authorize others to perform their obligations, they must also be prepared to accept responsibility for the inadequate performance of their delegates.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> These regulations simply ensure that consumers do not face unreasonable hurdles in bringing their warranty claims and that, when performed, the performance warranty work is adequate.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> The Act clearly gives EPA authority to make the vehicle manufacturers responsible for their authorized dealers\u2019 acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">B. <em>Liability for Competitors\u2019 Parts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">In addition to ensuring that vehicle manufacturers remain responsible for warranty service provided by their authorized dealers, EPA attempted to implement Congress\u2019 mandate, in Section 207(b), that vehicle manufacturers not be allowed to deny warranty claims where a competitor\u2019s certified replacement part was used.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> In this effort EPA published \u201creplacement part\u201d regulations, which provide, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">(a) No emission performance warranty claim shall be denied on the basis of the use of a properly installed <em>certified </em>part in the maintenance or repair of a vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"AUT4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>(b) Except as provided in \u00a7 85.2104(h), a vehicle manufacturer may deny an emission performance warranty claim on the basis of an <em>uncertified </em>replacement part used in the maintenance or repair of a vehicle if the <em>vehicle manufacturer </em>presents evidence that the uncertified replacement part is:</p>\n<p id=\"aot-dedup-0\">(1) Either defective in materials or workmanship, or not equivalent from an emissions standpoint to the original equipment part; and</p>\n<p id=\"A56\">(2) The owner is unable to rebut the evidence. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"AD-\">40 C.F.R. \u00a7 85.2105(a) &amp; (b) (1982) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> These regulations thus make the vehicle manufacturers responsible, at least in the first instance, for all warranty claims arising from use of their compet\u00ed-tors\u2019 parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-21\">1 <em>tt </em>i . <em>ncer i \u00ede par s</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ag9\">Petitioners first challenge that aspect of the replacement parts regulations that makes the vehicle manufacturers responsible for warranty claims in which un-certified parts were used in the maintenance or repair of the vehicle. This portion of the regulations effectively shifts the parts manufacturers\u2019 burden of demonstrating equivalency \u2014 -a prerequisite to certification to the vehicle manufacturers when an uncertified part is alleged to have been relevant to the vehicle s failure to comply with the emission standards.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Petitioners claim that EPA reaches beyond its statute-ry authority m forcing them to carry this burden of proof before they may deny a warranty claim. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"AFY\">On its face, Section 207(b) prohibits vehicle manufacturers from denying warranty claims if <em>certified </em>parts were used in a vehicle\u2019s repair. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7541(b). The statute says nothing about requiring vehicle manufacturers to accept warranty claims where <em>uncertified </em>parts were used, or of requiring vehicle manufacturers to demonstrate that <em>uncertified </em>parts were defective or not equivalent to original equipment parts before a claim can be denied. Indeed, the fairest implication from the language of the statute is that if an <em>uncertified </em>part is relevant to the failure to comply with the emission standards, then the manufacturer may deny the warranty claim.</p>\n<p id=\"Aix\">When Congress was considering Section 207(b), it obviously was aware of existing law that governed the vehicle manufacturers\u2019 responsibilities to consumers.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> That law \u2014 the Magnuson-Moss Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301 <em>et seq. </em>(1982) \u2014 specifically prohibits manufacturers from conditioning their warranties on the consumers\u2019 use of articles identified by brand, trade, or corporate name. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2302(c). But that law did not prohibit manufacturers from conditioning their warranties on the use of the equivalent of original equipment parts because Congress recognized that the manufacturers\u2019 reputation and customer goodwill were at stake in warranty work and that manufaeturers should be able to protect their interests by requiring reputable and effective repairs. <em>Cf. id. </em>\u00a7 2307 (manufacturer can designate facilities for performing warranty repairs).</p>\n<p id=\"AeL\">Congress faced this same concern when it addressed the performance warranty issue under the Clean Air Act It recognized that the performance warranty exposed ve-bjeje manufacturers to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqI\">such vast liability that these compailieS have a legitimate intereSt in limiting the scope of their liability by conditioning the validity of their performance warranties on the proper care and maintenance of the vehicle. * * * [TJhis interest carries with it the ability to establish criteria to protect the vehicle manufacturer from liability which it, in no way, caused, but which resulted solely from the owner\u2019s negligence or the installation of <em>indepen</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number><em>dently produced inferior parts </em>or improper nonfranchised service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-4\">[Congress further recognized] the legal and economic considerations^] as well as the inability to establish effective quality control measures [, which] <em>prohibit the vehicle manufacturer from publicly identifying non-OEM equivalent parts and nonfranchised service outlets. * * *</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A79\">H.R.Rep. No. 93-1628, <em>supra, </em>at 30, JA 547 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Thus Congress enacted a scheme whereby EPA was to shoulder responsibility for establishing the criteria for equivalency \u2014 the parts certification scheme. Congress was concerned that vehicle owners, because of the duration of the warranty, would use only original equipment parts in maintenance or repair of their motor vehicle emission systems in order to avoid disputes about the \u201cequivalence\u201d of their parts. Congress feared that these psychological and financial incentives would adversely affect the competitive position of aftermarket parts manufacturers.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> It therefore directed <em>EPA </em>to establish a system whereby all <em>parts </em>manufacturers could, through a relatively simple and inexpensive procedure,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> certify that their parts were equivalent\u201d to those of the vehicle manufacturer.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7541(a)(2). This system was to become effective within two years. <em>Id. </em>Thus, if a vehicle owner had installed a certified aftermarket part, the vehicle manufacturer could no longer assert that the part was not \u201cequivalent\u201d and so refuse to honor the owner\u2019s warranty repair claim. But at no time did Congress indicate it wanted vehicle manufacturers to bear the burden of proving nonequivalence for parts not so certified.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">To the contrary, Congress understood what a delicate task it had assumed in balancing the needs of vehicle manufacturers, parts manufacturers, and consumers. It clearly wanted to mitigate the potential anticompetitive impact of the performance warranty on parts manufacturers and, to that end, directed EPA to establish a certification scheme that would minimize the warranty\u2019s anticompetitive impacts. But this scheme also sought to provide certain quality control assurances to both vehicle manufacturers and consumers about the equivalency of independent manufacturers\u2019 parts. Thus EPA had to establish a scheme whereby parts manufacturers could establish such equivalency. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 85.-2105(a)(2) (1982) undermines this balance by shifting to the vehicle manufacturers the' responsibility for establishing nonequivalen-cy, thereby making them potentially liable for aftermarket parts that have not been processed and checked through EPA\u2019s certification scheme. The regulation clearly exceeds EPA\u2019s statutory grant of authority and must be invalidated.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>2. <em>Certified parts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">Petitioners further challenge that aspect of the \u201creplacement parts\u201d regulations that prohibits vehicle manufacturers from denying a performance warranty claim on the basis that a <em>certified </em>part was defective, decertified, or otherwise not equivalent to the original equipment part. Joint brief of petitioners and intervenor at 21; <em>see </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 85.2105(a) (1982); 45 Fed.Reg. 34840, JA 420; 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 85.-2121(f) (1982); 45 Fed.Reg. 78462 (Nov. 25, 1980), JA 519.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> We must reject this challenge because EPA\u2019s regulations track the clear language of the statute<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> and fulfill the overriding purpose of the parts certification program.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Section 207(b) flatly prohibits invalidation of any performance warranty \u201con the basis of <em>any part </em>used in the maintenance or repair of a vehicle or engine <em>if such part was certified </em>* * 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7541(b). By its very terms, this provision covers any part that is certified, and there is no indication whatever that Congress meant to create any exception for defective, decertified, or nonequivalent parts.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> To the contrary, Congress wanted to protect consumers from being caught in the middle of disputes between vehicle and parts manufacturers and to make it less risky for them to buy less expensive, nonoriginal equipment parts.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Consumers would be spared such disputes and encouraged to use independent manufacturers\u2019 parts only if the vehicle manufacturers were required to honor <em>all </em>consumers\u2019 claims on parts that were certified when bought.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> For that reason Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>enacted Section 207(b) requiring vehicle manufacturers to honor any claim based on a certified part, whether equivalent or not.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Petitioners contend that two other pieces of legislative history \u2014 a 1976 House Report<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> and a 1977 House Committee Report <footnotemark>72</footnotemark> \u2014 demonstrate that Congress did not intend for the warranty obligation to apply so broadly and that EPA\u2019s regulations are contrary to congressional intent. Both of these reports explained that use of a certified part could \u201cnot be considered as a basis for voiding the performance warranty, unless the actual part in question [was] proven by the vehicle manufacturer to be defective in workmanship or materials.\u201d But neither of the bills these reports accompanied was enacted into law. H.R. 10498 (which the 1976 report accompanied) died in the 1976 Congress.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> H.R. 6161 (which the 1977 report accompanied) was a starting point for the legislation ultimately enacted, but contained language very different from that actually included in the final bill.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> In the final version Congress chose the wording offered in S.252<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> and this Senate bill (and its language)<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> contained no such exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>for defective, decertified, or nonequivalent parts.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">In describing the final compromise, the Conference Committee concluded that \u201cno warranty shall be invalidated by the use of any part certified under regulations promulgated by the Administrator not to result in failure of an engine to comply with emission standards.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 95-564, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 548 (1977), JA 557. The Committee understood that a certified parts warranty could be invalidated in only one circumstance: where the manufacturer showed that the owner had not performed the required maintenance or repair as set forth in the owner\u2019s manual or had abused the vehicle in its operation. <em>Id. </em>Thus the Conference Committee could not have intended that vehicle manufacturers escape initial responsibility for allegedly defective, but certified, parts. Nor could the Committee have intended that vehicle manufacturers escape initial responsibility for nonequivalent or decertified parts, since the very purpose of creating a certification program was to allow consumers to insure against such charges. Thus, EPA\u2019s program seems entirely consistent with the Committee\u2019s understanding of the final compromise.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Petitioners object to EPA\u2019s reading of the statute (and the legislative history) because it imposes what they term \u201cvicarious liability\u201d on the vehicle manufacturers.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> But EPA\u2019s interpretation does no such thing. Rather, it merely commands vehicle manufacturers to make or authorize repairs and then to obtain reimbursement from the parts manufacturers. Contrary to petitioners\u2019 intimations,<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> this is the only interpretation of the statute that the agency has suggested:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-14\">[T]he Agency believes that Congress intended that the vehicle manufacturer honor claims involving certified parts, even if the parts are defective, provided the vehicle manufacturer may be reimbursed for the expenses of such activities by the aftermarket part manufacturer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Au9\">45 Fed.Reg. 34835 (May 22, 1980), JA 415. Furthermore, this interpretation is entirely consistent with Congress\u2019 desire to protect consumers from excessive prices and to minimize the difficulties that consumers might face in obtaining their warranted repairs, provided an acceptable reimbursement scheme is in place.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Thus we can find no basis for describing EPA\u2019s scheme as one that imposes \u201cvicarious liability\u201d or for finding the interpretation inconsistent with congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-15\">Because we find EPA\u2019s interpretation of the statute to be a reasonable one, our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>decisions in <em>Chrysler Corp. v. EPA, </em>600 F.2d 904 (D.C.Cir.1979),<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> and <em>Amoco Oil Co. </em>v. <em>EPA, </em>543 F.2d 270 (D.C.Cir.1976),<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> are completely inapposite. Both of these cases involved regulations that imposed liability (without reimbursement) on one party for the acts of another. In each case the court found that EPA lacked statutory authority to do so. <em>See </em>600 F.2d at 916-917; 543 F.2d at 275-276. By contrast, this case involves a statute that fully authorizes EPA to shift primary liability from one party to another, provided an acceptable reimbursement scheme accompanies the shift.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Since 1970 Congress has wanted vehicle manufacturers to bear the cost of repairing emission control devices through a performance warranty program. The 1977 amendments were enacted to minimize the anti-competitive effects of the pollution control program. In 1980 the Administrator finally developed the technology to put this program into effect. His regulations make the vehicle manufacturer broadly responsible for repair of emission control parts early in the life of the vehicle, and then shift that responsibility to the vehicle owner as the car ages. Furthermore, the regulations create a simple scheme whereby the manufacturer is primarily liable for repair failures resulting from dealers\u2019 acts and competitors\u2019 parts, but can then turn to the responsible party for appropriate reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The driving public has waited over a decade for the implementation of this program, and the success of our nation\u2019s mobile-source pollution control program depends, at least in part, on it. EPA has steadily overcome the technological roadblocks that stood in its way, and is now ready to put the performance warranty into effect. We think the regulations it has promulgated effectuate Congress\u2019 intent, and therefore, with the exception of the uncertified parts provisions, we affirm EPA\u2019s efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">\n<em>Affirmed in part and vacated in part.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-12\">.

In this voluntary certification program, aftermarket parts manufacturers would demonstrate that their parts were functionally equivalent to original equipment parts. <em>See </em>39 Fed.Reg. 40193 (Nov. 14, 1974), JA 004. The program was to have had four objectives: (1) to identify those parts or components important to vehicle emission performance; (2) to develop standards or guidelines for those parts; (3) to publish the standards or guidelines so that aftermarket parts manufacturers could design and build their parts accordingly; and (4) to allow the parts manufacturers to represent that parts so built were \u201ccertified\u201d to EPA standards.

But petitioners fail to note that notice has been required since 1977, and Congress did not even intend that the certification regulations be promulgated until August 1979.

Petitioners also argue that the regulation is invalid because it requires vehicle manufacturers to pay for repair of parts that \u201crelate\u201d to, but are not \u201cdesigned\u201d for, emission control, citing \u00a7 207(g) as making the vehicle owner responsible for such parts.

Thus petitioners\u2019 argument begs the question of who is responsible for failed parts that \u201crelate\u201d to emission control on cars that are properly and routinely maintained. The statute answers this question with its 24-month/24,000 miles dividing line: before 24 months/24,000 miles, the vehicle manufacturer is responsible for their repair; after 24 months/24,000 miles, the vehicle owner is responsible for their repair.

Where Congress meant for the consumer to bear the cost of repairs, it specifically said so.

This section leaves manufacturers free to deny warranty claims where the parts used were defective or nonequivalent.
