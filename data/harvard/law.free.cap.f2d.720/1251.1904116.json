The Secretary denied petitioner\u2019s application, claiming that she did not meet the disability requirements. Upon reconsideration, the Secretary reached the same conclusion, and petitioner filed a request for a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ) of the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals. After considering objective medical evidence of and subjective testimony concerning petitioner\u2019s various alleged disabilities, the ALJ concluded that petitioner failed to establish a disability for purposes of the Act'. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), petitioner then commenced a civil action for review of the Secretary\u2019s decision in the district court, contending that the ALJ had made inadequate findings to refute the uncontradicted subjective evidence of petitioner\u2019s disability. The magistrate agreed with petitioner, and recommended reversing the Secretary\u2019s decision. The district court rejected the magistrate\u2019s recommendation and affirmed the Secretary\u2019s denial, noting that, although the ALJ did not specifically explain why he rejected the testimony, the record reflected sufficient consideration of the subjective evidence to uphold the ALJ\u2019s ultimate finding. The sole issue presented on this appeal is whether, absent a clear credibility determination as to the subjective testimony of petitioner and her daughter, the ALJ\u2019s findings were sufficient to uphold his rejection of the claimant\u2019s subjective evidence of disability. We have jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-12\">Petitioner, a 57-year-old woman with an eleventh-grade education, has engaged in various sedentary occupations. She alleges that she has been unable to pursue such occupations since 1975, however, at which time she claims her alleged disability due to arthritis of the spine, status post double mastectomy, status post hysterectomy, nervousness, hypertension, and alcoholism commenced. The only bases of disability not completely disposed of by the ALJ\u2019s consideration of the objective medical evidence are nervousness, hypertension, alcoholism and related depression (hereinafter referred to as \u201cdisability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-13\">Because the petitioner last met the Act\u2019s special earnings requirements<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in March 1978, the ALJ determined that petitioner was required to establish that she became disabled within the meaning <em>of </em>the Act on or before March 31, 1978. Therefore, the relevant disability period is from July 1975 until March 1978. The evidence of disability during this period consisted of both objective and subjective information. The district court found that the ALJ\u2019s rejection of the claimant\u2019s objective medical evidence was proper in light of substantial objective medical 'evidence to the contrary, <em>and we </em>agree. The ALJ\u2019s rejection of claimant\u2019s subjective evidence of disability, however, presents a more difficult problem and is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-5\">Judicial review of factual findings in disability cases is limited to determining whether the record contains substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s findings. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Boyd v. Heckler, </em>704 F.2d 1207, 1209 (11th Cir.1983). A \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard, however, does not permit a court to uphold the Secretary\u2019s decision by referring only to those parts of the record which support the ALJ. A reviewing court must view the entire record and take account of evidence in the record which detracts from the evidence relied on by the ALJ. <em>See Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 487, 71 S.Ct. 456, 464, 95 L.Ed. 456, 467 (1951); <em>NLRB v. Randle-Eastern Ambulance Serv., Inc., </em>584 F.2d 720 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-6\">Under the Act, the claimant bears the initial burden of establishing a disability. This burden requires the claimant to prove his inability, due to physical or mental impairment, to perform his previous work. <em>Boyd, supra, </em>704 F.2d at 1209; <em>Bloodsworth v. Heckler, </em>703 F.2d 1233, 1240 (11th Cir.1983). In determining whether the claimant has satisfied this initial burden, the examiner is guided by four factors: (1) objective medical facts or clinical findings; (2) diagnoses of examining physicians; (3) subjective evidence of pain and disability, <em>e.g., </em>the testimony of the claimant and his family; and (4) the claimant\u2019s age, education, and work history. <em>Boyd, supra, </em>704 F.2d at 1210; <em>Bloodsworth, supra, </em>at 1240; <em>Walden v. Schweiker, </em>672 F.2d 835, 839 (11th Cir.1982), <em>quoting De Paepe v. Richardson, </em>464 F.2d 92, 94 (5th Cir.1972). \u201cThese factors must be considered both singly and in combination.\u201d <em>Bloodsworth, supra, </em>703 F.2d at 1240; <em>Rodriguez v. Schweiker, </em>640 F.2d 682, 685 (5th Cir.1981); <em>De Paepe, supra, </em>464 F.2d at 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-7\">In the instant case, the ALJ found that petitioner was not disabled principally because first, the relevant period of disability was from 1975 to 1978 and claimant produced no objective medical evidence of her condition between July 1975 and October 1979, and second, \u201cthe evidence that is available in no way supports the existence of disabling impairments at any time subsequent to at least mid-1972 until recent neurological evaluation in October 1981 which attempts to relate a disability dating back to 1975.\u201d Decision at 4 (Jan. 12, 1982). The ALJ\u2019s reference to available evidence includes the testimony of claimant and her daughter, Mrs. Evers. As we read the ALJ\u2019s opinion, the ALJ based his conclusion that this subjective evidence was unsup-portive of a disability on two express reasons. First, the ALJ noted that claimant\u2019s depressive episodes resulted in only two hospitalizations more than a year apart in 1971 and 1972. Second, the ALJ stated that claimant\u2019s depressive episodes were not elaborated upon subsequent to May 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-9\">The testimony of claimant and her daughter belie these conclusions. First, Mrs. Evers testified that whenever she suggested that her mother return to the hospital during the relevant period, her mother became terrified and refused to go. (Tr. at 55). Mrs. Evers further testified that her mother never actually went to see the family doctor from 1975 to 1979, because he would pressure her to correct her alcohol problem. (Tr. at 55-56). In light of this testimony, the fact that claimant was not hospitalized during the relevant period tends to support, rather than negate, the presence of a disability. Secondly, the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that claimant\u2019s depressive episodes were not elaborated upon after May 1972 is plainly erroneous. Petitioner testified that she became more depressed and her alcohol problem increased from 1974 to 1978 because she could not find work. (Tr. at 46). Similarly, Mrs. Evers testified that her mother has been a recluse since 1975 (Tr. at 52), and that her mother attempted suicide by hanging herself sometime between 1975 and 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-10\">The district court was correct in concluding that the instant case is not a situation in which the ALJ applied an improper standard by neglecting to consider subjective evidence of a disability, No. 82-554-Civ-T-GC, slip op. at 5 (M.D.Fla., Feb. 18, 1983) (citing <em>Benson v. Schweiker, </em>652 F.2d 406, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>409 (5th Cir.1981)); indeed, as indicated above, the ALJ made express references to such evidence. The problem in this case, however, is that the record as a whole does not support the ALJ\u2019s express reasons for rejecting the subjective proof of a disability-</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-4\">The insufficiency of the ALJ\u2019s reasons for rejecting the subjective evidence is significant because, in certain cases, a Social Security claimant may sustain the initial burden of proving that he was disabled from engaging in his former occupation purely on the basis of credited subjective testimony. <em>See Bloodsworth </em>v. <em>Heckler, </em>703 F.2d 1233, 1242 (11th Cir.1983), and cases cited therein. In the instant case, the insufficiency of the ALJ\u2019s reasons for rejecting the subjective evidence is particularly crucial because the only direct evidence produced from the disabling period is the subjective testimony of claimant and her daughter. No other evidence discussed by the ALJ refutes or otherwise contradicts this subjective evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-5\">These apparent deficiencies in the ALJ\u2019s finding as to claimant\u2019s subjective evidence are inconsequential, however, if the ALJ simply did not believe the testimony of claimant and her daughter. Conversely, unless the ALJ found that the testimony of the claimant and her daughter was not credible and such a finding is readily apparent to this reviewing court, the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that petitioner was not disabled does not satisfy the substantial evidence standard of review. Thus, the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination is the critical factor in our decision upon review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-7\">An agency\u2019s rejection of uncontradicted testimony can support a finding of substantial evidence. See <em>NLRB v. Walton Mfg. Co., </em>369 U.S. 404, 82 S.Ct. 853, 7 L.Ed.2d 829 (1962); <em>NLRB v. Florida Citrus Canners Co-op., </em>311 F.2d 541 (5th Cir.1963). <em>But </em>see <em>Dickinson v. United States, </em>346 U.S. 389, 74 S.Ct. 152, 98 L.Ed. 132 (1953) (holding that evidence presented must be accepted as true unless impeached or contradicted). See <em>generally </em>Mezines, Stein &amp; Gruff, <em>Administrative Law, </em>\u00a7 51.02, at 51-34 to -36. Where, as in the instant case, an agency\u2019s credibility determination is crucial to the reviewing court\u2019s conclusion under the substantial evidence test, the ALJ must have made a sufficient finding as to the witness\u2019 credibility. Some courts have been more demanding than others in their determination of a \u201csufficient\u201d finding as to credibility. The more strict approach requires \u201cthat there be an explicit finding whether the Secretary believed or disbelieved the claimant whenever the claimant\u2019s credibility is a critical factor in the Secretary\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>See Lewin </em>v. <em>Schweiker, </em>654 F.2d 631, 634-35 (9th Cir.1981), and cases cited therein; <em>Duncan v. Harris, </em>518 F.Supp. 751, 756 (E.D.Ark.1980); <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>476 F.Supp. 984, 986 (E.D.Ark. 1979). <em>See also White Globe Bldg. Maintenance </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>518 F.2d 1271, 1276 (9th Cir.1975). The more lenient approach does not require an explicit finding as to credibility where the claimant\u2019s testimony was clearly, though implicitly, discredited. <em>See Acevedo Ramirez v. Secretary of HEW, </em>550 F.2d 1286, 1287 (1st Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-9\">The law in this circuit appears to be somewhere between the \u201cstrict\u201d and \u201clenient\u201d approaches. <em>See, e.g., Boyd, supra, </em>704 F.2d at 1210 (noting that \u201c[b]y implying [a credibility] determination rather than expressly stating it, the ALJ has succeeded in muddying the waters ... \u201d). <em>Cf. Dobrowolsky v. Califano, </em>606 F.2d 403, 409 (3d Cir. 1979), <em>quoting Baerga v. Richardson, </em>500 F.2d 309, 312 (3d Cir.1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 931, 95 S.Ct. 1133, 43 L.Ed.2d 403 (1975). In <em>Allen v. Schweiker, </em>642 F.2d 799 (5th Cir.1981), petitioner challenged the Secretary\u2019s denial of disability insurance benefits on the ground that the ALJ failed to make an adequate finding of fact regarding the credibility of his former wife\u2019s testimony. Both Allen and his wife testified as to his disability. The judge specifically found that Allen\u2019s testimony, the primary evidence in support of his alleged disability, was not credible. No such finding, however, was made as to the testimony of Allen\u2019s former spouse. Nevertheless, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>court found that the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination as to the spouse was clearly implied by the explicit ruling as to Allen\u2019s testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-5\">Although this circuit does not require an explicit finding as to credibility, as <em>Allen </em>indicates, the implication must be obvious to the reviewing court. This degree of precision is consistent with the specificity required generally of administrative adjudications. Where an agency\u2019s decision concerns specific persons based upon determination of particular facts and the application of general principles to those facts, courts \u201cexpect the parties to present specific evidence and closely reasoned arguments, and ... demand that the decisionmaker\u2019s opinion indicate an appropriate consideration of the evidence and arguments presented.\u201d <em>Harborlite Corp. v. ICC, </em>613 F.2d 1088, 1093 n. 11 (D.C.Cir.1979). Thus, where proof of a disability is based upon subjective evidence and a credibility determination is, therefore, a critical factor in the Secretary\u2019s decision, the ALJ must either explicitly discredit such testimony or the implication must be so clear as to amount to a specific credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-6\">In the instant case, the implied credibility finding is not sufficiently clear to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that the petitioner\u2019s subjective evidence does not establish a disability. As in <em>Allen, </em>both the claimant and a close family member offered complementary testimony as to the claimant\u2019s disability. In <em>Allen, </em>however, the ALJ specifically found that the claimant\u2019s testimony was not credible. 642 F.2d at 801. Although the ALJ made no specific finding as to the claimant\u2019s spouse, her testimony was to the same effect as that of the claimant. Therefore, in light of the ALJ\u2019s ultimate finding of no disability, the implication was obvious that the ALJ did not regard the testimony of claimant\u2019s spouse as credible. By comparison, in the instant case, we must infer such a finding, if at all, solely from the ALJ\u2019s ultimate finding. We hold that such an implication is too subtle to measure up to the degree of precision required of adjudicative fact-finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-7\">Accordingly, we remand to the Secretary with instructions to articulate its credibility determination with sufficient clarity to allow us to determine whether the ultimate finding of no disability is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-8\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1348-14\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
