HENDERSON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">The appellant, Liberty Lobby, publishes the Spotlight, a weekly newspaper distributed nationally by subscription. E. Howard Hunt, the appellee, brought this action against Liberty Lobby in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida seeking damages for libel based upon an article appearing in the August 14, 1978 edition of the Spotlight.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury returned a verdict for Hunt in the amount of $100,000.00 compensatory and $550,000.00 punitive damages. On appeal Liberty Lobby makes several assignments of error including insufficiency of the evidence of actual malice, incorrect jury instructions, erroneous admission of certain affidavits into evidence and improper venue. Because the sufficiency of the evidence is vigorously contested, we begin with a thorough description of the pertinent facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-14\">The front page of the August 14, 1978 Spotlight announced in bold face type: \u201cCIA TO NAIL HUNT FOR KENNEDY KILLING\u201d. The headline referred the reader to page four for the details. On page four a larger headline stated \u201cCIA TO \u2018ADMIT\u2019 HUNT INVOLVEMENT IN KENNEDY SLAYING.\u201d A biography of Victor Marchetti, the author of the article, appeared on this page. This brief background of the author explained that Mar-chetti \u201chas been involved in U.S. Intelligence activities for almost 20 years, 14 years of that time being with the CIA, the last three years of which he was staff assistant to Richard Helms. He is the author of \u2018The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence\u2019 and \u2018The Rope Dancer.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-15\">The text of the article revealed an elaborate plot within the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA-) to frame Hunt for the Kennedy assassination. We quote the pertinent passages at length in order to avoid any distortion of the article\u2019s meaning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-16\">A few months ago, in March, there was a meeting at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., the plush home of America\u2019s super spooks overlooking the Potomac River. It was attended by several high-level clandestine officers and some former top officials of the agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-17\">The topic of discussion was: What to do about recent revelations associating President Kennedy\u2019s accused assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, with the spy game played between the U.S. and the USSR? (SPOTLIGHT, May 8, 1978.) A decision was made, and a course of action determined They were calculated to both fascinate and confuse the public by staging a clever \u2018limited hangout\u2019 when the House Special Committee on Assassina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>tions (HSCA) holds its open hearings, beginning later this month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"App4\">A \u2018limited hangout\u2019 is spy jargon for a favorite and frequently used gimmick of the clandestine professionals. When their veil of secrecy is shredded and they can no longer rely on a phony cover story to misinform the public, they resort to admitting sometimes even volunteering \u2014 some of the truth while still managing to withhold the key and damaging \u201e , . facts m the case. The public, however, is ,, ... , , ,, .4, usually so intrigued by the new information that it never thinks to pursue the matter further.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8e\">,ir , ,, \u201e. , , , We will probably never find out who masterminded the assassination of JFK- or why. There are too many powerful special interests connected with the conspiracy for the truth to come out even now, 15 years after the murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"agp-dedup-0\">But during the next two months, according to sensitive sources in the CIA and on HSCA, we are going to learn much more about the crime. The new disclosures will be sensational, but only superficially so. A few of the lesser villains involved in the conspiracy and its subsequent coverup will be identified for the first time \u2014 and allowed to twist slowly in the wind on live network TV. Most of the others to be fingered are already dead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-38\">But once again the good folks of middle America will be hoodwinked by the government and its allies in the establishment news media. In fact, we are being set up to witness yet another coverup, albeit a sophisticated one, designed by the CIA with the assistance of the FBI and the blessing of the Carter administration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ako-dedup-0\">A classic example of a limited hangout is how the CIA handled \u2014 and manipula!-ed-the Church Committee\u2019s investigation of two years ago. The committee learned nothing more about the assassinations of foreign leaders, illicit drug programs, or the penetration of the news media than the CIA allowed it to discover. And this is precisely what the CIA is out to accomplish through HSCA with regard to JFK\u2019s murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aza-dedup-0\">THEY\u2019LL HANG HUNT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Avj\">Chief among those to be exposed by the new investigation will be E. Howard Hunt, of Watergate fame. His luck has run 0ut, and the CIA has decided to sacri-fjce him to protect its clandestine services. The agency is furious with Hunt for having dragged it publicly into the Nixon mess and for having blackmailed it after he was arrested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9c\">_ ., TBesides, Hunt is vulnerable \u2014 an easy target, as they say m the spy business TT.&amp; \u2019 ,. <em>J i . </em>, , , ^ reputation and integrity have been destroyed. The death of his wife Dorothy, m a mysterious plane crash m Chicago still disturbs many Peo/e\u2019 esPecially smce tbe,re wfre rum&lt;f ^om informed sources ithat she was ^ ,to leave him and Per^aPs even turn on him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3x4\">In addition it is well known that Hunt hated JFK and blamed him for the Bay of Pigs disaster. And now, in recent months, his alibi for his whereabouts on the day of the shooting has come unstuck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-MW\">In the public hearings, the CIA will \u2018admit\u2019 that Hunt was involved in the conspiracy to kill Kennedy. The CIA may go -so far as to \u2018admit\u2019 that there were three gunmen shooting at Kennedy. The FBI, while publicly embracing the Warren Commission\u2019s \u2018one man, acting alone\u2019 conclusion, has always privately known that there were three gunmen. The conspiracy involved many more people than the ones who actually fired at Kennedy, both agencies may now admit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD66\">pn&lt;?TNr A &lt;5 rttm</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFQ\">AJ- Weberman and Michael Canfield, authors of Coup d etat In America, published Pictures of three apparent bums who were attested at Dealy Plaza Just after President Kennedy s murder, but w^\u00b0 were strangely released without any record of the arrest having been made by Hallas police. One of the tramps the authors identified as Hunt. Another was Frank Sturgis, a long-time agent of Hunts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ae8-dedup-0\">Hunt immediately sued for millions of dollars in damages, claiming he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>prove that he had been in Washington, D C, that day \u2014 on duty at CIA. It turned out, however, that this was not true. So, he said that he had been on leave and doing household errands, including a shopping trip to a grocery store in Chinatown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-4\">Weberman and Canfield investigated the new alibi and found that the grocery store where Hunt claimed to be shopping never existed. At this point, Hunt offered to drop his suit for a token payment of one dollar. But the authors were determined to vindicate themselves, and they continued to attack Hunt\u2019s alibi, ultimately completely shattering it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">Now, the CIA moved to finger Hunt and tie him to the JFK assassination. HSCA unexpectedly received an internal CIA memorandum a few weeks ago that the agency just happened to stumble across in its old files. It was dated 1966 and said in essence: Some day we will have to explain Hunt\u2019s presence in Dallas on November 22,1963 \u2014 the day President Kennedy was killed. Hunt is going to be hard put to explain this memo, and other things, before the TV cameras at the HSCA hearings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-6\">Hunt\u2019s reputation as a strident, fanatical anti-communist will count against him. So will his long and close relationship with the anti-Castro Cubans, as well as his penchant for clandestine dirty tricks and his various capers while one of Nixon\u2019s plumbers. E. Howard Hunt will be implicated in the conspiracy, and he will not dare to speak out \u2014 the CIA will see to that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">The article also included a photograph of Hunt captioned \u201cHoward Hunt \u2014 He\u2019ll be thrown to the wolves.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AK-y\">Shortly after this edition was distributed, Hunt contacted his attorney, who, in turn, wrote to the appellant demanding a retraction. In response, Liberty Lobby indicated that it would make a \u201cthorough and conscientious\u201d investigation of the matter. When the results of this \u201cinvestigation\u201d were not forthcoming after three weeks, Hunt\u2019s attorney again communicated with the appellant inquiring into the status of the matter. In the final letter that preceded the institution of the law suit, Liberty Lobby professed its confidence in the accuracy of Marchetti\u2019s article. The letter offered Hunt the opportunity to come to the appellant\u2019s office in Washington, D.C. to present his side of the story in an interview with Liberty Lobby employees'to be published in an upcoming edition of the Spotlight. Dissatisfied with this proposal, Hunt filed his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">The trial of the case was simplified by two concessions made by the parties. First, Hunt stipulated that he is a \u201cpublic figure\u201d and accordingly, that he was required to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Liberty Lobby published any falsehoods contained in Marchetti\u2019s article with \u201cactual malice\u201d as that term is defined in <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964). Second, Liberty Lobby acknowledged that Hunt was not in Dallas, Texas on the day that President Kennedy was murdered.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, Hunt was relieved of any burden of proving that he, in fact, did not kill the President.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">Hunt\u2019s evidence at the trial consisted of (1) his extensive live testimony; (2) the deposition testimony of Edward J. Dunn, Jr. and Walter Kuzmak, personal acquaintances of Hunt; (3) the deposition testimony of Willis Carto and James P. Tucker, the Chairman of the Executive Committee and the managing editor of the Spotlight respectively; (4) the original manuscript of Marchetti\u2019s article witli the handwritten changes made by Carto and Tucker; and (5) three affidavits from CIA officials that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>each had searched the CIA files for memo-randa pertaining to Hunt\u2019s whereabouts on the day that Kennedy was killed and had found no such records. Liberty Lobby called only one witness, Robert Bartel, the Chairman of the Board of Policies of Liberty Lobby. Marchetti did not testify at the trial, nor did either party take his deposition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Hunt\u2019s testimony covered several areas. He' described his background with the CIA including his involvement in the Bay of Pigs invasion. He recounted his role in the \u201cWatergate\u201d break-in, admitting that he pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges arising therefrom and served thirty-three months in prison. It was brought out that Hunt was a prolific writer of mystery novels and considered himself to be an experienced journalist. Hunt recalled the effects that the publication of Marchetti\u2019s article had on him, expressing his opinion that it had a serious negative impact both on his personal and professional life. In an effort to illustrate the depth of his reaction, he stated that he demanded to appear before the House Assassinations Committee in order to clear his name.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Hunt was also questioned about publications prior to the Spotlight story linking him with the assassination. Hunt stated that other writers had advanced the proposition that he was involved in a conspiracy to murder the President. He described his public denials of any involvement and introduced press clippings reporting his protestations of innocence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">During his direct examination Hunt stated that he had filed lawsuits against the authors of publications which accused him of participation in President Kennedy\u2019s murder. He said that he sued the \u201cNational Tattler\u201d for such a story, but that its publisher went bankrupt \u201ccoincidentally with my receiving a default judgment in federal court.\u201d Tr. 76. Hunt also testified that he presently had pending a suit against the authors of a book entitled \u201cCoup d\u2019etat in America.\u201d According to Hunt, this book, which was published in 1975,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ-\">dealt with the so-called tramps, the three bums found located and photographed in Dallas on the day of President Kennedy\u2019s assassination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-12\">There were some photographs, overlays that were submitted with the book which purported to prove or at least very strongly suggest that I was one of the bums, and by virtue of that alleged connection, I was supposed to have been one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>of the conspirators in the death of our President.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Tr. 85. Hunt\u2019s testimony established that these lawsuits were instituted prior to the publication of the August 14, 1978 Spotlight.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The bulk of Hunt\u2019s time on the witness stand focused on the Spotlight article itself including Hunt\u2019s opinion of the impression conveyed by the article and the accuracy of the statements contained therein. Hunt stated that the headline \u201cCIA to Nail Hunt for Kennedy Killing\u201d meant that \u201cI was going to be hung for the killing of John F Kennedy.\u201d He testified that the headline, \u201cCIA to \u2018Admit\u2019 Hunt Involvement in Kennedy Slaying\u201d was an expansion of the first headline, although he did not understand the import of the term \u201cadmit.\u201d According to Hunt, the headlines \u201csaid to me, and I had to look at these things in terms of what another might infer ..., that I was going to be charged federally for the killing of John F. Kennedy.\u201d Tr. 221-22. He also stated that the subheadline \u201cPosing as a Bum\u201d said \u201cin effect that Hunt had been posing as one of the three ... bums in Dallas on the day of Kennedy\u2019s assassination.\u201d Tr. 243. Finally, his attorney took him, line-by-line, through the article, questioning him about the truth of each statement. Hunt responded that virtually every assertion was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Hunt\u2019s proof then focused on the development of the article. For this evidence, Hunt relied upon the deposition testimony of Willis Carto and James Tucker from the Liberty Lobby. In essence, both testified that they relied upon Marchetti\u2019s reputation in deciding to publish his story. They each testified that Marchetti had submitted articles which had been published in the Spotlight in the past without complaint. When questioned about their independent verification of the information, each stated that they trusted Marchetti and that Marchetti assured them that his sources were reliable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> According to their testimony, each thought very highly of Marchetti, believed him to have access to high level confidential information and, in general, felt they had no reason to doubt the veracity of his article.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">Tucker testified that he asked Marchetti many questions about the article in an effort to ensure that they were on \u201csolid\u201d ground. For example, Tucker said that he asked Marchetti if he had seen the 1966 CIA memorandum referred to in the article and that his recollection of Marchetti\u2019s response was that Marchetti stated: \u201c[i]t was shown to me. I was allowed to stand there and read it and give it back.\u201d Tr. 373. Tucker indicated that he participated in \u201cseveral phone calls [and] discussions\u201d with Marchetti about the article, and that, although he was never told the names of any of Marchetti\u2019s sources, Marchetti\u2019s reassurances of the truth of the story convinced him of its validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">Carto and Tucker were questioned extensively about one notation made by Carto on Marchetti\u2019s manuscript. Appearing next to the following paragraph was the remark, <em>\u201cConfirm </em>this!\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-11\">A.J. Weberman and Michael Canfield, authors of \u2018Coup d\u2019etat In America,\u2019 published pictures of three apparent bums who were arrested at Dealy Plaza just after President Kennedy\u2019s murder, but who were strangely released without any record of the arrest having been made by Dallas police. One of the tramps<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the authors identified as Hunt. Another as Frank Sturgis, a long-time agent of Hunt\u2019s. Hunt immediately sued for mil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>lions of dollars in damages, claiming he could prove that he had been in Washington, D.C., that day \u2014 on duty at CIA. It turned out, however, that this was not true.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> So he said that he was on leave and doing household errands, including a shopping trip to a grocery store in Chinatown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Pl.Ex. 10.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Carto\u2019s answers to questions concerning this notation were confusing at best. He stated that he did write it and that Tucker was to be responsible for obtaining the confirmation. It is not clear from his testimony, however, precisely what information he sought. At one point his testimony appears to focus on the fact that Hunt had filed a lawsuit. At another, he indicated that he wanted confirmation that Hunt was not in Washington on the fateful day.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Carto was also ambiguous with respect to his receipt of the demanded confirmation. He indicated that he was sure that Tucker reported back that \u201cit was true,\u201d but could not recall whether Tucker said how he had confirmed it. He then stated that Tucker \u201cgot the information\u201d about the lawsuit \u201cincluded.\u201d Later, he was not sure that Tucker \u201cchecked out the lawsuit per se.\u201d Tr. 337. When asked why he felt the information needed confirmation, Carto replied that he felt that it is \u201cprudent at all times to cheek facts in which there is any degree of unclearness \u2014 of unclarity\u201d and that because he \u201cwas unaware of this suit and wanted to know more about it,\u201d he sought the information. Tr. 307-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-16\">Tucker\u2019s testimony was equally unenlightening. He stated that he was responsible for obtaining the confirmation and that he understood the mark to refer to the paragraph beginning with \u201cHunt immediately sued ... . \u201d He said that although he could not remember how he confirmed the lawsuit, he probably would have telephoned Marchetti to determine where the lawsuit had been filed and then would have telephoned a newspaper in that town to ask the details.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He remembered it being confirmed to his satisfaction by talking to \u201cHunt\u2019s lawyer or a lawyer for the other side of the issue, his office, or things of that nature.\u201d Tr. 400. His testimony suggests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>that he also believed that he was supposed to substantiate the statement rebutting Hunt\u2019s claim that he was in Washington, D.C.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Later, when Hunt\u2019s attorney asked Tucker if he independently verified Hunt\u2019s \u201calibi\u201d that he was at a Chinese grocery store, he replied that he believed he found the name of the shop in the Weberman and Canfield book and that after learning the name he could not find a \u201clisting\u201d for it. Tr. 404. After this, he stated that he was satisfied that the statement was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">An attempt was also made to discover whether Carto and Tucker knew of Hunt\u2019s public denials of complicity in the death of the President, and, if so, whether such denials caused them any concern with regard to the publication of Marchetti\u2019s article. Car-to had read Hunt\u2019s denials. When asked whether the fact that Hunt sued others who had accused him of involvement in the Kennedy assassination raised questions in his mind, Carto replied, \u201cWell, no, because we weren\u2019t making any such accusations.\u201d Tr. 357. The only reference to Hunt\u2019s public denials during Tucker\u2019s testimony appears in the context of his confirmation of the lawsuit mentioned in the article. According to Tucker, that fact did not \u201coverwhelm\u201d him because people are always suing newspapers. He testified that the lawsuit \u201cProbably made me call Victor up one more time.\u201d Tr. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Another line of inquiry related to litigation between Marchetti and the CIA. Car-to and Tucker were aware, prior to publication, that the CIA had obtained an injunction against Marchetti to prevent the publication of secrets he learned while with that agency, in violation of an oath of secrecy. Hunt\u2019s attorney questioned Carto and Tucker concerning the effect the injunction had on their assessment of Marchetti and his article. Carto first stated that he did not regard this development as a cause to question Marchetti\u2019s integrity \u2014 that it was \u201ca highly political matter.\u201d Tr. 331. Later, however, he changed the tone of his response:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-13\">Q. Did that give rise to any suspicion on your part that Mr. Marchetti might have been prejudiced against the CIA in the manuscript that he submitted to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-14\">A. Well, he certainly was at odds with certain groups within the CIA, but by the same token he had and I assume still has friends among other groups within the CIA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-15\">Q. That didn\u2019t make you question anything he wrote about the CIA then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-16\">A. Oh, absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-17\">Q. It did or it did not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-18\">A. It did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-19\">Q. And did you question him on what he wrote?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-20\">A. Well, you can see I did question on the manuscript.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Tr. 340-41.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Tucker considered the injunction, but he \u201caccepted [Marchetti\u2019s] premise that he would not reveal no [sic] information that actually \u2014 and had not \u2014 that would actually damage his own country.\u201d After explaining that most classified information has \u201cnothing to do with national security,\u201d he said that he decided that \u201cthe CIA doesn\u2019t have too much trouble getting a court injunction.\u201d Tr. 419-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">Another line of inquiry focused on the length of time the article remained in Liberty Lobby\u2019s possession before it was published and whether time constraints influenced the date of publication. Carto could not recall when the article was received or the relationship of the date of receipt to the deadline. He testified that they \u201cmay have had the article sitting around for weeks before we used it.\u201d Tr. 349. Tucker testified that the first time he saw the manuscript was a \u201cfew days before it was published.\u201d He also stated that \u201cwe had the copy for a few days at least, if not weeks, before we carried it in the paper. It may have been around for a while. I just don\u2019t recall.\u201d Tr. 374. Tucker did not regard the story as a \u201chot\u201d item but felt that they would have been conscious of the fact that it needed to be published before the upcoming hearings \u2014 that there was a \u201ctime factor involved.\u201d Tr. 374-75. He concluded, however, -that he had sufficient time to check out the story prior to publication. Tr. 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Another significant area covered by the depositions of Carto and Tucker dealt with the drafting of the headlines and subhead-lines that appeared in the publication. The testimony and the marked-up version of the manuscript confirmed that the original title assigned by Marchetti was \u201cThe JFK Assassination: New Developments and Another Cover-Up.\u201d According to Carto, Tucker was responsible for drafting the new headlines and he did not believe that he saw them before publication. In Carto\u2019s view, the purpose of headlines is twofold: to fit a certain available space and to \u201cget the interest of the reader and relate to the contents of the story.\u201d Tr. 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">Tucker was more expansive in his testimony. He explained that he always redrafts the headlines in articles submitted by free lancers. When asked why he chose the wording \u201cCIA to Nail Hunt for Kennedy Killing\u201d he answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-10\">Now, I considered it a flareful thing \u2014 not to say that Hunt killed Kennedy, but to say that the CIA is going to finger him or the CIA to nail Hunt for Kennedy assassination or killing, or to finger him \u2014 my own construction of it is to blame, being synonymous with to blame Hunt for it. Something of that nature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">Tr. 368. After this analysis, Tucker was asked whether he talked to anyone about the impression given by the headline. His response was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-12\">That\u2019s an interesting question. We often do that and all newspapers do. And you don\u2019t show the guy the story, don\u2019t let him know anything about it. What does that tell you? That if somebody said to me, \u2018Well, the Spotlight is saying Hunt killed Kennedy\u2019 and I would say, \u2018Kill the headline.\u2019 Even if I could defend it in a semantic argument we are still putting the paper out for Miss Mergatroid in Timbuktu and her first reaction to the headline we want to be accurate.

Actual malice is defined as a statement made \u201cwith knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279-80, 84 S.Ct. at 726, 11 L.Ed.2d at 706.

Penthouse International, Ltd., </em>691 F.2d 666, 670 (4th Cir.1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Our examination of the appellate court opinions also reveals that actual malice may be inferred in another circumstance in which the defendant protests his innocence. In <em>Buckley v. Littell, </em>539 F.2d 882 (2d Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1062, 97 S.Ct. 785, 50 L.Ed.2d 777 (1977), the author published a statement to the effect that William F. Buckley could be sued for libel. At the trial, the author suggested that he did not intend to label Buckley a libeler\u2014 that his metaphor was meant only to criticize Buckley\u2019s \u201chounding\u201d of certain people.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Second Circuit upheld a finding of actual malice, reasoning that the clear meaning to be inferred from the publication was that the author accused Buckley of making libelous statements. <em>Id. </em>at 896. Thus, the trial court was free to reject the author\u2019s assertion that he did not intend the statement to be interpreted in that manner. Similarly, in <em>Montandon v. Triangle Publications, Inc., </em>45 Cal.App.3d 938, 120 Cal. Rptr. 186, <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 893, 96 S.Ct. 193, 46 L.Ed.2d 126 (1975), the California appellate court found that actual malice had been established when the defendant published an article containing a defamatory statement, even though the publisher testified that he did not interpret it in that manner. The defendants in <em>Montandon </em>edited a press release for a television show on which the plaintiff was scheduled to appear. The description of the upcoming program circulated in the press release originally stated: \u201cFRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 20TH, 10:30 P.M., PAT MICHAELS SHOW, FROM PARTY-GIRL TO CALL-GIRL? How far can the \u2018party-girl\u2019 go until she becomes a \u2018call-girl\u2019 is discussed with T-V personality Pat Montandon, author (\u2018How to be a Party-Girl\u2019) and a masked-anonymous prostitute!\u201d After the defendants edited this report, the following excerpt was printed in the TV Guide: \u201cPat Michaels\u2014 Discussion, \u2018From Party Girl to Call Girl.\u2019 Scheduled guest: TV Personality Pat Mon-tandon and author of \u2018How to Be a Party Girl.\u2019 \u201d 45 Cal.App.3d at 942-43, 120 Cal. Rptr. at 188. The defendants claimed that they did not believe that the program note labeled Ms. Montandon a call girl. The court affirmed a finding of actual malice, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-9\">This testimony flies in the face of reason, as a reading of the program note reveals</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A51F\">The action by the TV Guide staff showed a reckless disregard of whether the statement published was true or false, because the staff was aware that the true facts, as stated in the press release, were that Pat Montandon was not a call girl but would be appearing on a show with a call girl; and a staff decision was made to leave out crucial facts in rewriting the release, thereby implying that plaintiff was a call girl. This is proof of convincing clarity to support the jury\u2019s verdict that'the article was published not in good faith, but with actual malice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number><em>Id. </em>45 Cal.App.3d at 943-44,120 Cal.Rptr. at 189. Under the <em>Montandon </em>decision, an inference of actual malice can be drawn when a defendant publishes a defamatory statement that contradicts information known to him, even when the defendant testifies that he believed that the statement was not defamatory and was consistent with the facts within his knowledge.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">With these principles in mind, we conclude that Hunt met his burden of proving with convincing clarity that Liberty Lobby published the article with actual malice. The jury found that the article was both libelous and false and Liberty Lobby does not challenge that determination.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Thus, assuming the falsity of the article, we turn to the evidence before the jury that the appellant knew it was false or entertained serious doubts about its truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">First, there is evidence that Liberty Lobby had reason to, and in fact did, question Marchetti\u2019s neutrality in reporting on CIA matters. The article disclosed a CIA scheme to mislead Congress and the American public apparently to cover up the role that it purportedly played in the assassination of President Kennedy. Needless to say, it displayed a highly inflammatory opinion of the agency. Carto testified that he knew Marchetti had been involved in litigation with the CIA and that fact \u201cabsolutely\u201d caused him to question what Marchetti wrote about the CIA. This evidence provides a clear and compelling inference that Liberty Lobby had \u201cobvious reasons to doubt the veracity of the informant or the accuracy of his reports.\u201d <em>St. Amant, </em>390 U.S. at 732, 88 S.Ct. at 1326, 20 L.Ed.2d at 268. <em>See also, Gertz, </em>680 F.2d at 538. Although Carto said he did question Marchetti \u201con the manuscript,\u201d the only reference thereto was the notation <em>\u201cConfirm </em>this!\u201d That remark apparently referred to Hunt\u2019s lawsuit against the authors of \u201cCoup d\u2019etat in America\u201d concerning his \u201calibi.\u201d Thus, the jury could reasonably conclude that Carto did not follow up on his doubts about Marchetti\u2019s neutrality prior to publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">Furthermore, it is clear that the article was not \u201chot news.\u201d Neither Carto nor Tucker could remember when the article was received, but Tucker did not regard it as a \u201chot\u201d item and had sufficient time to check it out before publication. While Mar-chetti\u2019s undisclosed sources would have been difficult if not impossible to verify, other information contained in the article was capable of confirmation. Liberty Lobby only sought confirmation of the details of Hunt\u2019s lawsuit and the \u201ctruth\u201d of his \u201calibi.\u201d Carto obviously had a question about Marchetti\u2019s information. However, he could not remember what, if anything, Tucker found out, although he said he was satisfied that \u201cit was true.\u201d Tucker was equally ambiguous, indicating that he might have called a newspaper in the city in which the action was pending (although he never states affirmatively that he did so), or that he asked Marchetti about it, or that he looked in the telephone book to see if the Chinese grocery where Hunt allegedly said he was shopping in 1963 existed in 1978.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> When a story is not \u201chot news,\u201d \u201cactual malice may be inferred when the investigation ... was grossly inadequate in the circumstances.\u201d <em>Vandenburg I, </em>441 F.2d at 380. We believe that the jury could properly decide that Liberty Lobby\u2019s \u201cinvestigation\u201d did not pass muster and, accordingly, infer actual malice therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">Next, the jury could have also inferred actual malice from the inherent improbabil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>ity of the story. <em>St. Amant, </em>390 U.S. at 732, 88 S.Ct. at 1326, 20 L.Ed.2d at 268. Of course, Carto and Tucker said they believed the information was plausible. However, the jury was under no obligation to credit this testimony. <em>Id. </em>The jury certainly could have determined that \u201conly a reckless man\u201d would circulate a story announcing that the CIA was going to cover up its role in the Kennedy murder by admitting that E. Howard Hunt was involved without official permission. Contrary to the appellant\u2019s assertion, Hunt\u2019s testimony that he thought the story could be true does not negate the inference to be drawn from inherent improbability. We firmly believe that even if Hunt thought the CIA might engage in such conduct, a jury could constitutionally view the story as inherently improbable.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Finally, we. think that the jury could infer actual malice from the headlines. The original title submitted by Marchetti was \u201cThe JFK Assassination: New Developments and Another Coverup.\u201d Tucker substituted the following headlines and subheadlines: \u201cCIA to Nail Hunt for Kennedy Killing,\u201d \u201cCIA to \u2018Admit\u2019 Hunt Involvement in Kennedy Slaying,\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ll Hang Hunt,\u201d \u201cPosing as a Bum.\u201d According to Tucker, he thought the choice of headlines in this instance was a \u201cflareful thing\u201d and he would have \u201ckilled\u201d the headlines if anyone told him that the Spotlight was saying \u201cHunt killed Kennedy.\u201d Carto and Tucker each professed to believe that the headlines conveyed the contents of the story. Tucker\u2019s stated purpose in redrafting the headlines was to explain that the CIA was going to \u201cblame\u201d Hunt for the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Although Liberty Lobby insists that the headlines were only meant to reveal a plan to falsely accuse or frame Hunt, it is obvious that the headlines could have conveyed the impression to a fact finder that Hunt was involved in the assassination. Viewing the headlines alone, the jury could have reasonably found that the Spotlight simply was reporting a truthful accusation by a federal government agency. Tucker\u2019s reference to the headlines as a \u201cflareful thing,\u201d indicates, contrary to his testimony, that he knowingly chose language that was subject to a false and highly defamatory interpretation. Under these circumstances, a finding of actual malice is constitutionally permissible. <em>Cf. Buckley, </em>539 F.2d at 896; <em>Montandon, </em>45 Cal.App.3d at 934-44, 120 Cal.Rptr. at 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">The sum total of the inferences of actual malice properly drawn from Hunt\u2019s proof constitutes clear and convincing evidence to support the jury\u2019s determination. The jury simply was not required to believe the appellant\u2019s professions of good faith. Hunt successfully compiled enough evidence to satisfy the constitutional restrictions placed upon public figures in libel litigation. We are conscious of the relatively high standard of proof required in such cases, but a jury verdict based on evidence which satisfies that burden can, and should, withstand strict appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">\n<em>Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">The appellant assigns as error the district court\u2019s instructions to the jury on actual malice, punitive damages and respondeat superior.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">A. <em>Responsible Publisher Instruction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"auv-dedup-0\">[H] After the district judge instructed the jury on Hunt\u2019s burden to prove actual malice by clear and convincing evidence, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-11\">A public figure may recover damages for a defamatory falsehood whose substance makes substantial danger to reputation apparent on a showing of highly unreasonable conduct constituting an extreme departure from the standards of investigating and reporting ordinarily adhered to by responsible publishers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-12\">Tr. 515. Liberty Lobby did not object to this instruction. Elsewhere in the court\u2019s charge, appears a more detailed explanation of the proof of actual malice. In that portion, no reference was made to the standards ordinarily adhered to by responsible publishers.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-13\">The appellant maintains that this \u201cresponsible publisher\u201d charge permits recov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>ery by a public figure based on an insufficient showing of actual malice. The instruction was requested by Hunt with a citation to <em>Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, </em>388 U.S. 130, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094 (1967). In <em>Curtis Publishing, </em>Justice Harlan\u2019s plurality opinion contained that language as a suggested standard for public figure, as opposed to public official, cases. However, a majority of the court in <em>Curtis Publishing </em>did not endorse this instruction. Four justices concurred in Chief Justice Warren\u2019s separate opinion which rejected the responsible publisher standard, holding that public figures must make the same showing as public officials \u2014 proof that the publisher in fact knew the material was false or that he in fact entertained serious doubts as to its truth. The cases since <em>Curtis Publishing </em>have disapproved an objective standard such as that suggested by Justice Harlan and given in this case. <em>See, e.g., Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974); <em>Long v. Arcell, </em>618 F.2d 1145 (5th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1083, 101 S.Ct. 869, 66 L.Ed.2d 808 (1981); <em>Ryan v. Brooks, </em>634 F.2d 726, 731 (4th Cir.1980). \u201cThe test of actual malice is not whether the defendant acted as a reasonable publisher would have acted under the circumstances. Rather, the inquiry focuses on the defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time of publication.\u201d <em>Long, </em>618 F.2d 1147.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">Thus, it is clear to us that the instruction taken from the <em>Curtis Publishing </em>plurality opinion was error. In spite of this infirmity, Liberty Lobby did not object to it as required by Rule 51 of the Fed.R.Civ.P.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> A remand for a new trial is necessary only if the error is so fundamental that the failure to recognize it will result in a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Barnett v. Housing Authority of the City of Atlanta, </em>707 F.2d 1571 at 1580 (11th Cir.1983); <em>Patton v. Archer, </em>590 F.2d 1319, 1322 (5th Cir.1979); <em>Delancey v. Motichek Towing Service, Inc., </em>427 F.2d 897, 901 (5th Cir.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Although the jury instructions in this case did contain the proper subjective guidelines for recovery by a public figure, they also authorized the jury to find liability based upon an improper objective standard. Much of Hunt\u2019s evidence centered on whether the appellant\u2019s conduct was unreasonable. Indeed, Hunt\u2019s opinion that, based upon his experience as a journalist, the appellant\u2019s actions were irresponsible was admitted into evidence. Based on this record, the jury could have imposed liability because it found that the appellant engaged in \u201chighly unreasonable conduct constituting an extreme departure from the standards of investigating and reporting ordinarily adhered to by responsible publishers,\u201d or it could have found that the appellant knew that the article was false or had serious doubts about its truth. We have no way of knowing the premise for this judgment. The Supreme Court has repeatedly cautioned that the preservation of the freedom of the press requires public figures and public officials to prove subjective actual malice. <em>See, e.g., Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974); <em>St. Amant v. Thompson, </em>390 U.S. 727, 88 S.Ct. 1323, 20 L.Ed.2d 262 (1968). Because we do not know whether the jury followed the constitutionally mandated criteria, a new trial will be necessary. <em>See Somer v. Johnson, </em>704 F.2d 1473, 1478 (11th Cir.1983) (new trial is required when both proper and improper instructions given because jury could have followed incorrect rule); <em>Johnson v. Bryant, </em>671 F.2d 1276, 1281 (11th Cir.1982). <em>Cf. Time, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>385 U.S. 374, 87 S.Ct. 534, 17 L.Ed.2d 456 (1967) (new trial mandated when jury charges permitted recovery based upon, <em>inter alia, </em>the failure to make a reasonable investigation, even though instructions ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>guably included the <em>New York Times </em>actual malice rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">B. <em>Respondeat Superior Liability.</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The appellant also contends that the trial court erred in its instruction on respondeat superior liability. While the appellant concedes that it is vicariously liable for the actions of Carto and Tucker, it vigorously argues that it cannot be held accountable for Marchetti\u2019s conduct. In essence, it claims that Marchetti\u2019s <em>state of mind, </em>for the purpose of finding actual malice, may not be imputed to the publisher because Marchetti was an independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">The district court charged the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-7\">When a corporation is involved, of course, it may act only through natural persons as its agents or employees, and in general any agent or employee of a corporation may bind the corporation by his acts and declarations made while acting within the scope of his authority delegated to him by the corporation, or within the scope of his duties as an employee of the corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-8\">The court now instructs you that publishers can be held vicariously liable for knowing falsehood offered by freelance writers.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-9\">An act of an employee or agent, to become the act of Liberty Lobby, Inc., must be performed by the agent, while acting within the scope of his employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-12\">The court charges you as a matter of law, that before any acts of knowledge of Victor Marchetti or James P. Tucker may be imputed to the defendant, Liberty Lobby, Inc., plaintiff, must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant, Liberty Lobby, Inc., had actual knowledge of its facts and information, or that Marchetti and Tucker were acting in the scope of their employment when they performed the acts or required the information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-13\">Tr. 509-511.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-14\">Liberty Lobby made only a general, ambiguous objection to this instruction, stating that \u201c[t]here is no question we would be liable for anything Mr. Tucker might have done. He is sort of lumped in here where it says freelance writer and what-have-you.\u201d Tr. 463. We seriously doubt that this objection constituted a distinct statement of the matter to which the appellant objected and the grounds for its objection, <em>see </em>Fed.R. Civ.P. 51. It does not even raise the question of vicarious liability for Marchetti\u2019s actions. Nevertheless, because a new trial is required, we consider the appellant\u2019s current objection to the jury charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-15\">In <em>Cantrell v. Forest City Publishing Co., </em>419 U.S. 245, 95 S.Ct. 465, 42 L.Ed.2d 419 (1974), the Court approved of a jury charge which permitted the imposition of vicarious liability upon a publisher for the knowing falsehoods written by its <em>staff writer. </em>The Court found no fault with the traditional state law doctrine of respondeat superior in that context.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Here, it is conceded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Carto and Tuckers actual malice could be imputed to Liberty Lobby. Their roles with the newspaper enabled them to bind the appellant by their actions. To the extent that the vicarious liability instruction respecting Tucker tracks the charge in <em>Cantrell, </em>it is sufficient.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">The inclusion of Marchetti in the respon-deat superior instruction was not consistent with the evidence. Under Florida law, a principal is liable for the torts of his agents. <em>Nelson v. Shell Oil Co., </em>396 So.2d 752 (Fla. App.1981); <em>King </em>v. <em>Young, </em>107 So.2d 751 (Fla.App.1958). The test for imposing such vicarious liability is whether the agent or employee is subject to the control of his principal or employer. <em>Id. </em>Conversely, it is well established that an employer is not responsible for the torts of an \u201cindependent contractor.\u201d The \u201cstatus of an independent contractor, as distinguished from that of an agent, consists of a contractual relationship by one with another to perform something for him, but the one so engaged is not controlled or subject to the control of the other in the performance of the engagement .... \u201d <em>King, </em>107 So.2d at 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-13\">In his amended complaint, Hunt alleged that \u201cMarchetti is a citizen of the state of Virginia and is an independent contractor and freelance writer.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Consistent with this position, he did not attempt to prove his case on a vicarious liability theory as it pertained to Marchetti. His evidence focused on Carto and Tucker\u2019s actions in an effort to establish their actual malice imputable to the appellant. The record does not support a finding that the appellant controlled Marchetti in any manner.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Rather, from our reading of the record, it appears that the parties assumed that Mar-chetti was an independent contractor. Consequently, it was error to include Marchetti in an instruction on vicarious liability.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-14\">C. <em>Punitive Damages.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b745-15\">The district court instructed the jury that it could also award punitive damages if it found in favor of Hunt on his libel cause of action.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The court went on to explain that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>such damages would be proper if the jury determined that Liberty Lobby acted with \u201cmalice, wilfullness or callous and reckless indifference\u201d to Hunt\u2019s rights. Although the appellant did not object to this jury charge at the trial, it now complains that it was an incorrect statement of Florida law. Alternatively, it argues that punitive damages cannot be constitutionally imposed in public figure libel cases.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">In <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974), the Court held that a non-public figure could recover compensatory damages for libel without showing <em>New York Times </em>actual malice as long as he proved some degree of fault. However, the Court decided, such a person cannot recover <em>punitive </em>damages without demonstrating actual malice \u2014 \u201cthe States may not permit recovery of ... punitive damages ... when liability is not based on a showing of knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 349, 94 S.Ct. at 3011, 41 L.Ed.2d at 810. After <em>Gertz </em>there was some speculation that punitive damages could not be recovered by public figures because of the Court\u2019s clear aversion to such a penalty in first amendment cases. Nevertheless, as many courts have recognized, <em>Gertz </em>did not go that far. <em>See, e.g., Maheu v. Hughes Tool Co., </em>569 F.2d 459, 478-80 (9th Cir. 1977); <em>Appleyard </em>v. <em>Transamerican Press, Inc., </em>539 F.2d 1026, 1029-30 (4th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1041, 97 S.Ct. 740, 50 L.Ed.2d 753 (1977); <em>Carson v. Allied News Co., </em>529 F.2d 206, 214 (7th Cir.1976); <em>Davis v. Schuchat, </em>510 F.2d 731, 736-38 (D.C.Cir. 1975). Rather, punitive damages can be recovered consistently with the first amendment by public figures who are able to prove <em>New York Times </em>actual malice. <em>Id. </em>We decline to adopt a contrary view.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">The determination that punitive damages are available to a public figure in a constitutional sense does not end our inquiry. The states are free to impose an additional burden upon plaintiffs who seek punitive damages in libel actions. <em>See Cantrell v. Forest City Publishing Co., </em>419 U.S. 245, 95 S.Ct. 465, 42 L.Ed.2d 419 (1974). Many states do not permit punitive damages unless the plaintiff can show that the defendant entertained \u201ccommon law\u201d or \u201cexpress\u201d malice. Common law malice differs substantially from the <em>New York Times </em>definition of actual malice. The former focuses on the defendant\u2019s feelings toward the plaintiff while the latter goes to the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the truth or falsity of a publication about the plaintiff. <em>Cantrell, </em>419 U.S. at 251-52, 95 S.Ct. at 469-70, 42 L.Ed.2d at 426-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">Our research confirms that Florida is one of those states that requires a form of common law malice to sustain an award for punitive damages. The Florida courts have concluded that \u201cIn order to award punitive damages in a libel action, ill will, hostility or an evil intention to defame and injure, must be present.\u201d <em>Matthews v. Deland State Bank, </em>334 So.2d 164, 166 (Fla.App. 1976). <em>See also, Brown v. Fawcett Publications, Inc., </em>196 So.2d 465, 472-73 (Fla.App.), <em>cert. denied, </em>201 So.2d 557 (Fla.1967). While the Florida law is not without ambi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>guity, it appears that proof of this type of malice may come from two sources: the publication itself and extrinsic evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s feelings toward the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, a jury instruction on the common law malice necessary to support punitive damages should focus the jury\u2019s attention on the defendant\u2019s feelings of ill will toward the plaintiff, considering \u201cthe evidence produced at trial\u201d and the \u201ccharacter of the publication itself.\u201d <em>Matthews, </em>334 So.2d at 166.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Punitive damages were predicated on the proof that Liberty Lobby acted with \u201cmalice, wilfullness or callous and reckless indifference\u201d to the rights of Hunt. Although the instruction of the district court approaches Florida\u2019s common law malice definition, on retrial the jury should be cautioned that a verdict for punitive damages can be returned only if it finds that Liberty Lobby acted with the type of ill will identified in <em>Matthews.</em><footnotemark><em>36</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">\n<em>The Affidavits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Finally, Liberty Lobby complains of the admission into evidence of the affidavits of certain CIA officials. The affiant in each document stated that he was the custodian of particular records at the CIA and that, after diligent search of the appropriate files, he was unable to locate any evidence of CIA memoranda indicating that Hunt was in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963 or discussing the need to explain Hunt\u2019s whereabouts on that date. The certificate of the General Counsel of the CIA was attached to each affidavit certifying that each affiant occupied the position stated in his affidavit. These certificates bore the CIA\u2019s official seal.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">The affidavits were properly admitted. They fell within an exception to the hearsay rule, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 803(10) (\u201cabsence of public record or entry\u201d), and were self-authenticating, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 902(2) (\u201cDomestic public documents not under seal\u201d). Moreover, contrary to the appellant\u2019s contention, this evidence was relevant. One element of Hunt\u2019s case required him to prove the falsity of the published statements. Thus, he introduced the affidavits to show that the CIA memorandum referred to in the article did not exist. The argument that the absence of the memorandum at the time of the litigation does not prove its absence in 1978 should have been made to the jury. It is not a reason for exclusion of clearly relevant evidence.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part and REMANDED for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b730-12\">. Hunt\u2019s original complaint named Liberty Lobby and Victor Marchetti as defendants. Mar-chetti, a freelance writer based in Washington, D.C., was the author of the article in controversy. Hunt\u2019s cause of action against Marchetti was dismissed by the district court because of a lack of jurisdiction over him in the Southern District of Florida. Hunt does not appeal that ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b732-8\">. Marchetti\u2019s article also described the CIA\u2019s plan to implicate other individuals in the upcoming hearing before the House Assassinations Committee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b732-13\">. Even though Liberty Lobby admitted that Hunt was not in Dallas, Hunt presented the deposition testimony of one witness who stated that he saw Hunt in Washington, D.C. on the day of the Kennedy assassination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b733-7\">. The only statement emanating directly from Marchetti was his affidavit which Liberty Lobby attached to its motion for summary judgment. The affidavit did not, however, become a part of the trial record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b733-8\">. The district court overruled an effort to enter the findings of the Committee into evidence. However, the findings were disclosed to the jury during the reading of Carto\u2019s deposition testimony in which he quoted from the report. According to this testimony, the Committee stated that \u201cDuring the course of the Committee\u2019s investigation, a rumor was circulating that the Committee had uncovered a memorandum in CIA files indicating Hunt was in Dallas on November 22, 1963. The rumor was not founded on fact. In addition, Hunt gave the Committee a sworn deposition in which he denied the allegation and the Committee found no evidence that contradicted Hunt\u2019s deposition.\u201d Tr. 295-96.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b733-9\">. One such clipping, a February 6, 1975 Associated Press excerpt from the Miami News entitled \u201cHunt denies part in plot to kill JFK,\u201d included Hunt\u2019s \u201cbitter criticism\u201d of a photograph purportedly depicting him near the scene of the assassination and his unequivocal assertion that he was not in Dallas on November 22, 1963. Also admitted was a June 23, 1975 Time Magazine article which reported the findings of the Rockefeller Commission concerning the CIA\u2019s participation in the Kennedy murder. This article stated that the commission had \u201cdismantled\u201d the theory that Hunt was involved in the assassination, that an FBI pho-toanalyst had determined that Hunt was not pictured in the photograph of three men taken near the crime scene and that the commission found no evidence that Hunt was in Dallas on that day. These press clippings were admitted over Liberty Lobby\u2019s hearsay and relevancy objections \u201cto show prior knowledge of these defendants of similar circumstances where Mr. Hunt is accused of what he is accused of in this article and that they should have been advised or on notice.\u201d Tr. 77.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b734-7\">. Carto recollected that Marchetti told him pri- or to publication that his sources were \u201cprivate, confidential sources in the CIA\u201d and that after publication Marchetti told him the names of some of the sources. Carto refused to provide the names, claiming a \u201cjournalistic privilege\u201d and stating that he could not remember the names.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b734-12\">. Carto testified: \u201cwe were relying completely on the expertise and knowledge and reputation, the background, the association, the contacts, the integrity of Mr. Marchetti.\u201d Tr. 329.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b734-13\">.

This passage was originally written as one paragraph by Marchetti. When it was published, it was broken down into two paragraphs, the second paragraph beginning with the third sentence.

During the trial, the appellant\u2019s position focused on the truth of the story and the claim that it was not damaging to Hunt. No argument is made on appeal that the evidence was inadequate to support the jury\u2019s rejection of these defenses. <em>See Rogero v. Noone, </em>704 F.2d 518, 520 n. 1 (11th Cir.1983); <em>Harris v. Plastics Manufacturing Co., </em>617 F.2d 438, 440 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b738-15\">.

We note that the district judge clearly intended to adopt the language approved in <em>Cantrell </em>but that, apparently due to inadvertence, certain words were misquoted or, possibly, improperly transcribed. (Compare jury charge quoted at page 36 with instruction from <em>Cantrell </em>quoted in note 27 <em>supra). </em>The charge contained in the record in this case is confusing. We are confident, though, that this deficiency will be cured in a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b745-8\">. We note that this judicial admission in a pleading is binding on Hunt, <em>see Hill v.

Marchetti was not solicited to write an article on the topic and his research was not directed by anyone at the Spotlight. He merely sold a finished product to the appellant. <em>Cf. Gertz v.

We make no judgment concerning whether the charge as it concerned Marchetti amounted to plain error. Of course, vicarious liability for Marchetti\u2019s torts is not necessary to a recovery against Liberty Lobby. There was sufficient evidence to find that Carto and Tucker <em>published </em>the article with actual malice which would justify a verdict against the appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b745-18\">.

Although public figures may recover punitive damages, we note that because of the threat to first amendment freedoms posed by excessive punitive damages awards, district courts should give careful attention to excessive awards. In <em>Curtis Publishing Co. v.

No exhaustive discussion of the proof of common law malice is required in light of the fact that our comments on the punitive damages issue are not necessary to the disposition of this appeal.

Of course, there can be no punitive damages unless there is first a finding of actual malice as defined in <em>New York Times. </em>The better practice would be to repeat this admonition so as to foreclose the possibility that the jury might award punitive damages without first finding <em>New York Times </em>actual malice. <em>Appleyard, </em>539 F.2d at 1031 (Butzner, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b747-16\">. The claim of improper jurisdiction has not escaped our attention. It is clear that Liberty Lobby is a newspaper aimed at a national audience as opposed to a regional readership, and may be required to defend this action in the Southern District of Florida. <em>See, Appleyard, </em>539 F.2d at 1028-29; <em>Curtis Publishing Co. v. Golino, </em>383 F.2d 586 (5th Cir.1967). The record evidence of the appellant\u2019s activities and subscription percentages in Florida adequately supports jurisdiction of the parties in the Florida district court. <em>Cf. Cox Enterprises, Inc. v.

Although I agree that the instruction referring to the standards of responsible publishers is legally incorrect, I do not believe that in light of Liberty Lobby\u2019s failure to object to the instruction at trial it amounts to reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-15\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">This circuit has strictly limited the creation of exceptions to the rule: \u201cIt is true that even absent [an] objection [pursuant to F.R. Civ.P. 51] \u2018an appellate court will notice error so fundamental as to result in a miscarriage of justice,\u2019 but \u2018that power will only be exercised in exceptional cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>Patton v. Archer, </em>590 F.2d 1319, 1322 (5th Cir.1979) (quoting, <em>Delancey v. Motichek Towing Service, Inc., </em>427 F.2d 897, 901 (5th Cir.1970)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See also, Barnett v. Housing Authority of City of Atlanta, </em>707 F.2d 1571, 1580 (11th Cir.1983). To determine if the challenged instruction resulted in a miscarriage of justice, we must \u201cconsider the charge as a whole from the standpoint of the jury, in view of the allegations made, the evidence presented and the arguments of counsel.\u201d <em>Miller v. Universal City Studios, Inc., </em>650 F.2d 1365 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">I am not convinced upon reviewing the jury instructions and counsels\u2019 arguments that this is an \u201cexceptional case\u201d to be exempted from Rule 51\u2019s stringent requirements. The disputed instruction was briefly stated only once during the entire charge. More importantly, it was immediately followed by a detailed explanation of the specific elements that the plaintiff had to prove, one of which was actual malice. The judge properly instructed at length what constituted actual malice, emphasizing the importance of the publisher\u2019s mental state and cautioning that negligent failure to investigate or verify information was insufficient by itself to establish malice. Moreover, both plaintiff and defendant\u2019s counsel relied on the proper legal definition of actual malice in their closing arguments, stressing the relevancy of the publisher\u2019s mental state.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Compare, Miller v. Universal City Studios, Inc., supra </em>(plaintiff\u2019s counsel argued faulty instruction to the jury as \u201cthe heart\u201d of his case).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">The responsible publisher instruction standing alone might have led the jury to believe that the defendant\u2019s state of mind was irrelevant. A review of the entire charge, however, with its subsequent emphasis on the publisher\u2019s mental state and its detailed explanation of actual malice does not create such \u201ca substantial and ineradicable doubt as to whether the jury was properly guided in its deliberations,\u201d <em>Miller v. Universal City Studios, supra </em>at 1372, that the inclusion of the challenged instruction can be said to have constituted fundamental error. <em>See Barnett v. Housing Authority City of Atlanta, supra; </em>F.R. Civ.P. 51.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, I would affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b748-6\">. This court has adopted as binding precedent Fifth Circuit cases decided prior to October 1, 1981. <em>Bonner v.

The defendant\u2019s attorney at several points during his closing argument stressed the importance of the defendant\u2019s mental state, telling the jury that \u201c[t]he question is what was in the mind of the author and publisher when they printed the article.\u201d Similarly, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney in rebuttal focused on how they had demonstrated that the defendant had acted either with knowledge that the article was false or with reckless disregard of its truthfulness, noting that \u201cactual malice, according to the law, refers to the mental state of Liberty Lobby \u2022....\u201d Neither closing argument suggested that the defendant\u2019s mental state was irrelevant to a finding of actual malice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b748-13\">. I express no opinion as to whether the challenged instruction would warrant reversal if Liberty Lobby had properly objected to it at trial. It is important to note, however, the special danger of granting new trials in cases where no objection to an erroneous instruction was made at trial: a party can place itself in a \u201cno-lose\u201d situation of either receiving a favorable verdict or, if the outcome is unfavorable, obtaining a new trial on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
