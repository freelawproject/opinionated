Stass, the plaintiff-appellant, is a first class shipfitter for Louisiana Dock Company in Harahan, Louisiana. He repairs barges.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">On December 27,1977, the Barge ACBL-920 (Barge 920), a standard inland hopper barge owned by American Commercial Lines (ACL), the defendant, was turned over to Louisiana Dock for repairs mainly of the hull and the approximately four sets of grain doors on each side of the slightly-peaked topside of the barge. By January 16, 1978, the work was finished, including the repairs on several of the grain doors. Work records indicate that Barge 920 was also partially cleaned, a service Louisiana Dock routinely performed as it deemed necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">On January 11, 1978, about 15 days after Barge 920 was delivered by ACL, Stass was assigned to open the sets of grain doors to check each set\u2019s rain seals for damage. In boarding Barge 920 and in opening the first set of grain doors, Stass noticed sprouted soybean or other grain scattered in the damp areas around the barge top and covers, a condition he figured at trial occurred on about half the barges he worked. Although the sprouts made for slippery footing, the work continued. By about 10:00 a.m., Stass, standing on the peak or top of the barge, and his tacker, Lawrence L. Goins, standing on the lower edge of the barge, had already opened two sets of doors without problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-11\">The third set of grain doors \u2014 opposite a set Stass and Goins had just opened \u2014 did not open easily, and Stass called another fitter to give him and Goins a hand. On the second try, with Goins and the fitter at the lower end of the covers and Stass again by himself on the 18-inch peaked walkway at the top (and with his back to the previously-opened hatch), the door lifted up about two or three feet but no more. Then, the three shipyard workers let the door drop back down, Stass slipped on something on the cover \u2014 \u201cprobably soy beans,\u201d lost his balance backwards, and fell through the open hatch about 14 to 16 feet to the floor of the empty barge. He landed on his heels and tailbone and suffered serious injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-12\">Stass sued ACL under \u00a7 905(b) of the LHWCA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Trial Judge found that though the slippery sprouted grain was on Barge 920 and around the covers before Stass boarded, the existence of the grain was known to Stass, and thus Louisiana Dock, or should have been obvious to or anticipated by it. Further, the Judge held that no defect was ever shown in the grain door which failed to fully open, and, anyway, Stass testified that his fall was not caused by the dropping of the door. Finally, even if the door was defective, there was no requirement under \u00a7 905(b) to fix the doors before turning the barge over to Louisiana Dock for inspection and repair of, among other things, the grain doors.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"ay0-dedup-0\">In <em>Scindia Steam Navigation Co. v. De Los Santos, </em>451 U.S. 156, 101 S.Ct. 1614, 68 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981), the Supreme Court outlined the duties a shipowner owes to a contracting stevedore and its longshoremen.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">(i) Before the loading or unloading be-gras, the shipowner must at least exercise \u201cordinary care under the circumstances to have the ship and its equipment in such condition that an expert and experienced stevedore will be able by the exercise of reasonable care to carry on its cargo operations with reasonable safety.\u201d The shipowner may rely on the stevedore to perform its work with reasonable care, but must warn the stevedore of \u201cany hazards on the ship or with respect to its equipment that are known to the vessel or shou d be known to it m the exercise of reasonable care that would likely be encountered by the steve- , . <em>j, ,. </em>,. dore m the course o\u00ed his cargo operations , . , , , * <em>\\ </em>, and that are not known to the stevedore <em>, </em>,, , , , . , ,. . , , and would not be obvious to or anticipated by him if reasonably competent in the performance of his work.\u201d 451 U.S. at 166^7; 101 S Ct at 1622</p>\n<p id=\"b978-13\">(ii) Once the work starts, the shipowner has no general duty to monitor the stevedoring operation, \u201cabsent contract provision, positive law, or custom to the contrary,\u201d and it may rely on the stevedore\u2019s judgment that equipment is reasonably safe for continued use during the work. \u201cThe shipowner, within limits, <em>is </em>entitled to rely on the stevedore, and owes no duty to the longshoremen to inspect or supervise the cargo operations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 172, 101 S.Ct. at 1624 (original emphasis).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-16\">(iii) However, the shipowner is entitled to rely on the stevedore\u2019s judgment only until the shipowner becomes aware of a hazard on the ship and that the stevedore is unreasonably failing to protect the longshoremen against that hazard, at which time it has a</p>\n<p id=\"AqPN\">\u201cduty to intervene\u201d and remedy the hazard. Although the shipowner is deemed to know about hazards existing before the work begins, it must have actual knowledge of hazards which develop during the operations, <em>Id. </em>at 175-76, 101 S.Ct. at 1626.</p>\n<p id=\"A3D\">Under the \u201cnew regime\u201d of <em>De Los </em>San<em>tos, Hill v. Texaco, Inc., </em>674 F.2d at 447, 449 n. 2, the shipowner has no defense that the hazard was so \u201copen and obvious\u201d to the longshoreman that he either was contributorily negligent or assumed the risk of the hazard by continuing to work. <em>De Los Santos, </em>451 U.S. at 176 n. 22, 101 S.Ct. at 1626 n 22; <em>Hill, </em>674 F2d at 452 n 5; <em>Lemon </em>v. <em>Bank Lines, Ltd., 656 </em>F.2d 110, <em>114 </em>(5th Cir.1981). This is so because when faced with an &gt; dangerous shipboard \u00abraditi ^ longshoreman\u2019s only alternatives wouM be to leave his job or face trouble for in delaying the work. <em>Napoli v. Helle</em>nic <em>Lines, Ltd., </em>536 F.2d 505, 509 (2d Cir.1976) <em>cited in De Los Santos, </em>451 U.S. at 176 n. 22, <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1626 n. 22. In short&gt; longshoreman's own knowledge of a shipboard hazard will not negate a shipowner s duty of care which would exist otherwise.\u201d Comment; 56 Tul.L.Rev. 1421, 1432 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"amq-dedup-1\">In the context of repair operations, however&gt; a vessel owner\u2019s duty to the shipyard and its workers is subtly altered. The courts have long recognized that the vessel owner has no duty to deliver his ship to the shipyard in a hazard-free condition, when the requested repairs would remedy the hazards which cause the injury. <em>See, e.g., West v. United States, </em>361 U.S. 118, 80 S.Ct. 189, 4 L.Ed.2d 161 (1959). In <em>West, </em>vessel owner had no duty to tighten the Plu&amp;s in the ship\u2019s water system, one of which shot off when the water was turned on and injured the plaintiff-employee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AibR\">It appears manifestly unfair to apply the requirements of a safe place to work to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>the shipowner when he has no control over the ship or the repairs, and the work of repair in effect creates the danger which makes the place unsafe. The [shipowner], having hired [the shipyard] to perform the overhaul and reconditioning of the vessel \u2014 including the testing \u2014 was under no duty to protect petitioner from risks that were inherent in the carrying out of the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b979-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 123, 80 S.Ct. at 193; <em>see also Hess v. Upper Mississippi Towing Corp., </em>559 F.2d 1030, 1036 (5th Cir.1977) (no duty of vessel owner to \u201cfree\u201d its barge of gasoline vapors when the \u201cprecise reason for plaintiff\u2019s employment was to make [that] unsafe condition safe\u201d), <em>cert. denied </em>435 U.S. 924, 98 S.Ct. 1489, 55 L.Ed.2d 518 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">After <em>De Los Santos, </em>this Court has continued to recognize these principles in a shipyard situation. In <em>Duplantis v. Zigler Shipyards, </em>692 F.2d 372 (5th Cir.1982), we refused to impose a duty on the shipowner to free its barge of highly-explosive gas from a cargo of light crude oil prior to delivering the barge to a shipyard to have a leak in the hull repaired. Since gas-freeing the barge was \u201ca necessary first step in doing the work Zigler had undertaken,\u201d and \u201ccritical to its ability to repair the pinhole,\u201d it was \u201cone of the \u2018dangers which the contractor was hired to correct,\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 374-75, <em>quoting Hess, supra, </em>559 F.2d at 1033, and the vessel owner had satisfied its duties under <em>De Los Santos </em>in turning over the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">In <em>Hill v. Texaco, Inc., </em>674 F.2d 447 (5th Cir.1982), we held that Texaco, the vessel owner, was not negligent in delivering a tanker with the walls of its gasoline storage tank damp, slippery, and caked with loose rust. Texaco had hired Evans Engineering, Inc. to determine the effect of rust on the thickness of the tank walls, and an Evans employee \u2014 the plaintiff \u2014 slipped on a piece of loose rust, fell from the metal braces on the tank wall he was examining, and suffered injuries. Since the danger of the. rusted walls was \u201cinherent in the carrying out of the contract,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452, <em>quoting </em>West, <em>supra, </em>361 U.S. at 123, 80 S.Ct. at 193, this Court denied relief. \u201c[A] ship may not be found negligent merely because a condition of the ship that requires repair or inspection injures the person hired to inspect or repair that condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452 n. 5. We also rejected the argument that Texaco was negligent in turning over the tank to Evans immediately after purging the tank of ballast water, even though \u201cthe damp walls of the tank exacerbated the slippery conditions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-9\">The tank, although wet, posed only a limited and accepted hazard to Hill until he elected to climb the rusted stiffeners without a safety line. Evans, as an expert in its field, could have brought safety lines with it or borrowed them from the ship. Had Evans done so, Hill could have completed the test with a reasonable degree of safety. <em>Scindia </em>teaches that the ship is entitled to assume that the independent contractor aboard ship will act reasonably with a view towards the safety of its employees. 101 S.Ct. at 1624. Were this not so, the LHWCA\u2019s imposition of a negligence standard rather than a seaworthiness standard on the vessel\u2019s conduct towards the harborwork-ers would mean nothing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b979-10\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-12\">Stass argues that under <em>Scindia </em>ACL was obliged to use ordinary care to deliver Barge 920 in such condition that Louisiana Dock, an experienced shipyard, and its employees would have been able by the exercise of reasonable care to perform their repair work with reasonable safety. Further, ACL must have warned Louisiana Dock of any hidden dangers it knew, or should have known, existed on Barge 920. He argues though that ACL fell short of its responsibilities when it delivered Barge 920 with sprouted grain lying around the covers and with a defective grain door.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-13\">The Trial Judge found that, as a matter of routine procedure, Louisiana Dock cleans barges delivered to it for repairs if it determines such cleaning is necessary. This finding of fact, armed with the \u201cBuckler and Shield\u201d of F.R.Civ.P. 52(a), will not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>set aside unless clearly erroneous, and our perusal of the trial record finds no such error. Stass\u2019 foreman at the time of the accident stated at trial that \u201cwhen a barge come[s] from maintenance [other Louisiana Dock employees], it should be clean.\u201d The then-estimator for Louisiana Dock (who wrote work orders and gave cost estimates to clients) testified about the routine procedures for cleaning barges prior to repair, about the company\u2019s special cleaning crews, and about the facts that cleaning was something Louisiana Dock would determine is necessary and charge for as done. Work records in fact indicate that cleaning was done on Barge 920 by Louisiana Dock, though in the hopper and not on the cover of the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">In short, cleaning the areas to be repaired on incoming barges was, as in <em>Duplantis, </em>692 F.2d at 375, simply \u201ca necessary first step in doing the work,\u201d and the slippery footing caused by the sprouts was a risk \u201cinherent in the carrying out of the contract\u201d for repairs, <em>West, </em>361 U.S. at 123, 80 S.Ct. at 193; <em>Hill, </em>674 F.2d at 452. In turning over Barge 920, ACL could rely on Louisiana Dock to perform its repair job properly, <em>De Los Santos, </em>451 U.S. at 170, 101 S.Ct. at 1623, and clean off the grain residue. Like the wet tank in <em>Hill, </em>the slippery footing on the barge cover \u201cposed only a limited and accepted hazard,\u201d 674 F.2d at 452, to Stass until he decided to \u2014 or, more likely, was ordered to<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u2014 open grain doors on both sides of Barge 920. As his then-foreman testified, Louisiana Dock policy was always to open doors on only one side of a barge, close them after any inspection (or put protective stanchions and lines around the open doors that needed repairs), and then open the doors on the other side of the barge. Had Louisiana Dock required its own policy to be followed, Stass would not have been injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-12\">Moreover, ACL had no duty to warn Louisiana Dock about the sprouts. As the Trial Judge pointed out, Stass himself testified that 50% of the barges he worked on had such residue. At least some grain residue on a barge specially designed to carry grain could be expected by any expert and experienced shipyard.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-13\">Neither was ACL negligent in delivering the barge with, or failing to warn about, the apparently defective grain door. Again as the Trial Judge pointed out, the plaintiff expressly disclaimed the bad grain door as a cause of his fall.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Court found as a fact, which we do not find clearly erroneous, that the fall was not caused by the vibration of the dropped door. Stass could just as easily have slipped and fallen closing one of the non-defective doors.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-14\">ACL had no duty to supervise or inspect Louisiana Dock\u2019s repair operations, absent as here contrary contract, law, or custom. It could rely on Louisiana Dock to avoid exposing its employees, like Stass, to unreasonable hazards. Louisiana Dock, not ACL, was obliged to erect protective \u201cguards\u201d around open hatches, remedy slippery footing, and require proper procedures to be followed in opening grain doors.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b980-15\">Finally, ACL has not transgressed the <em>De Los Santos </em>requirement that the shipowner intervene to protect a longshoreman when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>the vessel knows of an unsafe condition that the stevedore (or shipyard) is improvidently failing to guard the worker against. There is no evidence in the record that ACL had \u201cactual knowledge\u201dof the hazardous condition which arose \u2014 the open and unguarded hatch combined with the slippery footing. <em>See Helaire v. Mobil Oil Co., </em>709 F.2d 1031, 1038 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Duplantis, </em>692 F.2d at 376; <em>Ducote v. International Operating Co., </em>678 F.2d 543, 546 (5th Cir. 1982); <em>Hill, </em>674 F.2d at 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">So ACL, sailing with REASONABLE CARE, passes this Crew\u2019s careful watch.
