Johnson appeals from criminal convictions of conspiracy to distribute and distributing cocaine in violation of 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846. Johnson presents two challenges to his convictions. First, he argues that the jury verdict was not unanimous. Second, he contends that the district court improperly denied his motion in li-mine to prohibit cross-examination on his prior criminal convictions, and that the prosecutor\u2019s improper use of the convictions denied him a fair trial. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Johnson was indicted on one count of selling cocaine to Maurice Goldstein on June 30, 1981, and on one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine on July 9, 1981. Gold-stein testified that he bought cocaine from Johnson on June 30 and immediately sold it to an acquaintance, Philip Schneiderman, who passed the cocaine on to undercover Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) Agents Crosby and Leonhart. The DEA agents had \u201cfronted\u201d the money for the purchase. Other DEA agents testified that Johnson came to Goldstein\u2019s home June 30. Johnson denied selling cocaine on that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">On July 9 Crosby and Leonhart gave Goldstein $2800.00 for an ounce of cocaine; Goldstein promised delivery in a few hours. Goldstein testified that Johnson had agreed by telephone to sell an ounce of cocaine, and that he came by Goldstein\u2019s house that night and picked up $2500.00. According to Goldstein, Johnson said that he would come back shortly with the cocaine, but Johnson never returned. Johnson testified that on July 9 he decided to \u201crip off\u201d Goldstein by agreeing to sell cocaine and taking the \u201cfront\u201d money. Johnson testified that he had no cocaine to sell and no intention of selling cocaine; rather, he was angry at Goldstein for making sexual advances to Johnson\u2019s wife, and the theft was to be his revenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Unanimous verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The jury in Johnson\u2019s case returned its verdict, finding Johnson guilty on both counts of the indictment. The clerk of court then polled the jury. The first eleven jurors responded affirmatively to the question, \u201cAre these your verdicts?\u201d The twelfth juror, Ruby Budd, answered, \u201cYes, reluctantly.\u201d The first eleven jurors were excused and the following exchange took place between the court and Mrs. Budd:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AejD\">The Court: You have indicated that your verdict was \u201creluctantly\u201d reached. Is there any hesitation in your mind about the defendant\u2019s guilt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-13\">Mrs. Budd: Yes, there was, because there was nobody that witnessed it, that they actually saw him pass the cocaine, but I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-14\">The Court: Just a second, that\u2019s all I need to know for right now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-15\">The court then stated to counsel his intention of sending the jury back for further deliberations. Neither party objected, though defense counsel\u2019s request that the reasonable doubt instruction be given again was denied. Fifteen minutes later, the jury returned and again gave its verdict of guilty on both counts. The jurors were polled individually, and each agreed that the verdict as rendered was their verdict. Mrs. Budd was then questioned by the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-16\">The Court: You\u2019re satisfied with your verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-17\">Mrs. Budd: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-18\">The Court: Do you have any hesitancy in your mind about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-19\">Mrs. Budd: I did, but not now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-20\">The Court: You\u2019re satisfied that he\u2019s guilty beyond a reasonable doubt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-21\">Mrs. Budd: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-22\">After a discussion with counsel at the bench, the following exchange took place: The Court: Do you have any feeling that you want or need more time in order to reach a decision in this case?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-23\">Mrs. Budd: . I believed Agent Crosby\u2019s statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-24\">The Court: You don\u2019t feel you need any more time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Mrs. Budd: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The court then discharged the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Johnson claims that these colloquies demonstrate the lack of a unanimous verdict. We disagree. At the first hint of a non-unanimous verdict, the court questioned the juror about the verdict and sent the jury back for further deliberations. This was within the court\u2019s discretion under Fed.R.Crim.P. 31(a). <em>Amos v. United States, </em>496 F.2d 1269, 1272-73 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 896, 95 S.Ct. 174, 42 L.Ed.2d 140 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Johnson further contends that Mrs. Budd\u2019s statement, \u201cI believed Agent Crosby,\u201d shows that Mrs. Budd based her verdict on her belief that Johnson was guilty of theft, but not of distributing cocaine, since Agent Crosby\u2019s testimony could not support a guilty verdict on the cocaine charges. He supports this assertion with a transcript of a post-trial interview with Mrs. Budd which so states. Johnson relies on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pleva, </em>66 F.2d 529 (2d Cir.1933), and <em>Fox v. United States, </em>417 F.2d 84 (5th Cir.1969), for the proposition that when a juror never comes into agreement with the verdict, there is, in effect, no verdict at all. <em>Pleva </em>and <em>Fox </em>are quite different from this case. <em>Pleva </em>involved an ill juror who consented to a guilty plea due to concern over his health, and <em>Fox </em>involved a juror who remained silent when polled by the clerk. In <em>Fox </em>the ambiguity of the juror\u2019s verdict was apparent during the polling process when the juror did not affirmatively and unconditionally state his agreement with the verdict. <em>Fox v. United States, </em>417 F.2d at 88. In <em>Pleva </em>the ambiguity arose after polling, but before discharge of the jury when the ill juror stated that he would have voted against conviction but for his concern of spending another night without medical treatment. <em>United States v. Pleva, </em>66 F.2d at 532. In this case, Mrs. Budd assured the court several times of the certainty of her decision; there was no explicit reference to coercion or disagreement prior to the discharge of the jury. Further, the statement, \u201cI believed Agent Crosby,\u201d does not raise doubts about the verdict or in any way indicate coercion, duress, or uncertainty. <em>Amos v. United States, </em>496 F.2d at 1273; <em>United States v. Smith, </em>562 F.2d 619, 622 (10th Cir.1977). Even assuming Mrs. Budd did vote to convict Johnson on the basis of his admitted theft,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a juror\u2019s reasons for his verdict are generally irrelevant and mistake will not result in impeachment of the verdict. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Schroeder, </em>433 F.2d 846, 851 (8th Cir.1970); <em>see United States v. Weiner, </em>578 F.2d 757, 764 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 981, 99 S.Ct. 568, 58 L.Ed.2d 651 (1978). The jury was correctly instr\u00facted, and the verdict was clear and unanimous. Johnson was not denied his right to a unanimous verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">Prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-14\">Johnson\u2019s second claim concerns his prior criminal convictions. In 1970 or 1971<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he was convicted of aggravated assault, and in 1982 he was convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm. Johnson made a motion in limine to prohibit cross-examination on those convictions. The motion was denied by the district court. Defense counsel then brought out the convictions during his direct examination of Johnson. On appeal, Johnson argues that the district court erred under Fed.R.Evid. 609 in denying the motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-15\">The aggravated assault conviction was more than ten years old. Thus, its admission is governed by Rule 609(b), which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-16\">Evidence of a conviction under this rule is not admissible if a period of more than ten years has elapsed since the date of the conviction or of the release of the witness from the confinement imposed for that conviction, whichever is the later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>date, unless the court determines, in the interests of justice, that the probative value of the conviction supported by specific facts and circumstances substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Generally, stale convictions do not have much probative value. The rule recognizes this precept and establishes a rebut-table presumption against admissibility. <em>United States v. Singer, </em>660 F.2d 1295, 1300 (8th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1156, 102 S.Ct. 1030, 71 L.Ed.2d 314 (1982). \u201cExceptional circumstances\u201d are required before old convictions will be admitted. <em>Id. </em>at 1301. We need not reach the issue of whether such exceptional circumstances exist here, because the question was not preserved for review. This court held in <em>United States v. Cobb, </em>588 F.2d 607 (8th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 947, 99 S.Ct. 1426, 59 L.Ed.2d 636 (1979), that pretrial rulings on the admissibility of older convictions are \u201cmerely tentative.\u201d <em>United States v. Cobb, id. </em>at 612. The court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">Fed.R.Evid. 609(b) clearly contemplates that any final ruling on the admissibility of a more than ten-year old conviction should rest upon \u201cspecific facts, and circumstances\u201d developed in the course of the trial which bear on the probative value or prejudicial effect of the conviction in question. Thus, in ordinary circumstances, a defendant who objects to a pretrial ruling on the admissibility of such an aged conviction ought to assert that objection when the prosecutor seeks to introduce the questioned evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 612-13. In <em>Cobb, </em>as here, defense counsel himself introduced the \u201cquestioned evidence\u201d without a more timely ruling by the district court. As we noted in <em>Cobb, </em>the defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">effectively cut off both the prosecutor\u2019s privilege to withhold the possibly prejudicial evidence and the court\u2019s opportunity to reconsider its preliminary ruling by voluntarily broaching the subject of the [old] conviction on direct examination .... By voluntarily testifying to the [old] conviction, [the defendant] waived any objection to the trial court\u2019s pretrial ruling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 613. We believe the holding in <em>Cobb </em>applies here, and that it precludes our review. <em>See United States v. Key, </em>No. 83-1494 (8th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">As to the 1982 firearms conviction, Rule 609(a)(1) applies. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-11\">(a) General rule. For the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness, evidence that he has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted if elicited from him or established by public record during cross-examination but only if the crime (1) was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year under the law under which he was convicted, and the court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to the defendant ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">The district court did not follow the better practice of making an on-the-record finding that the 609(a)(1) balancing test weighed in favor of admitting the conviction, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>696 F.2d 578, 589 (8th Cir.1982), <em>cert. </em>denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 1531, 45 L.Ed.2d 952 (1983). However, the district court did hold a hearing, and the parties phrased their arguments in terms of prejudice and probativeness. Especially in view of the importance of Johnson\u2019s credibility, we do not believe the district court abused its discretion in ruling that Johnson could be cross-examined on the firearms conviction. <em>Id.; United States v. Spero, </em>625 F.2d 779, 781 (8th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-15\">Finally, Johnson contends that in cross-examining him, the prosecutor improperly painted him as a man of \u201cbad character, and thus, more likely to commit the crime charged.\u201d He argues that this impropriety, combined with questioning about two other convictions, a thirty year-old one for assault and a 1978 conviction reversed on appeal, violated his right to a fair trial. Again, we note that defense counsel brought out these convictions on direct examination. The prosecutor was entitled to cross-examine the witness concerning his testimony. <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number><em>Sparrow, </em>470 F.2d 885, 888 (10th Cir.1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 936, 93 S.Ct. 1913, 36 L.Ed.2d 397 (1973); <em>see United States v. Adcock, </em>558 F.2d 397, 402 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 921, 98 S.Ct. 395, 54 L.Ed.2d 277 (1977). Further, this cross-examination was extremely limited, and was followed by adequate instructions from the court concerning the limited relevance of Johnson\u2019s prior convictions. In this case, we are persuaded that Johnson was not denied a fair trial. <em>See United States v. Buchanan, </em>659 F.2d 878 (8th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-8\">. The Honorable Miles W. Lord, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, ruled on Johnson\u2019s pretrial motions and presided at his trial. Upon agreement of the parties, The Honorable J. Earl Cudd, United States Magistrate for the District of Minnesota, presided when the jury returned its verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b617-8\">. We note that, contrary to Johnson\u2019s protestations, Agent Crosby\u2019s testimony did present evidence of Johnson\u2019s guilt on the cocaine charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b617-17\">. A record of Johnson\u2019s conviction was not part of the record. Johnson could not remember in which year he was convicted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b619-6\">LAY, Chief Judge, dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">I respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority\u2019s opinion which finds that the defendant\u2019s \u201ccross-examination was extremely limited\u201d and that the limiting instructions given by the court adequately protected the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. I feel that the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination went beyond what is allowed under the Rules of Evidence and what should be tolerated by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Rule 609 of the Federal Rules of Evidence permits impeachment of a witness by \u201cevidence that he has been convicted of a crime.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 609(a). Under this rule, the prosecutor was entitled to question the defendant as to the fact of the conviction. However, the prosecutor\u2019s repeated questioning on the circumstances of the conviction went beyond mere proof of the crime. It was an attempt to paint Johnson as having a bad character.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">In his cross-examination of the defendant, the prosecutor repeatedly emphasized not only the prior conviction but the facts of the crime:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-10\">Q. You were convicted again in Minnesota two more times for aggravated assault?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-11\">A. One, I said one time in 1970 \u2014 \u201970 or \u201971.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-12\">Q. Okay. Did somebody get hurt that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-13\">A. Yes, sir, somebody did get hurt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-14\">Q. Did a lady get shot in the back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-15\">A. Yes, sir, accidentally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-16\">Q. A bullet got stuck somewhere into her body from behind her, didn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ank-dedup-0\">A. It did, right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-17\">Q. You had the gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-18\">A. It was her gun, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-19\">Q. You were convicted of the aggravated assault. Right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-20\">A. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-21\">Q. You went to trial on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-22\">A. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-23\">Q. The jury came back and found that you had done that, didn\u2019t they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-24\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-25\">Transcript of Trial at 5-8, <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>No. Cr. 4-82-90 (D.Minn.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-26\">The trial court abetted this unauthorized cross-examination by asking the defendant about his relationship with the victim of the earlier crime. The prosecutor then renewed his attack on the defendant\u2019s character by asking \u201cDid you shoot her to protect her (the victim\u2019s) honor?\u201d This exchange involving the defendant, prosecutor, and court is unwarranted and unacceptable under Rule 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-27\">The writer is unaware of any cases in this circuit which have allowed the prosecutor to delve so repeatedly into the facts of a collateral crime. It is fundamentally and prej-udicially wrong for the prosecutor to abuse the narrow license of Rule 609. Regardless of guilt or innocence, a defendant is entitled to a fair trial. The paramount interests of the administration of criminal justice so require. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
