Skillern and a codefend-ant Sanne were convicted of murdering Patrick Randel, a state narcotics agent. The victim Randel and the codefendant Sanne had been sitting in Randel\u2019s car at a roadside park when the petitioner Skillern drove up, immediately following which the codefendant Sanne shot and killed Randel. In arguing for reversal on his appeal, the petitioner raises three groups of contentions:</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">I. that his death penalty was unconstitutionally imposed under <em>En-mund v. Florida, </em>458 U.S. 782, 102 S.Ct. 3368, 73 L.Ed.2d 1140 (1982), in the absence of sufficient evidence of his own personal culpability for the allegedly unexpected act of the codefendant triggerman in shooting the victim, and under instructions that allegedly permitted the jury to impute to Skillern the triggerman\u2019s intent to kill the victim;</p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\">II. that the district court improperly denied him an evidentiary hearing on his allegations that he was denied due process and the effective assistance of counsel because the denial of a continuance forced a newly-appointed defense counsel to go to trial on the capital charge three weeks after his appointment; and</p>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">III. that evidentiary error of constitutional magnitude rendered the sentencing hearing fundamentally unfair and violative of due process, because of the admittedly erroneous admission into evidence of the allegedly expert opinion of a forensic pathologist that there was a probability that Skillern would commit future criminal acts of violence and would constitute a continuing threat to society; and that the sentencing hearing was similarly infected by the admission into evidence of an indictment for murder <em>with malice </em>in an earlier offense, when Skillern had then been convicted of the lesser offense of murder <em>without </em>malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-12\">Although these contentions are not insubstantial, we find no error under the circumstances shown by the denial of the petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2254 application without an' eviden-tiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-13\">\n<em>Factual context</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b938-14\">The victim Randel, a state narcotics agent, had been working undercover to set up a purchase of illegal drugs from Skillern and his codefendant Sanne. The day before the killing Skillern and Sanne had become concerned that Randel might be a state informant. Nevertheless, the three had met in Randel\u2019s motel room, where other narcotics agents eavesdropped on the conversation from an adjoining room.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-15\">Sanne and Skillern showed the officer a sample of the drugs they intended to sell. The officer then asked them how they wanted to handle the deal, and one of the defendants replied, \u201cLet\u2019s go some place where we can talk business.\u201d Leaving the State money that was to be used for the transaction in the motel room, Randel drove off in his car with Sanne as passenger, while Skillern followed in another automobile. Approximately an hour later, Skillern and Sanne returned, and Sanne was seen entering Randel\u2019s motel room. They then drove off.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-16\">A few hours later Randel was found shot to death in his locked car at a roadside park <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>twenty to twenty-five miles distant from the motel. About four hours later, Skillern and Sanne were arrested. Skillern had the State purchase money and Randel\u2019s gun in his possession, while Sanne was in possession of Randel\u2019s credit cards and other effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Skillern and Sanne were indicted for intentionally causing the death of Randel in the course of committing and attempting to commit a robbery, a capital offense. Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 19.03 (Vernon 1974). At an initial trial, at which neither testified, Skillern and Sanne were found guilty; in the sentencing hearing, the jury assessed a life sentence for Sanne (who had a minor criminal record) and a death sentence for the petitioner Skillern (whose criminal record included a prior killing). On direct appeal, the convictions were reversed because of a failure to sequester the jury. <em>Skillern v. State, </em>559 S.W.2d 828 (Tex.Cr. App.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">The present conviction results from a retrial, at which Sanne now took the stand and confessed to firing the gun that killed Randel. According to Sanne, Randel struck him on the face and unexpectedly pulled a gun on him, following which Sanne shot him six times in the chest and abdomen. (Under this version of the crime, Skillern points out, his own personal participation was at most limited to a planned robbery and did not encompass the unexpected killing of Randel by Sanne.) On this second trial, the jury again found both defendants guilty, and in the sentencing phase the death penalty was assessed against both defendants. The convictions and Skillern\u2019s death sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, but Sanne\u2019s death sentence was reformed to life imprisonment on the basis of double jeopardy. <em>Sanne v. State, </em>609 S.W.2d 762 (Tex.Cr.App.1980), <em>cert. denied, Skillern v. Texas, </em>452 U.S. 931, 101 S.Ct. 3067, 69 L.Ed.2d 432 (1981). Exhausting state habeas proceedings, Skillern now applies for federal habeas relief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">As previously noted, the petitioner Skil-lern contends that the district court erred in denying him federal habeas relief, relying upon three principal groups of contentions, which respectively concern: I. The <em>En-mund </em>issues; II. The denial of an eviden-tiary hearing on his contentions that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel; and III. Erroneous evidentiary rulings of constitutional magnitude in the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">I. <em>The </em>Enmund <em>Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">In <em>Enmund v. Florida, </em>458 U.S. 782, 797, 102 S.Ct. 3368, 3376-77, 73 L.Ed.2d 1140 (1982), the United States Supreme Court held that the Eighth Amendment does not permit \u201cimposition of death penalty on one such as Enmund who aids and abets a felony in the course of which a murder is committed by others but who does not himself kill, attempt to kill, or intend that a killing take place or that lethal force will be employed.\u201d Enmund had been sentenced to die for a murder that occurred during the course of a robbery in which he was the getaway car driver. In holding the death penalty constitutionally excessive for Enmund\u2019s criminal conduct, the Court observed that \u201c[t]he focus must be on <em>his </em>culpability, not on that of those who committed the robbery and shot the victims,\u201d 458 U.S. at 798, 102 S.Ct. at 3377 (emphasis added by the Court), and it concluded that Enmund\u2019s death penalty was invalid \u201cin the absence of proof that En-mund killed or attempted to kill\u201d or \u201cintended or contemplated that life would be taken,\u201d 458 U.S. at 801, 102 S.Ct. at 3379.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-11\">In <em>Bell v. Watkins, </em>692 F.2d 999, 1012 (5th Cir.1982), we summarized <em>Enmund </em>as holding \u201cthat under the eighth amendment a death sentence may not be imposed on someone who neither committed the homicide, attempted to commit the homicide, nor participated in the plot to kill the victim.\u201d Similarly, in <em>Clark v. Louisiana State Penitentiary, </em>694 F.2d 75, 76-77 (1982), <em>reh. denied, </em>697 F.2d 699 (5th Cir.1983), we interpreted <em>Enmund </em>as holding that \u201cthe Eighth Amendment does not permit imposition of the death penalty upon one who participates in a robbery but does not kill or contemplate the taking of a life.\u201d In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>latter case, although not on <em>Enmund </em>grounds (see note 6, <em>infra), </em>we vacated a death sentence because of instructions that unconstitutionally permitted conviction of first-degree murder on the basis of a cocon-spirator robber\u2019s killing, even absent specific intent to kill by the defendant sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Based upon the principles enunciated and applied in these decisions, the petitioner Skillern raises two principal contentions: <em>A. </em>that the evidence was insufficient to subject him to the death penalty because it does not show that he personally had taken life, attempted to take life, or intended to take life; and <em>B. </em>that, in any event, the instructions on which the case was submitted to the jury permitted it to assess the death penalty against him on the basis of his confederate Sanne\u2019s intentional killing of the victim and absent any requirement that the jury find Skillern himself had killed or had personally contemplated that Sanne would murder the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">A. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"AAU\">Skillern points out that the uncontradict-ed testimony of Sanne, his codefendant and his accomplice in the prospective drug transaction, is to the effect that Sanne himself had not planned to kill the narcotics officer before the two had driven in the agent\u2019s vehicle to the roadside park, and that the killing of the agent had resulted, without prior premeditation by Sanne, when the agent had unexpectedly drawn a pistol on Sanne and had struck him. The jury was not, of course, required to believe Sanne\u2019s account of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-11\">Assuming the jury was properly instructed, we find that a rational jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 326, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2793, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), that Skillern had agreed in advance with Sanne not only to rob Randel, but also to kill Randel, the suspected police informant, after they would lure him away from his motel room to the roadside park. Prior to the meeting with Randel in the latter\u2019s motel room to set up the drug transaction, the triggerman Sanne testified that he had told his supplier in Mexico to put the transaction on \u201chold\u201d. When Randel\u2019s body was found, it was in a position indicating that he was totally unaware of the imminence of danger; a cigarette was still dangling from his right hand. Considering the distance from the motel to the roadside park and back, the jury could reasonably have found that Randel was killed immediately upon the arrival of the two vehicles at the roadside park (as indeed Sanne so testified), according to previous plan, and that immediately the accomplices returned to the motel room within an hour of their leaving to retrieve the State purchase money.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-12\">B. <em>The jury instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b940-13\">Skillern was indicted and convicted for capital murder, as having intentionally caused the death of the victim Randel in the course of committing and attempting to commit a robbery. Tex.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 19.03(a)(2) (Vernon 1974).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Capital mur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>der is defined as a \u201ccapital felony\u201d, <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 19.03(b); a capital felony is punishable either by confinement for life or by death. Tex.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 12.31(a) (Vernon 1974).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">When an accused is convicted of a capital offense (which, to reiterate, under Texas law is punishable either by death or by life imprisonment), Tex.Code Crim.Proc. Ann. art. 37.071 (Vernon 1974) provides for a separate sentencing hearing before the trial jury, which is required to make certain findings in response to special issues submitted to it before the trial judge may sentence the defendant to death.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-19\">We have excerpted and set forth in Appendix 1, attached to this opinion, the charges of the state trial judge at the guilt and innocence phase of the state trial that are pertinent to the issues before us. Although the charge emphasized that capital murder requires that the accused <em>\u201cinten</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number><em>tionally </em>kills or causes the death of another\u201d while in the course of robbing another, paragraphs 6 and 7 of the charge permitted the jury to find Skillern guilty of the trig-german Sanne\u2019s killing, under the Texas law of criminal responsibility, as a conspirator in a robbery attempt equally guilty of the murder by his coconspirator if the killing \u201cwas committed in furtherance of the unlawful purpose [of the robbery] and was one that should have been <em>anticipated </em>as a result of the carrying out of the conspiracy.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Skillern argues that this charge, in violation of <em>Enmund, </em>permitted the jury to find Skillern guilty of capital murder, even though he did not personally contemplate or intend Sanne\u2019s allegedly unexpected shooting the victim. This argument overlooks, however, that <em>Enmund </em>only prohibits, as a violation of the Eighth Amendment, the <em>execution </em>of a person for the uncontemplat-ed (i.e., personally by him) act of an accomplice in the course of committing a non-capital felony upon which both were engaged. Nothing in <em>Enmund </em>or any other decision cited to us implicates any violation of rights guaranteed by the federal constitution by a state rule (such as that provided by Tex.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 7.01, 7.02 (Vernon 1974)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>), by which the <em>guilt </em>of an accused for an offense committed by a confederate may nevertheless be established- \u2014 even though the accused himself may not personally have intended the particular criminal act committed \u2014 by his criminal responsibility for the act or. conduct of a confederate when engaged in a joint criminal endeavor. <em>Enmund </em>merely invalidates a death penalty when based solely upon a defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility for a killing by an accomplice that is unintended or not contemplated by the defendant; it does not invalidate a conviction of a substantive offense of murder when guilt is so based.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-15\">Under Texas law, an accused may be convicted of the substantive offense of capital murder \u2014 which, to reiterate, is punishable <em>either </em>by life imprisonment <em>or </em>by death, see notes 1 and 2, <em>supra </em>\u2014 under the Texas law of parties and of criminal responsibility for the act of a confederate, even though the killing that occurred in the course of another offense was not intended by the defendant before the court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>rehearing in <em>Clark v. Louisiana State Penitentiary, </em>694 F.2d 75 (5th Cir.1982), we noted that the Fourteenth Amendment does not forbid \u201ca state from defining criminal culpability so as to allow an assumed or deemed assent to the act of a coconspirator in a different crime. There is no bar in the Fourteenth Amendment against the crime of felony murder.\u201d 697 F.2d 699, 700 (1983) (on petition for rehearing).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Thus, neither <em>Enmund </em>nor any cited constitutional principle bars Skillern\u2019s conviction under Texas law of the substantive offense of capital murder, which is not necessarily punishable by a sentence of death, simply because his guilt of the substantive offense was established by the Texas law of criminal responsibility for the acts of his confederate Sanne \u2014 whether or not Skillern himself intended or contemplated that a life would be taken in the commission of the robbery upon which Skillern and the confederate were jointly engaged. <em>Enmund </em>might well bar a <em>death penalty </em>upon jury instructions that permitted its imposition based solely upon a coconspirator\u2019s intent and act, and absent personal intent or contemplation of the accused that a killing take place. However, the present instructions of which complaint is made did not purport to determine the sentencing option of the jury as whether life imprisonment or instead death would be imposed. Their sole purport was to furnish a basis upon which the jury could determine Skillern\u2019s guilt of the substantive offense of capital murder, only following which (see note 3 supra)\u2014 and under different instructions \u2014 would the jury determine the criteria by which a death sentence, instead of life imprisonment, would be the penalty for conviction of the substantive offense of capital murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">We therefore do not find merit to Skillern\u2019s contention that the jury instructions complained of permitted imposition of a capital sentence in violation of the principles enunciated by <em>Enmund.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">In the present state case, following the conviction, a sentencing hearing was held at which evidence was submitted; after which, the jury was asked to decide three special issues, its answers to which would determine whether the court would sentence Skillern to death or instead to life imprisonment. See note 3 <em>supra. </em>The district court then gave brief general instructions, to which no objection was made, that did not include any reference to the Texas law of criminal responsibility, and that required the jury to find proved beyond a reasonable doubt its answer to the three special issues submitted to it, as required by Tex.Code Crim.Proc.Ann. art. 37.071 (Vernon 1981) (quoted in note 3 <em>supra). </em>A unanimous jury answered Special Issue No. 1 in the affirmative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-12\">Was the conduct of the Defendant, Doyle Edward Skillern that caused the death of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>the deceased, Patrick Allen Randel, committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that the death of the deceased or another would result?<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEdq\">The instructions at the sentencing hearing on their face thus required the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Skillern\u2019s conduct that caused the victim\u2019s death was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that the victim\u2019s death would result. It might have been preferable that an additional instruction have been given that the Texas law of a party\u2019s criminal responsibility for the act of another did not supply the accused\u2019s deliberate intent and reasonable expectation that death would result, a prerequisite for imposition of the death penalty. However, no request was made for a special instruction to this effect, nor was any objection made to the charge as given. We cannot say that the sentencing instructions themselves permitted the jury to find that the requisite deliberate intent or contemplation to kill could be based solely upon the accomplice Sanne\u2019s killing of the victim, in violation of Enmund.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Nor can we say that the possible ambiguity in that regard of the jury instructions resulted in a level of uncertainty and unreliability in the fact-finding process, as enhanced by misleading prosecution argument at the sentencing hearing,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> such as resulted in the vacation of the death sentence in <em>Clark v. Louisiana State Penitentiary, </em>694 F.2d 75 (5th Cir.1982). In the state\u2019s brief opening argument, the prosecutor summarized the state\u2019s theory of the case with regard to Special Issue No. 1. Referring to the previous verdict of guilty, he succinctly stated, \u201cYou found that they, acting together, intended to kill him. What could be more deliberate and what could bring a more reasonably expected result?\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">In his argument, Skillern\u2019s counsel clearly delineated the different issue before .the jury in the sentencing phase as to Skillern\u2019s criminal responsibility for the act of Sanne:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9YC\">Obviously, I don\u2019t think that you will bind Mr. Skillern with what went on in Mr. Sanne\u2019s mind at the time of the shooting. I think the law tells you, and I am sure Mr. Butts will tell you again, that when \u201cparties\u201d were defined to you and you find that one was criminally responsible for the conduct of another, that is necessarily the framework in which you found Mr. Skillern guilty in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-12\">That may be true but, when we get to the issue of punishment, why, it seems to me that so far as meting out what the punishment should be in a case like this, that you have got to assume, in your own minds, what may have been anticipated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>by Mr. Skillern with respect to what another would do under circumstances that possibly no one could foresee, at that roadside park.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">In the fourth paragraph of his closing argument, it is true, the prosecutor (without objection by the defense) stated that the defendants \u201cwere acting together as a party within the meaning of the word \u2018party\u2019, as defined in paragraph six of the first charge,\u201d also noting \u201cthat charge is just as much the law of the land at this phase of the trial.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the thrust of his argument was that everything Skillern and Sanne had \u201cdone\u201d had been done in concert \u2014\u201cpractically everything you have heard has been done in concert, in one way or another. Maybe one was playing the drum and the other blowing the bugle, but in concert.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2890-91. The prosecutor made no further reference to the law of parties in his nine-page closing argument. In asking for the jury\u2019s affirmative answer to Special Issue No. 1, the prosecutor quoted that the jury must find that the conduct of Skillern that caused the death was \u201ccommitted deliberately in reasonable expectation that the death of the deceased would result,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> without again referring to Skil-lern\u2019s criminal responsibility as a party for Sanne\u2019s act.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">Reviewing the sentencing hearing arguments as a whole, in the light of the sentencing instructions given by the state trial court, we think that with regard to Skillern the issue pinpointed to the jury for its determination was whether Skillern himself deliberately participated in conduct that contemplated the murder by his accomplice Sanne of the victim. We are unable to say that the fleeting reference by the prosecution to the Texas law of party responsibility casts sufficient uncertainty or unreliability onto the jury\u2019s determination that Skillern was personally culpable in the victim\u2019s death as to require vacation of the death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">II. <em>Effective Assistance of Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b945-13\">Skillern next urges that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel or other constitutional right through the denial of a continuance to allow his counsel more time to prepare for his defense. Skillern contends that, at the least, he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing to prove the prejudice he suffered in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-14\">With regard to the contention that an evidentiary hearing is required, counsel overlooks that in fact an evidentiary hearing was held in the state court on the pretrial motion for continuance, at which the state trial court rejected the contentions that more time was needed. Further, on the motion for a new trial the contention was made that the denial of the motions for pretrial continuance had prejudiced counsel in their preparation of the defense; at the hearing on this motion the defense counsel attempted to explain why the continuance had prejudiced their preparation of the defense; and these contentions were likewise rejected by the state trial court by its denial of the motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-15\">Thus, if the facts developed at these State hearings are sufficient to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>the factual reasons concerning whether a continuance was or was not required to assure adequate time to serve as effective counsel, no further evidentiary hearing is required. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Preliminarily, we must also note that the issue before us is not whether the state trial court abused its discretion in denying a continuance. \u201cWhen a denial of a continuance forms a basis of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, not only must there have been an abuse of discretion but it must have been so arbitrary and fundamentally unfair that it violates constitutional principles of due process.\u201d <em>Hicks v. Wainwright, </em>633 F.2d 1146, 1148 (5th Cir.1981). The denial of a continuance to afford appointed counsel a reasonable opportunity to confer with the accused and to prepare his defense may indeed amount to a deprivation of constitutional right, <em>Avery v. Alabama, </em>308 U.S. 444, 60 S.Ct. 321, 84 L.Ed. 377 (1940), but whether in fact this has occurred requires an examination of the circumstances of the case, <em>id. </em>308 U.S. at 450, 60 S.Ct. at 324 (denial of continuance to counsel appointed three days prior to trial in murder case did not under circumstances there present, offend the federal constitution). <em>See also Gandy v. Alabama, </em>569 F.2d 1318 (5th Cir.1978) (where denial of right to counsel found in the denial of a continuance sought because of abrupt loss of representation by retained counsel). \u201cThere are no mechanical tests for deciding when a denial of a continuance is so arbitrary as to violate due process. The answer must be found in the circumstances present in every case, <em>particularly in the reasons presented to the trial judge at the time the request is denied.\u201d Ungar v. Sarafite, </em>376 U.S. 575, 589, 84 S.Ct. 841, 849, 11 L.Ed.2d 921 (1964) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">The appointment of counsel and the denial of continuance occurred in the following factual context:</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">Skillern\u2019s previous conviction and death penalty for the same crime had been reversed by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, following which on February 11, 1978, the state trial judge ordered a change of venue to another county and set the retrial for March 13,1978. On February 20, twenty-two days before the trial date, attorney Connery was appointed to represent Skillern in his trial for capital murder, although he had been apprised of his upcoming appointment some five days prior thereto. Between February 20 and March 2, Connery filed fifteen pretrial motions (admittedly based mostly on those filed in the previous proceedings). One of these was a motion for a continuance, which was denied after an evidentiary hearing on March 8. Jury selection commenced on March 13, and the trial in chief commenced on March 21 and proceeded daily thereafter. On March 30, Skillern and his codefendant were found guilty of capital murder. On March 31, following a sentencing hearing held that day, these defendants were sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">The chief ground urged by Skillern\u2019s pretrial motion for continuance was the inadequate time allowed to examine the nine-volume record of the previous trial, which had been made available to the defense counsel, and to interview the witnesses (who were out-of-county) before they testified. At the hearing, defense counsel estimated that a minimum delay of 2-3 weeks was necessary. In denying a re-urged motion for the continuance, the trial judge allowed defense counsel time to interview state witnesses, if requested, before they testified. The record further indicates that the prosecution made available to the defense counsel reports and other documents for the latter\u2019s use in cross-examination. All of the witnesses except one (who was interviewed by defense counsel before he took the stand) had testified in the prior trial. The experienced trial counsel from the previous trial and appeal, which had resulted in a reversal, indicated his willingness to give present defense counsel the benefit of his views, although some difficulty was experienced in securing them because of his other trial commitments.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">At the hearing on the motion for the new trial, the defense counsel asserted as chief prejudice for the denial of the delay an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>inability to secure an investigator to go into the background of the defendants a little more for the punishment phase of the trial (mentioning with regard to Skillern the opportunity to find out more detail about his prior conviction for killing his brother), and the securing of more evidence with regard to the nature of the undercover narcotics business, as well as to explore further details concerning the victim Randel as re-fleeted by his personnel record that the prosecutor had furnished to the defendants for use at the second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\"> We are unable on the showing made or for the reasons proffered to the state trial judge before and after the trial, to hold that the denial of a continuance was arbitrary or that Skillern has borne his burden of demonstrating that he was thereby deprived of his constitutional right to a fair trial because of the ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Martin v. Maggio, </em>711 F.2d 1273, 1279, 1281 (5th Cir.1981) (citing other decisions of this circuit). The constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel guarantees the defendant, not error-free representation, but \u201c \u2018counsel reasonably likely to render and rendering effective assistance\u2019 \u201d. <em>Id. </em>While the seriousness of the charges must be considered as part of the totality of circumstances when ruling on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the standard of competence required of trial counsel is no higher in capital cases than in non-capital cases. <em>Id. </em>711 F.2d at 1279-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-14\">In our view, the state record shows no disadvantage to Skillern\u2019s defense by the allegedly inadequate preparation time. Although the issue is not entirely free from doubt (see the dissenting opinion in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, <em>Sanne v. State, supra, </em>609 S.W.2d at 777, 779), we are unable to say that the denial of the continu-anee caused any actual prejudice to the appointed counsels\u2019 effective representation of the accused at the trial three weeks later \u2014 considering the appointed attorneys\u2019 access to the record of the previous state trial, the full discovery afforded by the prosecution, and the substantial identity of the issues and witnesses of the first and second trials. As is illustrated by the sug-gesti\u00f3n of defense counsel at the hearing on the motion for a new trial of what they might have done further had they been afforded the additional 2-3 weeks continu-anee requested, the original reasons sought for the continuance were largely obviated by the measures taken by the district court and by the appointed trial counsels\u2019 own energetic efforts to familiarize themselves with the evidence and the issues to prepare the defense of the accused. Outside of the conclusory allegation that more time was needed b inted state trial counse! to adequately for trial on this habeas review&gt; no reason is suggested to us as to what tria] counsel migM have done differ_ ent]y or more effectively had more time been afforded. The most serious defect in skillern\u2019s habeas argument that the relatively short period afforded his counsel rendered his trial constitutionally inadequate, }s that the state trial record in fact reflects a competent defense, while Skillern is unable to point out any failing of his counsel or to suggest evidence that should have been uncovered in his favor through more adequate representation. <em>Martin v. Mag-gio, supra, </em>711 F.2d at 1280-81 (citing other Fifth Circuit decisions),</p>\n<p id=\"Aqj1\">We therefore conclude that Skillern is not entitled to federal habeas relief on grounds related to the state trial court\u2019s denial of a continuance to his attorney or of the attorney\u2019s allegedly ineffective assistance at the trial, on the basis of: the state record and the reasons there suggested by counsel for the need for an additional 2-3 weeks to prepare the defense; the state trial court\u2019s reasons for rejection of the continuance and its remedial measures to facilitate appointed counsel\u2019s efficient preparation of the defense the infact effective representation Skillern at his state trial; and the lack on federal habeas review of any specific allegations as to what more could have been done in Skillern s defense,</p>\n<p id=\"aom-dedup-0\">III <em>Evidentiary Rulings in the Sentencing Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"afp-dedup-1\">Skillern\u2019s final substantial contention is that his fundamental right to a fair trial at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>the sentencing hearing was violated by the admission, over his counsel\u2019s objection, of the incompetent expert opinion of a forensic pathologist, based upon a hypothetical question, that there was a probability that Skillern \u201cwould commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">\u201e ,. , i it. m <em>n </em>4. <em>* </em>Criminal Appeals found that although the admission of the doctors answer was error because he was incompetent to testify as an expert and lacked firsthand familiarity with Skillern\u2019s personality to testify as a lay witness, it was harmless error due to the other evidence of Skillern\u2019s violent propensities adduced by the prosecution. Sanne v. <em>State, supra, </em>609 S.W.2d at 773-74. The defendant\u2019s attorney extensively cross-examined the doctor and established in the presence of the jury that the doctor was not formally licensed to practice psychiatry and that his opinion as to future behavior was strictly based upon a hypothetical situation, The state appellate court concluded that the incremental effect of the doctor\u2019s opinion was not great enough to have had a persuasive effect on the mind of the average juror. <em>Id. </em>609 S.W.2d at 774. The dissenting opinion in that court does set forth, however, strong reasons why the doctor\u2019s testimony was prejudicial to Skillern\u2019s defense against receiving a capital sentence. <em>Id </em>609 S W 2d at 777 778-79</p>\n<p id=\"A4qk\">The role of a federal habeas court is more limited than that of the state appellate court. We do not sit as a super state supreme court to review error under state law. <em>Porter v Estelle, </em>709 F.2d 944, 957 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Mendiola v. Estelle, </em>635 F.2d 487, 491 (5th Cir.1981), quoting <em>Cronnon v. Alabama, </em>587 F.2d 246, 251 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 974, 99 S.Ct. 1542, 59 L.Ed.2d 792 (1979). An evidentiary error in a state trial does not justify federal habeas corpus relief unless it is of such magnitude as to constitute a denial of fundamental fairness under the due process clause. <em>Porter, supra, </em>709 F.2d at 957, and decisions there cited. Thus, even the erroneous admission of prejudicial testimony does not justify habeas relief unless it is \u201cmaterial in the sense of a crucial, critical, highly significant factor.\u201d <em>Porter, supra, </em>709 F.2d at 957; <em>Anderson v.

State, supra, </em>609 S.W.2d at 773, possesses no merit as a basis for federal habeas relief.

The defendant objected to Charge 6 insofar as it permitted conviction of Skillern, absent proof of his personal participation in or encouragement of the murder. <em>Id. </em>pp. 207, 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">The pertinent portions of the jury charge at the <em>guilt </em>stage of the trial (other instructions were given at the submission to the jury following the post-conviction sentencing hearing) are:</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">Our law provides that a person commits capital murder when such person intentionally kills or causes the death of another while such person is in the course of committing or attempting to commit the offense of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">A person commits murder when he intentionally or knowingly kills or causes the death of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">*****:(:</p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-13\">A person acts intentionally, or with intent, with respect to the nature of his conduct or to a result of his conduct when it is his conscious objective or desire to engage in the conduct or cause the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-14\">A person acts knowingly, or with knowledge, with respect to the nature of his conduct or to circumstances surrounding his conduct when he is aware of the nature of his conduct or that the circumstances exist. A person acts knowingly, or with knowledge with respect to a result of his conduct when he is aware that his conduct is reasonably certain to cause the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-15\">5.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-16\">This is a case depending for conviction on circumstantial evidence. In order to warrant a conviction of a crime on circumstantial evidence, each fact necessary to the conclusion sought to be established must be proved by competent evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, all the facts (that is, the facts necessary to the conclusion) must be consistent with each other and with the main fact sought to be proved, and the circumstances, taken together, must be of a conclusive nature leading, on the whole to a satisfactory conclusion and producing, in effect, a reasonable and moral certainty that the accused, Doyle Edward Skillern, either alone or acting with Charles Victor Sanne, and no other person committed the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-17\">But in such cases it is not sufficient that the circumstances coincide with, account for, and therefore render probable the guilt of the defendant, Skillern. They must exclude, to a moral certainty, every other reasonable hypothesis raised by the evidence except the defendant, Skillern\u2019s guilt, and unless they do so beyond a reasonable doubt, you will find the defendant not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-18\">6.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-19\">A person is criminally responsible as a party to an offense if the offense is committed by his own conduct, by the conduct of another for which he is criminally responsible, or by both. A person is criminally responsible for an offense committed by the conduct of another, if, acting with intent to promote or assist in the commission of the offense, he solicits, encourages, directs, aids, or attempts to aid the other person to commit the offense. Each such party to the offense, whether jointly indicted or not, may be legally prosecuted and convicted as such, provided the evidence against each establishes that he acted as a party to the offense, regardless of the particular part played by each. Mere presence alone will not constitute one a Party.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-21\">If, in the attempt to carry out a conspiracy to commit one felony, another felony is committed by one of the conspirators, all conspirators are guilty of and parties to the felony actually committed, though having no intent to commit it, if the offense was committed in furtherance of the unlawful purpose and was one that should have been anticipated as a result of the carrying out of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-22\">7.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-23\">Now therefore if you find from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that on or about the 23rd of October, 1974, in the County of Live Oak and the State of Texas that the defendant Doyle Edward Skillern was acting as a party within the meaning of the word \u201cparty\u201d as the same is defined in Paragraph 6 of this charge, and that while so acting, if he was, that the defendant-, Charles Victor Sanne did then and there intentionally cause the death of Patrick Allen Randel by shooting him with a gun, if he did, and that the said Charles Victor Sanne did then and there intentionally cause the death of the said Patrick Allen Randel, if he did, in the course of committing or attempting to commit robbery as that term has heretofore been defined to you, then you will find defendant, Doyle Edward Skillern guilty of the offense of capital murder as charged in the indictment, and so say by your verdict.

We did so, however, not because of an <em>Enmund </em>Eighth Amendment violation, but because the defendant was denied constitutional due process by instructions that lessened the prosecutor\u2019s burden to prove guilt of the substantive offense (under state law) beyond a reasonable doubt.
