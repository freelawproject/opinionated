Finding that under <em>Estelle v. Smith, </em>451 U.S. 454, 101 S.Ct. 1866, 68 L.Ed.2d 359 (1981), White\u2019s fifth, sixth, and fourteenth amendment rights were violated by the introduction of the testimony of psychiatric witnesses at the penalty hearing, the district court vacated White\u2019s 1979 death sentence. On appeal, the state contends that (1) the district court erred in applying <em>Estelle v. Smith, supra </em>(1981), retroactively to White\u2019s 1979 case, (2) that the district court erred in finding that <em>Estelle v. Smith, supra, </em>applied to the psychiatric testimony presented at the sentencing phase of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>White\u2019s case, (3) that, as to some of the testimony of one of the mental examiners, the federal court was barred by the Texas contemporaneous objection rule from considering White\u2019s claim, and (4) that any error in admitting the psychiatric testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Finding no merit to the state\u2019s contentions, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment granting habeas relief and vacating White\u2019s death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">White was convicted of capital murder in June 1979. Following a capital conviction, a sentencing hearing is held at which three issues are submitted to the jury, mandating upon an affirmative jury finding the imposition of a capital sentence. One of these issues concerns the accused\u2019s propensities for future violence. The <em>Estelle v. Smith </em>issue in White\u2019s case results from the introduction into evidence at this penalty hearing of the testimony of two court-ordered mental examiners and their expressed professional opinion that there was a probability that White would commit future acts of violence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">At the state trial, White had not raised the issue of his mental competency to stand trial. However, in April 1979 the state trial court granted the state\u2019s motion for psychiatric testimony and ordered that members of the Harris County psychiatric unit \u201cconduct a psychiatric examination\u201d of White. This was the general form of an order used by that state court to determine whether or not the defendant is competent to stand trial. R. II, pp. 44-45. The defendant White was not advised of his right to remain silent nor forewarned that any disclosure made during the mental examinations would be used against him as evidence, if convicted, in a penalty hearing that might result in a capital sentence. Nor was defense counsel apprised in advance of the scope of the psychiatric hearing as comprehending the issue of White\u2019s propensity for future violence for purposes of use in the penalty hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Under these circumstances, the district court held that under <em>Estelle v. Smith, supra, </em>White\u2019s fifth, sixth, and fourteenth amendment rights were violated by use at the penalty hearing of the court-ordered mental examiners\u2019 testimony that the jury might reasonably believe was founded upon information obtained by these mental examiners as a result of the court-ordered psychiatric examinations of White.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">The state first argues that the ruling in the Supreme Court\u2019s 1981 decision of <em>Estelle v. White </em>should not be retroactively applied to this 1979 penalty hearing. We have already rejected this contention. <em>Battie v. Estelle, </em>655 F.2d 692 (5th Cir. 1981). Under the precedent theory of this court, one panel may not overrule an earlier decision of another panel of this court squarely on point and in the absence of intervening and overriding Supreme Court decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">The state next argues that <em>Estelle v. White </em>was not offended because the questions eliciting the expert witnesses\u2019 professional opinion on White\u2019s propensity for future violence were couched in terms of \u201chypothetical\u201d questions, although thinly veiled and patterning exactly White\u2019s prior criminal activity. The questions had been preceded by the testimony of each of the witnesses that they had examined White and had concluded that he possessed an anti-social personality. The district court found that, in the context of the entire interrogation, the answers to the \u201chypotheticals\u201d (in one of which, White\u2019s name was used)\u2014 closely tailored to fit White himself \u2014 reasonably indicated that the psychiatric prognosis of White\u2019s future dangerousness was influenced by and derived from the court-ordered pretrial psychiatric examinations (as, in fact, one of the two witnesses agreed was highly possible). Based upon our ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>animation of the state sentencing hearing, as well as of the testimony taken at the federal habeas hearing, we do not find this determination by the district judge insofar as factual to be clearly erroneous, so as to be reversible on appellate review. Fed.R. Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Aside from the mental witnesses\u2019 opinions allegedly based on \u201chypotheticals\u201d, the district court also found that the state introduced the testimony of the psychologist (Dr. Brown) in violation of <em>Estelle v. Smith </em>at the penalty hearing. Dr. Brown\u2019s testimony in this regard was admittedly based upon his court-ordered examination of White. Dr. Brown testified that White had an anti-social \u201chedonistic\u201d personality (tied in by subsequent questioning of the witness as being a \u201csociopath\u201d), a type of personality in which treatment was both unresponsive and with poor results. The questioning of this witness had developed that a person of this type of personality disorder was oriented more or less toward the moment and considered little in terms of the future consequences of his acts, and that a sociopath was characterized by an absence of remorse or guilt for past crimes and an inability to\u2019 profit from past experience. The questioning was obviously directed towards White\u2019s propensity for future violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">No objection was made at the time to the elicitation of this phase of Dr. Brown\u2019s testimony, and the state argues that federal habeas review of it is barred by the Texas contemporaneous objection rule. <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977). However, the Texas courts did not clearly reject White\u2019s petition for state collateral relief on that procedural ground; the district court therefore correctly concluded that the Texas court\u2019s decision to deny relief was based on the merits and thus did not foreclose federal review. <em>Bell v. Watkins, </em>692 F.2d 999, 1006 (5th Cir.1982). <em>See also Green v. Estelle, </em>706 F.2d 148 (5th Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>712 F.2d 995, 996 (5th Cir.1983) (holding that the Texas contemporaneous objection rule did not bar consideration of fifth and sixth amendment claims raised under <em>Estelle v. </em>Smith).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The state of Texas lastly contends that any error occasioned by the admission of the psychiatric testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We cannot conclude that evidence admitted on a critical issue in the sentencing phase of a capital case, in violation of White\u2019s constitutional rights, constituted harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Holloway </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>435 U.S. 475, 489-90, 98 S.Ct. 1173, 1181, 55 L.Ed.2d 426 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment granting habeas corpus relief and vacating White\u2019s capital sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-6\">. This question to each of the mental witnesses was couched in terms of a hypothetical closely tailored to fit White\u2019s history. In each instance, defense counsel objected to the question on the ground, inter alia, that the information requested in the hypothetical question violated White\u2019s fifth amendment rights.
