Robinson, charging him with first-degree burglary, petit larceny, and assault with a dangerous weapon. On November 4, 1969 Robinson pled guilty to second degree burglary. Robinson appeared for sentencing on February 17,1970. At that time the District Court ordered that a study be prepared pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(e) of the Federal Youth Corrections Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (hereinafter the \u201cYCA\u201d or \u201cthe Act\u201d) to determine whether Robinson would benefit from sentencing under the Act, and Robinson was committed to the custody of the Attorney General for study and appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">On May 6,1970 Robinson was back before the District Court, the \u00a7 5010(e) study having been completed. The court then sentenced appellant under the YCA pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(b) for a term not to exceed the statutory maximum of six years under the Attorney General\u2019s supervision. The court also dismissed the remaining counts against Robinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">Robinson was released on parole from the Community Treatment Center on June 25,1971. On August 5,1971 his parole status was changed to \u201cinactive\u201d and he was no longer required to report to a parole officer. On February 16, 1976, six years after the original \u00a7 5010(e) study was ordered, Robinson was unconditionally discharged from his YCA sentence. The court is now asked to determine whether this release occurred prior to, or coincided with, the expiration of Robinson\u2019s maximum sentence. On this question turns appellant\u2019s right to the relief he seeks \u2014 the expungement of the burglary conviction from his record. If the date of the commitment for the \u00a7 5010(e) study is determined to be the date of Robinson\u2019s sentencing under the YCA, then he was unconditionally released upon the expiration of his maximum sentence. If, however, the date of his sentencing is determined to be the date of the \u00a7 5010(b) commitment, then Robinson\u2019s maximum sentence would not have expired until May 5, 1976, and his February, 1976 release would have occurred prior to the completion of that maximum sentence. We hold that his sentence began on February 17,1970, that he is not entitled to expungement of his conviction, and thus that the ruling of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-14\">The Federal Youth Corrections Act is Congress\u2019 response to the need for flexibility in the sentencing of young criminals. \u201cIt was intended to provide a flexible rehabilitation program for selected youthful offenders amenable to treatment....\u201d <em>White v. Reid, </em>126 F.Supp. 867, 869 (D.D.C. 1954). The YCA offender is subject to \u201ctreatment\u201d, not simply punishment. Treatment \u201cmeans corrective and preventive guidance and training designed to protect the public by correcting the antisocial tendencies of youthful offenders.... \u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5006(f). The youthful offender, once sentenced under the Act, is guaranteed release from all supervision after a maximum of six years under the guidance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Attorney General. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5010, 5017. The statute also provides a unique incentive to those sentenced under its provisions. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5021 states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">(a) Upon the unconditional discharge by the Commission of a committed youth offender before the expiration of the maximum sentence imposed upon him, the conviction shall be set aside and the Commission shall issue to the youth offender a certificate to that effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALe\">Robinson\u2019s appeal to this court concerns his effort to gain this certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">This certificate ought to be the goal of every youth offender. It is in effect the return-ticket from a criminal conviction. Once given, it frees the young offender from the real disabilities of a criminal record and reduces the lingering stigma of a conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">A youth offender committed under the provisions of the Youth Corrections Act upon his release unconditionally before the expiration of the maximum sentence imposed is entitled to have the conviction set aside \u201cautomatically\u201d and not as a matter of discretion. This feature of the Youth Corrections Act gives it an operative effect, which presents a marked and important difference from a criminal conviction which can be relieved only by a presidential pardon and then only to a limited extent. Thus apart from and more important than the other differences urged upon us, a person sentenced under the Youth Corrections Act can, by virtue of his own good conduct, be spared the lifelong burden of a criminal record. ... [A] Youth Corrections sentence ... can, by the choice and conduct of the individual, become a non-criminal episode so far as the public records are concerned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqT\"><em>Tatum v. United States, </em>310 F.2d 854, 855-56 (D.C.Cir.1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">The opportunity to earn this certificate has been called by the Supreme Court a \u201cparticularly valuable benefit for the offender sentenced under the YCA ...\u201d <em>Durst v. United States, </em>434 U.S. 542, 548, 98 S.Ct. 849, 852, 55 L.Ed.2d 14 (1978). More recently the Court noted that \u201cCongress\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">purpose in adopting \u00a7 5021 was to promote the rehabilitation of youth offenders by providing a substantial incentive for positive behavior while serving a sentence under the YCA.\u201d <em>Tuten v. United </em>States, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 1412, 1415, 75 L.Ed.2d 359 (1983). In <em>Tuten, </em>the Supreme Court rejected arguments that the set-aside provision in \u00a7 5021 operated automatically upon <em>completion </em>of the offender\u2019s YCA sentence. It is thus settled that a youth offender will receive an automatic set-aside only if he is unconditionally released <em>prior to </em>the running of his maximum sentence. The Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-12\">Under the interpretation of \u00a7 5021(b) plainly suggested by the language of the statute, the conviction of a youth offender who has been placed on probation under \u00a7 5010(a) is not set aside where, as here, the court has <em>not </em>exercised its discretion to discharge him unconditionally \u201cprior to the expiration of the maximum period of probation theretofore fixed by the court,\u201d which in this case was two years. This limitation is fully consistent with the rehabilitative purpose of the YCA as well as with Congress\u2019 intent to employ the set aside as an incentive for positive behavior by youths sentenced under the Act. The incentive might be significantly weaker if convictions were set aside regardless of whether the youth offender, by his conduct during the probationary period, had convinced the sentencing court to discharge him before the expiration of his probationary term. Although it would also have been reasonable for Congress to make the set-aside available to any youth offender who completes probation without incident, this result is certainly not compelled by the purposes of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-13\"><em>Id. </em>at-, 103 S.Ct. at 1417.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-14\">While <em>Tuten </em>established that the automatic set-aside is available only to those youth offenders who are unconditionally discharged prior to the expiration of their maximum sentence, it did not inquire into the specifics for calculating the crucial dates of sentencing and discharge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>\u00a7 5006(g) of the Act provides that \u201c \u2018conviction\u2019 means the judgment on a verdict or finding of guilty, a plea of guilty, or a plea of nolo contendere.\u201d \u00a7 5017(c) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\">A youth offender committed under section 5010(b) of this chapter shall be released conditionally under supervision on or before the expiration of four years from the date of his conviction and shall be discharged unconditionally on or on or before six years from the date of conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">This case requires the court to determine what is meant by the phrase \u201cdate of conviction\u201d in \u00a7 5017(c). Mr. Robinson argues that \u201cthe date of conviction contemplated by \u00a7 5017(c) is the date of the judgment of conviction; that is, the date the court imposes sentence under the Act.\u201d Brief for Robinson at 4. He further asserts that \u201cexpiration of the \u2018maximum sentence imposed\u2019 under \u00a7\u00a7 5010(b), 5017(c) and 5021(a) is six years from the date sentence is imposed under the Act, as reflected in the final Judgment and Commitment Order\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 5. As the \u00a7 5010(b) sentence was ordered on May 6, 1970, and Robinson was unconditionally discharged on February 16, 1976, he urges that he was \u201cunconditionally discharged <em>prior to </em>six years from the date of imposition of sentence\u201d, and thus that he \u201cwas entitled to an automatic set aside and should be granted a set aside <em>nunc pro tunc </em>as of February 16, 1976.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The Government disagrees with this interpretation of the statute and argues that a \u201c\u00a7 5010(e) commitment constitutes an imposition of sentence ...\u201d Brief for the United States at 5. It asserts that \u201cthere is no valid reason for excluding the time spent by a defendant in custody pursuant to a \u00a7 5010(e) commitment from the \u2018sentence\u2019 ultimately imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the Government concludes, \u201cthe expiration of appellant\u2019s maximum sentence occurred on February 16, 1976, the exact date he was unconditionally discharged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6-7. The District Court agreed with the Government and denied Robinson\u2019s motion for expungement of his record. Order, <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>Crim. No. 866-69 (D.D.C. May 13, 1981). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">This case centers on the effect on a youth offender\u2019s YCA sentence of a court-ordered \u00a7 5010(e) study. The \u00a7 5010(e) study is a crucial component of Congress\u2019 scheme for dealing with young offenders. Age is not the single trigger which propels a young criminal into the YCA\u2019s framework. Rather, age plus an amenability to the treatment envisioned provides entrance into the YCA program. The \u00a7 5010(e) study is the means by which judges can reliably determine whether a young offender can benefit from a YCA sentence. This court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-12\">As part of this elaborate [YCA] scheme Congress provided for the preparation of \u00a7 5010(e) reports, designed to supply \u201cadditional information as to whether [the] youth offender will derive benefit from treatment.\u201d The observation and study period furnishes an invaluable opportunity to discover why these youths committed crimes, whether and in what way society has failed them, and what might be done to foster productive, law abiding conduct in the future. The reports prepared are potentially useful presentenc-ing aids to assist the judge in discharging his awesome responsibilities under the Act. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>at the Center. He may conduct interviews not only with the offender but also with his family and community associates. The clinical psychologist compiles a personality profile of the offender, based on interviews with him and certain projective and intelligence tests. The three Classification Committee members prepare a joint evaluation and recommendation. This evaluation and recommendation, along with the individual reports of the Classification and Parole Officer and the clinical psychologist and a cover letter from the Superintendent or Assistant Director of the Youth Center are forwarded to the D.C. Board of Parole. Based on this material, the Board makes its own recommendation and submits the entire package of documents, the completed \u00a7 5010(e) study, to the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number><em>United States v. Hopkins, </em>531 F.2d 576, 581 (D.C.Cir.1976). We have also described the process typically associated with the conduct of a \u00a7 5010(e) study.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is a thorough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>and comprehensive evaluation which draws upon all available data regarding the young offender, including his family and social background and his conduct while committed to the institution responsible for the study. It is the first step in the offender\u2019s rehabilitation. Because the commitment operates to confine the youth, it is also more than a simple \u201cpre-sentencing aid.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fort, </em>409 F.2d 441, 443 (D.C.Cir.1969) (\u00a7 5010(e) commitment constitutes a sentence for purposes of determining appealability of defendant\u2019s conviction). It is, in fact, a sentence. <em>United States v. Hinkle, </em>492 F.2d 660 (D.C.Cir.1974) (\u00a7 5010(e), commitment was a sentence so that appellant was convicted within the meaning of the impeachment statute). See <em>also United States v. Carter, 225 </em>F.Supp. 566 (D.D.C.1964). The court is now asked to decide whether this interim sentence is so interconnected with the permanent sentence rendered under the YCA that time spent under it ought also to be considered time spent under the final YCA sentence for the purpose of computing a young offender\u2019s maximum sentence and thus whether he has been unconditionally released prior to the expiration of that maximum sentence. We hold that it is so connected, and that it does so count.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">We note first that the regulations of the United States Parole Commission provide that time spent \u201cin custody in connection with the offense or acts for which sentence was imposed ...\u201d is to be credited towards service of the sentence. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.10(a) (1982). The regulation which deals specifically with YCA sentence computation states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-9\">(c) Service of the sentence of a committed youth offender . .. commences to run from the date of conviction and is interrupted only when such prisoner or parolee: (1) Is on bail pending appeal; (2) is in escape status; (3) has absconded from parole supervision; or (4) comes within the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">28 C.F.R. 2.10(c). The Commission\u2019s regulations make no effort to separate time spent committed for a \u00a7 5010(e) study from time generally spent under YCA sentence, even though a regulation exists that deals specifically with excludable time. The Government also argues that the District of Columbia Department of Corrections and the United States Bureau of Prisons compute youth offenders\u2019 sentences beginning with the date of a \u00a7 5010(e) study if there was one done.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s counsel stated at oral argument that although he thought the practices of these two agencies to be irrelevant, he had no reason to dispute the Government\u2019s assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Because of the practices of these agencies the time spent under a \u00a7 5010(e) commitment has been routinely figured into sentence computations for youth offenders. Were the court to hold for appellant and decree that YCA sentences should run from the date of final sentencing after receipt of the study, two effects would follow. First, the ruling would result in the windfall of automatic expungement not only of Robinson\u2019s record, but also of the records of many YCA offenders who had been released on a date calculated under the current sentence computation procedures. Any offenders released on a date computed by reference to the time of their \u00a7 5010(e) commitments would be entitled to demand and gain automatic expungement of their convictions. Second, such a ruling would result in the imposition of additional commitment time for all offenders currently serving YCA sentences who had been studied under \u00a7 5010(e)\u2019s provisions. These offenders would henceforth be denied credit toward the completion of their sentences for time spent during a \u00a7 5010(e) commitment. Neither logic nor precedent requires these unfortunate results.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">We feel, as did the Fifth Circuit when it was confronted with a similar question, that the critical consideration at issue here is whether appellant was in \u201c \u2018constructive custody\u2019 \u201d while the \u00a7 5010(e)- study was underway. <em>Davis v. Markley, </em>589 F.2d 784, 785 (4th Cir.1979). In <em>Davis </em>the court considered the denial of a writ of habeas corpus to a prisoner who argued that her sentence had been incorrectly computed. She argued that various time periods, amounting to 293 days, ought to be credited towards time spent serving her YCA sentence. A portion of those 293 days was time spent during a stay of an order committing her to the custody of the Attorney General for observation and report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">On August 19, 1975, petitioner\u2019s probation was revoked and the court ordered her committed to the custody of the Attorney General for observation and report, but suspended operation of the order until August 27, 1975. This 7 days is the first time period at issue. On November 5,1975, petitioner was committed to the custody of the Attorney General for treatment and supervision ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-7\"><em>Id. </em>The court did not directly pass on the question of credit for time spent committed for study. But it did explicitly hold that the time spent under the stay of the order committing her for study was to be credited towards her YCA sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-8\">[O]ur inquiry is whether during the [time periods] during which petitioner was on stay of execution of sentence she was in \u201cconstructive custody,\u201d <em>Suggs v. Daggett, </em>522 F.2d [396] at 397 [10th Cir.1975]; if so, the Act\u2019s concern for correctional rehabilitation is met and the time must be considered operative. We find that petitioner\u2019s time on stay was tantamount to time on probation and was thus operative time within 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5017(c). The stay orders required petitioner to regularly report her employment status to the court, and allowed the sentencing judge the flexibility to attempt to allow petitioner to rehabilitate herself through employment rather than incarceration. She remained at all times within the supervisory ambit of the correctional process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ajj-dedup-0\"><em>Id. </em>at 785-786. If a stay of a commitment for a \u00a7 5010(e) study is part of the \u201csupervisory ambit\u201d, then the study itself is certainly part of the same penumbra. Time spent while under such a study should be, and was in Robinson\u2019s case, credited towards total YCA sentence time.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">It should also be noted that the time available for study under \u00a7 5010(e) is open-ended. Once a youthful offender is committed for study, the United States Parole Commission must report its findings to the court within 60 days or within \u201csuch additional period as the court may grant ...\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(e). It would cut against the statute\u2019s stated maximum sentence of six years to ignore these two months, and it would be inequitable in the extreme to ignore the lengthier periods when they arise. If a youth offender\u2019s \u00a7 5010(e) study required, for example, six months, it would under Robinson\u2019s theory have no bearing on the six year maximum sentence. Yet for that entire period the offender would presumably be undergoing the same rehabilita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>tive regime as would follow final sentencing under the YCA. There is simply no reason to divorce this \u00a7 5010(e) study from all that follows its completion.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">This court has commented at length on the goals of the YCA. <em>See Doe v. Webster, </em>606 F.2d 1226 (D.C.Cir.1979). We have rejected constructions of the YCA based upon \u201cartificial premise[s]\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 1241, and Robinson\u2019s argument that substantive and functional differences separate the \u00a7 5010(e) commitment from the \u00a7 5010(b) commitment strikes us as artificial. Reply Brief for Robinson at 3. Robinson argues that \u201cmaximum available time\u201d must be given to the Attorney General to ensure that young offenders receive the attention necessary to give rehabilitation a chance to succeed. <em>Id. </em>at 6. But Congress set. an outside limit on the time available to reach that goal. We must emphasize the simple fact that time spent under the supervision of the Attorney General is part of that \u201cmaximum available time\u201d, whether it is time officially denominated as \u00a7 5010(e) time or \u00a7 5010(b) time. Accordingly, we hold that Robinson was not unconditionally released prior to the expiration of his maximum sentence, and therefore affirm the ruling of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-15\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5005 et <em>seq. </em>(1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b302-7\">.
