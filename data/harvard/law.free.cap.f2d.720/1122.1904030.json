No. 95-250, \u00a7\u00a7 201-213, 92 Stat. 163,172-182 (1978). First, whether the Secretary may at any time reopen the determination of an employee\u2019s entitlement to benefits, and, second, whether receipt of Social Security disability payments bars a claimant from benefits under the Act where the Secretary is contesting the claim. We rule for the employee on both points.</p>\n<p id=\"AVio\">The Secretary concedes that equitable concerns may in special cases bar reconsideration of entitlement determinations, despite the broad statement in regulations promulgated under the Act. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. 92.50(r). The instant case is most appropriate for determining that equitable princ<em>i</em>ples bar the Secretary from reopening the ,. \u201e , ,\u2022 \u2022 question of employee eligibility. The issue is whether the employee was terminated A , prior to the effective date of the Act, as 5 distinct from being continued m a disabled status. That issue was determined by the 0 , \u201e Secretary some four years ago, and at that . , relatiwlv \u00cdTlnniVv focused on events that transpired some seven years before The infor^ation the gec. retary now relies on to make a redetermination was available earlier and is not dispositive in any event, since whether the employee was notified would also bear on whether the employee was terminated. <em>See </em>Cal.Lab.Code \u00a7 2922 (West Supp.1982) (at will employment is terminated by employer on notice to employee). There has been no fraud, misrepresentation, or manipulation of the facts by the employee. While the Secretary need not always show good cause in order to reopen a benefit determination, the absence of good cause is a factor to consider when, in an aggravated case, we are considering the equities of the matter, The Secretary\u2019s delay in reopening the issue is not for good cause. <em>Cf. </em>29 C.F.R. 92.-50(u)- In the circumstances before us, we determine it is inequitable to reopen the earlier determination in favor of the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"avb-dedup-0\">Section 205(b) makes claimants receiving Social Security disability benefits ineligible under the Act. We find the seetion inapplicable, however, where Social Security is received in lieu of Redwood Act benefits by reason of the Secretary\u2019s contesting the latter. An appropriate adjustment in Redwood Act benefits must be made to prevent double recovery. But we do not think Congress contemplated that Social Security benefits must be waived as a condition to claiming benefits under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>Act, where the Secretary is contesting payment. In this case the Secretary would have the employee receive no benefits for the four years the contest has endured. The statute does not require that result. Indeed, Congress commanded that the Secretary \u201cavoid inequities adverse to employees that otherwise would arise from an unduly literal interpretation of the language of this title.\u201d \u00a7 213(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\">The case is remanded to the Secretary for payment of benefits, subject to offset for Social Security disability payments that were made and retained, as provided by the administrative law judge in his order of June 1, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">The five years of administrative hearings in this case constitute the Bleak House of litigation under the Redwood National Park Expansion Act. Accordingly, the petitioner is awarded attorney\u2019s fees for this appeal under the Equal Access to Justice Act. Petitioner\u2019s attorney is directed to file an application for fees, with supporting documentation, within 30 days of this order. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(3) (Supp. V 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-6\">REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
