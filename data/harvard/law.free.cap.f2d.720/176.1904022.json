The issue on this appeal is whether appellants\u2019 complaint presents a case or contro<em>versy </em>\u2014 i.e., whether appellants have standing \u2014 even though invalidation of the Interpretative Bulletin would not compel appellants\u2019 employers to grant prospective or retrospective relief from the allegedly unlawful pension plans. The district court granted appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Von Aulock v. </em>Smith, 548 F.Supp. 196 (D.D.C.1982). We affirm because we conclude that appellants\u2019 injury, which was suffered at the hands of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>employers, is not fairly traceable to the EEOC\u2019s maintenance of the Interpretative Bulletin as an interpretive regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">According to the complaint, whose factual allegations we must accept as true in reviewing the jurisdictional dismissal, <em>see Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 501, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2206, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975), appellant Von Aulock is an employee of Bell Laboratories in New Jersey. He is a participant in a Bell pension plan established on January 1, 1979, the day Bell raised its mandatory retirement age from 65 to 70 in order to comply with the 1978 amendment of the ADEA. Under Bell\u2019s plan, Von Aulock\u2019s pension will be calculated on the basis of his employment status at the time he reaches the normal retirement age of 65. Thus, although Von Aulock has continued to work past that age, his pension benefits have not been increased to take account of this work. In addition, Von Aulock\u2019s pension benefits will not be increased to reflect his shorter expected lifespan when he retires and begins collecting benefits at an age past 65. Finally, Von Aulock is not eligible for a new Bell plan that has higher benefits and is generally available to persons who are active employees on August 10, 1980, but is not available to employees such as Von Au-loek who are past the age of 65 on that date; that is, the benefit improvement does not apply to employees past the age of 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Appellant Hidalgo is a former employee of Rockwell International in California and a participant in a Rockwell pension plan. Hidalgo retired from Rockwell at the age of 66, taking advantage of Rockwell\u2019s raising of its mandatory retirement age from 65 to 70. Nonetheless, Hidalgo\u2019s benefits under Rockwell\u2019s pension plan were based on his employment status at the time he reached 65; the benefits took no account of his salary and cost-of-living increases in his final year of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Appellants alleged in their complaint that their employers\u2019 pension plans discriminated against them solely because they were over age 65. They further alleged that their employers\u2019 refusal to adjust pension benefits to take account of service past age 65 has no age-related cost justification. The Bell and Rockwell pension plans, they therefore alleged, violated the ADEA\u2019s prohibition on \u201cdiscrimination] against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s age.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">Rather than suing their employers under the ADEA, appellants brought this action against the EEOC. They alleged in their complaint that Bell and Rockwell maintain the challenged pension plans \u201cbecause they are authorized to do so by\u201d an Interpretative Bulletin of the EEOC. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 28, 36. They contended that the Interpretative Bulletin is contrary to the ADEA and sought a judgment, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 (1976), both declaring the invalidity of the current Bulletin and requiring the EEOC to promulgate new regulations consistent with the ADEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">The challenged Bulletin is an interpretation of section 4(f)(2) of the ADEA. That section declares:</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">It shall not be unlawful for an employer</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adh\">(2) to observe the terms of a bona fide seniority system or any bona fide employment benefit plan such as a retirement, pension, or insurance plan, which is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of [the ADEA] ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-14\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(f)(2) (Supp. V 1981). When Congress raised the upper age limit on coverage of the ADEA from 65 to 70, it became necessary to clarify the legal status of pension plans based, as many are, on a retirement age of 65. On May 25,1979, the Department of Labor, which at that time had responsibility for administering the ADEA, issued the Interpretative Bulletin that is the subject of this lawsuit. 44 Fed. Reg. 30,648 (1979) (codified at 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 860.120(f)(iv)(B) (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-15\">The Interpretative Bulletin discusses two types of retirement plans: \u201cdefined contribution\u201d plans and \u201cdefined benefit\u201d plans. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Under the former type of plan, employers make designated contributions to the accounts of participating employees, who, at retirement, receive the amount that has accumulated, through employer contributions and interest, in their accounts. Under the latter type of plan, employees receive designated periodic payments upon retirement, and employers fund the plans with whatever is necessary, which depends on changing actuarial projections, to make the designated payments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants challenge five provisions of the Interpretative Bulletin, one relating to defined contribution plans, and four relating to defined benefit plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Subsection (1) states, in relevant part, that \u201c[a] defined contribution plan may provide for the cessation of employer contributions after the normal retirement age of any participant in the plan,\u201d unless the plan is \u201csupplemental\u201d to a defined benefit plan or to another defined contribution plan. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 860.120(f)(iv)(B)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subsections (3), (4), (5), and (7) provide that a defined benefit plan need not give credit, in calculating benefit accrual, for an employee\u2019s service past normal retirement age and need not actuarially adjust the benefits accrued to reflect abnormally late retirement. Those subsections also state that a defined benefit plan need not provide for the accrual of benefits during service past normal retirement age. Finally, they provide that a defined benefit plan need not take account of salary increases or plan improvements that take effect after an employee\u2019s normal retirement age, though denial of such increases and improvements is conditioned on the employer\u2019s giving the employee the benefit of any improvements made in the plans that apply to persons already retired; in short, the late-retiring employee must be treated either as a retiree or as a younger employee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We assume that appellants\u2019 description of the Bell and Rockwell pension plans is accurate and, therefore, that the Interpretative Bulletin does, as appellants allege, condone the two challenged plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>One month after the Department of Labor promulgated the Bulletin, the EEOC took over the administration and enforcement of the ADEA. Reorg. Plan No. 1 of 1978, 3 C.F.R. 321 (1979), <em>reprinted in </em>5 U.S.C. app. at 1155-56 (1982), <em>and in </em>92 Stat. 3781 (1978). The EEOC announced that it had undertaken a complete review of Labor Department interpretations of the ADEA and that those interpretations would remain in effect until new interpretations were adopted. 44 Fed.Reg. 37,974-75 (1979). Since that time, the EEOC has issued modified interpretations on a variety of subjects covered by the Labor Department carryover interpretations. <em>See </em>46 Fed.Reg. 47,724 (1981); 44 Fed.Reg. 68,858 (1979). But the Interpretative Bulletin challenged by appellants, which the EEOC maintains is still under substantive review, remains in effect. <em>See </em>46 Fed.Reg. at 47,-726.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Soon after the filing of the complaint in this case, appellee Smith moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the complaint failed to present a justiciable case or controversy. Appellee argued that the Interpretative Bulletin, being merely an agency interpretation and hence not binding on employers, was not the cause of appellants\u2019 injury and that its invalidation would not likely result in redress of appellants\u2019 injury. Appellants countered that Bell\u2019s and Rockwell\u2019s maintenance of their plans was in fact fairly traceable to the Interpretative Bulletin. More particularly, they alleged that, because the Portal-to-Portal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 259 (1976), is applicable to the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(e)(1) (Supp. V 1981), they suffer a direct injury in that the Bulletin deprives them of any remedy against their employers for any discriminatory action taken in good faith reliance on an EEOC interpretation, even if that interpretation eventually is declared to be contrary to law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The effect of the Bulletin, in other words, is to immunize employers from liability in damages for actions taken in good faith reliance upon the Bulletin prior to a determination that the Bulletin\u2019s position is wrong and their actions illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">The district court granted the motion to dismiss. The court concluded that appellants had \u201cnot alleged a sufficient nexus between their injury and the government action attacked to justify judicial intervention. <em>Linda R.S. v. Richard D., </em>410 U.S. 614, 617-18 [93 S.Ct. 1146, 1148-49, 35 L.Ed.2d 536] (1972).\u201d 548 F.Supp. at 197. In particular, the court thought \u201cpurely conjectural\u201d the possibility that an employer would plead and prove good faith reliance on the Bulletin as an affirmative defense in an ADEA suit by an employee. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number><em>Id. </em>Judgment was accordingly entered for appellee, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The Constitution imposes at least three requirements on a plaintiff claiming standing in federal court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">At an irreducible minimum, Art. Ill requires the party who invokes the court\u2019s authority to \u201cshow that he personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant,\u201d and that the injury \u201cfairly can be traced to the challenged action\u201d and \u201cis likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-7\"><em>Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church &amp; State, Inc., </em>454 U.S. 464, 472, 102 S.Ct. 752, 758, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982) (citations omitted). For appellants to establish standing in this case, therefore, they must allege (1) an injury that is (2) fairly traceable to the Interpretative Bulletin and (3) likely to be redressed by a judicial decision invalidating the Bulletin. <em>See Community Nutrition Institute v. Block, </em>698 F.2d 1239, 1245 (D.C. Cir.1983); <em>Consumers Union v. FTC, </em>691 F.2d 575, 577 n. 9 (D.C.Cir.1982) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Appellants have alleged two injuries in their attempt to meet the constitutional requirements for standing. First, they have pointed to the unlawfully low pensions provided for by their employers\u2019 pension plans. This injury is a traditional economic harm. Second, they have pointed to the legal impossibility, due to the ADEA\u2019s incorporation of the Portal-to-Portal Pay Act, of holding their employers liable for past violations of the ADEA while the Interpretative Bulletin remains an agency regulation. This injury is the deprivation of all possibility of securing the higher pensions to which they claim an entitlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">A decision of this court makes clear that the second injury \u2014 carefully defined so that the \u201cfairly traceable\u201d and \u201credressability\u201d requirements for standing are satisfied \u2014 is not constitutionally sufficient. <em>Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce v. Goldsch-midt, </em>627 F.2d 258 (D.C.Cir.1980), expressly rejected the argument that \u201cany litigant who can allege that he is seeking to remove an \u2018absolute barrier\u2019 to the relief he ultimately desires must have standing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 264. The court held that the existence of one absolute barrier was sufficient injury only if its removal would mean that all other barriers to the ultimately sought relief were likely to fall. <em>Id. </em>at 264-65. This holding followed directly from Supreme Court precedent. In <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975), for example, the Court held that the plaintiffs had no standing even though they sought a legal change (a zoning variance) that was a necessary condition, though not the only one, for relief from the injury they \u00faltimately complained of (the absence of low-income housing). The second injury asserted by appellants in this case is identical to that asserted in <em>Goldschmidt </em>and must likewise be deemed insufficient to confer standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">Jurisdiction over appellants\u2019 complaint therefore depends on the adequacy of appellants\u2019 primary claim of injury. Since deprivation of legally required pension benefits unquestionably constitutes injury in fact, it is the other two requirements for standing that present problems for appellants. To satisfy those requirements, the allegations of their complaint must enable this court to conclude that the allegedly unlawful pension plans are fairly traceable to the existence of the Interpretative Bulletin and are likely to be altered to conform to the ADEA if this case were to result in the invalidation of the Interpretative Bulletin.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">These two requirements have been treated as distinct. <em>See Community Nutrition Institute v. Block, </em>698 F.2d at 1244 \u2014 45. They are nonetheless closely related, especially where, as here, the injury complained of is future injury, <em>i.e., </em>the future maintenance of unlawful pension plans.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>deed, they were initially articulated by the Supreme Court as \u201ctwo facets of a single causation requirement.\u201d C. Wright, <em>Law of Federal Courts </em>\u00a7 13, at 68 n. 43 (4th ed. 1983); <em>see </em>698 F.2d at 1244 n. 26 (quoting <em>Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., </em>438 U.S. 59, 74, 98 S.Ct. 2620, 2631, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1978), and Warth <em>v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. at 505, 95 S.Ct. at 2208). They both implement the prohibition on unnecessary, advisory opinions expressed in Article Ill\u2019s case-or-controversy requirement. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, </em>426 U.S. 26, 39, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 1924, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976), \u201c[t]he necessity that the plaintiff who seeks to invoke judicial power stand to profit in some personal interest remains an Article III requirement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">The \u201cfairly traceable\u201d requirement for standing, as applied to the injury in this case, demands that Bell\u2019s and Rockwell\u2019s future maintenance of their allegedly unlawful pension plans be fairly traceable to the continued existence of the Interpretative Bulletin. The \u201credressability\u201d requirement is different, though obviously similar, because it does not focus, as the \u201cfairly traceable\u201d requirement does, on the direct \u201cconnection between the alleged injury and [appellee\u2019s] actions.\u201d <em>Community Nutrition Institute v. Block, </em>698 F.2d at 1245. Rather, it focuses on the \u201cconnection between the alleged injury and the action requested of the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, in this case, the \u201credressability\u201d requirement demands that it be likely that Bell and Rockwell provide appellants with more favorable, lawful pension plans once appellants have secured from this lawsuit a judgment that the Interpretative Bulletin is contrary to the ADEA. Since the \u201cfairly traceable\u201d requirement is a causation requirement, <em>see id., </em>it, like the \u201credressability\u201d requirement, directs us to assess the likely effect on appellants\u2019 employers of the absence of the Interpretative Bulletin. The \u201credressability\u201d requirement directs us to assess, in addition, the likely effect on the employers of a judicial declaration of the invalidity of the Bulletin.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Although the standing inquiry in this case involves the delicate task of guessing the likely action in hypothetical situations of parties not before the court, \u201c[t]he mere fact that ultimate relief to the appellants depends on the actions of third parties does not by itself defeat appellants\u2019 standing .. .. \u201d <em>Committee for Full Employment v. Blumenthal, </em>606 F.2d 1062, 1066 (D.C.Cir. 1979). \u201c[T]he indirectness of the injury,\u201d however, \u201cmay make it substantially more difficult to meet the minimum requirement of Article III .... \u201d <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. at 505, 95 S.Ct. at 2208. In a case such as this, therefore, we must exercise special care to ensure that standing is not being rested on \u201cinjury that results from the independent action of some third party not before the court.\u201d <em>Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, </em>426 U.S. at 41-42, 96 S.Ct. at 1925-26. Upon assessing the likely effect on Bell and Rockwell of the absence of the Interpretative Bulletin, we conclude that appellants\u2019 injury is the result of their employers\u2019 independent action and therefore is not fairly traceable to the Bulletin.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">One reason we draw that conclusion is that both Bell and Rockwell have maintained the pension plans challenged by appellants at least since January 1, 1979, the effective date of the 1978 ADEA amendments. The Interpretative Bulletin, though proposed in September 1978, was promulgated almost six months later, on May 25, 1979. 44 Fed. Reg. 30,648 (1979). Appellants\u2019 employers thus evidently did not feel it necessary to delay adoption (or temporarily to suspend) their pension plans until they could claim the protection, through the Portal-to-Portal Pay Act, of the Bulletin. They made a decision to maintain the challenged plans, for which they were at risk for six months (perhaps longer), based on an independent judgment about the legality of their plans, a judgment whose independence would be diminished only slightly if it incorporated predictions about the final action of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Labor Department and about judicial deference to agency interpretations. That judgment is some evidence of the likely effect on Bell and Rockwell of the absence of the Interpretative Bulletin.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Much more important, however, is the basis appellants\u2019 employers had in January, 1979, and have today for the maintenance of their pension plans wholly independent of the Interpretative Bulletin. The statute does not by its terms authorize the challenged aspects of the Bell and Rockwell plans. Rather, to the general proscriptions of the ADEA it makes a broad exception for \u201cany bona fide employee benefit plan ... which is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of [the Act].\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(f)(2) (1976). This broad exception is thus defined in statutory language whose meaning in particular circumstances may be, though of course need not be, decisively determined by legislative history. Just such circumstances seem to be presented by the questions whether the challenged portions of the Interpretative Bulletin violate the ADEA. The legislative history of the 1978 amendments to section 4(f)(2) \u2014 -in which Congress overturned <em>United Air Lines, Inc. v. McMann, </em>434 U.S. 192, 98 S.Ct. 444, 54 L.Ed.2d 402 (1977), by adding the statement that \u201cno such ... employee benefit plan shall require or permit the involuntary retirement of any individual specified by section 12(a) of this Act because of the age of such individual,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(f)(2) (Supp. Y 1981) \u2014 provides explicit and extremely strong support for the correctness of the challenged portions of the Interpretative Bulletin and hence for the lawfulness of the Bell and Rockwell plans insofar as they are indirectly challenged by appellants\u2019 challenge to the Bulletin.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Congress amended the ADEA in 1978 in two principal respects: it raised the age limit on the coverage of the Act from 65 to 70, and it prohibited pension plans that provided for mandatory retirement. S.Rep. No. 493, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 1 (1977), U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 504. Together, these two amendments made it necessary to address \u201c[t]he argument that pension and other employee benefit plan costs would increase if the act\u2019s upper age limit is increased,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 5, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 508, which was, as one might expect, a major source of concern to Congress. The relevant Senate Report states that that argument had \u201cnot been substantiated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In support of that conclusion, the Senate Report notes that the ADEA would not interfere \u201cwith the relevant provisions of the 1974 pension law [ERISA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Report then states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">This legislation ... does not require the accrual of additional benefits or the payment of the actuarial equivalent of normal retirement benefits to employees who choose to work beyond the plan\u2019s normal retirement date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">Included in this report is a letter from Assistant Secretary [for Labor for Employment Standards] Elisburg responding in detail to questions from the Chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on the relationship between ERISA and the proposed amendments to the ADEA which reaffirms the committee\u2019s intent in this regard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-9\"><em>Id. </em>The Elisburg letter gives answers to specific questions. It states, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-10\"><em>Question 1. </em>Would an employer be required to credit years of service for purposes of benefit accrual after normal retirement age?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-11\">Answer. It is our view that nothing in the ADEA or in the proposed amendments would require an employer to credit, for purposes of benefit accrual, those years of service which occur after an employee\u2019s normal retirement age....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-12\"><em>Question 2. </em>Would an employer be required to pay the actuarial equivalent of normal retirement benefits to an employee who continues to work beyond the normal retirement age?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-13\">Answer. No. There will not have to be any adjustment in the size of the periodic payments at the time of actual retirement. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number><em>Question 3. </em>If the upper age limit is raised, some employees who choose to work beyond age 65 will be participants in plans which provide for the commencement of retirement benefits at age 65. Could such plans be amended to provide that retirement benefits would commence at the actual date of retirement without violating the ADEA or ERISA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-12\">Answer. [NJeither ... the ADEA nor ERISA required the payment of retirement benefits to employees who continue to work beyond normal retirement age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-16\"><em>Question 4. </em>Would an increase in the upper age limit of the ADEA increase the funding costs for private pension plans?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANr\">Answer. An increase in the upper age limit of the ADEA would not increase the funding costs for private pension plans. As a matter of fact, financial pressure on private pension plans could be alleviated.... As an actuarial matter, the longer an employee works, the shorter the period retirement payments will have to be made, thus lowering the funding assumptions of the plan. Savings would of course come from the added years of accumulated interest on the fund. Savings would also stem from the fact that, as indicated above, a plan need not provide for further accrual of benefits after the participant has reached the plan s normal retirement age, and thus the added years of service do not increase the ultimate retirement benefit or the cost of providing it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjvV\">' ' \u2019' <em>Question 5. </em>Assuming that under ER-ISA a plan need not provide for benefit accrua s for an employee who continues to work after the normal retirement age, would an employers failure to provide for the accrual of benefits for such an employee constitute age discrimination under the ADEA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaB\">Answer. In our opinion, a bona fide pension plan that provides that no benefits accrue to a participant who continues service with the employer after attainment of normal retirement age would not violate the ADEA. Under Section 4(f)(2) of the ADEA, it is not unlawful to observe the terms of a bona fide pension plan that is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of the ADEA. As I noted in my testimony, the legislative history of the ADEA indicates that Section 4(f)(2) was intended to allow age to be considered in funding a plan and in determining the level of benefits to be paid. We believe that it will run counter to the intent of the Act to require a plan to provide for benef\u00edt accrual after the plan&lt;g normai retirement age</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay2\">Id. at 14-16, U.S-Code Cong. &amp; Admin News 1978&gt; pp. 517-519' The Senate Pass\u00aed lts verslon of the ADEA amendments without alterin? the Ration reported by the \u2122mmittee ln any relevant respect,</p>\n<p id=\"AEY\">The legislative history in the House is much the same.

On March 21, 1978, the day the House passed the amendments, two of the House <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>managers, fresh from the Conference Committee, had. the following exchange on the floor of the House:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\">MR. DENT. Mr. Speaker, in order that there be no question about the committee handling of pension legislation, I have arranged with the gentleman from California to make the record very clear. I would like to put this question to the gentleman:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">Is it the intention of the conferees that an employer will be permitted, under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 as amended, to maintain a defined contribution plan \u2014 other than a plan which is merely supplemental to a defined benefit or defined contribution plan maintained by the employer \u2014 which precludes employer and, if applicable, employee contributions to such a plan subsequent to an employee\u2019s attainment of the normal retirement age contained in the plan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">MR. HAWKINS. Yes. The answer to the gentleman\u2019s question is \u201cYes\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">The conferees intend that an employer will not violate the Age Discrimination in Employment Act by maintaining such a defined contribution plan. This position is in keeping with the general view of the House and the Department of Labor with regard to prohibited age discrimination in the context of pension plans covering employees who continue employment beyond the normal retirement age, as expressed in a letter of September 8, 1977, from Assistant Secretary Elisburg to me which appears in the Congressional Record of September 23, 1977, at page 30564.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">124 Cong.Rec. 7881-82 (1978). The two principal managers in the Senate had a similar exchange on the Senate floor on March 23, 1978, the day the Senate passed the amendments.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">[MR. JAVITS.] Mr. President, if I may have the attention of the chairman of our committee and manager of the conference report on the floor, I wish to clarify a number of issues involving employee benefit plans and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as modified by the 1978 amendments. I want to ask our distinguished committee chairman whether he agrees that an employer will be permitted under the act, as amended, to maintain a defined contribution plan \u2014 other than a plan which is merely supplemental to a defined benefit or defined contribution plan maintained by the employer \u2014 which precludes employer and, if applicable, employee contributions to such a plan subsequent to an employee\u2019s attainment of the plan\u2019s normal retirement age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMu\">MR. WILLIAMS. The answer is \u201cyes.\u201d I completely agree with the statement of the distinguished Senator from New York. Your statements are consistent with the position taken by the Department of Labor regarding these matters. As Assistant Secretary Elisburg\u2019s letter, which appears in the Senate committee report makes clear, employers will not be required to continue contributions to either defined benefit or defined contribution plans for employees who continue working beyond normal retirement age.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"auo-dedup-1\">124 Cong.Rec. 8218 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">Because the issues going to the merits have not been joined in this litigation, we cannot and do not decide whether the Interpretative Bulletin is consistent with the ADEA. Hence, we do not undertake any further analysis of the legislative history or of its significance for the particular provisions of the Interpretative Bulletin under challenge. With legislative history so directly addressed to the challenged aspects of the Bell and Rockwell plans, however, we find inescapable the conclusion that it is highly likely that appellants\u2019 employers would continue to maintain their challenged plans even in the absence of the administrative support provided by the Interpretative Bulletin, relying directly on the statutory support for their practice of freezing the pension costs for an employee when the employee reaches age 65. Appellants, we must conclude, have not shown that their injury \u2014 their employers\u2019 future maintenance of the allegedly unlawful pension plans \u2014 can fairly be traced to the EEOC\u2019s Interpretative Bulletin.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">Our analysis of the \u201cfairly traceable\u201d component of constitutional standing in this ease is evidently somewhat unusual, as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>involves a reasonably extensive inquiry into the underlying merits of the lawsuit. Ordinarily, determining standing does not require this sort of exploration of the merits. <em>See, e.g., Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. at 500, 95 S.Ct. at 2206; <em>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 153, 90 S.Ct. 827, 829-30, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970). Nevertheless, some inquiry into the merits is necessary in a variety of situations presenting justiciability questions \u2014 those involving, for example, the \u201czone of interests\u201d test for standing, <em>id., </em>or the question of ripeness, <em>United Public Workers v. Mitchell, </em>330 U.S. 75, 67 S.Ct. 556, 91 L.Ed. 754 (1947), or the political question doctrine, <em>Baker v. Carr, </em>369 U.S. 186, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962), or even the injury-in-fact component of standing where the injury claimed is one that qualifies for constitutional purposes only because a law has protected it, <em>Warth </em>v. <em>Seldin, </em>422 U.S. at 500, 95 S.Ct. at 2206. In any event, examination of the merits seems to us unavoidable where an interpretative regulation is challenged as authorizing a party not before the court to inflict injury on the plaintiff. Whether the third party\u2019s actions are fairly traceable to the existence of the interpretative rule \u2014 which of course has no legal force on its own, <em>see General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, </em>429 U.S. 125, 141-45, 97 S.Ct. 401, 410-12, 50 L.Ed.2d 343 (1976) \u2014depends on, among other things, what support for those actions the third party can find directly in the statute that the rule interprets. Some statutory construction is therefore necessary in determining whether the plaintiff has satisfied the \u201cfairly traceable\u201d requirement for standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The \u201credressability\u201d requirement for standing presents an even thornier problem in a case such as this; that is why we rest our decision on the \u201cfairly traceable\u201d ground. As indicated above, addressing the \u201credressability\u201d requirement in this case would necessitate asking how Bell and Rockwell would be likely to respond to a judicial declaration that the Interpretative Bulletin is invalid. The statutory support they could find for the legality of their pension plans suggests that they would continue to maintain their plans. On the other hand, a judicial pronouncement that the plans violate the ADEA, even if issued in the face of contrary legislative history, would have to give appellants\u2019 employers some pause in deciding not to conform their conduct to the court\u2019s opinion. In making such a decision, they would have to consider not only the fact that the court\u2019s judgment is not binding on nonparties but also the <em>stare decisis </em>and precedential effect of the case. Since both employers here are located in other circuits, the persuasiveness of the court\u2019s reasoning would have to become a crucial consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">To determine whether appellants\u2019 injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision in this case, we would seem to be compelled to speculate on what Bell and Rockwell would decide after considering these factors. We would not welcome such a task, and indeed the speculative character of the determinations involved may demand the rejection of appellants\u2019 standing. We need not reach this issue, however, for we hold that appellants have not alleged facts sufficient to show that their injury is fairly traceable to appellee\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">The judgment of the district court is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-5\">. It is not entirely clear from the record whether the Bell and Rockwell plans are defined contribution or defined benefit plans, though it appears from appellants\u2019 allegations of illegality that the two plans are of the latter type. Further, the allegations of the complaint make clear that appellant Hidalgo is unaffected by subsection (7) of the challenged Interpretative Bulletin. See <em>infra </em>note 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b274-6\">. Subsection (1) provides in full as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">A defined contribution plan may provide for the cessation of employer contributions after the normal retirement age of any participant in the plan. A defined contribution plan may also provide that no employer contributions shall be made on behalf of an employee who is hired after normal retirement age. However, these provisions apply only with respect to plans which are not \u201csupplemental\u201d. Any defined contribution plan is deemed \u201csupplemental\u201d with respect to any employee who is a participant in it as well as in a defined benefit plan maintained by the employer. Where an employer has no defined benefit plan but two or more defined contribution plans, all but one of the defined contribution plans are \u201csupplemental\u201d with respect to those employees who are participants in them. The one defined contribution plan which is not \u201csupplemental\u201d could provide for the cessation of employer contributions after normal retirement age. The employer can designate which one of the defined contribution plans is not \u201csupplemental\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 860.120(f)(iv)(B)(l).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b274-11\">.
