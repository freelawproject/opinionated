Each party seeks to enjoin the other\u2019s use of the trademark \u201cKitty Clover\u201d on potato chips in the Kansas City trade area. The Kansas City trade area comprises the Kansas City area in the state of Kansas, most of the state of Missouri, and Arkansas. It is undisputed that Culbro Snack Poods, Inc. (Culbro) has undisputed rights to \u201cKitty Clover\u201d in the remainder of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">The district court, the Honorable Harold D. Vietor presiding, granted Culbro\u2019s motion for preliminary injunctive relief. Hi-land appealed and this court upheld the lower court\u2019s determination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The case was remanded for findings on Culbro\u2019s claim that Hiland had abandoned the mark. Upon remand the court entered judgment dismissing Hiland\u2019s complaint and found in favor of Culbro on its counterclaim. <em>Hiland Potato Chip Co. v. Culbro Snack Foods, Inc., </em>No. 81-198-D (S.D.Iowa Dec. 14, 1982). Hiland now appeals from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-6\">The facts found by the district court are as follows: The mark \u201cKitty Clover\u201d was registered in 1938 by Culbro\u2019s remote predecessor, Kitty Clover Potato Chip Company of Omaha, Nebraska, which mark is valid and subsisting and owned by Culbro. In 1956 the Omaha company agreed with its plant in Kansas City (operated since the 1950\u2019s by family relatives) whereby the Kansas City plant was allowed to make, use and sell Kitty Clover potato chips in the limited area served by the Kansas City plant, referred to as the Kansas City trade area. In 1959, the original Kitty Clover Omaha company was sold to Fairmont Foods Company which in turn sold to Culb-ro in 1978 (such sale included the \u201cKitty Clover\u201d trademark).</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-7\">In the 1970\u2019s the Kansas City Kitty Clover Company changed its name to Clary House, which operated until its bankruptcy in September, 1980. Hiland\u2019s immediate predecessor, Cardinal Distributing Company (Cardinal), owned by Harold Balagna, bought Clary House\u2019s route trucks, customer lists and tradenames, including \u201cKitty Clover,\u201d in the bankruptcy proceedings. A few weeks later, on November 7, 1980, Cardinal agreed with Hiland to distribute Hi-land\u2019s potato chips to its customers. The agreement gave Cardinal the right to sell $50,000 worth of Kitty Clover products a year. However, Cardinal never exercised that right, although Cardinal did redistribute some returned Kitty Clover stock previously distributed by Clary House.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-10\">On November 10,1980, the sales manager of Cardinal, Mr. Kiefer, mailed a communication to Clary House customers which in part states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-11\">As you know, Clary House has been going through several crises which have resulted in numerous problems. Effective November 7, 1980, we became associated with Hiland Potato Chips, Inc. (Our New Company Name is Cardinal Distributing.) These changes will result in a much improved program, with a complete merchandized line of product as outlined in the enclosed price list.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-12\">Because of the apparent lack of interest on the part of the large eastern corporation owning the Kitty Clover Brand Name, the new local business decided to become associated with, and to sell, Hi-land Brand Potato Chips and Snacks. The Kitty Clover, Cardinal, and Clary House Brand names will be eliminated from Missouri and Arkansas. This decision to introduce a new brand to most of you will make us part of one of the largest regional Brands in the United States. (All items will be under the Hi-land Label.) Hiland Route Distribution will include the following states: South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. \u2014 North and South through the Middle States of our country.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1078-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 5 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-14\">The enclosed price list included only \u201cHi-land\u201d brand products.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>Mr. Balagna, the president of Cardinal, did not specifically authorize Kiefer to write the November 10 communication, but he saw the communication and did nothing to communicate a retraction of any statements in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">Immediately after the distribution of the November 10 Kiefer communication, Culbro learned of the communication and began distributing its Kitty Clover brand potato chips in the Kansas City trade area. On November 19, 1980, Cardinal sent a notice of infringement to Culbro demanding that Culbro discontinue its use of \u201cKitty Clover\u201d in the Kansas City trade area, but did not advise Culbro that Cardinal was using or intended to use \u201cKitty Clover.\u201d The infringement claim was continuously asserted by Balagna on behalf of Cardinal and by Hiland, Cardinal\u2019s successor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-6\">While distributing for Hiland, Cardinal made no distribution of potato chips under the \u201cKitty Clover\u201d mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-7\">On February 28, 1981, Cardinal conveyed to Hiland its distribution routes, trucks, trademark rights and other assets and good will. Subsequently, Hiland began to distribute in the Kansas City trade area some of its potato chips under the \u201cKitty Clover\u201d mark and continued to do so until the preliminary injunction was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-8\">On appeal Hiland urges that a trademark which has not been used for a period of time does not become legally abandoned unless the trademark owner intends the abandonment to occur, and in this case Cardinal did not so intend. Culbro on the other hand contends that to defeat a claim of abandonment based upon nonuse, intent to resume use is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-9\">The trial court resolved this issue in favor of Culbro, and found an abandonment of the mark by Hiland. The court predicated its conclusion upon 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127, quoting it in part as follows: \u201cA mark shall be deemed to be \u2018abandoned\u2019 \u2014 (a) When its use has been discontinued with intent not to resume. Intent not to resume may be inferred from circumstances.\u201d The court concluded that \u201cA public announcement of intention to discontinue the sale of a product may be a circumstance from which an intent not to resume may be inferred,\u201d citing <em>Sutton Cosmetics (P.R.) Inc. v. Lander Co., </em>170 U.S.P.Q. 461, 462 (S.D.N.Y.1971), <em>aff\u2019d as modified, </em>455 F.2d 285 (2nd Cir.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-11\">In analyzing \u201cintent\u201d the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-12\">Objective evidence of abandonment outweighs a party\u2019s testimony that there was no intent to abandon a mark. \u201cIf all a party had to do to avoid a holding of abandonment was to testify that he never had any intent to abandon the mark, then no mark would ever be held abandoned.\u201d McCarthy, <em>Trademarks and Unfair Competition, </em>Vol 1, \u00a7 17:3C (1973).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-13\">\u201cA party\u2019s testimony that he had no intent to abandon may be outweighed by his actions, which may speak louder than his words: \u2018[T]he purely subjective intention in the abandoner\u2019s mind to re-engage in a former enterprise at some indefinite future time is not sufficient to avoid abandonment where an objective analysis of the situation furnishes ample evidence to warrant the inference of abandonment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-14\">The November 10 communication from Kiefer was not equivocal. It stated that the Kitty Clover brand name \u201cwill be eliminated\u201d and it further stated: \u201cAll items will be under the Hiland label.\u201d All items in the enclosed price list were Hiland brand products. It is hard to imagine how a public declaration of discontinuance of a trademark could be more clear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1079-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-16\">As to Hiland\u2019s contention that the Kiefer communication was unauthorized, the court found and concluded that Balagna ratified it under the law of agency because he did nothing to retract after learning of its existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-17\">The court concluded its discussion of the abandonment issue, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-18\">The court finds as an ultimate fact that Cardinal, acting through Mr. Balagna and Mr. Kiefer, beginning the Friday before November 10, 1980, and continuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>through the date shortly thereafter that Culbro began distributing Kitty Clover chips in the Kansas City trade area, discontinued use of the Kitty Clover mark in the Kansas City trade area with an intent not to resume its use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">In <em>Exxon Corp. v. Humble Exploration Co., Inc., </em>695 F.2d 96, 102-03 (5th Cir. 1983) it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-6\">There is a difference between intent not to abandon or relinquish and intent to resume use in that an owner may not wish to abandon its mark but may have no intent to resume its use.... An \u201cintent to resume\u201d requires the trademark owner to have plans to resume commercial use of the mark. Stopping at an \u201cintent not to abandon\u201d tolerates an owner\u2019s protecting a^mark with neither commercial use nor plans to resume commercial us\u00e9. Such a license is not permitted by the Lanham Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-7\">We endorse that statement and find its application controlling here. The trial court found that in its November 19, 1980, infringement notice to Culbro, Cardinal did not advise Culbro that Cardinal was using or intended to use \u201cKitty Clover.\u201d It further found that while Cardinal functioned as a distributor for Hiland for nearly a four month period, Cardinal did not distribute any \u201cpotato chips under the Kitty Clover mark, except that it did retrieve some Kitty Clover chips previously distributed by Clary House from customers who no longer wanted them and resold those chips to other customers.\u201d After Hiland purchased Cardinal\u2019s assets on February 28, 1981, it began distribution of some of its potato chips under the \u201cKitty Clover\u201d mark in the disputed trade area. However, that does not lend support to Hiland\u2019s position. It is the activity of Cardinal prior to its sale to Hiland which is determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-8\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s determination of this issue and find no evidence that Cardinal intended to resume commercial use of the mark. Thus, there exists no evidence to negate its abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-9\">The remaining issue for disposition is whether or not Hiland is equitably es-topped from denying an intent not to resume use of the \u201cKitty Clover\u201d trademark. The district court set forth the elements of estoppel as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-10\">(1) lack of knowledge and of the means of knowledge of the truth as to the facts in question; (2) reliance, in good faith, upon the misleading conduct or false representations of the party to be estopped; and (3) change in position based thereon to his injury, detriment or prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 10, <em>quoting United States v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>480 F.2d 1095, 1099 (8th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-12\">Hiland does not dispute these elements, but argues they have not been established by Culbro. The trial court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-13\">Culbro has established the essential elements of estoppel to preclude Hiland from asserting that Cardinal did intend to resume use of the Kitty Clover trademark. Culbro has proved that it had no knowledge or means of knowing that Cardinal intended the opposite of the declarations in the Kiefer communication, that it relied in good faith on those declarations, and that it changed its position in reliance on those declarations to its detriment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-14\">Cardinal\u2019s protestations of infringement came after Culbro changed its position in reliance on the November 10 communication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-16\">We agree with this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-17\">We have carefully examined the briefs of the parties and the record in this case and conclude that the judgment entered herein is based on findings of fact that are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-18\">Affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir.R. 14.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1078-8\">. <em>Hiland Potato Chip Co. v.
