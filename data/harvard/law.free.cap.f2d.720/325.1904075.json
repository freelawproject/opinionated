This subsection provides for discipline to be ordered for an inmate only by a three-person hearing board. Jackson charges that a disciplinary measure, seven days in an isolation cell, was imposed on him by a one-person hearing board. As a result of this alleged deprivation of constitutional rights, Jackson seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, $40 per day damages for his week in solitary confinement, punitive damages and an attorney\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-25\">This case was first heard before a United States Magistrate who recommended that the district court conclude that no cause of action was stated by the complaint. <em>Jackson v. Sullivan, </em>No. 83-46 (D.Del., Feb. 9, 1983). This recommendation was put in effect by a final order of the district court on February 28, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-26\">Neither the magistrate nor the district court had the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Hewitt </em>v. Helms, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 864, 74 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983) nor this Court\u2019s rulings in <em>Drayton v. Robinson, </em>719 F.2d 1214 (3d Cir.1983) and <em>Strathie </em>v. <em>Department of Transportation, </em>716 F.2d 227 (3d Cir.1983), including footnote 2. Since these opinions bear directly on Jackson\u2019s claim, this case will be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>manded to the district court for reevaluation of the constitutional issues raised by the complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-15\">. Because of the complexity of the liberty and due process claims raised by the complaint, the district court on remand may wish to appoint counsel to represent Jackson.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
