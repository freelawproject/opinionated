Civil service employees are members of either the \u201ccompetitive service\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or the \u201cex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>cepted service.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An employee typically becomes a member of the \u201ccompetitive service\u201d by taking an examination administered by the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d). <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3304 (1976 &amp; Supp. V 1981). An applicant who meets the minimum requirements for entrance to an examination, and who receives a rating of 70 or more on the examination, is known as an \u201celigible.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 210.102(b)(5), 337.101(a) (1983). OPM is required to enter on a civil service \u201cregister\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the names of all eligibles in accordance with their numerical rankings. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 332.401 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">An agency seeking to hire an employee must submit a request to OPM for a \u201ccertificate\u201d of eligibles.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When OPM receives a request for certification of eligibles, it prepares a certificate by selecting names from the head of the appropriate register. This certificate consists of a sufficient number of names to permit the agency to consider three eligibles for each vacancy, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 332.402 (1983), the so-called \u201crule-of-three.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A hiring official from the agency, known as the \u201cappointing officer,\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.102(b)(1) (1983), is obliged to fill each vacancy \u201cwith sole regard to merit and fitness\u201d from the three eligibles ranking highest on the certificate who are available for appointment. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 332.404 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-18\">With a few exceptions not here relevant, eligibles appointed from a register become \u201ccareer-conditional\u201d employees. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.301(a) (1983). These career-conditional employees may become \u201ccareer\u201d employees upon the completion of a three-year period of \u201ccreditable service.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.201(a)(b) (1983).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Those employees who successfully complete the first year of the three-year service period generally have greater procedural rights than those who do not. For example, prior to the completion of the first year of a career-conditional employee\u2019s service period \u2014 the \u201cprobationary period\u201d \u2014 the employee may be dismissed \u201cif he fails to demonstrate fully his qualifications for continued employment.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.803 (1983). During this period such an employee is accorded limited procedural rights,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and may seek review of a dismissal only on the grounds that the dismissal was discriminatory or effected by improper procedures.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Career employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>(and career-conditional employees in their second or third years of service), in contrast, enjoy the much greater procedural protections of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See generally Sampson v. Murray, </em>415 U.S. 61, 80-82, 94 S.Ct. 937, 948-949, 39 L.Ed.2d 166 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Members of the \u201cexcepted service\u201d are subject to less rigorous entrance requirements, and are accorded fewer procedural protections, than are members of the competitive service. Among the members of the excepted service are employees appointed for a definite term of employment, or \u201cterm employees.\u201d These employees do not acquire competitive status by virtue of their term appointment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Term employees may be appointed for terms of one to four years \u201cwhen the needs of the service so require.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 316.301 (1983). Unlike members of the competitive service, who must generally submit to competitive examinations, term employees may bypass the rigors of the competitive process if OPM so authorizes. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 316.302(b) (1983).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Term employees, on the other hand, are accorded none of the procedural protections of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and only limited procedural rights by regulation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">In general, there are no provisions for the conversion of term employees to career-conditional employees.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A term employee who wishes to acquire competitive status must therefore make use of the ordinary procedures for entering the competitive service. Those procedures include taking a competitive examination, obtaining a position on a civil service register, being certified as one of the three highest rated applicants for each vacancy, and being selected by an appointing officer with sole regard to merit and fitness.\u201d <em>See </em>p. 281 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">Both term and competitive employees may be released from employment when a shortage of funds, reorganization, or reclassification so requires.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The procedures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>governing these releases are captioned \u201cReduction in Force,\u201d <em>see </em>5 C.F.R. Part 351 (1983), and employees released pursuant to these procedures are said to be \u201cRIF\u2019d.\u201d An employee who is properly \u201cRIF\u2019d\u201d does not enjoy a number of the procedural protections of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7512(B) (1976); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 752.-401(c) (1983); <em>Rasmussen v. United States, </em>543 F.2d 134, 137, 211 Ct.Cl. 260 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">With this understanding of the governing Civil Service regulations, we turn to the facts giving rise to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Nathan Smith was hired in August of 1971 as a term employee of the United States Marshals Service (the \u201cService\u201d), an arm of the Department of Justice. The Marshals Service administered an \u201cAnti-Air Piracy Program\u201d in the early 1970s for the purpose of combatting a rising number of aircraft hijackings. Marshals for the Air Piracy Program were hired, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 316.302(b) (1983), as term deputies without regard for Civil Service Commission registers. <em>See </em>note 11 <em>supra. </em>Smith, who was not at that time on a Civil Service register, was hired for a term ending June 30, 1982 \u201csubject to a character investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">The record indicates that at the time Smith was hired, agents of the Marshals Service represented that the Service intended to \u201cconvert\u201d term deputies hired for the Air Piracy Program to career positions. According to Gerald LaRosa, deputy marshal with responsibility for the Philadelphia airport, both the Philadelphia marshals and responsible officials in Washington \u201cwere under the understanding that [term deputies] were all going to be assumed into the Marshals] Service.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Agency made these representations for the purpose of attracting more highly qualified candidates than would otherwise have applied for term positions. John Doyle, at the time one of four \u201cspecialists\u201d in the United States for the Marshals Service, explained the Marshals\u2019 dilemma as follows;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-24\">We were having trouble getting good employees because it was a temporary position to work in this program.... And the people that we wanted to hire in a lot of eases they didn\u2019t want to stay because ... it was only a temporary thing[.] [S]o they told them in Washington, they told the Marshals] to tell them that they would be converted to a permanent basis. I know because ... they would constantly call me on the phone in Washington and ask me when they were going to be converted because we were promising they were going to be converted.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvU\">Accordingly, Nicholas Vinci, Chief Deputy Marshal in Philadelphia, explained to each term deputy, including Smith, that the Service intended to confer permanent status on term deputies provided that they completed the requisite one-year period of probation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-25\">In fact, however, the applicable Civil Service regulations did not permit the Service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>to \u201cconvert\u201d term deputies to permanent positions. <em>See </em>pp. 282-283 &amp; note 14 <em>supra. </em>The regulations required, and members of the Marshals Service understood, that any term deputy seeking a permanent position had to make use of the ordinary procedures for entering the competitive service. Consequently, on June 16, 1972, Bert Lederer, then Personnel Officer for the Marshals Service, directed all hiring officials to employ the regular Civil Service Registers in order to \u201cconvert\u201d term deputies. Lederer\u2019s communique provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVV\">BEGIN [THE] PROCESS OF CONVERTING TERM DEPUTIES TO CAREER CONDITIONAL APPOINTMENTS THROUGH CIVIL SERVICE REGISTERS. SUGGEST YOU MEET WITH LOCAL AREA OFFICE OF [THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION] AND ENLIST ADVICE AND GUIDANCE.... EXPLAIN THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO CONVERT YOUR TERM DEPUTIES.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The Service had, however, overlooked an important obstacle to its plan to \u201cconvert\u201d term deputies that impeded its ability to convert Smith. A number of its term deputies, including Smith, were not on Civil Service Registers at the time of Lederer\u2019s announcement. Moreover, the appropriate Philadelphia register had closed on March 9, 1971, rendering it impossible for term deputies who had applied for employment after March 9 to obtain a position on a register. The Civil Service Commission did not correct this defect until September 20, 1972, when the Commission amended its examination announcement and accepted applications for the Philadelphia register until October 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Between August of 1971, when Smith was hired, and September of 1972, when the Commission reopened the Philadelphia register, the Service obtained a character report on Smith compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This FBI report revealed that Smith had received four reprimands by the Philadelphia Police Force, where he had served with some distinction for 27 years. According to the FBI, Smith \u201creceived \u2018Outstanding\u2019 performance rating and numerous commendations from within and outside the [Philadelphia Police Department] from 1955 to 1968.\u201d Tr. at 757. The report also indicated, however, that Smith had been charged with \u201cConduct Unbecoming an Officer\u201d in 1969 arising from an indictment for the sale of a stolen automobile, that Smith had \u201cresigned under these charges,\u201d and that he had been found not guilty of all charges on June 26, 1970.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">On January 5,1972, James Berryhill, then Acting Personnel Chief for the Marshals Service, drafted a letter proposing Smith\u2019s removal. Berryhill\u2019s letter recited that Smith had received four reprimands while serving on the Philadelphia Police Force, had been charged with \u201cConduct Unbecoming an Officer,\u201d and had \u201cresigned while these charges were still pending.\u201d Berry-hill directed that Smith\u2019s immediate superi- or, Marshal Charles Guy, sign this letter and present it to Smith. Although the record reveals that Marshal Guy staunchly supported Smith\u2019s competence as a marshal \u2014 and indeed that Guy drafted a letter to Wayne Colburn, Director of the Marshals Service, protesting Berryhill\u2019s instruction and asserting that Smith, \u201csince being in my employ, has done an outstanding job and I am not convinced otherwise,\u201d Tr. at 786 \u2014 Guy dutifully signed Berryhill\u2019s letter and passed it on to Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Smith responded in writing to Berryhill\u2019s proposed removal on January 19, 1972, in accordance with the procedural provisions governing the dismissal of term employees during the \u201ctrial period.\u201d <em>See </em>notes 7 and 13 <em>supra. </em>Because of the importance of the FBI report to this appeal, we review Smith\u2019s response to it in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The first two reprimands identified by the FBI, Smith stated, were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akk\">due to my failure to notify a Detective assigned to my division that he was to appear in Court. This notification of the court appearance was sent over the teletype machine and an oversight of this sort is automatically placed against the detective in charge at the time the notice comes through the teletype machine. There is no right of defense on the part of the person receiving the reprimand, since it is not considered detrimental to his standing in her personnel file. This reprimand took place December 17, 1962, over 9 years ago, and it is impossible for me to recollect the reason for the oversight; however, even though the reprimand is placed against the detective in charge of that particular shift, it is the duty of each individual to check the teletype himself for notice of court appearances. The particular Detective Division to which I was assigned at that time was constantly kept busy with assignments, causing oversights of this nature by many detectives.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Tr. at 778-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">The third reprimand identified concerned the failure to note in a logbook that an automobile had been reported on fire in a parking lot, and that a human leg had been found in the city incinerator. Smith had not been notified of this reprimand \u2014 apparently in contravention of police regulations \u2014 and had been given no opportunity to explain the oversight.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">The fourth reprimand identified by the FBI concerned the failure to \u201creceipt\u201d a vehicle properly. Smith explained that he had signed a receipt for the vehicle, which was then parked for five days in front of the Police station, Smith then took \u201ctwo regular days off and when I went back on duty on the 8:00 A.M. to 4:00 P.M. tour the car was gone.\u201d Smith had \u201cno knowledge of what happened to the car or when it was removed from its position.\u201d Tr. at 779.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">Finally, responding to the charge of conduct unbecoming an officer, Smith asserted that \u201cthere has never been a charge of conduct unbecoming an officer in my personnel file, nor have I ever been confronted with such a charge.\u201d Smith acknowledged that such a charge could only have arisen from an indictment for the sale of a stolen automobile, and that Smith had been acquitted of this charge. Smith further stated that \u201csince I was found not guilty of all charges, my court record was expunged, [and] no departmental charges were placed against me.... \u201d Tr. at 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">In addition to these responses, Smith indicated that while on the Philadelphia Police Force, he had received three departmental awards and 21 \u201cOfficial Commendations.\u201d During Smith\u2019s service as a term deputy, Smith had also received a \u201ccommendation for outstanding performance of duty\u201d for averting a possible hijacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">In summary, the four \u201creprimands\u201d in Smith\u2019s record were for omissions in the nature of administrative errors. The record reveals no charge of \u201cconduct unbecoming an officer.\u201d Smith was therefore a man who, during 27 years of service on the Philadelphia Police Force and in the Marshals Service, was honored 25 times with awards of commendations, committed four administrative oversights, and was acquitted of criminal charges lodged against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">On February 1, 1972, Bert Lederer, who succeeded James Berryhill as Chief of Personnel, notified Smith that the Service intended to remove Smith from his position as deputy marshal effective February 4, 1972. Lederer \u201cfound\u201d that Smith was in fact charged with conduct unbecoming an officer, despite Smith\u2019s assertion that no such charge appeared in his record. No explanation for this \u201cfinding\u201d exists in the record, nor does the record disclose any documentation of the charge\u2019s existence. Citing this finding and the four reprimands recited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>above, Lederer removed Smith \u201cfor the good of the Service.\u201d Lederer\u2019s February 1 memorandum made no effort to relate the four administrative errors committed during Smith\u2019s 27 year tenure on the Philadelphia Police Force to Smith\u2019s ability to inspect airline passengers for the Marshals Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">On February 9, 1972, without any explanation, Lederer reversed his position and cancelled Smith\u2019s termination. Lederer\u2019s terse two-sentence memorandum stated only that Smith would not be terminated and that Lederer\u2019s letter of February 1 \u201cis hereby cancelled.\u201d Although Lederer\u2019s memorandum of February 9 gave no reason for his sudden change of position, Lederer later testified that his decision had \u201cin essence\u201d been overruled by the Director of the Marshals Service, Wayne Colburn. Tr. at 235, 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Smith completed his probationary period with the Marshals Service without incident. On June 29, 1972, the Marshals Service requested from the Civil Service Commission a certificate of eligibles for appointment to career-conditional positions as deputy marshals. The Commission certified four names for consideration: Paul Hondros, Allen Cox, James Duross, and Anthony Pas-quarella. All four applicants had obtained positions on Civil Service Registers by June of 1972. Nathan Smith, who was not at this time on a register \u2014 and who could not have been on a register, since the Commission had not reopened the Philadelphia register until September, <em>see </em>pp. 28A-285 <em>supra </em>\u2014was not certified for consideration. Instead, the Service extended Smith\u2019s term appointment until June 30, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">Thereafter, a series of events ensued that bordered on the comic. Smith obtained a position on the Philadelphia register on September 27,1972. According to Donald Merrill, area manager of the Civil Service Commission, if the Marshals Service had requested a certificate on September 27 identical in nature to that requested on June 29, then Smith would have been ranked either first or second on the certificate.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Moreover, Nicholas Vinci, Chief Deputy Marshal in Philadelphia, testified that if Smith\u2019s name had been on a certificate, then Vinci would have appointed Smith to a career-conditional position.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">Nevertheless, for reasons that are somewhat unusual, Vinci did not request a certificate' from the Commission until December 13,1972. Vinci\u2019s delay was attributable to a special procedure adopted by the Service for the Air Piracy Program.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> On December 11, however, President Nixon imposed a hiring and promotion freeze on all federal agencies \u201cto remain in effect until the new federal budget is submitted to Congress some time in January [of 1973].\u201d Tr. at 389. The Commission promptly returned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Vinci\u2019s December 11 request for a certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">For reasons that are wholly unexplained, the Commission did not keep a copy of Vinci\u2019s December 11 request on file until January. Instead, the Commission apparently regarded it as essential that Vinci file the same request a second time after the termination of the President\u2019s hiring freeze. For even more irregular reasons, however, Vinci never filed a second request.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Vinci\u2019s decision not to request a second certificate was attributable to James Berry-hill, curiously the same official who sought unsuccessfully to dismiss Smith on the basis of the FBI\u2019s report on Smith\u2019s character. According to Vinci, on January 15, 1973, Bert Lederer distributed a memorandum informing Vinci and other hiring officials that term deputies who had not been \u201capproved for conversion, pending certification from the appropriate [Civil Service] register,\u201d should take a new, nationally administered examination, \u201cif they are not within reach of the [Deputy Marshal] register.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> On its face, Lederer\u2019s January 15 memorandum appears not to have applied to Smith: Smith, of course, had been approved for conversion pending his certification from the Deputy Marshal register, and was within reach on the register. Nevertheless, in January James Berryhill informed Vinci personally that Vinci was \u201cnot to bother with the registers\u2019 formerly used for the appointment of career deputies because the Service planned to use a new national examination. Tr. at 394-95. In addition, Vinci testified that Berryhill said \u201che would get back to me about the [January 15 memorandum].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Berryhill never \u201cgot back to\u201d Vinci. As a consequence, Vinci never requested a certificate of eligibles, and Smith was never appointed to a career-conditional position.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">These irregularities reached their climax during the summer of 1973. The Commission postponed the announcement of its new national examination, slated to be announced in April of 1973, until August. In June of 1973, however, the United States reversed its two-year practice of staffing the Air Piracy Program with deputy marshals, preferring instead to staff these positions with private employees. Consequently, the Service \u201cRIF\u2019d\u201d all term deputies appointed to the Program. The Service did not, however, \u201cRIF\u201d its career-conditional employees; these permanent employees had been assumed into the Marshals Service as a whole. Smith received a notice of separation under RIF procedures in June of 1973,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> to be effective on July 27,1973 \u2014 one month before the Service announced the examination Smith was to take to enter a program that had since been terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-13\">Between June and November of 1973, the Commission responded to a flurry of inquiries on Smith\u2019s behalf. At no time in any of these letters did the Service attribute its failure to \u201cconvert\u201d Smith to the series of accidents, mistakes, and irregularities enumerated earlier. Indeed, the letter offered no suggestion that Smith was simply an unfortunate victim of circumstances. Rather, the Commission\u2019s letters reveal that Smith was not \u201cconverted\u201d to a permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>position solely because of the information contained in the FBI report on his character. On June 13, for example, the Director of the Marshals Service, Wayne Colburn, responded to an inquiry from former Pennsylvania Senator Hugh Scott. Colburn stated that the three deputies, James Du-ross, Paul Hondros, and Nathan Smith, were not, approved for conversion on the basis of information uncovered during their \u201cbackground investigations.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Colburn later reported the same conclusion to former Pennsylvania Senator Richard Schweiker:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHE\">Mr. Smith\u2019s official personnel folder [prepared by the Marshals Service] contains no derogatory information whatsoever. As I have previously mentioned, [the FBI] conducted a thorough background investigation of Mr. Smith which included confidential reference checks. The background investigation file [prepared by the FBI] is the only file that contains the information on which I have based my final decision not to consider Mr. Smith for full-time permanent employment.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"a0t-dedup-0\">A second letter, dated November 20 from Colburn to Senator Schweiker and identified as Exhibit 38 of the Record, was to the same effect. Colburn noted that a \u201cthorough background investigation of each deputy was conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\u201d and that on the basis of this \u201cbackground investigation,\u201d \u201c[i]t was concluded that it would not be in the best interests of the United States Marshals Service to consider Mr. Smith for permanent appointment.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Smith challenged his separation from the Service with the Philadelphia Regional Office of the Civil Service Commission. On November 23, 1973, the Regional Examiner found that Smith had been properly reached for a reduction in force. Smith took an appeal to the Civil Service Commission Board of Appeals and Review on December 4, 1973, and in January of 1974 sued the Commission and the Marshals Service in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. On April 4, 1974 the Appeals Board found no error in the Marshals Service RIF procedures and dismissed, as not germane to the appeal, whether Smith should have been retained in a permanent position.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">On August 16, 1976, the district court remanded Smith\u2019s case to the Commission. Concluding that the Commission was the appropriate factfinder in these circumstances, the district court declined to conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of the facts giving rise to Smith\u2019s complaint. Accordingly, the court directed the Commission to conduct a hearing for the purposes of examining five issues raised in Smith\u2019s complaint:</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">(1) That his superiors promised him that he would be converted to permanent status and that he relied on this promise to his detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">(2) That the reason stated for his termination from the Marshals Service is a sham. According to Smith, the real reason for his termination is not the reduction-in-force concept but an unfavorable FBI report prepared in 1971. Smith further contends that at the time this FBI report was prepared, the Marshals Service did not pursue or take action against him because of the report, but instead, after he disputed the accuracy of the report, agreed to remove it from his personnel file.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">(3) That he was on a valid register and should have been appointed to the position of Career Deputy United States Marshal purely as a ministerial matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">(4) That the decision not to engage him as a Career Deputy United States Marshal was \u201ccapricious and invidious\u201d without any reasonable basis; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>that no rules for the conversion of the term deputies hired to staff the Anti-Air Piracy Program were adopted; and that decisions on this subject were not made in a uniform manner.</p>\n<p id=\"ahd-dedup-0\">(5) That he should be given an opportunity to dispute any unfavorable matters in the FBI report and that the FBI report contains inaccurate information.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The Commission conducted hearings between November of 1976 and February of 1977, from which the facts recited earlier have been drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">On July 16, 1977, the Philadelphia Field Office of the Civil Service Commission concluded that Smith had been separated in accordance with Commission regulations. After reviewing the history of events leading to Smith\u2019s separation, the Philadelphia Office found that Smith had' never been certified by the Commission and was therefore properly released. Responding to Smith\u2019s contention that the Marshals Service \u201cpurposefully ensured that he was not certified by the Civil Service Commission,\u201d the Field Office concluded that \u201cthe preponderance of the evidence persuades us that officials in the Philadelphia Office of the Marshals Service did not purposefully fail to request a certificate from the Commission after September of 1972 in order to avoid the certification of [Smith].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The \u201cofficials\u201d in the Marshals Service to whom the Philadelphia Office referred were Chief Deputy Nicholas Vinci and Director Wayne Colburn. The Office noted that Vinci supported Smith\u2019s application, and that Colburn had overruled the attempt by Bert Lederer and James Berryhill to dismiss Smith during Smith\u2019s \u201ctrial period\u201d of service. The Office made no finding, however, respecting whether Lederer and Berryhill led Vinci erroneously to believe that a certificate could not be requested between January and September of 1972. Moreover, the Office did not discuss Colburn\u2019s letters, including the letter identified as Exhibit 38, stating expressly that the FBI report was the sole ground on which the Service relied in failing to convert Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">Finally, the Philadelphia Office found that had Smith been certified by the Commission, the FBI report would have provided a \u201ctenuous basis\u201d for denying Smith a permanent appointment. The Office acknowledged that Smith provided \u201ca basis for questioning the accuracy and reliability of some of the information reported in the FBI investigation,\u201d but discounted these errors. \u201c[W]hatever errors may have recently been discovered in the FBI report [were] of no material consequence,\u201d the Office concluded, because the Service relied on the FBI report \u201cin good faith.\u201d Nevertheless, the Philadelphia Office attributed great weight to the Service\u2019s decision to extend Smith\u2019s term appointment for three years. Having extended Smith\u2019s <em>term </em>appointment, the Office concluded, the Service could not maintain that the FBI report made him unsuitable for <em>permanent </em>employment.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">On September 15, 1978, the Civil Service Commission\u2019s Appeals Review Board affirmed the decision of the Philadelphia Office. Smith renewed before the Review Board the argument, pressed before the Philadelphia Office, that the Service deliberately ensured that a certificate of eligi-bles would not be requested in order to avoid appointing Smith to a permanent position. Although there is, the Board found, \u201cevidence of misunderstanding and error in the failure to request certification,\u201d the Board concluded that there is \u201cno evidence of capricious or invidious discrimination against Smith.\u201d Like the Philadelphia Office, the Appeals Board did not discuss the roles of Lederer and Berryhill in seeking Smith\u2019s dismissal. In its only reference to Smith\u2019s challenge to the content of the FBI report, the Board recommended that Smith make use of \u201cthe provisions of the Privacy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Act of 1974\u201d to dispute the report\u2019s unfavorable information.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Smith promptly renewed his challenge to the Appeals Board decision before the district court. In a memorandum filed on October 31, 1979, the district court concluded that section 10(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2), limited judicial scrutiny of Smith\u2019s separation to the arbitrary, capricious, and abuse of discretion standard of review. Unlike the Commission, the district court concluded, based on a \u201ccareful review of the record,\u201d that the \u201creal reason\u201d for Smith\u2019s dismissal was the unfavorable FBI report. Citing Exhibit 38 of the Record, <em>see </em>note 29 <em>supra, </em>the district court found that Director Col-burn \u201cmade it clear that the background information set forth in the FBI report was the main reason for not converting Smith to permanent status.\u201d App. at 74. Moreover, the district court stated the Commission itself found that \u201cany reliance on the FBI report as a basis for denying Smith\u2019s employment would be \u2018tenuous.\u2019 \u201d App. at 77. Consequently, the district court held that the Service\u2019s refusal to \u201cconvert\u201d Smith to permanent status was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The district court then turned to the question of the appropriate remedy. Smith sought back pay in addition to a permanent or term position with the Service. The district court concluded that Smith\u2019s monetary claims were not \u201cseverable\u201d from his claims for a permanent or term position. However, the district court held, jurisdiction over the monetary claim was exclusive in the Court of Claims. Accordingly, the court conditioned any order it may have issued on a withdrawal of Smith\u2019s claim for damages. Smith, however, refused to withdraw his claim for back pay, and on January 14, 1980, the district court \u201creferred\u201d the entire case to the Court of Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The Court of Claims, however, was of a different opinion than the district court over the district court\u2019s power to \u201crefer\u201d Smith\u2019s case to the Court of Claims. <em>See Smith v. United States, </em>654 F.2d 50, 228 Ct.Cl. 168 (1981). The power to transfer cases to the Court of Claims, that court held, derived from the former provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(c). That section authorized the district courts to transfer any case within the Court of Claims\u2019 \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d to the Claims Court. However, the court held, Smith\u2019s case is not one within the Court of Claims\u2019 exclusive jurisdiction. Smith sought reclassification to a new position \u2014 that of a permanent deputy \u2014 in addition to back pay and reinstatement to his former position \u2014 that of a term deputy. Both the Claims Court and the district court, the Claims Court held, are empowered to order reinstatement. Accordingly, the Claims Court held, Smith\u2019s case is not within that court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction, and the district court had no power to transfer Smith\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Recognizing that these inconsistent judgments left Smith in an untenable position, the Claims Court urged Smith to move the district court to reconsider its holding that Smith\u2019s monetary and nonmonetary claims were nonseverable. As an appropriate disposition, the Claims Court noted, the district court might find Smith\u2019s claim for reclassification severable from his claims for reinstatement and back pay, and adjudicate this reclassification claim. <em>See Smith v. United States, supra, </em>654 F.2d at 54. Smith\u2019s claims for reinstatement and back pay could then proceed in the Claims Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">Accordingly, some nine years after these proceedings began, Smith moved the district court, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), to reconsider its holding that his monetary and nonmonetary claims were nonseverable. Enlightened by the Claims Court\u2019s opinion, on March 24, 1982, the district court vacated its prior orders and held that these claims were severable. However, the district court did not agree that Smith\u2019s claim for reinstatement should be referred to the Claims Court. Rather, relying on its power of mandamus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 (1976), the district court ordered Smith reinstated to his term position and appointed to a permanent position. App. at 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">The United States appeals from the district court\u2019s March 24 order. The govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>ment argues that the record does not support the district court\u2019s conclusion that Smith\u2019s separation was arbitrary and capricious, that the district court had no jurisdiction to consider Smith\u2019s claim for reinstatement, and that the court was without authority under the mandamus statute to order Smith\u2019s appointment to a permanent position.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">This case raises questions concerning judicial review, and the scope of that review, of Smith\u2019s separation from the Marshals Service, and the district court\u2019s remedial powers. We turn to these questions in turn.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">A. <em>Scope of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Smith\u2019s claim, and any remedy to which he may be entitled, rests on whether the actions of the Marshals Service in not requesting a certificate of eligibles may, under the circumstances present here, be reviewed under the Administrative Procedure Act. Accordingly, we turn initially to the APA to determine those actions reviewable by the courts and, to the extent that those actions are reviewable, the standard by which they must be tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">\n<em>1. Actions reviewable under the APA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">At times a statute or regulation is drawn \u201cin such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.\u201d <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 410, 91 S.Ct. 814, 820, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971), citing S.Rep. No. 752, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. 26 (1945). In those \u201crare instances,\u201d <em>id., </em>an action may be \u201ccommitted to agency discretion,\u201d and thus not reviewable by a court. In such circumstances, section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2) (1976), exempts the action from judicial review under the provisions of section 10(e) of the Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (1976).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> However, a restriction on access <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>to judicial review may be effected only upon a strong showing that Congress so intended. <em>See </em>p. 295 <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">In this case, Smith complains in part of the Service\u2019s failure to request a certificate of eligibles from the Civil Service Commission. Because the Commission\u2019s regulations apparently do not limit the discretion of the Marshals Service to request a certificate, and because we are aware of no similar regulations of the Marshals Service itself, the question arises as to whether the Marshals Service has unreviewable discretion to request a certificate of eligibles.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">a. <em>Terminology</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">We are faced at the outset with an ambiguity in terminology that has plagued commentators and courts alike.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The phrase \u201caction committed to agency discretion by law\u201d as used in section 701(a)(2) denotes certain agency actions shielded from judicial review altogether. As Professor Davis has explained, the \u201ctwo concepts \u2018committed to agency discretion\u2019 and \u2018unreviewable\u2019 have in this limited context the same meaning.\u201d 4 K. Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 28.16, at 80 (1958). Thus, when the term \u201caction committed to agency discretion by law\u201d is employed in a section 701(a)(2) context, it is taken to mean that such action may not be reviewed by a court. In this case, therefore, if we were to conclude that the Marshals Service, by not requesting a certificate of eligibles, had taken an \u201caction committed to agency discretion by law,\u201d it is apparent that we would be obliged to end our inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">On the other hand, if an action is not one \u201ccommitted to agency discretion by law,\u201d as that phrase is used in section 701(a)(2), then it <em>is </em>reviewable by the courts. Among the applicable standards of our review is that of \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1976). Accordingly, when an agency action is not \u201ccommitted to agency discretion by law,\u201d it is subject to judicial review for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">Thus dual use of the word \u201cdiscretion\u201d in sections 701(a)(2) and 706(2)(A) gives rise to a linguistic anomaly. An action taken by an agency may be one not \u201ccommitted to agency discretion by law\u201d as that term is to be construed in section 701, and yet it may be one as to which the agency retains the discretion to act, thus subjecting it to judicial review for abuse of discretion, under section 706. These meanings may always be distinguished by recalling that the phrase \u201ccommitted to agency discretion by law\u201d in section 701(a)(2) is simply a euphemism for agency discretion so broad that it is unreviewable even for abuse of discretion. Most agency discretion is not of this character. As one commentator noted, \u201cthough present in almost every agency determination, discretion is not an obstacle to the review of most decisions.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-14\">\n<em>b. Third Circuit standards for action \u201ccommitted to agency discretion by law\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b388-15\">Both the Supreme Court<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>court<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> have devoted extensive commentary to \u201caction[s] committed to agency discretion by law.\u201d The principles governing this subject are not novel in their application. The APA\u2019s \u201cgenerous review provisions must be given a \u2018hospitable\u2019 interpretation.\u201d <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 141, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1511, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967). Only \u201cupon a showing of \u2018clear and convincing evidence\u2019 of a contrary legislative intent should the courts restrict access to judicial review.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Rusk v. Cort, </em>369 U.S. 367, 379-80, 82 S.Ct. 787, 794, 7 L.Ed.2d 809 (1962). Thus, this court has held,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">in the absence of a specific statutory preclusion of review, agency action may be determined to be \u201ccommitted to agency discretion by law\u201d only when a fair appraisal of the entire legislative scheme, including a weighing of the practical and policy implications of reviewability, persuasively indicates that judicial review should be circumscribed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-6\"><em>Local 2855, AFGA (AFL-CIO) v. United States, </em>602 F.2d 574, 578 (3d Cir.1979) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">In <em>Local 2855, </em>Judge Adams, writing for this court, held that three criteria bear on the question of the reviewability of agency action. First, as a predicate to nonreviewability, the agency must have <em>\u201cbroad </em>discretionary powers,\u201d <em>id., see Southern Railroad Co. v. Seaboard Allied Milling Corp., </em>442 U.S. 444, 455, 99 S.Ct. 2388, 2394, 60 L.Ed.2d 1017 (1979); <em>Gatter v. Nimmo, </em>672 F.2d 343, 345 (3d Cir.1982). We meant by this phrase that \u201cin a given case there is no law to apply,\u201d not merely that statutes employ the permissive \u201cmay\u201d or other words of discretion. <em>Local 2855, supra, </em>602 F.2d at 578-79; <em>Gatter, supra, </em>672 F.2d at 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Second, actions that implicate political, military, economic, or other choices \u201cnot essentially legal [in] nature in the sense that legal education and lawyers\u2019 learning afford peculiar competence for their adjustment\u201d are not readily susceptible to judicial review, and are therefore candidates for actions committed to agency discretion. <em>Local 2855, supra, </em>602 F.2d at 579, citing <em>Kendler v. Wirtz, </em>388 F.2d 381, 383 (3d Cir.1968), quoting <em>Driscoll v. Edison Light &amp; Power Co., </em>307 U.S. 104, 122, 59 S.Ct. 715, 724, 83 L.Ed. 1134 (1939) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting). A characteristic of these choices is their dependence on special agency expertise coupled with the absence of any \u201cdiscernible guidelines\u201d against which the expertise can be measured. <em>Id. </em>at 579, <em>see Concerned Residents of Buck Hill Falls v. Grant, </em>537 F.2d 29, 36 (3d Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">Third, even those actions \u201ccommitted to agency discretion by law\u201d are reviewable on grounds that the agency lacked jurisdiction, that the agency\u2019s decision was occasioned by \u201cimpermissible influences,\u201d or that the decision violates any constitutional, statutory, or regulatory command. <em>Local 2855, supra, </em>602 F.2d at 580; <em>see Kirby v. United States, </em>675 F.2d 60, 67-68 (3d Cir. 1982). <em>See also </em>Saferstein, <em>Nonreviewability: A Functional Analysis of \u201cCommitted to Agency Discretion,\u201d </em>82 Harv.L.Rev. 367, 372 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">c. <em>Application of Third Circuit standards</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">We turn then to the question whether the Service\u2019s decision to request a certificate of eligibles is an \u201caction committed to agency discretion,\u201d and thus unreviewable. We are guided by the tenet that federal personnel decisions are largely discretionary, <em>see United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 406, 96 S.Ct. 948, 957, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976), and that there are no specific statutory or regulatory limitations on the power of an agency to request a certificate of eligibles. Nevertheless, we are loathe to conclude that the federal agencies are free to request or not request certificates in a capricious or invidious fashion, or to use the certification practice as a device for circumventing other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>requirements of law. Only when \u201ca fair appraisal of the entire legislative scheme ... persuasively indicates that judicial review should be circumscribed\u201d will this conclusion be compelled. <em>See Local 2855, supra, </em>602 F.2d at 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">In this case, the Marshals Service misrepresented that its term deputies would be \u201cconverted\u201d to permanent employment after the successful completion of a probationary period, a misrepresentation conceived with the intent to induce more experienced personnel to apply for term positions than would otherwise have accepted employment. In fact, of course, the Service had no authority to \u201cconvert\u201d its term employees; those term employees who sought permanent employment were obliged, like all other candidates for employment, to obtain a position on a certificate of eligibles. <em>See </em>pp. 283-284 <em>supra. </em>Accordingly, the Personnel Officer of the Service, in an official memorandum, instructed its hiring officers to ensure that term deputies applied for career employment. <em>See </em>note 19 <em>supra. </em>Further, the Service directed its hiring officers to make use of a special procedure to ensure that those term deputies with sufficiently high scores were certified. <em>See </em>note 23 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">These official policy decisions of the Service make it unnecessary to decide whether, in every case, the decision to request a certificate of eligibles is, or is not, committed to agency discretion by law. In this case, the Service\u2019s representations that it would use the certification procedure to \u201cconvert\u201d its term deputies, and its official memoranda effecting these representations, constituted an official agency program and policy providing that the certification procedure would be used to implement the agency goal of \u201cconverting\u201d term deputies. By adopting this program, the agency obligated itself to implement the program for \u201cconverting\u201d term deputies in a nonarbi-trary fashion. Any other conclusion would permit the Service to represent to its employees that they would be \u201cconverted,\u201d and then behave arbitrarily and capriciously with respect to these representations. In short, under the first criterion of <em>Local 2855, </em>a \u201cfair appraisal of the entire [regulatory program]\u201d indicates that the Service obliged itself to act nonarbitrarily in \u201cconverting\u201d its term deputies. Judicial review as to whether the Service administered its program to \u201cconvert\u201d term deputies arbitrarily or capriciously, is therefore appropriate.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Our conclusion is reinforced by the second criterion identified in <em>Local 2855: </em>whether the agency action implicates choices political, military, economic, or otherwise peculiarly insusceptible of judicial review. The question whether the certification procedure arbitrarily and capriciously implemented the program to \u201cconvert\u201d term deputies is the standard fare of judicial review. No delicate political or economic questions present themselves. To the contrary, we need only ask whether the Service implemented the \u201cconversion\u201d program in a rational, nonarbitrary, and regular fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Finally, under the third criterion of <em>Local 2855, </em>we may review agency action as to whether the action violated other regulatory commands. The Service has a regularized method for evaluating its employees: the one-year \u201ctrial\u201d or probationary period. During this period, a term or career employee may be dismissed \u201cif he fails to demonstrate fully his qualifications for continued employment,\u201d and is afforded procedural means for challenging this finding. <em>See </em>notes 7 and 8 <em>supra. </em>In this case, the Service did not dismiss Smith during the \u201ctrial period,\u201d and while the Service represented that Smith would be \u201cconverted\u201d to career status if he concluded this period\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>which he did \u2014 it did not afford Smith the probationary period for testing his suitability for employment. We may ask whether the Service deliberately used the device of failing to request a certificate of eligibles as a surrogate for avoiding these lawful means of measuring employee performance. <em>Cf. Keener v. United States, </em>165 Ct.Cl. 334, 338 (1964); <em>Ritter v. Strauss, </em>261 F.2d 767, 771 (D.C.Cir.1958) (RIF may not be used as surrogate for effecting discharge); <em>see </em>note 15 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Thus, having tested the Service\u2019s actions against the criteria adopted by this court in <em>Local 2855, supra, </em>it is evident that the Service\u2019s discretion to request a certificate of eligibles is judicially reviewable. The standard by which we review that exercise of discretion is the next subject to which we turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\n<em>2. Standard of review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Section 10(e) of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1976), provides that this court shall declare unlawful, agency action found to be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d We must further decide whether the Commission\u2019s factfinding is reviewable under the substantial evidence standard of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(E) (1976). Section 706(2)(E) provides that the substantial evidence test shall apply to review of agency action taken after a mandatory hearing. In <em>Charlton v. United States, </em>412 F.2d 390 (3d Cir.1969), however, this court applied the substantial evidence test to the discharge of a federal employee not accompanied by a statutory hearing. In <em>Twiggs v. United States Small Business Administration, </em>541 F.2d 150 (3d Cir.1976), this court limited <em>Charlton </em>\u201cto its factual context, <em>i.e., </em>discharges of employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153. In the case of a voluntary transfer, the court held, the \u201carbitrary, capricious, or abuse of discretion\u201d standard of review applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">The district court held, and we agree, that the substantial evidence test does not apply to the Commission\u2019s findings of fact in this case. The Service\u2019s refusal to request a certificate was not a \u201cdischarge,\u201d but a refusal to reclassify. While the distinction is a fine one \u2014 for the effect of the refusal coupled with Smith\u2019s subsequent \u201cRIF\u201d was to discharge Smith \u2014 it has been recognized in other contexts. <em>See United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 402, 406, 96 S.Ct. 948, 955, 957, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976); <em>Donovan v. United States, </em>580 F.2d 1203, 1206-08 (3d Cir.1978). Given the language of section 706(2)(E) and the limitation of <em>Charlton </em>\u201cto its facts,\u201d we are not prepared to depart from this distinction here. The Commission\u2019s findings respecting the Service\u2019s refusal to request a certificate, and any claim Smith raises regarding his term appointment, are reviewable under the \u201carbitrary, capricious, or abuse of discretion\u201d standard, and not the substantial evidence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">B. <em>The Merits-</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">An action will not be deemed arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion \u201csimply because one may happen to think it ill-considered, or to represent the less appealing alternative solution available.\u201d <em>Calcutta E. Court of India &amp; E. Pakistan v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, </em>399 F.2d 994, 997 (D.C.Cir.1968). We will not substitute our judgment for that of the agency. Rather, we require that the agency\u2019s action be rationally related to the purposes to be served, and supported by the facts found in the record. <em>See Carlisle Paper Box Co. v. NLRB, </em>398 F.2d 1, 5-6 (3d Cir.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">We hold that the Service\u2019s failure to request a certificate of eligibles was arbitrary and capricious under this standard. First, the record is replete with mistakes, irregularities, and unexplained procedures. Indeed, the Commission itself found as a fact that there was \u201cevidence of misunderstanding and error in the failure to request certification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">We count at least five such \u201cmisunderstanding[s]\u201d or \u201cerror[s]\u201d in the record: (1) the Service represented that its deputies would be \u201cconverted\u201d to career positions in order to recruit superior candidates, when in fact the Service was fully aware that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>had no power to \u201cconvert\u201d deputies, and must instead hire from Civil Service Registers; (2) Chief Deputy Vinci did not request a certificate of eligibles from the Commission between September 27 and December 13, 1972, for reasons which the Commission found were predicated on the mistaken belief that the Commission\u2019s procedure was a \u201cfavor\u201d to him; (3) the Commission did not keep Vinci\u2019s December 13 request on file until January of 1973, but rather required that Vinci refile the same application, for reasons that are altogether unexplained; (4) although Smith would have qualified for \u201cconversion\u201d from the Philadelphia register, James Berryhill inexplicably instructed Vin-ci \u201cnot to bother\u201d with these registers. Further, Berryhill indicated that he would \u201cget back to\u201d Vinci about these registers and never did; (5) after January of 1973, the Commission imposed an additional requirement on Smith before Smith could be \u201cconverted\u201d to career status \u2014 the requirement that Smith take a new national examination \u2014 and then terminated the position for which he applied before this examination was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The effect of this extraordinary series of mistakes and irregularities is evident. Smith was promised a career position if he completed the probationary period, which he did. Moreover, Smith did everything required of him to be \u201cconverted\u201d in accordance with the Commission\u2019s procedures. Nevertheless, the Service delayed requesting certification for no rational reason explained in the record; the Commission superimposed an additional requirement that Smith take a new examination before the Service would fulfill its obligation to \u201cconvert\u201d him; and the Commission then postponed this new examination until after Smith was discharged. Taken together, we are satisfied that the Service\u2019s actions were arbitrary, capricious, and without rational foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">In addition, we conclude that the Service\u2019s actions are arbitrary and capricious for a second reason. The record makes it apparent that the real reason for these mistakes and irregularities in requesting certification was the FBI investigation of Smith\u2019s character. Indeed, in three letters to Pennsylvania\u2019s congressional representatives, Director Colburn admitted precisely this fact. <em>See </em>pp. 288-289 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Nevertheless, the FBI report could not be a rational basis for the failure to request certification. Nothing in the report, as explicated by Smith\u2019s letter memorandum of January 19, 1972, cast doubt on Smith\u2019s ability to inspect airline passengers. To the contrary, the report revealed four administrative errors during 27 years of otherwise exemplary service. The only plausible ground for objection \u2014 the alleged charge of \u201cconduct unbecoming an officer\u201d \u2014 did not, according to Smith, appear in his personnel file, and nothing in the record before us indicates otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Moreover, any doubt about the unsuitability of the report as a ground for dismissing Smith was settled by the Service itself. On February 9, 1982, the Service revoked its attempt, based on the FBI report, to terminate Smith during Smith\u2019s \u201ctrial period.\u201d In June of 1972, the Service further extended Smith\u2019s term appointment for three years. The Philadelphia Office of the Commission found that in light of these actions, the FBI report provided a \u201ctenuous basis\u201d for denying Smith a permanent position. We agree. The proper time for evaluating an employee\u2019s performance is during the trial or probationary period. Once the Service approved of Smith\u2019s performance by extending his term appointment for three years, it established that acts which occurred before the probationary period were not grounds for terminating Smith\u2019s employment after this period. Nor can the Service argue that the duties of term and career deputies differed, justifying Smith\u2019s appointment as a term deputy but not as a permanent deputy. The Philadelphia Office found that no significant difference between these duties existed, and we respect this finding of fact. Accordingly, the FBI report could not be the basis for denying Smith either term or permanent employment. For the same reason, the Service could not use the certification proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>dure as a device for achieving the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">C. <em>The Remedy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">There remains before us the question of the appropriate remedy for these agency actions. The district court held that its power to order relief derived from the mandamus statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651 (1976), and ordered Smith (1) reinstated to his term position, and (2) reappointed to a permanent position \u201cat that level and grade he would be entitled to had he been appointed to the position of career deputy United States marshal in 1973 and had served continuously until today.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s power to order relief derives not from the mandamus statute, but from section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(1). We also conclude that the district court erred in appointing Smith to a term position. However, we will affirm that portion of the district court\u2019s order directing that Smith be appointed to a permanent position at an appropriate grade and salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">The Supreme Court has consistently held that the remedy of mandamus \u201cis a drastic one, to be invoked only in extraordinary situations.\u201d <em>Allied Chemical Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 34, 101 S.Ct. 188, 189, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980) (per curiam). The writ will issue only when \u201ca party seeking issuance [has] no other adequate means to attain the relief he desires,\u201d and when the \u201cright to issuance of the writ is \u2018clear and indisputable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35, 101 S.Ct. at 190, quoting <em>Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co. v. Holland, </em>346 U.S. 379, 384, 74 S.Ct. 145, 148, 98 L.Ed. 106 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">When appointment to a position of employment is sought, the right to mandamus is \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d only when the party seeking appointment has a right or entitlement to employment based on statute or regulation. <em>See Donovan v. United States, </em>580 F.2d 1203, 1208-09 (3d Cir.1978). If the appointment sought is not a \u201cclear legal entitlement,\u201d but rather a matter subject to agency discretion, mandamus will not lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">No statute or regulation mandated the appointment of Smith to a career-conditional position. Any decision to appoint Smith was instead subject to the informed exercise of the Marshals Service\u2019s discretion and, as we have held, reviewable for abuse of discretion. \u201cWhere a matter is committed to discretion, it cannot be said that a litigant\u2019s right to a particular result is \u2018clear and indisputable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Allied Chemical Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., supra, </em>449 U.S. at 36, 101 S.Ct. at 190. Accordingly, mandamus is not available to compel Smith\u2019s appointment to a permanent position.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> For similar reasons, mandamus would not be available to appoint Smith to a term position.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-14\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-15\">Although we hold that mandamus will not support an order appointing Smith to permanent employment, Smith is not thereby deprived of all judicial remedies. Section 10(e) of the APA provides that the reviewing court shall \u201ccompel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(1) (1976). This section further provides that the reviewing court shall \u201chold unlawful\u201d agency action found to be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(a) (1976). It is apparent that an \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d action is one that is \u201cunlawful\u201d within the meaning of section 706(1), and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>when an agency arbitrarily or capriciously withholds action, we may \u201ccompel\u201d the agency to act under this section. Accordingly, section 706(1) authorizes injunctive relief to compel an appointment arbitrarily or capriciously withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\">Our interpretation accords with that of the Tenth and District of Columbia Circuits, These courts have held that section 706(1) is a source of injunctive relief to remedy an arbitrary or capricious delay or denial of agency action. <em>See Carpet, Linoleum &amp; Tile Layers, Local Union No. 419 v. Brown, </em>656 F.2d 564, 566-67 (10th Cir.1981); <em>Health Systems Agency of Oklahoma, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norman, </em>589 F.2d 486, 492-93 (10th Cir. 1978) (failure to accept application an abuse of discretion; court directed that application be considered); <em>M. Steinthal &amp; Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Seamans, </em>455 F.2d 1289, 1305-06 (D.C. Cir. 1971) (preliminary injunction may issue when requisite standards are met); <em>see also Wheelabrator Corp. </em>v. <em>Chafee, </em>455 F.2d 1306, 1316-17 (D.C.Cir.1971). Indeed, any other interpretation would render the standards of section 706 meaningless; were it otherwise, the federal courts would be powerless to redress agency action found arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"AL4\">We have concluded that section 706(1) authorizes this court to compel agency action arbitrarily or capriciously withheld. Because the action unlawfully withheld by the Service was the failure to request a certificate of eligibles from which Smith would have been appointed to a permanent position, the district court is authorized by section 706(1) to compel Smith\u2019s appointment to a permanent position. We agree with the district court that Smith must be appointed to that grade and salary he would have enjoyed had the Service not unlawfully withheld his appointment.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"acp-dedup-0\">We also concur with the district court that we lack jurisdiction over Smith\u2019s claim for backpay in excess of $10,000. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(2) (Supp. Y 1981). We cannot agree, however, that the Service also be directed to reinstate Smith to his term position, a position that expired by its own terms in 1975. The Service did not unlawfully withhold Smith\u2019s appointment to a term position; to the contrary, the Service appointed Smith to a term position in lieu of \u201cconverting\u201d him to permanent employment. The only action unlawfully withheld by the Service was Smith\u2019s appointment to <em>permanent </em>employment. Accordingly, Smith\u2019s appointment to a term position was not agency action \u201cunlawfully withheld.\u201d To that extent, and without regard to whether Smith\u2019s reinstatement to a term position and our disposition directing his appointment to a permanent position would be consistent, <em>see </em>note 41 <em>infra, </em>section 706(1) does not authorize the district court to compel the Service to reinstate him.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay7\">Our disposition of these claims permits us to untie the jurisdictional knot tied by prior orders of the Claims Court and the district court in these proceedings. In its order of October 31, 1979, the district court held, citing <em>Cook v. Arentzen, </em>582 F.2d 870 (4th Cir.1978), that any claims by Smith for injunctive relief were nonseverable from Smith s claim for monetary damages in excess of $10\u2019000. By \u201cnonseverable,\u201d the district court meant that the Court of Claims bad exclusive jurisdiction over Smith s monetalY and nonmonetary claims. <em>See Cook, supra, </em>582 F.2d at 878.</p>\n<p id=\"a8x-dedup-0\">As previously observed, however, the Court of Claims disputed the district court\u2019s interpretation of its own jurisdiction. Cit-ing <em>Cook v. Arentzen </em>with disapproval, the Court of Claims held that both that court and the district court had jurisdiction over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Smith\u2019s claim for reinstatement. <em>See Giordano v. Roudebush, </em>617 F.2d 511, 514-15 (8th Cir.1980). Consequently, the Court of Claims held, the district court was without power to transfer Smith\u2019s claim for reinstatement to the Court of Claims under the former provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(c). That section \u2014 now repealed by the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982, \u00a7 132(1), Pub.L. No. 97-164, 96 Stat. 25,39 \u2014 provided that the district courts may transfer \u201ca case within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Claims\u201d to that court. Moreover, the Court of Claims was without jurisdiction to consider Smith\u2019s second claim for permanent appointment. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Testan, supra. </em>Accordingly, the Court of Claims held that the district court was without power to transfer any of Smith\u2019s nonmonetary claims to that Court. <em>See Smith v. United States, </em>654 F.2d 50, 53, 228 Ct.Cl. 168 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Whether the Court of Claims also held that the district court was without power to transfer Smith\u2019s <em>monetary </em>claim is unclear. Although the former provisions of 28 U.S.C, \u00a7 1406(c) refer to the transfer of a \u201ccase,\u201d and not to individual claims within a case, the Court of Claims \u201csuspended\u201d proceedings in that court pending the district court\u2019s reconsideration of its own jurisdiction. <em>See Smith v. United States, supra, </em>654 F.2d at 54. We cannot discern from the record whether the Claims Court continues to exercise jurisdiction over Smith\u2019s claim for back pay, and whether the Claims Court would exercise jurisdiction over Smith\u2019s claim for reinstatement in light of this court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Because we conclude that the district court lacked the power in this case, under the mandamus statute and the APA, to order Smith\u2019s reinstatement, it is patent that the only proper forum in which to raise the reinstatement claim, if that claim is still viable, is the Claims Court. Therefore, we need not resolve the dispute whether, if the district court <em>did </em>have the power to order reinstatement under the APA, it would nonetheless have been barred from doing so because the Claims Court must exercise exclusive jurisdiction over such claims. <em>Compare Keller v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>679 F.2d 220, 221-22 (11th Cir.1982) (per curiam) <em>and Cook v. Arentzen, supra, </em>582 F.2d at 878, with <em>Giordano v. Roude-bush, supra, </em>617 F.2d at 514-15.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">In addition, we conclude that with the repeal of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(c) by the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982, we may transfer a case to the Claims Court \u201cif it be in the interest of justice\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a) (1976) without regard to whether the case is within the \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d of that court<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> We further conclude that Smith\u2019s claims for reinstatement and back pay are severable from his claim for permanent employment, and that these claims for reinstatement and back pay constituted a \u201ccase\u201d under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a).

We address at the outset the source of our jurisdiction. Section 144 of the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982 provides that petitions to review final orders of the Merit Systems Protection Board \u2014 successor to the Civil Service Commission Appeals Review Board\u2014 shall be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1) (Supp. V 1981), <em>as amended by </em>Pub.L. No. 97-164, \u00a7 144, 96 Stat. 25, 45 (1982). The Federal Courts Improvement Act, however, applies only to notices of appeal filed after October 1, 1982. Pub.L. No. 97-164 \u00a7\u00a7 402, 403(e), 96 Stat. 25, 57, 58 (1982). The notice of appeal in this case was filed on March 24, 1982. Section 403(e) of the Act provides that any case in which a notice of appeal has been filed in a district court prior to October 1 shall be decided by the court of appeals to which the appeal was taken. Consequently, we now have appellate jurisdiction provided that the district court properly exercised original jurisdiction. Cf. <em>Lancellotti </em>v. <em>Office of Personnel Management, </em>704 F.2d 91, 98 n. 12 (3d Cir.1983) (similar conclusion for petitions for review filed in the courts of appeals before October 1, 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 abolished the Civil Service Commission Appeals Review Board \u2014 as noted above \u2014 and replaced it with the Merit Systems Protection Board. Pub.L. No. 95-454, \u00a7 202, 92 Stat. 1111, 1121 (1978). Section 205 of the 1978 Reform Act provided that petitions to review final orders of the Board \u201cshall be filed in the Court of Claims or a United States Court of Appeals\u201d \u2014 not in the district courts. The 1978 Reform Act took effect in January of 1979. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 907, 92 Stat. at 1227. Smith\u2019s original complaint, however, was filed in the district court in 1974, long before the 1978 Act. Accordingly, we must ask whether the district court had original jurisdiction before the 1978 Reform Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">In <em>Jaffee v. United States, </em>592 F.2d 712, 718-19 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 961, 99 S.Ct. 2406, 60 L.Ed.2d 1066 (1979), this court held that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (1976) is a jurisdictional predicate for claims of nonmonetary relief under the Administrative Procedure Act. Consequently, Smith\u2019s claims for nonmonetary relief were properly before the district court of 1974. Because neither the district court\u2019s nor our jurisdiction over this case is affected by the 1978 Reform Act or the 1982 Improvement Act, we have jurisdiction over Smith\u2019s claims for nonmonetary relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b387-16\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 (1976) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b387-17\">(a) This chapter applies, according to the provisions thereof, except to the extent that\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b387-18\">(2) agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-19\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (1976) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b387-20\">The reviewing court shall \u2014 ...</p>\n<p id=\"b387-21\">(2) hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\">. <em>See </em>L.

We simply hold that having promised to use the certification procedure to implement its \u201cconversion\u201d program, the Service thereupon obliged itself to exercise its discretion to request certificates in a rational, nonarbitrary fashion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b393-11\">. The district court relied on a dictum in <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 96 S.Ct. 948, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976), for the proposition that relief by writ of mandamus was available.

The Supreme Court did not, however, thereby hold that mandamus would always be available to effect a \u201creclassification\u201d of employees, or abrogate the traditional requirements of mandamus in these cases.

Kunda v. Muhlenberg College, </em>621 F.2d 532, 554-55 (3d Cir.1980) (Garth, J., concurring and dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b395-6\">. Chief Judge Seitz would not reach this issue for a different reason. In Chief Judge Seitz\u2019 view, Smith\u2019s claim for term reinstatement amounts to no more than a disguised claim for monetary damages, since at the time that Smith filed his complaint, the United States no longer staffed the Air Piracy Program with term deputy marshals. On that basis, Chief Judge Seitz believes that Smith\u2019s claim for term reinstatement was properly transferred to the Court of Claims by the district court in 1980. See <em>e.g., Hoopa Valley Tribe v. United States, </em>596 F.2d 435, 436, 219 Ct.Cl. 492 (1979) (where prime effort of claim is to obtain money damages from the Federal Government, the Court of Claims\u2019 exclusive jurisdiction over non-tor-tious (above $10,000) claims cannot be evaded or avoided by framing a district court complaint to appear to seek injunctive, mandatory, or declaratory relief).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b395-11\">. The legislative history of the Federal Courts Improvement Act does not speak to the purpose of the repeal of \u00a7 1406(c). <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 275, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 22, 1982 U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Ad.News 11, 32. We cannot conclude, however, that Congress intended to handcuff the federal courts by prohibiting them from transferring a case improperly filed in the district courts to the Claims Court when the interests of justice so require. We conclude instead that Congress intended to eliminate the cumbersome requirement \u2014 and the attendant jurisdictional complexities, as evinced by this case \u2014 that a case be within the \u201cexclusive\u201d jurisdiction of the Claims Court in order to invoke the transfer provision of \u00a7 1406(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b396-8\">. Even if we were without power to transfer this case to the Claims Court under \u00a7 1406(a), our disposition of this appeal makes it apparent that Smith\u2019s claims for reinstatement and back pay were properly transferred to the Claims Court by the district court in January of 1980 under the former provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(c). This conclusion follows because, as we have now held, the district court lacked power in this case to order reinstatement. Consequently, Smith\u2019s reinstatement claim was within the \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d of the Court of Claims as that phrase appeared in section 1406(c). If the Claims Court, by \u201csuspending\u201d proceedings in that court, continues to exercise jurisdiction over these claims, then the court may choose simply to rely on its jurisdiction deriving from the district court\u2019s 1980 transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">We note as well that our disposition of this appeal may moot any claim for appointment to a term position. Smith seemingly cannot be appointed to two positions simultaneously, and the career appointment is apparently the superior of the two. Nevertheless, the record does not reveal whether benefits of any kind may turn on Smith\u2019s having completed the service of his term position. This question is properly left to consideration by the Claims Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">Our disposition of this appeal makes it unnecessary to consider whether Smith could prevail under the doctrine of <em>Vitarelli v. Seaton, </em>359 U.S. 535, 79 S.Ct. 968, 3 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b396-6\">ADAMS, Circuit Judge, concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Although I agree with the result reached by the majority, I write separately primarily to emphasize the narrowness of today\u2019s holding. First, as I understand the case, the Court holds that the combination of erroneous decisions and delays which resulted in the denial of a career appointment to Nathan Smith was sufficiently inordinate to be unlawful. We do not suggest, however, that bureaucratic negligence will inexorably rise to the level of \u201carbitrary and capricious action\u201d for purposes of the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d). Second, in reversing the district court\u2019s order to reinstate Smith to his term position, the Court is not in any way passing on the merits of Smith\u2019s claim that he was wrongfully discharged from his old post. Rather, as I analyze the remedy issue, the order directing that Smith be appointed to a career position rendered moot any nonmone-tary claim based on Smith\u2019s discharge from his term position. To ensure that the decision not be misconstrued, I add the following explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">Because the Marshals Service officially represented that term deputies for the Anti-Air Piracy Program would be \u201cconverted\u201d to career status after successfully completing a period of probation,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Court holds that the agency committed itself to conducting a regular program of \u201cconversion\u201d in a nonarbitrary and noncapricious manner. This commitment imposed a judicially reviewable limit on administrative discretion, a limit unrelated to the fact that the conversion program was not authorized. It therefore seems unnecessary to assert that statements by certain members of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Service were \u201cmisrepresentations,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and I do not join any suggestion to that effect. Additionally, the Service\u2019s self-imposed limit on discretion did not depend on the details of the statutes and rules governing employment in the competitive and excepted service. Consequently, I do not join the extensive discussion in Part I.A., <em>supra, </em>Maj.Op. at 280-283, insofar as it might be interpreted as controlling statements of law, rather than factual background only.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Nevertheless, the majority is surely correct that the actions of the Marshals Service in this case are not immune from judicial review under section 10 of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2) (1976). Given the Service\u2019s commitment to a regular program of conversion, it cannot be said that the agency has such \u201cbroad discretionary powers\u201d that \u201cthere is no law to apply.\u201d <em>Local 2855, AFGA (AFL-CIO) v. United States, </em>602 F.2d 574, 578-9 (3d Cir.1979); <em>Gatter v. Nimmo, </em>672 F.2d 343, 345 (3d Cir.1982). The question whether the Service\u2019s program was conducted in a nonarbitrary and nonea-pricious manner presents a classic legal choice well-fitted to the \u201cpeculiar competence\u201d of courts. <em>Local 2855, supra, </em>602 F.2d at 579. In view of the presumption favoring judicial review under the APA, <em>id. </em>at 578, the Service\u2019s actions in this proceeding are not committed solely to agency discretion by law under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2), and are therefore reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">I also am in accord with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the appropriate standard for review is the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d test of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1976). Since federal personnel decisions must be accorded substantial deference, <em>see United States v. Tes-tan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 406, 96 S.Ct. 948, 957, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976), and since the Service\u2019s failure to convert Smith does not fall squarely into the category of a discharge, I agree that there is no reason to extend the rule of <em>Charlton v. United States, </em>412 F.2d 390 (3d Cir.1969), and apply the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(E) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">What most concerns me about today\u2019s decision is that the majority\u2019s application of the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d test not be misinterpreted. Judge Garth points to two reasons why the Service\u2019s failure to convert Smith to career status was arbitrary and capricious: first, the series of five \u201cmisunderstandings and errors\u201d which delayed the Service in requesting Smith\u2019s name on a certificate of eligibles from June 30,1972\u2014 when he had successfully completed his probationary period \u2014 until after his dismissal pursuant to a Reduction in Force (\u201cRIF\u201d), <em>see </em>Maj.Op. at 295-296; and second, the Service\u2019s continued reliance on the FBI Report after deciding to extend Smith\u2019s term appointment beyond his probationary period. <em>See </em>Maj.Op. at 296-297. My understanding of this holding is not that, strictly speaking, these are two independent grounds for finding the government\u2019s actions arbitrary and capricious, but rather that the two grounds are closely interrelated. When, as here, the government establishes a program whereby term deputies who successfully complete their probation period will be converted to career status and a series of delays prevents an employee from being converted after successful completion of the probationary term, the government must either rationally explain the delays or rationally explain its decision not to correct the effect of the delays.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">In this case, the government did neither. To say that the delays resulted from \u201cmisunderstanding and error,\u201d as did the Civil Service Commission Appeals Review Board, App. at 65, is not a sufficient explanation. The government\u2019s refusal to correct the effect of the delays was justified only by reference to the FBI Report. The Service conceded as much in its three letters to the Senators from Pennsylvania. Tr. at 854, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>858 and 861; Appellant\u2019s Exh. 32, 36 and 38. Yet, the Service had itself effectively repudiated the FBI Report after rescinding its February 1972 termination order and reappointing Smith for a new 3-year term as a temporary deputy. In light of the Service\u2019s implicit admission that the FBI Report was irrelevant, its subsequent reliance on the Report was manifestly irrational.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the errors and misunderstandings that delayed Smith\u2019s conversion, when taken together with the Service\u2019s reliance on the FBI Report, rendered arbitrary and capricious the failure to convert Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">I concur in the holding that under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(1) (1976) Smith should be appointed to a permanent position at the grade and salary he would have attained had the Service not unlawfully withheld his appointment. I also agree that Smith\u2019s claim for back pay in excess of $10,000 must be heard by the Court of Claims. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(2). Finally, I am in accord with the conclusion that the district court should not have decided Smith\u2019s claim for reinstatement to a term position. But I cannot join entirely with the reasoning of my colleagues in reaching this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">To my mind, the district court\u2019s order to appoint Smith to a career position mooted his claim for term reinstatement. The injunction directing Smith\u2019s career appointment can be conceptualized as a 2-step remedy: first, an order to reinstate Smith to a position comparable to his old term appointment; second, an order to promote Smith from his old post to a career position. Once the district court directed that Smith be appointed to the permanent post he would have held absent the Service\u2019s improper conduct, any additional injunction directing Smith\u2019s reinstatement became redundant. To that extent, Judge Garth is correct that the district court \u201clacked power\u201d to issue a separate order for term reinstatement. <em>See </em>Maj.Op. at pp. 298, 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">The mootness of Smith\u2019s claim for term reinstatement does not, however, justify the conclusion that the term position was \u201cnot unlawfully\u201d withheld. <em>See </em>Maj.Op. at 298. Conceivably, Smith\u2019s allegation that he was unlawfully discharged from the term position states a cause of action under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(1). But for the Service\u2019s arbitrary and capricious failure to \u201cconvert\u201d Smith, he would not have been within the ambit of the 1973 RIF in the first place. Because of these peculiar facts, the Service\u2019s refusal to exempt Smith from its 1973 RIF may have constituted \u201cagency action unlawfully withheld\u201d for purposes of section 706(1). We need not reach this difficult issue, however, since the injunction directing a permanent appointment necessarily incorporates the nonmonetary relief that might be granted for a wrongful discharge from the term position. Our disposition of this case does not moot any monetary claims premised on Smith\u2019s discharge from the term position, but such monetary relief \u2014 being part of a claim for damages in excess of $10,000 \u2014 falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Claims Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">Thus I agree with Chief Judge Seitz that any remaining claims based on Smith\u2019s discharge from his term position are monetary. Chief Judge Seitz, however, reaches this conclusion by reasoning that the demand for term reinstatement can amount only to a disguised claim for monetary damages. <em>See </em>Maj.Op. at 299 n. 40. In practical terms, there appears to be no difference between viewing the issue as a mootness problem, as I do, or as a \u201cdisguised monetary claim\u201d problem, as does Chief Judge Seitz. But analytically I do not think this case falls squarely within the principle of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number><em>Hoopa Valley Tribe </em>v. <em>United States, </em>596 F.2d 435, 436, 219 Ct.Cl. 492 (1979), or the decisions which require immediate referral to the Court of Claims when a case contains no substantial nonmonetary claims. <em>See Denton </em>v. <em>Schlesinger, </em>605 F.2d 484 (9th Cir.1979); <em>Polos v. United States, </em>556 F.2d 903 (8th Cir.1977). Smith\u2019s claim for relief involves a substantial nonmonetary demand for career appointment which, as the Court of Claims explained, <em>Smith v. United States, </em>654 F.2d 50, 52, 228 Ct.Cl. 168 (1981), could be heard only by the district court. Moreover, had we not mooted the nonmonetary claims arising from Smith\u2019s term discharge, his term reinstatement also might have provided a substantial basis for retaining jurisdiction in the district court. I therefore prefer to analyze the vexing jurisdictional problem of this case in terms of mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">Although the district judge did not explain his unusual order directing that Smith receive both permanent appointment and term reinstatement, I suspect that this remedial approach was chosen out of an apprehension that <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 96 S.Ct. 948, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976), might foreclose Smith from asserting a backpay claim if he received only an order for permanent appointment. I too am concerned that the Court not inadvertently deprive Smith of his claim for damages, but I do not believe it does so today. The <em>Testan </em>opinion makes clear that the Court of Claims may not award back pay for a position to which a plaintiff has not been appointed. Since Smith was appointed to and did serve in a term position until his discharge, <em>Testan </em>would appear to pose no barrier to a backpay claim based on the term position. As for backpay based on Smith\u2019s career appointment, I am not persuaded that <em>Testan </em>bars a backpay award to a plaintiff who, by order of a district court, has been appointed to a career position that the court determined had been arbitrarily and capriciously withheld; <em>Tes-tan </em>did not decide such a question. In interpreting its own jurisdiction to hear Smith\u2019s case, the Court of Claims dealt ambiguously -with the <em>Testan </em>problem, but intimated by its construction of <em>Phillips v. United States, </em>227 Ct.Cl. 532 (1981), that it could consider a backpay claim based on Smith\u2019s wrongfully withheld career position once he had received a career appointment. <em>Smith v. United States, supra, </em>654 F.2d at 53; <em>but see id. </em>at 52 (\u201cWe still could not give the employee back pay for a position to which he was not appointed ... \u201d). These issues must be resolved in the first instance by the Court of Claims, but I wish to emphasize that, at least as I view it, the decision today does not reject the merits of any claim regarding the term position Smith may make in the Claims Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">With the understanding that the result reached by the Court rests on the entire combination of circumstances that prevented Smith\u2019s conversion to career status and that we do not in any way reach the merits of Smith\u2019s claim that he was wrongfully discharged from his term position, I concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b396-15\">. The many statements by members of the Marshals Service assuring new term deputies that they would be converted, <em>see esp. </em>Tr. at 127, 617-18, 639-41, may not have been sufficient to constitute an official commitment by the agency.
