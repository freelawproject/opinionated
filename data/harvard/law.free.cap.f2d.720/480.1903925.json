We affirm the decision of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-20\">Norfolk and Western (N &amp; W) is a railroad that has a line operating between Brunswick, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska. On December 30, 1981, N &amp; W filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) a light density line<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> surcharge<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of $191 per car on all traffic originating or terminating at N &amp; W stations on the line. After seeking discovery of the underlying data used by N &amp; W to calculate the surcharge, the petitioners sought a suspension of the surcharge and an investigation into its lawfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-21\">The ICC did not suspend the surcharge but did institute an investigation into all issues relevant to the lawfulness of the schedules. The Commission, after considering all the evidence of record, found that the petitioners had not met their burden of showing that, after application of the surcharge, N &amp; W\u2019s revenues would exceed 110 percent of N &amp; W\u2019s variable cost of transporting-traffic to and from the line plus the reasonably expected costs of continued operations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Light Density Line Surcharge, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>367 ICC 99 (1982). The Commission therefore found that the surcharge was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Subsequent to the Commission\u2019s findings, petitioners sought a stay of that portion of the Commission\u2019s decision discontinuing the proceeding. The Commission denied the stay request but reopened the proceeding on its own motion to clarify several points in its order. <em>Light Density Line Surcharge, </em>No. 38799 (Nov. 29, 1982) (unpublished). Petitioners thereafter filed the present petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Under the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, P.L. No. 96-448, 94 Stat. 1895, a rail carrier is entitled to apply a surcharge if the revenue it receives from a line does not exceed 110% of the variable costs of transporting traffic to and from the line plus 100% of the reasonably expected costs of operating the line. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10705a(b)(l)(A) &amp; (b)(2) (Supp. Y 1981). Petitioners argue that no substantial evidence exists to support the ICC\u2019s findings as to N &amp; W\u2019s cost of operating the line.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Specifically, petitioners argue that land valuations supplied by N &amp; W were unsubstantiated and should not have been relied upon by the ICC. Petitioners also argue that costs attributable to a forty-one mile section of the line were counted twice in the ICC\u2019s estimates of N &amp; W\u2019s costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">In <em>Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. Wichita Board of Trade, </em>412 U.S. 800, 806-07, 93 S.Ct. 2367, 2374, 37 L.Ed.2d 350 (1973), the Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-13\">Judicial review of decisions by the Interstate Commerce Commission in rate cases necessarily has a limited scope. Such decisions \u201care not to be disturbed by the courts except upon a showing that they are unsupported by evidence, were made without a hearing, exceed constitutional limits, or for some other reason amount to an abuse of power.\u201d <em>Manufacturers R. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>246 U.S. 457, 481 [38 S.Ct. 383, 389, 62 L.Ed. 831] (1918). As this Court has observed, \u201cThe process of rate making is essentially empiric. The stuff of the process is fluid and changing \u2014 the resultant of factors that must be valued as well as weighed. Congress has therefore delegated the enforcement of transportation policy to a permanent expert body and has charged it with the duty of being responsive to the dynamic character of transportation problems.\u201d <em>Board of Trade of Kansas </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number><em>City v. United States, </em>314 U.S. 534, 546 [62 S.Ct. 366, 372, 86 L.Ed. 432] (1942).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">The delegation to the Commission is not, of course, unbounded, and it is the duty of a reviewing court to determine whether the course followed by the Commission is consistent with its mandate from Congress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">In the instant case, the petitioners have failed to present specific evidence that would substantiate the alleged incorrect valuation and double counting. Petitioners rely on conclusory statements given by their witnesses in testimony and affidavits. Without a comparison between the allegedly incorrect figures and the figures on which petitioners rely, we cannot say that the Commission\u2019s findings were an \u201cabuse of power.\u201d It is true that the ICC relied on figures supplied by N &amp; W. However, with no substantiation of the petitioners\u2019 claim that those figures were unreliable, we cannot say that the ICC\u2019s conclusions are \u201cunsupported by evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The petitioners also allege that the standards used by the Commission in calculating reasonably expected costs were incorrect. Under the Staggers Act, Congress required the ICC to define within 120 days of the Act\u2019s passage, October 1, 1980, the \u201creasonably expected costs\u201d of operating a rail line. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10705a(b)(2) (Supp. V 1981). Congress provided standards that were to apply for the 120 day interim period. <em>See id. </em>The instant action was initiated after the expiration of the 120 day period but before the ICC issued its interpretation of \u201creasonably expected costs.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In deciding the instant action, the Commission used the interim standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">The Commission states that it chose to apply the interim standards because their application produced a lower surcharge than would the application of the then pending official standards. In oral argument, the petitioners conceded this result but contended that our decision in <em>City of Cherokee v. Interstate Commerce Commission, </em>671 F.2d 1080 (8th Cir.1982), requires that this court remand the case to the ICC for another hearing at which the permanent standards would be applied.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">In <em>Cherokee, </em>the court recognized that the Staggers Act set a minimum 110%/100% revenue standard that a railroad may seek to achieve through a surcharge. Because the ICC had refused to investigate the surcharge, no evidence was presented as to the railroad\u2019s reasonably expected costs and revenues. Therefore, the petitioners were unable to apply the 110%/100% standard and evaluate the surcharge. It was on this issue that the court held that the ICC should apply, on remand, the official standards for \u201creasonably expected costs\u201d instead of the interim standards. The court emphasized the crucial role that the reasonably expected cost figure would play in the ICC\u2019s determination and the importance to petitioners of having a clear standard by which to measure the rail carrier\u2019s proposed surcharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">This case differs from <em>Cherokee </em>in several respects. In <em>Cherokee, </em>no attempt had been made by the carrier or the ICC to substantiate reasonably expected costs. Therefore, the use of the new standards would be just as expedient as would the use of the interim standards. In the instant case, the ICC has already used the statuto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>rily allotted time for reviewing the surcharge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It has already made an accounting of N &amp; W\u2019s reasonably expected costs and we find no public benefit in having it expend more resources on this issue.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Additionally, all parties were on notice during the proceedings that the ICC was using the interim standards in determining reasonably expected costs<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and were apprised of the official standards when they were issued. Yet the petitioners do not argue that by using either of these standards N &amp; W\u2019s revenues would exceed the 110%/100% standard. Finally, petitioners themselves concede that the use of the interim standards results in a <em>lower </em>surcharge than that which would result from the application of the new standards. We find no prejudice to the petitioners by the ICC\u2019s decision. The order of the Commission is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-11\">. Petitioners are 28 companies that ship commodities via the Norfolk and Western line.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b577-12\">. A light density rail line is a line that \u201ccarried less than 3,000,000 gross ton miles of traffic per mile in the most recent calendar year for which traffic data is available.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10705a(b)(l)(A) (Supp. V 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b577-22\">.

Petitioners argue that the burden of proving that the line qualifies for a surcharge is on the carrier once the ICC has instituted an investigation. The rail carrier does have the burden of originally showing that its line qualifies as a light density line producing inadequate revenues under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10705a(b)(l) &amp; (2) (Supp. V 1981). However, once the surcharge is properly applied, as it was in this case, the burden is on the shippers to show that the surcharge revenues exceed 110% of the carrier\u2019s cost of transporting traffic to and from the line plus 100% of the cost of operating the line:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANs\">Upon petition of a shipper located upon a line to which a surcharge under this subsection is applied, the Commission may cancel the application of a surcharge under this subsection <em>if such shipper demonstrates to the Commission </em>that, after application of the surcharge, the surcharging carrier\u2019s revenues from all traffic originating or terminating upon the line to which the surcharge applies exceed 110 percent of such carrier\u2019s variable cost of transporting all traffic to or from such line plus such carrier\u2019s reasonably expected costs of continuing to operate such line.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqm\"><em>Id. </em>at 10705a(b)(3)(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-15\">Petitioners rely on section 10701a(b)(2)(B)(ii) for support of their argument that N &amp; W has the burden of proof. However, this section relates to initial rate setting by the rail carrier and is superseded by the more specific provision quoted above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b579-8\">. <em>Reasonably Expected Cost, </em>365 ICC 819 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b579-9\">. In <em>Cherokee, </em>the rail carrier applied for abandonment of its line. The ICC approved the application. On appeal, this court held that the ICC had used the wrong standards in determining whether abandonment was available to the carrier and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with the correct standards. As the renewed abandonment proceedings were nearing completion, the rail company filed a surcharge of more than $1,000 per car for all traffic moving on its branch line (effectively doubling the cost of moving freight on the line). The ICC accepted the surcharge and refused petitioners\u2019 request to suspend and investigate it. This court asserted jurisdiction on the basis that the ICC\u2019s action substantially interfered with this court\u2019s earlier denial of the ICC\u2019s order allowing abandonment. <em>See City of Cherokee v. ICC, </em>641 F.2d 1220 (8th Cir. 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b580-5\">. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10707(b)(1) (Supp. V 1981) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">The Commission must complete a proceeding under this section and make its final decision by the end of the 5th month after the rate, classification, rule, or practice was to become effective, except that if the Commission reports to the Congress by the end of such 5th month that it cannot make a final decision by that time and explains the reason for the delay, it may take an additional 3 months to complete the proceeding and make its final decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">In the instant case, the Commission issued its decision on the last day of the three month extension.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b580-8\">.
