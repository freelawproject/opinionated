We reverse the judgment of the district court and direct the entry of a writ declaring the exclusion order invalid and remanding this matter to the Immigration and Naturalization Service for determination in deportation proceedings of the relief Joshi seeks. We express no view on the merits of Joshi\u2019s substantive claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-24\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b895-25\">Joshi, a 67-year old citizen of India, was lawfully admitted to the United States in 1973 as a nonimmigrant business visitor. In 1974, he applied to the district director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service for an adjustment of status to that of a permanent resident. In June 1975, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>his application was pending, Joshi sought permission to travel to India on business, The Service granted his request in the form of an \u201cadvance parole.\u201d Joshi made his business trip and returned six weeks later to resume his application for adjustment of status. This application was denied in 1976. A subsequent application and a motion for reconsideration were also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">The Service instituted exclusion proceedings against Joshi in 1978.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He objected to the exclusion proceedings as inappropriate and also renewed his application for adjustment to permanent resident status. The immigration judge overruled the objection to the exclusion proceedings. At the con-elusion of the hearing in April 1983, she denied Joshi s application for adjustment of status and ordered him excluded from the United States. The judge also denied the discretionary relief that Joshi sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">The Board of Immigration Appeals rejected Joshi\u2019s claim that he should have been accorded deportation rather than ex-elusion proceedings and dismissed his appeal. It concluded that Joshi lost his right te deportation proceedings when he obtained the first advance parole. The Board also upheld the denial of his request for suspension of deportation, ruling that this relief is \u201conly available in deportation proceedings.\u201d It affirmed the denial of other discretionary relief. No precedent precisely on point was available to the Board because Joshi\u2019s case appears to be the first to consider the consequences of an alien\u2019s authorized departure and return, to resume a pending application for change of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b896-17\">After Joshi was lawfully admitted to this country as a business nonimmigrant in 1973, he could be removed only by deportation proceedings. He could not be subjected to exclusion proceedings. In 1974 when he applied for permanent residency, his deport-able status remained unchanged under a long-standing administrative practice that regards the applicant\u2019s authorized stay in the United States as continuing while his application is under consideration. <em>See </em>INS Operations Instructions 245.5b, reproduced in 4 Gordon &amp; Rosenfield, <em>Immigration Law and Procedure </em>23-530 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"AdY\">The of heari accorded Joghi hag far-reaching effects. A deportation hearjng is the usual means of proceeding against an alien already physically in the United States; an exclusion hearing is the USUal means of proceeding against an alien who is seeking admission. <em>Landon v. Plasencia, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 321, 325, 74 L.Ed.2d 21 (1982). If Joshi is entitled to deportation proceedings, he would have many substantive and procedural benefits no^ available to an excludable alien. The Supreme Court hag noted that \u201ethe alien who logeg hig right to regide in the United States in a deportation hearing ... may be able to depart voluntarily, \u00a7 244(e), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(e), avoiding ... the stigma 0f deportation, \u00a7 242(b), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b) ... or he can seek suspension of dep\u00f3rtation, \u00a7 242(e), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(e).\u201d <em>Landon </em>v. Plasencia, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 321, 323, 74 L.Ed.2d 21 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"Ab6T\">jjj</p>\n<p id=\"adl-dedup-1\">Despite^ Joshi s protestations that he has keen denied due process of law because subjecting him to exclusion proceedings is fundamentally unfair, we conclude that resolution of this appeal does not depend on the application of constitutional principles. Instead, it involves interpretation of statutes, regulations, and the Service\u2019s operations instructions. Although the appeal Presents an issue of first impression, SuPreme Court opinions dealing with closely-related matters furnish controlling prece^ent.</p>\n<p id=\"A1U-\">In <em>Rosenberg v. Fleuti, </em>374 U.S. 449, 457-58, 83 S.Ct. 1804, 1809-1810, 10 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>1000 (1963), the Supreme Court noted that Congress, reacting to the narrow judicial interpretation of \"entry\" when it enacted \u00a7 101(a)(13), wanted to ameliorate the harsh results visited upon aliens who had previously entered and resided in the United States.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court said: \"We conclude, then, that it effectuates congressional purpose to construe the intent exception to \u00a7 101(a)(13) as meaning an intent to depart in a manner which can be regarded as meaningfully interruptive of the alien's permanent residence.\" The Court left development of this concept to the judicial process, but in the case at hand, it applied this interpretation of the statute to a resident alien whose departure from the United States \"was an innocent, casual and brief excursion.\" Under these circumstances, the returning alien was not subject to the consequences of entry. Its interpretation of the Act, the Court explained, gave recognition to congressional intent to protect aliens residing in the country from unexpected risks and unintended consequences of wholly innocent action. 374 U.S. at 462, 83 S.Ct. at 1812.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-29\">In 1968 the Commissioner issued a regulation, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.2(a)(3), which in effect applied the Fleuti rationale to the departure of aliens who, like Joshi, are seeking adjustment of status.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is apparent from the text of the regulation that an applicant for adjustment of status who makes an unintended departure from the United States for a brief absence is not deemed to have lost his entitlement to adjudication of his application in deportation proceedings. On this point the regulation is explicit: \"[T]he application shall be adjudicated without regard to the departure and absence.\" The alien is accorded this favorable treatment because, as Fleuti explains, the congressional purpose is effectuated by ascertaining whether the alien intended his departure to be \"meaningfully interruptive.\" 374 U.S. at 462, 83 S.Ct. at 1812.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-66\">Fleuti also teaches that the relevant factors pertaining to an alien's intent should be developed \"`by the gradual process of judicial inclusion and exclusion' . . .\" 374 U.S. at 462, 83 S.Ct. at 1812. This case, we believe, provides a proper occasion for giving effect to this aspect of Fleuti.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-74\">Joshi's intent in departing from the United States has never been questioned. He recognized that if he left without permission he would abandon his application for adjustment of status. Consequently, to preserve his application he sought permission. Moreover, he was granted permission by a document that recited in part: \"This authorization will permit you to resume your application for adjustment of status on your return to the United States.\" It is quite clear that Joshi intended to preserve, rather than meaningfully interrupt, his entitlement to a deportation proceeding. We conclude that Joshi's departure, absence, and return pursuant to permission for the express purpose of resuming his application for adjustment of status was \"unintended\" within the meaning of the regulation as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>interpreted according to the principles explained in <em>Fleuti, </em>374 U.S. 449, 83 S.Ct. 1804, 10 L.Ed.2d 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Joshi\u2019s absence was brief, as well. Under the Service\u2019s internal regulations, the adjustment applicant is required to return to the United States within two months of the date the advance authorization form is issued. INS Operations Instruction 212.5c, reproduced in Gordon &amp; Rosenfield, 4 <em>Immigration Law and Procedure </em>23-168.4, 231-71 (1983). Joshi complied with this requirement, returning from India after a six-week absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Joshi has satisfied all of the requirements of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.2(a)(3). His departure was unintended within the meaning of this regulation. His absence was brief when measured by INS Operations Instruction 212.5e. He was inspected pursuant to \u00a7 235, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225(a), and allowed to return to the country. Consequently, pursuant to the regulation, his application for adjustment of status should have been \u201cadjudicated without regard to the departure and absence.\u201d Joshi was entitled to have his application adjudicated in deportation proceedings before his authorized departure. By the terms of the regulation, he is still entitled to adjudication in deportation proceedings and to the ancillary relief available to those proceedings. The Board erred by sustaining adjudication in exclusionary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">We do not suggest that Joshi could not have been denied admission to the country upon his return from India in 1975 in an exclusion hearing. He was subject to inspection when he presented himself at the border. Notwithstanding the permission he had received to depart and return, if he had violated any immigration law or if he had misrepresented the purpose of his travel, he would not be entitled to the benefit of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.2(a)(3). Moreover, the Service could determine his entitlement in an exclusion hearing. <em>See Landon v. </em>Plasencia, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 321, 328-29, 74 L.Ed.2d 21 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">We are not persuaded by the Service\u2019s arguments, which were adopted by the Board, that the text of the permission granted Joshi in 1975 and subsequently promulgated regulations dictate a change in his status from an alien subject to deportation to an alien subject to exclusion. The 1975 permission was styled an \u201cadvance parole.\u201d It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-11\">Advance parole authorized for travel to India for business reasons. This authorization will permit you to resume your application for adjustment of status on your return to the United States. However, you will then be considered an applicant for entry and if your adjustment in expulsion proceedings, [sic]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">The Service contends that this document clearly notified Joshi that he would be considered a paroled alien and an applicant for entry. Joshi counters by arguing that the reference to \u201cexpulsion proceedings\u201d clearly indicates that he would be entitled to a deportation hearing if he passed inspection at the border. Dicta in <em>Leng May Ma v. Barber, </em>357 U.S. 185, 188, 78 S.Ct. 1072, 1074, 2 L.Ed.2d 1246 (1958), appears to support Joshi. There the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"adp-dedup-2\">Chapter 5 [of the Immigration and Nationality Act] concerns itself with aliens who have already entered the United States and are subject to \u201cexpulsion,\u201d as distinguished from \u201cexclusion,\u201d if they fall within certain \u201cgeneral classes of de-portable aliens.\u201d 66 Stat. 204, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251. Proceedings for expulsion under Chapter 5 are commonly referred to as \u201cdeportation proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-13\">Nevertheless, discussion of the printed form and the nomenclature adopted by the Service in granting permission pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.2(a)(3) need not long detain us. The form is unintelligible, and we believe the outcome of this appeal should not depend on what at best would be a labored interpretation of it. It is sufficient to note that the form did not notify Joshi that departure, travel, and return pursuant to the advance parole would result in the loss of entitlement to a deportation proceeding. Quite wisely, the Service revised the form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>in 1979 to delete the garbled language about entry and expulsion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Advance parole is not a statutory procedure. Nor is its use stipulated by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.2(a)(3) which speaks only of permission for the alien\u2019s absence. Advance parole is simply an administrative device that until 1978 had been regulated solely by INS operation instructions that used this nomenclature interchangeably with \u201cadvanced authorization.\u201d <em>See, e.g., </em>Operation Instruction 212.5c, reproduced in 4 Gordon &amp; Rosenfield, <em>Immigration Law and Procedure </em>23-168.4 (1983). In 1978, the Service promulgated 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 236.4 and 245.2(a)(1). These regulations provide that an adjustment applicant who is \u201can alien paroled under section 212(d)(5) of the Act\u201d may renew his application in an exclusion proceeding if he' satisfies certain requirements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">The difficulty with the Board\u2019s reliance on the 1978 regulations lies in the fact that the regulations pertain to \u201can alien paroled under section 212(d)(5) of the Act.\u201d But Joshi was never paroled under this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-15\">Section 212(d)(5) authorizes the Attorney General to parole into the United States temporarily aliens who arrive at the border seeking admission. The law was enacted to allow the applicant entry \u201cfor emergent reasons or for reasons deemed strictly in the public interest.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although the paroled alien is physically present in the United States, he is characterized as stopped at the gates. <em>See Kaplan </em>v. <em>Tod, </em>267 U.S. 228, 230, 45 S.Ct. 257, 257-258, 69 L.Ed. 585 (1925). Congress specifically provided that the parole \u201cshall not be regarded as an admission of the alien\u201d and when the parole is terminated, \u201chis case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other applicant for admission into the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b899-16\">Section 212(d)(5), however, does not address the consequences of departure and return of an alien in Joshi\u2019s situation. Jo-shi\u2019s admission to the country after his business trip was not for \u201cemergent reasons or for reasons deemed strictly in the public interest\u201d as specified by \u00a7 212(d)(5).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> His <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>advance parole was in reality a form of permission granted pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.2(a)(3) authorizing him to travel to India and upon his return to resume his application for a change of status. Even though the Service called this permission an advance parole, we believe its consequences should not be dictated by literal application of \u00a7 212(d)(5) which does not purport to deal with authorization for foreign travel or with readmittance to the country to resume prosecution of a pending motion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-19\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>The committee believes that the broader discretionary authority [in \u00a7 212(d)(5)] is necessary to permit the Attorney General to parole inadmissible aliens into the United States in emergency cases, such as the case of an alien who requires immediate medical attention before there has been an opportunity for an immigration officer to inspect him, and in cases where it is strictly in the public interest to have an inadmissible alien present in the United States, such as, for instance, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>witness or for purposes of prosecution. H.R. Rep. No. 1365, 82d Cong., 2d Sess. 52, <em>reprinted in </em>1952 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 1653, 1706.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">A realistic reading of the 1978 regulations, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 236.4 and 245.2(a)(1), is that the references to renewal of adjustment applications in exclusion proceedings by persons granted advance parole applies only to aliens who were previously in a \u00a7 212(d)(5) parole status or who have been granted advance parole prior to their initial entry into the United States.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This interpretation of the regulations is consistent with 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.2(a)(3) requiring the adjustment application be adjudicated \u201cwithout regard to the departure and absence\u201d if the alien is favorably readmitted to the United States. Thus, if an applicant was deportable before his authorized absence, he remains deportable after he passes inspection upon his return. If an applicant was excludable before the departure because he is a \u00a7 212(d)(5) parolee, he would continue in an excludable status after his return even if he is allowed to come into the country to resume his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">In sum, we conclude that an alien who seeks permission to travel and return to the United States pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.-2(a)(3) should be given the same consideration afforded similarly situated aliens who are favorably readmitted to the country after leaving without permission. In both instances, their applications for status adjustment should be adjudicated without regard to departure and absence. We therefore hold that when Joshi r\u00e9turned from his business trip and was readmitted to the United States after inspection, his application should have been adjudicated in deportation proceedings. This conclusion is consistent with 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.2(a)(3) which deals with the departure and return of aliens seeking an adjustment of status. It is consistent also with the principles that undergird the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rosenberg v. Fleuti, </em>374 U.S. 449, 83 S.Ct. 1804, 10 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">Joshi urges us to render a favorable decision on his substantive claims. We decline to do this. Our decision is limited solely to the procedural aspects of his case. We hold only that on remand his substantive claims, including his requests for discretionary relief, should be adjudicated in deportation proceedings and not in exclusion proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">The judgment of the district court is vacated, and this case is remanded for further judicial and administrative proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b896-19\">. While the exclusion proceedings were pending, Joshi was granted two more advance paroles for business and personal reasons. It is undisputed, however, that Joshi\u2019s status must be determined on the basis of his 1975 departure and return. His subsequent advance paroles simply referred to him as a respondent in the pending exclusion proceedings. For this reason, they are irrelevant to the determination of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b897-39\">.
