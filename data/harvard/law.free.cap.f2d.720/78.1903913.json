CCWD\u2019s application was supported by the Northern California Power Agency (NCPA), a joint enterprise of publicly-owned electric systems. NCPA procures electric power on behalf of its members and planned to purchase the power generated at the CCWD plant. On February 8, 1982, FERC granted CCWD a license somewhat narrower in scope than the one described in CCWD\u2019s application.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The construction and operation of CCWD\u2019s plant, as licensed, will have certain adverse impacts on a hydroelectric dam and powerhouses operated by Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG &amp; E) pursuant to prior license grants. In separate petitions consolidated for review PG &amp; E and CCWD present challenges to FERC\u2019s decision. For the reasons set out below we conclude that the Commission\u2019s action on CCWD\u2019s application reasonably accommodated two principal goals of the FPA: promoting the comprehensive development of waterways subject to federal jurisdiction, and encouraging private investment to effect that development. We therefore affirm the Commission\u2019s decision to grant a license to CCWD, subject to the terms and conditions FERC specified to protect PG &amp; E\u2019s legitimate interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-14\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b176-15\">The North Fork Stanislaus River flows southwestward from Lake Alpine and converges with the main stream of the Stanislaus River near Modesto, California. See map <em>infra </em>p. 82. PG &amp; E, under licenses granted by the Federal Power Commission (FERC\u2019s predecessor agency, hereafter not distinguished from FERC), currently operates three hydroelectric facilities in the vicinity of that junction. PG &amp; E maintains a dam and small reservoir at Spicer Meadow (north edge of the map) which is used to control water supplies to two powerplants\u2014 the Angels<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Murphys<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> powerhouses (shown in the southwest section of the map). PG &amp; E\u2019s third facility is the Stanis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>laus powerhouse<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (just east of the Murphys powerhouse) which draws on a different source of water.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">COWD's project,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as originally proposed to FERC, would have had three adverse impacts on PG &amp; E's existing operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">First, CCWD proposed to divert most of the water currently used at PG &amp; E's Angels and Murphys powerhouses to a new, CCWD-operated powerhouse at Collierville (situated between the Murphys and Stanislaus powerhouses, and shown in the southwest section of the map).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> CCWD asserted that it was prepared to compensate PG &amp; E for the power PG &amp; E would lose, but insisted that FERC had a statutory duty to license CCWD's new project to the full extent CCWD proposed. CCWD's projected diversion would increase the power generated from the water in question. Because CCWD's proposal was \"better adapted\" to developing the waterway, CCWD claimed FERC was obliged to accept it. For this argument CCWD relied principally on section 10(a) of the FPA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> PG &amp; E, on the other hand, maintained that FERC may authorize no encroachment on its licensed operations without PG &amp; E's consent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> PG &amp; E placed principal reliance on section 6 of the FPA.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-32\">Second, CCWD's project would somewhat raise the water level downstream of the Stanislaus powerhouse, and consequently reduce the power PG &amp; E could generate there by about 0.3% of the powerhouse's current output. Again, CCWD expressed a willingness to compensate PG &amp; E for the power lost; PG &amp; E adhered to the position that no adverse impact on its license could be authorized by FERO without PG &amp; E's consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-60\">Third, CCWD proposed to erect a new dam at Spicer Meadow that would substantially increase the size of the existing reservoir at that location, inundate PG &amp; E's Spicer Meadow dam, and destroy PG &amp; E's associated facilities and conduits. CCWD contended that a clause in PG &amp; E's license for the Spicer Meadow dam permitted FERC to authorize the erection of this new dam. PG &amp; E maintained that the clause in question permits only the raising of the old dam, not the erection of a new one.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-72\">In the license issued to CCWD, FERC resolved these three disputes as follows. First, PG &amp; E is to retain control of the water it currently uses at the Angels and Murphys powerhouses. Second, OCWD is permitted to raise the water level downstream of the Stanislaus powerhouse, but must compensate PG &amp; E for the power lost. The amount of compensation, and the forum for determining it, remain open questions. Third, subject to protection of PG &amp; E's interest in water now channeled to its powerhouses, CCWD is licensed to erect a new dam at Spicer Meadow.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The FPA was enacted to establish a systematic, orderly process for promoting the comprehensive development and full use of the nation\u2019s navigable waters. Congress\u2019 general statement of the FPA\u2019s purpose appears in section 10(a), which requires projects licensed by FERC to be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"acz-dedup-0\">best adapted to a comprehensive plan for improving or developing a waterway ... for the use or benefit of interstate or foreign commerce, for the improvement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>and utilization of water-power development, and for other beneficial public uses, including recreational purposes; and if necessary in order to secure such plan the Commission shall have authority to require the modification of any project and of the plans and specifications of the project works before approval.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">16 U.S.C. \u00a7 803(a).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">The FPA contemplates development through private investment. <em>Chemehuevi Tribe of Indians v. FPC, </em>420 U.S. 395, 407-08, 95 S.Ct. 1066, 1074, 43 L.Ed.2d 279 (1975). Prior to the FPA\u2019s enactment in 1919, licenses to develop hydroelectric power projects on navigable waterways were issued in one of two ways. The Secretary of the Interior could license projects pursuant to legislation enacted in 1901; these licenses were revocable at will. In contrast, individual acts of Congress were used to grant perpetual licenses for specific projects. Secure licenses were thus difficult to obtain; revocable licenses, though more readily available, were of little value to private investors. These conditions, Senator Walsh remarked during the Senate debates on the FPA, made legislation necessary. <em>See </em>59 Cong.Rec. 1,440 (1920). Accordingly, the FPA was designed to insure that the licenses granted by FERC promote secure licensee expectations.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-13\">To this end, section 6 specifies: Licenses under this subchapter shall be issued for a period not exceeding fifty years. Each such license shall be conditioned upon acceptance by the licensee of all of the terms and conditions of this chapter and such further conditions, if any, as the Commission shall prescribe in conformity with this chapter, which said terms and conditions and the acceptance thereof shall be expressed in said license, Licenses may be revoked only for the reasons and in the manner prescribed under the provisions of this chapter, and may be altered or surrendered only upon mutual agreement between the licensee and the Commission after thirty days\u2019 public notice,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AS9\">16 U.S.C. \u00a7 799. Correspondingly, the last clause of section 10(a) authorizes FERC to require licensee modifications only \u201cbefore approval.\u201d Related language restricting the <em>licensee\u2019s </em>power unilaterally to make changes in a licensed project appears in section 10(b).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A final indication of the Sixty-sixth Congress\u2019 strong concern that licensees receive reliable grants appears in FPA section 28, which purports to limit the power of future Congresses to amend the FPA in any way that would adversely affeet extant licenses.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Azz\">There is some tension between section 10\u2019s focus on comprehensive development, and section 6\u2019s emphasis on secure licenses, Secure licenses are likely to promote the development of new projects on previously undeveloped waterways. But to the extent FERC\u2019s power to alter or revoke licenses is narrowed, the replacement of small or anti-quated facilities by larger or more efficient ones may be impeded. Congress judged that on balance secure licenses for terms not exceedhig fifty years would more often further than obstruct comprehensive development.</p>\n<p id=\"Am4\">FERC\u2019s power to limit license agreements and to reserve the right to require future alterations enables the Commission to ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>cord section 6 the scope its terms indicate without unreasonably undermining the FPA\u2019s broader purpose set' out in section 10(a). FERC has discretion under section 6 to restrict license terms to any period not exceeding fifty years, and is also authorized by that section to impose additional license conditions at its discretion. FERC understands \u2014 and has not hesitated to exercise\u2014 this discretionary authority. In <em>Duke Power Co., </em>55 F.P.C. 677, 680 n. 8 (1976), for example, the license agreement expressly reserved the Commission\u2019s right to \u201cissue [a subsequent] license authorizing the construction, operation and maintenance of a hydroelectric project which will more completely utilize the water resources\u201d of the river in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">In the case at hand we are called upon to determine first, whether FERC has misconstrued the relevant sections of the FPA, and second, whether FERC\u2019s construction of PG &amp; E\u2019s Spicer Meadow license is correct. An agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute it administers is entitled to deference, <em>Zenith Radio Corp. v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 443, 450, 98 S.Ct. 2441, 2445, 57 L.Ed.2d 337 (1978), as is its construction of the license agreements it negotiates and oversees. <em>Cf. Andrew G. Nelson, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>355 U.S. 554, 558, 78 S.Ct. 496, 498, 2 L.Ed.2d 484 (1958); <em>Alabama Power Co. v. FERC, </em>584 F.2d 750, 753-54 (5th Cir.1978). <em>But cf. Harrison v. FERC, </em>567 F.2d 308, 310 (5th Cir.1978) (\u201cThe issue is one of document interpretation, a field where plain meaning controls, absent ambiguity or special usage.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">A. <em>Diversion of the Angels and Murphys water supplies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">FERC rejected CCWD\u2019s proposal to divert to CCWD\u2019s new Collierville powerhouse water now channeled to PG &amp; E\u2019s Murphys and Angels powerhouses. PG &amp; E' currently generates about 31,000 Megawatt-hours (Mwh) of energy per year using that water; CCWD would use it to generate about twice as much \u2014 65,850 Mwh per year. CCWD Initial Brief at 15. FERC urged CCWD and PG &amp; E to pursue negotiations on the matter,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but ruled that section 6, applied to the licenses held by PG &amp; E, prevented FERC from authorizing these diversions without PG &amp; E\u2019s consent.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> At oral argument PG &amp; E\u2019s counsel informed the court that negotiations have not abated.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>As a threshold matter, CCWD has not persuaded us that \u201clong established Commission precedents\u201d support its view that FERC must license the better adapted project even if it interferes with a prior license. CCWD Initial Brief at 41-43. In a prior decision FERC has, indeed, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAo\">The Commission\u2019s comprehensive licensing authority is not restricted by any rights of existing licensees to be free of encroachment from a new project where the Commission finds that the resulting totality of river development, giving full consideration to any negative effects of the encroachment, is most conducive to comprehensive development.... Where the record indicates that such an encroachment will significantly impair the operational value of the existing project, the Commission has included a provision in the new license requiring it to compensate the existing licensee for the loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtS\"><em>Susquehanna Power Co. &amp; Philadelphia Electric Power Co., </em>32 F.P.C. 826, 831 (1964) (footnotes omitted). The Commission reiterated this view in <em>Duke Power Co., </em>55 F.P.C. 677, 681 (1976). Neither of these cases, however, involved a non-consensual interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The quoted language from <em>Susquehanna </em>is pure dictum,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> as FERC itself tacitly acknowledged in that case. \u201cWe do not have any question here of compensation to [the prior licensee] for damages to its licensed operations by [the new project]; as conditioned as set forth above, there will be none.\u201d 32 F.P.C. at 832. In <em>Duke Power </em>FERC overruled a licensee\u2019s objection to a license agreement clause in which the Commission reserved the right to authorize future interference with the licensed project. Again, there was no question of a non-consensual encroachment on existing operations. At oral argument CCWD conceded that it could identify no prior case in which FERC had allowed a new license to encroach on an old one in circumstances where the old licensee did not tacitly or explicitly acquiesce in the encroachment or agree to a negotiated settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">On at least one prior occasion FERC has refused to license a project that would have substantially reduced water supplies to existing licensees. In <em>North Kern Water Storage District, </em>16 FERC \u00b6 61,082 (1981), FERC squarely addressed \u2014 and rejected \u2014 a new applicant\u2019s assertion that under section 10(a) the Commission is obliged to license a subsequent, \u201cbetter adapted\u201d project regardless of the adverse impact on a prior licensee. The Commission\u2019s decision with respect to the Angels-Murphys water dispute is entirely consistent with that precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">Turning from Commission precedent to the FPA itself, CCWD relies primarily on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>FPA section 10(a) to support its claim that FERC should have licensed CCWD\u2019s \u201cbetter adapted\u201d project in its entirety, without regard to the adverse impacts on PG &amp; E\u2019s existing licensed facilities. CCWD would derive from this provision a command that FERC reallocate water to a new applicant whenever the applicant demonstrates, as CCWD has, that it will make better use of the water than does the prior licensee. FERC, according to CCWD, has not only the authority, it has a statutory obligation to license the \u201cbetter adapted\u201d project regardless of adverse impact on prior licensees, subject only a requirement that those licensees receive adequate compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">We do not find in section 10(a) the firm directive CCWD urges. On the contrary, we cannot gainsay FERC\u2019s conclusion that, in the circumstances presented here, section 6 requires rejection of CCWD\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">CCWD overreads section 10(a) and diminishes the policy declared in section 6. Section 6 clearly states: \u201cLicenses may be revoked only for the reasons and in the manner prescribed under provisions of this chapter, and may be altered or surrendered only upon mutual agreement between the licensee and the Commission . ... \u201d This appears to dispose of CCWD\u2019s claim to the Angels-Murphys water. But CCWD reads section 6 only to prevent FERC from unilaterally imposing on a licensee additional, <em>affirmative </em>obligations not specified in the license agreement. <em>See </em>CCWD Initial Brief at 30, 32-33. This reading finds no support in the specific language of section 6 (which restricts revocation or surrender of a license as well as alteration), no support in other provisions of the Act (which are clearly designed to promote stable licensee expectations), and none in the legislative history.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Act\u2019s overarching purpose, all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>parties agree, is to promote the development of the nation\u2019s waterways. Congress determined that development should be financed largely by private investment, and sought to promote that investment by making licenses secure. Section 6 unmistakably reflects that policy.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">CCWD\u2019s counterarguments are insubstantial. CCWD concedes that the FPA attaches importance to secure licenses,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> but suggests that the purpose of section 6 is achieved equally well, and more consistently with the FPA\u2019s larger purpose, by a requirement that displaced licensees receive adequate compensation when a new, \u201cbetter adapted\u201d project is approved. This argument is unpersuasive. To potential investors, a right to wrangle in court over compensation is likely to be a less attractive drawing card than a hydroelectric project reasonably secure from regulatory interference. And no provision of the FPA sets up inter-licensee compensation as an alternative to the protections specified in section 6 against unilateral license revisions by FERC. Neither section 10(c), nor section 21, both cited by CCWD in support of its compensation theory, can reasonably be read to do so.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>CCWD insists, however, that the reading of section 6 we accept will gravely undermine section 10(a)\u2019s focus on projects \u201cbest adapted to a comprehensive plan for improving or developing a waterway.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Section 6, CCWD argues, should not be read to allow a prior licensee of a tiny project to \u201cveto\u201d a subsequent proposal to develop a much larger project in the same location.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The short answer to this argument is that the CCWD-PG &amp; E dispute over the Angels-Murphys water does not present that case.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> CCWD\u2019s project as licensed by FERC, without access to the Angels-Mur-phys water, has not suffered large diminution as a result of any PG &amp; E \u201cveto.\u201d The project can operate at about 90% of the originally-planned capacity: without the disputed water CCWD can generate about 494,000 Mwh of energy per year; with the water, about 560,000 Mwh. CCWD Initial Brief at 15. PG &amp; E is therefore in no position to exploit its status as prior licensee unreasonably to obstruct CCWD\u2019s larger proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">We need not decide whether section 6 affords leeway irrelevant to the present facts. We have earlier noted FERC\u2019s ability to write consent requirements into licenses at the time of issuance, and the United States\u2019 clear power to overcome the withholding of required consent by condemnation of the project under section 14 of the Act.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Nonetheless, it may be that the consent requirement of section 6 is subject to a \u201creasonableness\u201d safeguard against a licensee\u2019s arbitrary refusal to consent, when that refusal would substantially impair the interest of the licensor in effective use of water power.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> To dispose of the present case, it suffices to say that we decline to enter into assessments of reasonableness where lack of consent does not affect the viability of the subsequent project<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>B. <em>Impact on PG &amp; E\u2019s Stanislaus powerhouse</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">CCWD\u2019s project will raise the water level downstream of PG &amp; E\u2019s Stanislaus powerhouse by some sixteen feet, and thereby reduce power generated at that plant by about 0.3%. FERC estimates the resultant financial loss to PG &amp; E will be in the range of $14,400 to $52,800.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> J.A. 740. Notwithstanding PG &amp; E\u2019s refusal to consent, FERC judges the 0.3% impact on PG <em>&amp; </em>E\u2019s Stanislaus license to be permissible because it is so small. FERC leaves open the possibility of requiring CCWD to compensate PG &amp; E in an amount yet to be determined.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">PG &amp; E insists that section 6 does not contemplate even a \u201cde minimis\u201d exception \u2014 FERC simply may not approve a license that will have <em>any </em>adverse impact on one already issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">In our view PG &amp; E\u2019s interpretation of section 6 is not compelled by the language of that section, and is unnecessary to its purposes. PG &amp; E\u2019s interpretation would tilt the balance too far in favor of prior licensees, making it possible for PG &amp; E and similarly situated licensees to undermine, perhaps significantly, the FPA\u2019s broader objective of encouraging comprehensive development of the waterways.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">Section 6 states, without qualification, that licenses<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> \u201cmay be altered or surrendered only upon mutual agreement between the licensee and the Commission.\u201d But the operative term \u201caltered\u201d is not self-defining. It is safe to assume that any new hydroelectric project will have some impact on every other project on the same waterway or in the same geographical area. Water levels or flow rates upstream or downstream may change slightly, drainage into or out of the river may be affected, indeed rainfall in the area might change when a large reservoir is created or removed. Section 6, like most other statutory provisions, must incorporate some common sense limits.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Without seeking to define <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>those limits precisely, we are persuaded that an unconsented 0.3% reduction in generating capacity does not amount to a license \u201calteration\u201d prohibited by the explicit terms of section 6.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Section 6\u2019s goals are not eroded by this interpretation. Encouraging and protecting private investment in waterway development does not require FERC to disallow every conceivable adverse impact, no matter how slight, on existing licensees. Investor confidence can remain unshaken under a rule that allows the Commission to authorize de minimis interferences with the operation of an existing plant.

PG &amp; E argues that the terms of the Spicer Meadow dam license issued by the Commission to PG &amp; E in 1951 do not allow FERC to permit construction of a <em>new </em>dam. FERC disagrees. It approved CCWD\u2019s proposed dam, but protected PG &amp; E\u2019s interest in water currently channeled from the Spicer Meadow reservoir to PG &amp; E powerhouses by issuing CCWD\u2019s license \u201csubject to\u201d the provisions of Article 32 of PG &amp; E\u2019s Spicer Meadow dam license. J.A. 744.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">Article 32 provides, in pertinent part: In order that this project shall not unreasonably interfere with any other project or part thereof which may hereafter be developed ... the Commission expressly reserves the right at any time ... to grant another license ... authorizing [the new] applicant alone or jointly with the licensee for this project <em>to raise a dam or the dams of this licensed project and to increase the storage capacity of any or all of the reservoirs; </em>provided, that any such authorization shall require: (i) that the licensee for this project shall be adequately protected from or recompensed for any damage, temporary or permanent, which may be caused <em>by the raising of said dam or dams or by the construction of any other works or structures within the area of the project for which license is issued ... </em>(iv) the licensee for this project shall at all times have complete control over storage and release therefrom of any of its waters, <em>whether stored in reservoirs constructed at its own expense, constructed jointly with such other applicant or constructed at [the] expense of such other applicant; ... </em>provided that the licensee for this project shall be indemnified from liabilities and costs involved as in (i), (ii), and (iii) above and shall retain control of its water as in (iv) 'above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">10 F.P.C. at 1186 (emphasis supplied). PG &amp; E points to the first italicized phrase and argues that FERC thereby reserved the right to authorize only the \u201craising\u201d of existing dams, not the construction of an entirely new one. We think PG &amp; E\u2019s reading is crabbed. The three italicized sections of Article 32, sensibly read, indicate that FERC retained authority to permit enlargement of the Spicer Meadow reservoir \u201cto increase the storage capacity,\u201d by any appropriate means, means that could include but were not restricted to appropriating and raising PG &amp; E\u2019s existing dam.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">First, the language of Article 32 itself gives little support to PG <em>&amp; </em>E\u2019s narrow reading. The most obvious way to \u201cincrease the storage capacity\u201d of a reservoir, action authorized by the first italicized passage in Article 32, is to build a higher dam <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>downstream. PG &amp; E\u2019s argument would exclude this interpretation by implying the following bracketed word in that passage: \u201cto raise a dam or the dams of this licensed project and [thereby] to increase the storage capacity of any or all of the reservoirs.\u201d Such an interpretation renders the last portion of the passage superfluous.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> It is not readily compatible, moreover, with other portions of Article 32. Both of the other italicized passages, since they form part of a proviso, relate only to actions that increase storage capacity in the manner permitted by the principal provision. Thus, the second italicized passage, when it anticipates \u201cconstruction of any other works or structures within the area of the project for which [a new] license is issued,\u201d must have in mind works or structures for the purpose of increasing reservoir capacity; and the most likely of these is a dam downstream. Similarly, the third italicized passage\u2019s reference to \u201creservoirs ... constructed at [the] expense of [the new licensee],\u201d must allude to reservoirs that \u201cincrease the storage capacity of [the existing licensee\u2019s] reservoirs\u201d \u2014 and this most likely refers to a reservoir that inundates the existing licensee\u2019s present dam. Finally, the proviso that the existing licensee \u201cshall at all times have complete control over storage and release ... of any of its waters [whereever stored]\u201d hardly seems necessary if the increase of storage capacity is only to be achieved behind the existing licensee\u2019s own raised dam.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Elsewhere in the license agreement the parties reiterated their expectation that a subsequent increase in storage capacity effected by another licensee might be authorized, but made no reference to any limitation on the means that might be used to accomplish that purpose. FERC announced in the license its finding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"As7\"><em>[u]nder present circumstances and conditions ... </em>the project is best adapted to a comprehensive plan for the improvement and utilization of water-power development, and for other beneficial public purposes, including recreational purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">10 F.P.C. at 1184 (emphasis supplied). In Article 25, which deals with PG &amp; E\u2019s duty to clear the bottom of its reservoirs, the parties anticipate, in general terms, an \u201caddition to the reservoir storage capacity by others under a license issued by the Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1185. Finally, Article 30 of the license provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\"><em>In order not to interfere with future comprehensive development of the water power resources of the Stanislaus River watershed, </em>waters stored in project reservoirs shall not be released for use or permitted to be used in the development of power except in existing powerhouses and by existing installations, without the prior approval of the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-10\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">The body of the license agreement thus reflects the parties\u2019 understanding that FERC retained broad authority to permit future development at Spicer Meadow. In sum, we are convinced that Article 32\u2019s reference to the raising of PG &amp; E\u2019s existing dams was an alternative the license agreement specifically kept open <em>to facilitate </em>future development, not an exclusive means that the parties anticipated PG &amp; E might invoke to impede it.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> This squares precisely with FERC\u2019s interpretation of the license, an interpretation to which we owe deference. Accordingly, we hold that FERC retained the power to authorize CCWD\u2019s erection of a new dam, subject to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>requirement that PG &amp; E retain its present control<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> over water supplied to the Angels and Murphys powerhouses.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">III.

None in fact provided significant support for the proposition asserted in the quoted passage.

In P.U.D. No. 1 of Douglas County, Washington, 28 F.P.C. 128, 132 (1962), the Commission approved an encroachment on an existing government project. The encroachment was apparently not opposed by the affected agency. In P.U.D.

FERC\u2019s preliminary review indicated that there would be no \u201csubstantial alteration\u201d of PG &amp; E\u2019s existing projects, and the Commission therefore deferred further consideration of PG &amp; E\u2019s protest to future licensing proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b182-5\">. The Sixty-sixth Congress debated the FPA in the House between June 27 and July 1, 1919, and in the Senate, between December 6, 1919, and January 15, 1920. Those debates contain almost no discussion of the import of section 6. The House Report, H.R.Rep. No. 61, 66th Cong., 1st Sess. (1919), is equally uninformative. But one question that was heatedly debated, especially in the Senate, is revealing. The debate revolved around FPA sections 14 &amp; 15, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 807-08, which provide that at the expiration of a license term the United States may take over an existing project, renew the license, or license a new licensee. Many Senators were concerned that even at that stage the prior licensee might be able to veto any new licensee\u2019s application, thus securing an effectively perpetual license unless the United States itself chose to take over the works. The vigorous debate on the precise phrasing of section 15 to foreclose that possibility unambiguously reveals Congress\u2019 view that <em>prior </em>to the expiration of the new license the Commission would have no power to transfer authority to a new licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">CCWD would attach great significance to this exchange on the floor of the House in the early debates of the Sixty-sixth Congress:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">Mr. White of Maine.

There are many provisions in this bill giving the commission power to grant licenses to such applicants as will best develop the water powers of the region, and with such power granted to the commission it might be that they would grant a license to a lower builder of a dam, even though it might entail loss to the upper owner of a dam. Of course it would be subject to the payment of damages. I doubt, however, whether the commission would exercise such power to any considerable extent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-12\">Mr. White of Maine.

It is clear, in context, that Representative White was concerned about projects antedating the proposed legislation, not projects licensed by the new Commission after the legislation came into effect. His question was asked in connection with FPA section 4, dealing with the Commission\u2019s general power to issue licenses, not section 6, which places limitations on that power, and the entire tenor of this tentative exchange suggests that Representative Esch had in mind only the possible condemnation of pre-FPA fa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>cilities. Only in that light did Representative Esch\u2019s answers make sense \u2014 section 6 and the rest of the FPA offered no protection to unlicensed facilities developed before 1920; indeed, section 23(a), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 816, specifically provided that the FPA did not \u201cconfirm! ] or otherwise affect! 1 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 any authority heretofore given .... \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b183-7\">.

Accordingly, CCWD concludes, FPA section 6 does not govern the matter. CCWD Initial Brief at 33. FERC presents similar arguments with respect to the Stanislaus powerhouse dispute. <em>See infra </em>note 31. The Commission suggests that in granting a license it does not allocate or guarantee the continuation of water rights to licensees, <em>see </em>FPA section 27, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 821; therefore it may license diversion of waters except to the extent that the diversion would render a portion of the project works substantially inoperable. However accurate FERC\u2019s view may be in the context of water rights disputes between a licensee and another claimant asserting water rights not conferred by FERC, or between a licensee and the forces of nature ultimately responsible for the provision of water, it is plain that when FERC grants a license without appropriate reservation, FERC <em>does </em>undertake not to license other projects that will substantially alter the supply of water to the prior licensee without its consent. Section 6 would be virtually valueless if it protected only the bricks and mortar of a facility and a minimal level of operation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b183-8\">.

Even where matters proximately affecting the public interest are not at stake, courts sometimes find an implicit requirement of reasonableness in contractual provisions that subject one party\u2019s action to consent or agreement by the other. <em>See, e.g., Contra Costa County Flood Control &amp; Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, </em>512 F.2d 1094, 1097, 206 Ct.Cl. 413 (1975). Such an inference is at least no less appropriate in the interpretation of government licenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-14\">[Wjhen private rights of an indefeasible nature are sought to be derived from regulatory provisions ... the case is peculiarly one for the application of the universal rule that grants of special franchises and privileges are to be strictly construed in favor of the public right, and nothing is to be taken as granted concerning which any reasonable doubt may be raised.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-15\"><em>Louisville Bridge Co. v. United States, </em>242 U.S. 409, 417, 37 S.Ct. 158, 159, 61 L.Ed. 395 (1917).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b184-16\">. CCWD argues that PG &amp; E\u2019s consent to diversion of the Angels-Murphys water has, in any event, been granted. CCWD Initial Brief at 44-51. The Angels and Murphys project <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>licenses contain standard provisions in which FERC reserves the right to order future changes in operations \u201cin the interest of the fullest practicable conservation and utilization of such waters for power purposes and for other beneficial public uses ____\u201d Angels license Art. 5 (standard provision), 40 F.P.C. at 1448; Murphys license Art. 13, CCWD Initial Brief, Appendix C at 17. CCWD would read into these clauses, which largely repeat FPA section 10(a), PG &amp; E\u2019s advance consent to CCWD\u2019s project. In connection with another project FERC has construed these standard license conditions to permit the Commission only to order capacity additions by the licensee, not to license new encroaching projects. North Kern Water Storage Dist., 16 FERC j[ 61,082 (1981). Moreover, CCWD\u2019s argument here is untimely: CCWD concedes it failed to raise this issue in the Commission proceeding, <em>see </em>CCWD Initial Brief at 46 n. 1; we decline to consider it further in this review proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b185-11\">. PG &amp; E states that the loss will \u201ccost[ ] as much as $100,000 per year.\u201d Initial Brief of Petitioner PG &amp; E at 38-39 (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b185-12\">. In the Order accompanying the grant of CCWD\u2019s license, and in Article 59 of the license itself, FERC \u201creserve[d] the right to determine the appropriate compensation after notice and opportunity for hearing.\u201d J.A. 742, 754. In its Order Denying Rehearing FERC added: its \u201creservation ... will allow this Commission to determine what compensation we will require CCWD, as licensee, to provide to PG &amp; E. There may be some determinations of compensation on which the Commission may wish to defer to another forum.\u201d J.A. 965.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b185-16\">. The rigid reading of section 6 proposed by PG &amp; E would, for the future, simply invite a new boilerplate clause in every license agreement, a clause in which FERC reserved its right to permit minor encroachments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b185-17\">. We do not accept FERC\u2019s argument that in section 6, \u201calteration of a \u2018license\u2019 means a physical change in a facility.\u201d Brief for Respondent FERC at 14. FERC itself appears to reject that construction in the context of the dispute over the Angels-Murphys water supplies. We are of the view that when FERC issues a license covered by section 6 it tacitly undertakes not to issue other licenses that will significantly interfere with operations already licensed, whether the interference will adversely affect the prior licensee\u2019s physical plant, its \u201cproject works,\u201d or its supplies of water. <em>See supra </em>note 19. FERC does not guarantee water supplies, <em>see </em>FPA section 27, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 821, but that does not mean FERC remains free to reallocate the water supplies of licensed operations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b185-18\">. We note that FPA section 10(b), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 803(b), prohibits <em>licensees </em>from making \u201csubstantial\u201d alterations or additions to a project <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>without prior FERC approval. Congress plainly recognized that licensees must be given discretion to effect small changes in the course of day-to-day operations. But in drafting section 6, Congress apparently overlooked FERC\u2019s parallel need to allow de minimis encroachments on extant licenses that may result from other licensing decisions. The oversight is unsurprising; section 6\u2019s focus is on the direct threat of unilateral FERC or licensee decisions to modify an existing license or depart from its terms, not on the indirect encroachment of one license on another. <em>Cf. Alabama Power Co. v. FPC, </em>482 F.2d 1208, 1215 (5th Cir.1973); <em>Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v. FPC, </em>202 F.2d 190, 197-98 &amp; n. 3 (D.C.Cir.1952), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>347 U.S. 239, 74 S.Ct. 487, 98 L.Ed. 686 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">PG &amp; E points out that in connection with section 10(b) FERC has defined \u201csubstantial alteration\u201d to mean a \u201cdecrease in efficiency\u201d or a \u201cmaterial increase in cost.\u201d Initial Brief of Petitioner PG &amp; E at 36. PG &amp; E considers it significant that the raising of the water level downstream of its Stanislaus powerhouse meets that definition. <em>Id. </em>We do not find PG &amp; E\u2019s view persuasive. Though we hold that section 6 admits a de minimis exception similar to that expressly created by the \u201csubstantial alteration\u201d language of section 10(b), the purposes of the two sections are quite different; what has a minimal impact upon the one does not necessarily have only a minimal impact on the other. Section 6 is designed to promote stable financial expectations among investors; section 10, on the other hand, is immediately designed to assure, among other things, that the public obtains the generated power that marks the purpose of the license.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b186-7\">. If a loss of 2700 Mwh per year <em>were </em>a large fraction of PG &amp; E\u2019s Stanislaus powerhouse capacity, and PG &amp; E adamantly refused every reasonable offer of compensation for that loss, we would be forced to address the issue left open in Part A, above \u2014 we would have to decide whether a \u201csubstantial\u201d loss to PG &amp; E of 2700 Mwh per year could be allowed to block the 560,000 Mwh per year output of the CCWD project.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b186-10\">. We note in this regard that a sharp disagreement between CCWD and PG &amp; E on appropriate compensation with respect to the Angels and Murphys plants turned in part on their different estimates of future water supplies to the powerhouses in question. CCWD Initial Brief at 15 n. 1; J.A. 687.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b186-11\">. We do not suggest that an annual loss of tens of thousands of dollars is in all respects relevant to FPA administration \u201cinsubstantial.\u201d We emphasize only that in the context of a project generating revenues several hundred times as great, the risk at stake is not the type likely to influence decisions to invest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b186-12\">. We do not, however, adopt FERC\u2019s view that only \u201csubstantial alterations\u201d in a license engage section 6 protections, largely because that test, as FERC articulates it, seems entirely circular. FERC has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-13\">The term \u201csubstantial alteration\u201d has been used over the years to describe those instances when a proposed action which in some way would affect or interfere with a licensed project was considered to be of such a magnitude that it could require the alteration of an existing license, which pursuant to section 6 would require the consent of the existing licensee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-14\">Order Denying Rehearing, J.A. 965. Perhaps recognizing that this statement does not aid in delineating the type of license alterations that require section 6 consent, FERC continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1Q\">Even if we dispense with use of the term \u201csubstantial\u201d in conjunction with alterations</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>of license[s] covered by Section 6, we would still have to define what types of actions which in some way affect a licensed project require the \u201calteration\u201d of an existing license and thus invoke the protections of Section 6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AER\"><em>Id. </em>at 966. With this we agree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b187-9\">. PG &amp; E asserts that FERC does not have jurisdiction to set compensation. Initial Brief of Petitioner PG &amp; E at 28. FERC takes the position that it has jurisdiction to determine if it has jurisdiction, and urges us to withhold review of the entire compensation question until it has made at least that threshold determination. Brief for Respondent FERC at 48-49. NCPA (and, by implication, CCWD) dismisses this matter as \u201can insubstantial quarrel over the particular procedures by which PG &amp; E is entitled to obtain its remedy.\u201d Brief of the NCPA Intervenor, in Support of Respondent at 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-14\">On this point there is plainly no controversy yet ripe for review. <em>Cf. Cities of Anaheim &amp; Riverside v. FERC, </em>692 F.2d 773, 777-78 (D.C. Cir.1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b188-5\">. Interpreting the latter portion of the passage as authorizing inundation of the existing dam does <em>not </em>render the first portion of the passage superfluous. Specific authorization would reasonably be thought necessary to enable a third party to enter upon and modify the licensee\u2019s dam structure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b188-6\">. If the facts had been reversed \u2014 if the license agreement had contained no reference to raising PG &amp; E\u2019s dam, and CCWD had proposed to do so \u2014 we would undoubtedly hear the argument that FERC retained authority to license a new dam, but had no power to permit a subsequent licensee to take over PG &amp; E\u2019s existing structure. In the context of PG &amp; E\u2019s entire license agreement we believe that Article 32 mentioned raising the existing dam to foreclose any such argument by PG &amp; E, not to limit FERC\u2019s options when licensing a subsequent development.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b189-18\">. PG &amp; E suggests that its control can be adequately protected only if the new development is restricted to raising the old dam. This claim is both unsubstantiated and implausible. We see no reason why two large organizations like CCWD and PG &amp; E cannot, under FERC\u2019s supervision, arrive at an accommodation that will secure PG &amp; E\u2019s \u201ccontrol\u201d of its water while allowing CCWD to build and operate the new dam.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b189-27\">. In light of our reading of Article 32 we need not address FERC\u2019s further argument that it is authorized to license a new dam simply because raising the old one would be unsafe.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
