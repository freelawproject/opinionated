For reversal appellant argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress weapons seized during a warrantless search of his truck. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-4\">In June, 1982, a confidential informant told William Bertolani, a special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), that members of the Oakland, California, chapter of the Hell\u2019s Angels Motorcycle Club would be attending a motorcycle run in Colorado. The informant later told Bertolani that the club members would leave Oakland on August 9 and would be taking a \u201cside trip\u201d to Sturgis, South Dakota, to confront members of a rival motorcycle club. The informant warned Bertolani that there might be violence and that the Hell\u2019s Angels members would be armed. According to the informant, a nonfelon member known as \u201cLittle Mike\u201d would be transporting the weapons. The informant told Bertolani that he had learned this fact from his conversation with \u201cLittle Mike.\u201d In response to a question from Bertolani, the informant confirmed that \u201cLittle Mike\u201d was appellant. The informant further stated that \u201cLittle Mike\u201d would be driving a silver and black Scotsdale Chevrolet pickup truck, that for purposes of the trip the truck would be fitted with a camper, and that \u201cLittle Mike\u201d would leave a day ahead of the other club members. In the past the informant had provided law enforcement officials information leading to at least four arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">On the basis of the informant\u2019s tip, Berto-lani and other ATF agents began surveillance of appellant. One agent spotted a silver and black Scotsdale pickup truck in the vicinity of a Hell\u2019s Angels clubhouse and observed appellant near the truck. At that time the truck did not have a camper attached. On August 7 another agent observed the pickup truck with a camper attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-6\">On August 8, an agent advised Bertolani that appellant was driving the pickup truck out of the Oakland area. Shortly thereafter, another agent spotted the pickup truck travelling eastbound. At that time, Berto-lani and the other agents began organized surveillance. The agents observed appellant driving the pickup truck through California, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, and South Dakota. At various times during the trip, the agents lost sight of the truck and also observed that appellant drove erratically.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-8\">When appellant entered Custer, South Dakota, the agents began \u201cclose\u201d surveillance. Custer is near Sturgis, South Dakota, the site of the anticipated motorcycle club confrontation, and the agents had observed heavy motorcycle traffic in the area. Agent Bertolani followed appellant when he turned off a paved road onto a dirt road that led to a cluster of trees. According to his testimony at the suppression hearing, Bertolani decided to stop the vehicle at that point because he feared that appellant was close to the site where he would distribute the weapons and that the agents would lose sight of appellant. After stopping the truck, the agents searched the vehicle and seized several weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-9\">Law enforcement officials may make a warrantless search of a vehicle if they have probable cause to believe the vehicle contains contraband. <em>United States v. Ross, </em>456 U.S. 798, 799, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 2159, 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982). However, \u201c[t]he probable cause determination must be based on objective facts that could justify the issuance of a warrant by a magistrate and not merely on the subjective good faith of a [law enforcement] officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 808, 102 S.Ct. at 2164.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-10\">Appellant argued to the district court, as he does on appeal, that the informant\u2019s tip could not supply probable cause for the warrantless search of his truck. The district court rejected his assertion, finding that the tip met the two-pronged test set forth in <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969), and <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964). The district court found that the informant was reliable because in the past he had supplied information leading to several arrests. The district court further found that the tip that appellant would be transporting weapons was credible because the informant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>learned the information from appellant; the tip detailed the description of the vehicle, the date of departure, the purpose and destination of the trip; and virtually every detail of the informant\u2019s tip was corroborated by the agents\u2019 personal observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\">We agree with the district court that the informant\u2019s tip supported a probable cause determination. We note that the Supreme Court has recently abandoned the two-pronged test of <em>Spinelli </em>and <em>Aguilar </em>and substituted in its place a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d approach. <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). Under this standard, a magistrate \u201cis simply to make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances ..., including the \u2018veracity\u2019 and \u2018basis of knowledge\u2019 of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2332. In addition, the Court emphasized \u201cthe value of corroboration of details of an informant\u2019s tip by independent police work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2334.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1096-14\">. The Honorable Andrew W. Bogue, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the District of South Dakota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
