Appellants brought suit in Massachusetts against Boeing, the Washington-based maker of the airplane. The district court accepted a carefully detailed recommendation from the magistrate to dismiss the suit, on grounds of <em>forum non conven-iens, </em>provided that Boeing agree to appear as defendant in either Saudi Arabia or Pakistan, not to assert any statute of limitations defense other than those available if the case remained in Massachusetts, to make available witnesses and other evidence, and to pay any judgment rendered against it. The plaintiffs appeal this conditional dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-14\">This case is on all fours with <em>Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, </em>454 U.S. 235, 102 S.Ct. 252, 70 L.Ed.2d 419 (1981). There, the Supreme Court reiterated the doctrine it had set forth in <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, </em>330 U.S. 501, 67 S.Ct. 839, 91 L.Ed. 1055 (1947), and <em>Koster v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., </em>330 U.S. 518, 67 S.Ct. 828, 91 L.Ed. 1067 (1947), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-15\">when an alternative forum has jurisdiction to hear the case, and when trial in the chosen forum would \u2018establish ... oppressiveness and vexation to a defendant ... out of all proportion to plaintiff\u2019s convenience\u2019 or when the \u2018chosen forum [is] inappropriate because of considerations affecting the court\u2019s own administrative and legal problems,\u2019 the court may, in the exercise of its sound discretion, dismiss the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-16\"><em>Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, </em>454 U.S. at 241, 102 S.Ct. at 258. The <em>Piper </em>Court reiterated the list of \u201cprivate interest factors\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>\u201cpublic interest factors\u201d that a court is to weigh in deciding whether to apply the <em>forum non conveniens </em>doctrine. And, it stated explicitly that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW\"><em>forum non conveniens </em>determination is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. It may be reversed only when there has been a clear abuse of discretion; where the court has considered all relevant public and private interest factors, and where its balancing of these factors is reasonable, its decision deserves substantial deference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><em>Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, </em>454 U.S. at 257, 102 S.Ct. at 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The <em>Piper </em>Court found \u201creasonable\u201d a district court decision to dismiss a tort action brought by relatives of British citizens killed when their American-made airplane crashed in Scotland. The Court reversed a court of appeals determination that less favorable substantive law warranted keeping the plaintiff\u2019s case in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">We can find no material distinction between <em>Piper </em>and this case. As in <em>Piper, </em>the district court (and the magistrate) balanced the relevant factors. As in <em>Piper, </em>comparative witness and evidence availability, the place of the accident, the nationality of the victims, comparative judicial familiarity with the likely applicable law, all cut strongly in favor of trial abroad. As in <em>Piper, </em>the dismissal is conditioned upon the defendant facilitating that foreign trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The only difference appellants raise here consists of the fact that Pakistanian International Airlines has already paid to each of eighteen of the twenty-two plaintiffs 100,-000 Saudi riyals (approximately $30,000), known as the \u201cdiah\u201d or \u201cblood money,\u201d in \u201csettlement\u201d of their claim. This fact, according to appellants, means that this case presents what the <em>Piper </em>court called a \u201crare circumstance\u201d in which \u201cthe remedy offered by the other forum is clearly unsatisfactory,\u201d where the foreign forum is, therefore, not \u201can adequate alternative.\u201d <em>Piper Aircraft Co. </em>v. <em>Reyno, </em>454 U.S. at 254 n. 22, 102 S.Ct. at 265 n. 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">We disagree with appellants, for we believe that the difference to which they point does not alter the result. For one thing, the \u201cdiah\u201d payment is likely irrelevant to the choice of forums. There is strong reason to believe that a district court sitting in Massachusetts would have to apply foreign law, the same law that a Pakistani or Saudi Arabian court would apply, in determining the legal effect of the \u201cdiah\u201d settlements. <em>Pevoski </em>v. <em>Pevoski, </em>371 Mass. 358, 358 N.E.2d 416 (1976) (in tort cases Massachusetts generally follows doctrine of <em>lex loci </em>delicti); <em>Schulhof v. Northeast Cellulose, Inc., </em>545 F.Supp. 1200 (D.Mass.1982) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">More importantly, even if that were not so, the acceptance of this money, along with the consequent possibility that further claims are barred, is at most the sort of \u201cchange in the substantive\u201d law that the <em>Piper </em>Court held not to be determinative. <em>Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, </em>454 U.S. at 247-55, 102 S.Ct. at 261-65. The <em>Piper </em>Court explicitly considered the fact that the law of Scotland, unlike that of the United States, likely prevented reliance upon a \u201cstrict liability theory\u201d and provided for a \u201csmaller\u201d damages award. The Court held that such legal differences ordinarily should not \u201cbe given conclusive or even substantial weight in the <em>forum non conveniens </em>inquiry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247, 102 S.Ct. at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">This language suggests to us that the Supreme Court had in mind a narrow exception \u2014 an exception that, insofar as substantive law is concerned, would come into play where transfer to a foreign forum means application of a substantive law that is both different and basically unjust. Nothing to which plaintiff points suggests that such is the case in either Pakistan or Saudi Arabia. And, of course, if transfer means application of the same, or at least a reasonably fair, substantive law, then, the fact that the requirements of that law may have been fulfilled (say, by settlement) does not show the unavailability of either foreign remedy or forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">In sum, given <em>Piper, </em>we cannot say that the district court abused its powers in finding that the 100,000 riyal \u201cdiah\u201d did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>The judgment of the make the difference, district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
