Kent City School District, </em>539 F.Supp. 768 (N.D.Ohio 1981). It is sufficient to restate here that Thomas M. Rettig (Thomas) is a severely handicapped teen-age child. Thomas displays symptoms of autism and is also believed to be mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">In February of 1978 Thomas\u2019 parents requested a due process hearing pursuant to the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (EHCA or Act) 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401 <em>et seq., </em>questioning the quality of the education their son was receiving. A hearing was conducted before a Hearing Officer in accordance with \u00a7 1415(b)(2) of the Act. The Hearing Officer decided in favor of the Kent City School District and issued a comprehensive opinion on April 30, 1979. It was affirmed by the State Board of Education.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The initial complaint in this matter was filed in the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio on November 30, 1979. The complaint joined Thomas and his mother as parties plaintiff and named the Kent City School District as defendant. Plaintiffs, in the initial complaint, essentially petitioned for review of the state decision pursuant to 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(e)(2),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and also asserted violations of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794. An amended complaint incorporated additional allegations of constitutional infringements under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and joined, as defendants, the superintendent of the Kent City School District, the director of special education for the district, the State Board of Education of Ohio \u00e1nd the state superintendent of education.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">The lower court, subsequent to duly conducted hearings in August of 1980, denied plaintiffs\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction. The trial court issued its final order in May of 1981, subsequent to a trial of the case on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">The trial court upheld the administrative Hearing Officer\u2019s decision, concluding that: (a) the defendants had provided adequate inservice training for faculty and staff; (b) the defendants had devised and implemented a reasonable educational program for Thomas which would not be modified; (c) a twelve month educational program for Thomas was not required under the Act; and (d) continuous occupational therapy for Thomas was not a requirement of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">The lower court did, however, direct the Kent City School District to provide Thomas with one hour of extracurricular activities each week and further decreed that the State Board of Education amend its rules to conform with federal regulations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The lower court concluded, as a matter of fact, that plaintiffs had failed to prove their constitutional infringements. It also characterized the plaintiffs\u2019 claims arising under the Rehabilitation Act as merely restatements of EHCA charges and disposed of those charges by incorporating them into its resolution of the latter. Finally, the lower court declined to award attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-13\">The plaintiffs appealed the trial court\u2019s decision insisting that Thomas was being denied a free appropriate education. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Kent City School District cross-appealed from the lower court\u2019s order mandating the district to provide Thomas with one hour of extracurricular activities each week. The State revised its regulations in accordance with the lower court\u2019s order and did not appeal. <em>See </em>O.A.C. \u00a7 3301-51-02(6)(12)(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Initially, we conclude that the lower court\u2019s findings with respect to the constitutional claims are not clearly erroneous and we affirm the court\u2019s ruling as to those claims. This Court also agrees that, in this case, the plaintiffs\u2019 complaints purportedly arising under the Rehabilitation Act, with one exception, are resolved by the disposition of the EHCA claims. <em>See </em>34 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 104.33, 104.36 (1982). Accordingly, this Court is confronted with only those issues joined under the EHCA. In considering the asserted violations of the EHCA the Court is directed to the Supreme Court\u2019s recent explication of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">In <em>Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley, </em>458 U.S. 176, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982), the Supreme Court reviewed the policies, procedures and objectives of the Act. It also specifically identified and delimited a court\u2019s obligation in actions instituted pursuant to \u00a7 1415(e)(2). The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">[A] court\u2019s inquiry in suits brought under \u00a7 1415(e)(2) is two-fold. First, has the State complied with the procedures set forth in the Act? And second, is the individualized educational program developed through the Act\u2019s procedures reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits? If these requirements are met, the State has complied with the obligations imposed by Congress and the courts can require no more.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 206, 102 S.Ct. at 3051 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">Plaintiffs urge that both inquiries should be answered in the negative. In addressing the procedural requirements of the Act the plaintiffs assert that the State failed to develop adequate programs for inservice training of teachers and support personnel as directed by the EHCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">The EHCA specifically requires a State participating under the Act to submit a plan incorporating, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Auj\">a description of programs and procedures for (A) the development and implementation of a comprehensive system of personnel development which shall include the inservice training of general and special educational instructional and support personnel, -. ..</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">The district court found that the defendants had developed and implemented a wide range of inservice training programs which satisfied the requirements of the EHCA. That conclusion is supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">Plaintiffs have argued, however, that parents should be included within the meaning of \u201csupport personnel\u201d. and therefore the Kent City School District was obliged to provide inservice training to the parents of Thomas. The legislative history, however, discloses that Congress intended the term \u201csupport personnel\u201d to denote professional staff employed by the school system. The Senate Report, in discussing the Act\u2019s provision regarding inservice training, stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-13\">High quality educational services for all handicapped children will require a greater number of support personnel, as well as teachers. The supportive services should be provided by trained occupational therapists, speech therapists, psychologists, social workers and other appropriately trained personnel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">S.Rep. No. 94-168, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 34, <em>reprinted in </em>[1975] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News, 1425, 1457. Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 contention that \u201csupport personnel\u201d should include parents is unfounded and this Court concludes that defendants provided adequate inservice training under the terms of the EHCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-15\">The plaintiffs have challenged the quality of the educational program developed for Thomas in several respects. In sum, however, the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments merely reflect a difference of opinion as to the most effective teaching methods available to advance Thomas\u2019 education. Various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>experts testified as to an appropriate educational program for Thomas. The courts, however, are not free to choose between competing educational theories and impose that selection upon the school system. As the Supreme Court admonished in <em>Rowley, supra </em>at 207, 102 S.Ct. at 3051-52:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ajf-dedup-0\">In assuring that the requirements of the Act have been met, courts must be careful to avoid imposing their view of preferable educational methods upon the States. The primary responsibility for formulating the education to be accorded a handicapped child, and for choosing the educational method most suitable to the child\u2019s needs, was left by the Act to state and local educational agencies in cooperation with the parents or guardian of the child.. The Act expressly charges States with the responsibility of \u201cacquiring and disseminating to teachers and administrators of programs for handicapped children significant information derived from educational research, demonstration, and similar projects, and [of] adopting, where appropriate, promising educational practices and materials.\u201d \u00a7 1413(a)(3). In the face of such a clear statutory directive, it seems highly unlikely that Congress intended courts to overturn a State\u2019s choice of appropriate educational theories in a proceeding conducted pursuant to \u00a7 1415(e)(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">We previously have cautioned that courts lack the \u201cspecialized knowledge and experience\u201d necessary to resolve \u201cpersistent and difficult questions of educational policy.\u201d <em>San Antonio School District v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 1, 42 [93 S.Ct. 1278, 1301, 36 L.Ed.2d 16] (1973). We think that Congress shared that view when it passed the Act. As already demonstrated, Congress\u2019 intention was not that the Act displace the primacy of States in the field of education, but that States receive funds to assist them in extending their educational systems to the handicapped. Therefore, once a court determines that the requirements of the Act have been met, questions of method-olog are for resolution by the States,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqG8\">(footnotes omitted). This Court is of the opinion, therefore, that the lower court was correct in refusing to interfere with the State\u2019s implementation of its educational program as it related to Thomas. To the extent the plaintiffs\u2019 requested the trial court to order the school district to include specific programs within Thomas\u2019 curriculum \u2014 for example, summer classes and continuous occupational therapy \u2014 this Court affirms the district court\u2019s denial of such relief inasmuch as the programs were not necessary to permit Thomas to benefit from his instruction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">The trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in addressing the issue of Thomas\u2019 extracurricular activities. In granting this relief, the trial court relied on the following administrative regulation promulgated under the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-10\">\u00a7 300.306 Non-academic services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-11\">(a) Each public agency shall take steps to provide nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities in such manner as is necessary to afford handicapped children an equal opportunity for participation in those services and activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoS\">34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.306 (1982).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The regulation apparently adopts a standard designed to ensure that handicapped children are exposed to extracurricular activities on an equal basis with non-handicapped children.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">In <em>Rowley, </em>however, the Supreme Court specifically rejected a construction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>EHCA which required \u201cthat States maximize the potential of handicapped children \u2018commensurate with the opportunity provided to other children.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rowley, supra </em>at 189, 102 S.Ct. at 3042, <em>quoting, </em>483 F.Supp. 528 at 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The regulation and the lower court\u2019s opinion antedated the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Rowley. </em>This Court therefore deems it appropriate to remand this issue to the district court for further consideration in light of the pronouncements in <em>Rowley.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In accordance with this opinion, the judgment below is AFFIRMED in all respects except that portion requiring the school district to provide extracurricular activities to Thomas which is VACATED and REMANDED for further consideration.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Each party shall pay its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-8\">. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(e)(2) provides that any party aggrieved by the resolution of an administrative hearing under the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"atr-dedup-1\">shall have the right to bring a civil action with respect to the complaint presented pursuant to this section, which action may be brought in any State court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the United States without regard to the amount in controversy. In any action brought under this paragraph the court shall receive the records of the administrative proceedings, shall hear additional evidence at the request of a party, and, basing its decision on the preponderance of the evidence, shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b560-15\">. Federal regulations mandate a final disposition of all appeals from decisions of Hearing Officers within 30 days of issuance thereof. 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.512 (1982). The State rules permitted a 60-day interval.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b562-6\">. The lower court also ordered the School District to conduct a multi-factored evaluation of Thomas. The School District, in fact, had attempted to perform such an evaluation but his parents objected, charging that the basis of norm-referenced or standardized testing was inappropriate for autistic children. The evidence disclosed however that such testing was an. important component of an overall evaluation. It was, therefore, reasonable to require the parents of Thomas, as a condition to receiving benefits under the Act, to permit the school district to perform an evaluation of Thomas. <em>See, Vander Malle v. Ambach, </em>673 F.2d 49 (2nd Cir.1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b562-14\">. The regulation was initially promulgated by the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare and appeared at 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1210.306. However, the functions of the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare with respect to the Act were transferred to the Secretary of Education. Pub.L. No. 96-88 \u00a7 601, 93 Stat. 696. The regulation in issue, along with scores of others, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>was thereafter transferred to Title 34 and re-designated. 45 Fed.Reg. 77368 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b563-17\">. This last issue is the exception previously alluded to wherein application of the Rehabilitation Act could provide a resolution different from that achieved by application of the EHCA. <em>See </em>34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.37 (1982). The lower court is free to address this issue on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b563-18\">. <em>Amicus curiae </em>has briefed the issue of attorney fees.
