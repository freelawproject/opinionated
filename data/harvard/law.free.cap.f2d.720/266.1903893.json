It was during his twelfth hospitalization, after an involuntary commitment proceeding, that Rennie instituted the suit which gave rise to these proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The issue presented in this appeal involves the consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>tutional right of involuntarily committed mentally ill patients to refuse antipsychotic drugs administered against their will.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court recognized a constitutional right to refuse treatment. <em>Rennie v. Klein, </em>462 F.Supp. 1131 (D.N.J.1978) and 476 F.Supp. 1294 (D.N.J.1979). In doing so, however, the district court framed an injunction in which it embodied those requirements which the court deemed necessary to protect the liberty interest of involuntarily committed mental patients who refuse an-tipsychotic medication. Both parties appealed from the district court\u2019s order granting a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">On appeal, this court sitting in banc agreed that there existed a constitutional right to refuse treatment. <em>Rennie v. Klein, </em>653 F.2d 836 (3d Cir.1981) (in banc). Our opinion, while recognizing that \u201cthe patient has a constitutional right to be free from treatment that poses substantial risks to his well-being,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 844-45, also included in its constitutional standard a \u201cleast intrusive means\u201d analysis. <em>See </em>653 F.2d at 845-47. Thus, the in banc majority affirmed the district court\u2019s analysis, <em>see </em>462 F.Supp. at 1145-48, but then rejected the injunction imposed by that court and modified that injunction to incorporate the provisions of New Jersey\u2019s Administrative Bulletin 78-3, which was found to satisfy due process. 653 F.2d at 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">At about the same time that the <em>Rennie </em>proceedings were taking place, we were also called upon to determine the constitutional standards which governed the case of a mentally retarded patient who claimed the right to be free from undue bodily restraint, the right to personal security, the right to protection from attacks by other inmates, and the right to adequate treatment. <em>Romeo v. Youngberg, </em>644 F.2d 147 (3d Cir.1980) (in banc). <em>Romeo </em>involved a section 1983 action for damages in which the plaintiff claimed that as a mentally retarded inmate of Pennhurst, a state institution, his constitutional rights had been violated when he suffered, among other things, attacks on his person and physical restraints. Convening in banc, we found a Fourteenth Amendment liberty interest in freedom of movement, in personal security, and in habilitation, 644 F.2d at 164 \u2014 69, but we did not agree on the relevant standard to be used in determining whether plaintiff Romeo\u2019s rights had been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">The Supreme Court vacated the in banc majority judgment in <em>Romeo, </em>and adopted the standard announced by Chief Judge Seitz in his <em>Romeo </em>concurrence. <em>Youngberg v. Romeo, </em>457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982). The Supreme Court held that the standard for determining damage recovery for mentally retarded patients against doctors and other professionals turns on whether \u201cthe decision by the professional is such a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice, or standards as to demonstrate that the person responsible actually did not base the decision on such a judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 323, 102 S.Ct. at 2462 (footnote omitted). The Supreme Court thus declined to adopt a \u201cleast intrusive means\u201d analysis, and remanded both <em>Rennie, </em>458 U.S. 1119, 102 S.Ct. 3506, 73 L.Ed.2d 1381 (1982) and <em>Rogers v. Okin, </em>634 F.2d 650 (1st Cir.1980), <em>cert. granted, </em>451 U.S. 906, 101 S.Ct. 1972, 68 L.Ed.2d 293 (1981), <em>vacated and remanded sub nom. Mills v. Rogers, </em>457 U.S. 291, (1982) to their respective courts. <em>Mills </em>involved the same issue as <em>Rennie, </em>namely, the constitutionality of the forcible administration of antipsychotic drugs to involuntarily committed mental patients. <em>Rennie </em>was remanded specifically for reconsideration in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Youngberg.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">It is against the backdrop of both our <em>Romeo </em>and <em>Rennie </em>in banc decisions and the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Young-berg v. Romeo </em>that we have been called upon to reconsider our judgment in <em>Rennie v. Klein, </em>653 F.2d 836 (3d Cir.1981). Having re-examined that opinion and judgment, I believe that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Youngberg </em>does not require any change in the judgment which accompanied our earlier opinion, even though the analysis leading to that judgment does require amendment. The Supreme Court in <em>Youngberg </em>did not refer to a \u201cleast intrusive means\u201d analysis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, if we are to reconsider <em>Rennie </em>in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s teaching in <em>Youngberg, </em>we cannot employ the concept of \u201cleast intrusive means.\u201d In New Jersey, the standard by which Rennie, as a mentally ill patient who has been committed involuntarily to a state institution, see <em>State v. Krol, </em>68 N.J. 236, 344 A.2d 289 (1975), must have his constitutional right to refuse antipsychotic drugs measured, is whether the patient constitutes a danger to himself or to others.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because that evaluation must be the product of the medical authorities\u2019 professional judgment, such a judgment and the resulting decision to administer medication will be presumed valid unless it is shown to be a \u201csubstantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice or standards.\u201d <em>Youngberg, </em>457 U.S. at 323, 102 S.Ct. at 2462. One of the factors to be considered in the exercise of professional judgment- \u2014 albeit not a controlling or necessarily determinative factor \u2014 is whether and to what extent the patient will suffer harmful side effects. I believe that the professional judgment standard established by the Supreme Court in <em>Youngberg </em>sets the limits within which this factor must be assessed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">Because the record here is limited to a representative and a class of involuntary committees I, in turn, would restrict the holding in this case to only those mentally ill patients who constitute a danger to themselves or to others.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, I would hold only that antipsychotic drugs may be constitutionally administered to an involuntarily committed mentally ill patient whenever, in the exercise of professional judgment, such an action is deemed necessary to prevent the patient from endangering himself or others. Once that determination is made, professional judgment must also be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>exercised in the resulting decision to administer medication.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The elimination of the concept of \u201cleast intrusive means\u201d from this analysis does not, however, require that any change be made in the decree portion of our in banc opinion, which held that New Jersey procedures were adequate in implementing the rights of the mentally ill. Our. earlier judgment, even though incorrectly predicated on a \u201cleast intrusive means\u201d analysis, properly determined that New Jersey\u2019s regulations afforded sufficient due process protections with respect to forcibly medicating the mentally ill without the need for interposing external judicial requirements.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> By focusing on professional judgment, the exercise of which would include the considerations I have discussed, it is obvious that the New Jersey procedures provided in Administrative Bulletin 78-3 satisfy the due process requirements adopted by the Supreme Court in <em>Youngberg. </em>Thus, I would affirm our previous judgment but I would do so without reliance on any \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">I am aware that intervening events have occurred since the district court entered its judgment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> I am also aware that the district court\u2019s order that we modified involved not a permanent, but a preliminary, injunction. Recognizing these circumstances, I would remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with the principles discussed in both the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Youngberg v. Romeo </em>decision and the foregoing opinion in support of the judgment that I would affirm today.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-16\">.

The district court conditionally certified three sub-classes. For purposes of this proceeding, we are concerned only with the second subclass, which consists of all adult patients involuntarily committed to any of New Jersey\u2019s five state mental health facilities. <em>Rennie v. Klein, </em>653 F.2d 836, 839 (3d Cir.1981) (in banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b364-12\">. Since that time there has been extensive legal commentary treating this subject. <em>See, e.g., </em>Note, Beyond <em>Youngberg: </em>Protecting the Fundamental Rights of the Mentally Retarded, 51 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Fordham L.Rev. 1064 (1983); Comment, The Scope of the Involuntarily Committed Mental Patient\u2019s Right to Refuse Treatment with Psychotropic Drugs: An Analysis of the Least Restrictive Alternative Doctrine, 28 Villanova L.Rev. 101 (1983); Note, A Common Law Remedy for Forcible Medication of the Institutionalized Mentally Ill, 82 Colum.L.Rev. 1720 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\">. On appeal to this court Romeo attacked the district court\u2019s instructions to the jury. Our in banc opinion held, <em>inter alia, </em>that for a defendant to be free from liability, the defendant had to demonstrate that the restraints imposed were the \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d of handling the patient, and that the treatment selected was the \u201cleast intrusive treatment\u201d available under the circumstances. See, <em>e.g., Romeo v. Youngberg, </em>644 F.2d 147, 166-68, 172-73 (3d Cir.1980) (in banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b365-8\">. <em>See also </em>Administrative Bulletin 78-3, \u00a7 II(2)(b)(ii) (\u201c... whenever there is a significant possibility that the patient will harm himself or others before improvement of this condition is realized, if medication is not administered.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b365-13\">. The standard espoused by Judge Adams mandates, in my opinion, no materially different analysis than the standard advocated here. Judge Adams requires, as do I, that \u201c[t]he determination whether the patient poses a threat to himself or others ... precede[] even the contemplation of the forcible administration of antipsychotic drugs,\u201d typescript at 5, and both Judge Adams\u2019s standard and mine require the exercise of professional judgment prior to the administration of antipsychotic drugs. Typescript at 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b365-14\">. The Supreme Court in <em>Youngberg </em>expressly declined to deal with the issue of antipsychotic drugs because, as the separate opinions in our <em>Romeo </em>case pointed out, <em>see </em>644 F.2d 147, 173 n. 1 (Seitz, C.J., concurring); <em>id. </em>at 183-84 (Aldisert, J., concurring); and <em>id. </em>at 186 (Garth, J., concurring), the <em>Romeo </em>record did not present the problem of antipsychotic drugs and their forcible administration. <em>Youngberg, </em>457 U.S. at 319, 102 S.Ct. at 2460.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b366-6\">. The essential difference between the constitutional standard proposed by Chief Judge Seitz and that announced here is that Judge Seitz would leave it to the professional judgment of the medical authorities as to whether antipsy-chotic drugs could be forcibly administered to involuntarily committed patients even in the absence of a threshold determination that the patient was a danger to himself or others. The standard adopted here would preclude the forcible administration of such drugs unless the predicate determination was made that the patient was a danger either to himself or others.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b366-7\">. <em>See Rennie v. Klein, </em>653 F.2d at 848-54. Among other things, the procedures provide that, in the event a patient protests the administration of antipsychotic medication, the attending physician shall explain his reasons for prescribing the drugs and shall set forth the drugs\u2019 benefits and risks. \u00a7 11(B). The regulations limit the administration of antipsychotic drugs to three specific situations. \u00a7 11(2). In addition, the procedures establish a system of consultation with the patient, including encouraging the patient to seek outside advice from family and friends, review by other professional staff at the institution, and required meetings with a \u201ctreatment team\u201d if the patient still refuses such medication. The physician is also required to submit the entire case to the medical director, whose concurrence is required before commencement of the medication, \u00a7 11(B), (C), and the plan of medication must be reviewed weekly once begun. \u00a7 11(E)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">Although I find that the procedures specified in Administrative Bulletin 78-3 satisfy due process requirements under the constitutional standard announced in text above, I have not addressed nor approved any interpretation of the regulations which arguably might constitute a departure from that standard. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7 11(2). Inasmuch as no specific provision of the regulation has been challenged, that subject, if raised, should be left to the district court for its determination in the first instance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b366-14\">. For example, Judge Weis noted in the majority in banc opinion that the Mental Health Systems Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9401-9503 (1980), which includes a \u201cBill of Rights\u201d for mental health patients, was enacted subsequent to the district court\u2019s decision. In that regard, Judge Weis noted that the district court, having retained jurisdiction, may \u201cin its discretion consider the Mental Health Systems Act as relevant to the remaining proceedings.\u201d 653 F.2d at 852 n. 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b366-10\">ADAMS, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aji\">concurring in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">I have no doubt that the New Jersey regulations found in Administrative Bulletin 78-3 satisfy the due process requirements of the Constitution. I also agree that today\u2019s decision is controlled by <em>Youngberg v. Romeo, </em>457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982), <em>rev\u2019g Romeo </em>v. <em>Youngberg, </em>644 F.2d 147 (3d Cir. 1981) (in banc). I cannot, however, join in the limited professional judgment standard articulated by Judge Garth and, as the author of the least intrusive means standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>enunciated in <em>Romeo, </em>I believe it is incumbent upon me to write separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The issue before this Court continues to be the definition of the constitutional rights afforded the mentally ill and mentally retarded who are involuntarily institutionalized. In <em>Romeo, </em>we reversed the district court\u2019s holding that the only substantive restraints upon the states in this context were found in the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. We found instead that involuntarily institutionalized persons retain liberty and due process interests in minimally adequate care and treatment. This declaration of constitutional rights was specifically affirmed by the Supreme Court. <em>Youngberg, supra, </em>457 U.S. at 318-19, 102 S.Ct. at 2459-60. The Supreme Court, however, rejected the use of the least intrusive means test and endorsed the standard articulated by Chief Judge Seitz:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">The Constitution only requires that the courts make certain that professional judgment in fact was exercised. It is not appropriate for the courts to specify which of several professionally acceptable choices should have been made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-7\"><em>Id. (quoting Romeo </em>v. <em>Youngberg, </em>644 F.2d at 178 (Seitz, C.J., concurring)).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Had the Supreme Court not rejected the least intrusive means test in <em>Youngberg, </em>I would stand by that principle unreservedly. The treatment of those who have committed no crime and are institutionalized simply as a result of illness or incapacity has for too long been a blot on aspirations for a humane and just society. The Constitution does not tolerate \u201cwarehousing\u201d patients or recklessly placing them in physical constraints or on antipsychotic drugs for the administrative convenience of state institutions. This was the underlying concern in our <em>Romeo </em>opinion and, in my view, that concern survives the Supreme Court\u2019s reversal in <em>Youngberg.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">What does not appear to survive <em>Young-berg </em>is the least intrusive means test. Much as I agree with the sentiments expressed in Judge Weis\u2019s opinion, I do not believe that the difference between the effects of physical restraints and antipsychotic drugs suffices to preserve a higher constitutional standard for the administration of the latter. Whether the long-term effects of prolonged shackling are more or less pronounced than the effects of the short-term administration of drugs to combat a psychotic episode is not presently before this Court. Without such an empirical determination, I do not believe that a constitutional distinction can be drawn between the use of drugs and physical restraints. Thus, I believe that <em>Youngberg </em>must be read to control the forcible administration of antipsychotic drugs to involuntarily institutionalized persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">The Supreme Court\u2019s remand of this action specifically directed us to reevaluate our previous holding in light of <em>Youngberg. Rennie v. Klein, </em>458 U.S. 1119, 102 S.Ct. 3506, 73 L.Ed.2d 1381 (1982). Under <em>Youngberg, </em>a court must determine whether \u201cthe decision by the professional is such a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice, or standards as to demonstrate that the person responsible actually did not base the decision on such a judgment.\u201d 457 U.S. at 323, 102 S.Ct. at 2462 (footnote omitted). The key question on remand therefore is to give an operative meaning to the somewhat amorphous \u201cprofessional judgment\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">Our point of departure is the recognition of constitutional rights for the involuntarily institutionalized. A constitutional standard which provided no protection beyond that of the tort of medical malpractice would be inappropriate for the involuntarily institutionalized mentally ill. These patients are not in a position to \u201cshop around\u201d for a second opinion, to reject the treatment prescribed, or to insist upon their right to \u201cinformed consent.\u201d Because such patients are dependent on the state they must be granted a measure of protection beyond that afforded the average citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-13\">I therefore agree with Chief Judge Seitz that the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cprofessional judgment\u201d standard in <em>Youngberg </em>provides primarily a starting point for defining the constitutional rights at stake in this case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>The professional judgment of a physician acting with the power of state authority requires more than comparable professional decisions in a voluntary doctor-patient relationship. In the case of the forcible use of antipsychotic drugs, a state-employed physician must, at the very least, consider the side effects of the drugs, consult with other professionals and investigate other options available before that physician can be said to have discharged full professional judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Consequently, I take issue with the narrow holding of Judge Garth\u2019s opinion which would allow antipsychotic drugs to be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFP\">constitutionally administered to an involuntarily committed mentally ill patient whenever, in the exercise of professional judgment, such an action is deemed necessary to prevent the patient from endangering himself or others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">At 269. The determination whether the patient poses a threat to himself or others, to my mind, precedes even the contemplation of the forcible administration of antipsychotic drugs. Indeed, no citizen of New Jersey could be involuntarily institutionalized absent such a determination. Title 30:4-23 of the New Jersey Statutes defines \u201cmental illness\u201d as the existence of \u201cmental disease to such an extent that a person so afflicted requires care and treatment for his own welfare, or the welfare of others, or of the community.\u201d N.J.Stat. Ann. (1981). Such persons may be forcibly institutionalized under Title 30:4-27 only where there is a danger that the patient may injure himself or some other member of the public. <em>DiGiovanni v. Pessel, </em>104 N.J.Super. 550, 250 A.2d 756 (1969). <em>See also </em>1 Harper &amp; James, <em>Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 315 (1956) (\u201can officer or a citizen may take in custody an insane person when it is reasonably necessary to prevent threat of harm to himself or others\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">It therefore provides little protection for such citizens to allow the precondition for their involuntary institutionalization to suffice as the constitutional basis for the forcible administration of antipsychotic drugs. Accordingly, such a minimum determination would not appear to conform to the constitutional professional judgment standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Because the New Jersey regulations would satisfy any of the standards set forth in the various opinions, I concur in the result reached affirming the preliminary injunction and remanding this ease to the district court in light of <em>Romeo </em>as modified by <em>Youngberg </em>and today\u2019s opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">BECKER, Circuit Judge, joins in this concurrence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-6\">. I believe that this view is consistent with Chief Judge Seitz\u2019s concurrence: \u201c[t]he decision to administer drugs ... requires a consideration of whether there may be any harmful side effects to the patient and whether there are possible alternatives to the use of the drugs.\u201d At 274. Thus, this standard governs the necessarily difficult decisions made by professional staff members in the \u201chope of improving the patient\u2019s condition and returning him to his community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>273.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b368-10\">SEITZ, Chief Judge, concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">I agree with Judge Garth that persons who have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution have a qualified constitutional right to refuse antipsychotic medication. I also agree that the State of New Jersey has a countervailing interest in administering these drugs to an unwilling patient in certain circumstances, and that the procedures set forth in Administrative Bulletin 78-3 accommodate these various interests in a manner consistent with the Due Process Clause. I am writing, however, because of my different understanding of the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction that we reconsider this case in view of the Court\u2019s recent holding in <em>Youngberg v. Romeo, </em>457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">In <em>Youngberg, </em>the Court held that men- . tally retarded people who have been involuntarily committed have due process rights to be safe and free from bodily restraint, and that these rights are protected by a requirement that any infringement must be based on the \u201cprofessional judgment\u201d of the institution\u2019s staff. In my view, Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Garth\u2019s opinion does not sufficiently relate his analysis to this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">There can be no doubt that persons who have been involuntarily committed to institutions possess certain due process rights. Among these are \u201cliberty interests in safety and freedom from bodily restraint.\u201d <em>Youngberg, </em>457 U.S. at 319, 102 S.Ct. at 2460.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A related liberty interest, central to the present inquiry, is the right to refuse medical treatment, including antipsychotic drugs. These rights, however, are not absolute and must yield in certain circumstances to other, more important interests. The fact of legal, involuntary institutionalization is one such circumstance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Involuntary confinement represents a transfer from the patient to the State of the authority to make certain decisions affecting the patient\u2019s welfare. This transfer of authority is justified as an exercise of both the State\u2019s police power to protect society generally, and the State\u2019s parens patriae power to protect a citizen\u2019s interests when the citizen is incapable of protecting those interests himself. Although differences between these two powers may be clear in some instances, they are not readily distinguishable in the present circumstances. Even when the sole justification offered for a patient\u2019s confinement is that he is dangerous to himself or others, as in New Jersey, and not that he is incompetent, there is the inescapable fact that such confinement is a benefit to the patient as well as to society \u2014 a benefit which the patient is incapable of securing for himself. <em>But see </em>Developments, Civil Commitment of the Mentally Ill, 87 Harv.L.Rev. 1190 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The justification for the administration of the antipsychotic drugs is not unrelated to this question of the State\u2019s confinement of the patient. Where the State has removed the patient from society because he is dangerous, it is empowered to make additional decisions that affect his welfare. As explained above, the power to make these decisions is supported by the dual interests in society\u2019s and the patient\u2019s welfare. The State is not restricted to helping the patient only if he wishes to be helped. That limitation was overcome when the patient was confined. The State may therefore make decisions about different treatments that offer some hope of improving the patient\u2019s condition and returning him to his community.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">The issue before this Court is the constitutional standard which should apply to ensure a proper balance between the State\u2019s interests and the mental patient\u2019s due process rights in situations where the State wishes to administer antipsychotic drugs against the patient\u2019s wishes. In <em>Young-berg, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that the State may restrict a retarded person\u2019s interests in safety and freedom from bodily restraint, but only where such restrictions are the product of a \u201cprofessional judgment.\u201d 457 U.S. at 321, 102 S.Ct. at 2461. It is unclear whether the right to refuse antipsy-chotic drugs deserves greater protection than the rights at issue in <em>Youngberg. </em>Bodily restraints obviously impinge very directly on the patient\u2019s liberty, but they are also unlikely to have long-term effects. Health risks, on the other hand, may have irreversible consequences that are both immediate and long-term. Similarly, antipsy-chotic drugs may have dangerous and irreversible side effects in both the short and the long term. What is clear is that all of these practices present substantial threats to the due process rights of the patient. At the same time, they require that professional staff members make complex decisions based on many factors which they are in the best position to evaluate.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">It is my view that the standard adopted by the Supreme Court in <em>Youngberg </em>provides, at the very least, a starting point for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>accommodating the various interests involved in any decision to administer anti-psychotic drugs to an unwilling patient. I would therefore hold, more explicitly than Judge Garth has done, that the Due Process Clause at a minimum requires the authorities to administer antipsychotic drugs to an unwilling patient only where the decision is the product of the authorities\u2019 professional judgment. The decision of a professional staff person will be presumed valid unless it is shown to be a \u201csubstantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice or standards.\u201d <em>Youngberg, </em>457 U.S. at 323, 102 S.Ct. at 2462.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The decision whether to administer drugs is by its nature fact-specific. As a general matter, however, the physician must consider both the welfare of the patient and the interests of society as a whole. This requires a consideration of whether there may be any harmful side effects to the patient and whether there are possible alternatives to the use of the drugs. In addition, the physician\u2019s decision to use the drugs must be based on a contemporary judgment that the drugs either (1) are an appropriate part of the effort to treat the existing disorder that warrants the patient\u2019s continued confinement, or (2) must be administered in response to, or in anticipation of, the patient\u2019s violent outbreaks. Use of the drugs may not be justified purely on economic or administrative grounds, as part of an attempt to \u201cwarehouse\u201d the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The regulations in New Jersey Administrative Bulletin 78-3 satisfy these requirements imposed by the professional judgment standard. The procedures provide that the physician shall meet with the patient to explain \u201chis assessment of the patient\u2019s condition; his reasons for prescribing the medication; the benefits and risks of taking the medications; and the advantages and disadvantages of alternative courses of action.\u201d Ad.Bull. 78-3 \u00a7 11(B). In addition, the regulations require that the physician base his decision to administer the drugs on one of three alternative findings: (1) that the patient will harm himself or others without the drugs; (2) that the patient cannot improve without the drugs; or (3) that the patient can improve without the drugs, but only at a significantly slower rate. \u00a7 11(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">In addition, the regulations establish a system of review by other professional staff members at the institution. In order to administer antipsychotic drugs over the patient\u2019s protest, the physician is required to meet with the \u201ctreatment team\u201d to discuss the matter. He must also encourage the patient to discuss the proposed medication with relatives or friends. Finally, the physician must submit the entire case to the medical director, whose concurrence is required before commencement of the medication. \u00a7 11(B), (C). Afterwards, the plan of medication must be reviewed weekly. \u00a7 11(E)(2). All of these steps must be documented. \u00a7 11(E)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">I have no doubt that the New Jersey scheme for administering antipsychotic drugs to unwilling patients satisfies the due process requirements adopted by the Supreme Court in <em>Youngberg. </em>The scheme not only requires that the decision be the product of a professional judgment, but it specifies in some detail the particular type of professional judgment that must be exercised. In addition, the scheme imposes certain procedural requirements to ensure the appropriateness of the decision. Because the availability of the procedural protections is not an issue in this case, however, it is not necessary to decide whether such procedural protections are required under the Due Process Clause, or whether they are committed to the discretion of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Although I entertain a different understanding of the Supreme Court\u2019s direction that this court reconsider its judgment in view of <em>Youngberg, </em>I concur with Judge Garth\u2019s conclusion that the New Jersey regulations satisfy the requirements of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">WEIS, Circuit Judge, concurring, with whom A. LEON HIGGINBOTHAM, Jr. and SLOVITER, Circuit Judges, join.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">It is important to note at the outset that the court reaffirms its holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>involuntarily committed mentally ill patients have a constitutional right to refuse administration of antipsychotic drugs. On that point, all members of the court agree. I differ with Judge Garth\u2019s opinion only on the least intrusive means issue and, on that point, adhere to my former opinion. <em>See Rennie v. Klein, </em>653 F.2d 836, 838-854 (3d Cir.1981) <em>(in banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">It is regrettable that the remand has caused this court to retreat from the modest advance it made in applying the least intrusive means test to the long-term involuntary administration of these drugs. This rejection is particularly disheartening because it is based on <em>Youngberg </em>v. <em>Romeo, </em>457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982), where the Supreme Court found that the least intrusive standard was not relevant to the facts presented there, and the plaintiff conceded that it was not an issue. <em>Id. </em>at 313-14 n. 14, 102 S.Ct. at 2457 n. 14. The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion did not purport to govern the least intrusive means issue in the case at hand. I would take the Court at its word.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Even if <em>Romeo </em>rejected <em>sub silentio </em>the least intrusive test for the circumstances of that case, the decision would not, in my view, govern the standard for long-term forceable administration of antipsychotic drugs. In <em>Romeo, </em>the alleged constitutional violations were: first, the failure to provide for a resident\u2019s safety in terms of protecting him from his own violent acts and those of other inmates; second, the imposition of unreasonable bodily restraints \u2014 in that case, physical ones, such as shackles; and finally, the failure to provide minimal \u201cha-bilitation\u201d or training related to safety and freedom from restraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">In measuring the state\u2019s obligations in the context of the safety and restraint issues, the Supreme Court approved Chief Judge Seitz\u2019s standard that \u201cthe courts [are to] make certain that professional judgment in fact was exercised. It is not appropriate for the courts to specify which of several professionally acceptable choices should have been made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321, 102 S.Ct. at 2461.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">The majority reads into the Supreme Court\u2019s remand an implicit disapproval of the least intrusive means test in the circumstances present here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I do not detect any such message. Moreover, because of the substantial factual differences, I do not agree with the application of <em>Romeo </em>to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">Most significantly, the restraints at issue in <em>Romeo </em>were not measures bearing potentially permanent effects that would be physically or mentally crippling. If physical means such as straight) ackets or hand \u201cmuffs\u201d are used, the restraint can be removed without any permanent after-effects.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An erroneous decision on these restraints, therefore, can be corrected and, although past discomfort and frustration might not be undone, the effects do not continue into the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-14\">By contrast, the long-term administration of antipsychotic drugs may result in permanent physical and mental impairment. As our earlier opinion noted, all antipsychotic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>drugs affect the central nervous system and induce a variety of side effects. 653 F.2d at 843. Minor physical effects include blurred vision, constipation or diarrhea, palpitations, skin rashes, low blood pressure, faintness, and fatigue. Some patients experience akinesia \u2014 a state of diminished spontaneity, physical weakness, and muscle fatigue; others suffer akathesia, which is marked by a subjective state and an inability to be still.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Although these conditions usually diminish, antipsychotic drugs can also induce a permanent disorder known as tardive dys-kinesia. It is \u201ccharacterized by rhythmical, repetitive, involuntary movements of the tongue, face, mouth, or jaw, sometimes accompanied by other bizarre muscular activity.\u201d <em>Rennie v. Klein, </em>462 F.Supp. 1131, 1138 (D.N.J.1978). In addition, the effects on the patient\u2019s condition may not be limited to those produced directly by the drugs, For example, one patient\u2019s diet is now restricted to ground food because the involuntary jaw movements resulting from tardive dyskinesia were so severe that she could not be fitted with dentures.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Unlike the temporary and predictable effects of bodily restraints, the permanent side effects of antipsychotic drugs induce conditions that cannot be corrected simply by cessation of the regimen. The permanency of these effects is analogous to that resulting from such radical surgical procedures as a pre-frontal lobotomy. The consequences of error are far more serious in the drug cases than those of Romeo\u2019s physical restraints, and therefore, a standard commensurate with the potential harm to the patient is required.</p>\n<p id=\"ada-dedup-0\">The maj0rity holds that the drugs may be constitutionally administered if the decision js made as a result of a \u201cprofessional judgment\u201d by the institution staff. Although one 0f the elements to be weighed is the side effects the patient will suffer, the majority apparently regards this factor as having no greater weight that any other consideration. I fear that the latitude the majority allows in \u201cprofessional judgment\u201d jeopardizes adequate protection of a patient\u2019s constitutional rights,</p>\n<p id=\"aed-dedup-0\">ln my view, it is not enough to rely on a \u201cprofessional judgment\u201d unless it includes an evaluation aimed at the least intrusive means \u2014 a cost-benefit analysis viewed from the patient\u2019s perspective. A \u201cprofessional judgment\u201d based primarily on administrative convenience or the purely economic interest of the state does not pass muster.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If less intrusive means to accomplish the state\u2019s legitimate objectives are available and feasible, then administrative and financial concerns are simply not significant enough to justify a patient\u2019s exposure to the serious risks accompanying use of these drugs. For this reason, the standard approved in the circumstances of <em>Romeo </em>has serious deficiencies when transferred to <em>Rennie\u2019s </em>situation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AfmE\">Although the majority and I diverge on the applicability of the least intrusive means doctrine, it should be apparent that in application our difference is primarily one of emphasis. To me, the least intrusive doctrine directs that professionals give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>greater consideration to the potential danger to the patient than to the state\u2019s administrative convenience or economic benefits. Since the majority incorporates harm to the patient as one of the elements of the \u201cprofessional judgment,\u201d it may be that in most cases the outcome would be the same under both tests. Although the difference in standards may be only one of degree, it is nevertheless an important one.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In adhering to the least intrusive test, I have not overlooked the Supreme Court\u2019s emphasis in <em>Romeo </em>that courts show deference to the judgment exercised by a qualified professional, so as to minimize judicial interference with the functioning of the institution. As noted earlier, the consequences of errors in <em>Romeo's </em>context are not as severe as those present here. Nevertheless, some deference to professional decisions is not inconsistent with our holding on procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">I agree with the court\u2019s holding that the administrative procedures designed by New Jersey, which consist of review by professionals in the mental health field, are adequate to protect the patient\u2019s constitutional rights. Introduction of the least intrusive means standard into these procedures does not supplant professional judgment; it merely adds an important factor to the analysis underlying that judgment. The least intrusive test does not constitute undue interference with professional judgment, and is surely defensible to the extent it mandates serious and deliberate consideration of the patient\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Moreover, the least intrusive means standard does not mandate that the state forfeit its interests or leave them unfulfilled. It simply requires a carefully considered choice. That burden is certainly minimal when compared to the potential consequences to the patient. As the Supreme Court has stated, \u201cThe individual should not be asked to share equally with society the risk of error when the possible injury to the individual is significantly greater than any possible harm to the state.\u201d <em>Addington v. </em>Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 427, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 1810, 60 L.Ed.2d 323 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">One other factor mentioned in <em>Romeo </em>\u2014the financial constraints under which state institutions necessarily operate \u2014 merits some brief comment. That consideration was mentioned in our earlier opinion as one reason why the simplified administrative procedure we approved was more acceptable than the elaborate plan devised by the district court. <em>See </em>653 F.2d at 851. I recognize the very serious financial problems of state institutions, but I do not believe that they militate against use of the least intrusive means test. To the contrary, the realization that state institutions are understaffed, underfinanced, and overcrowded only underscores my concern that the staff may undervalue or overlook the patient\u2019s interest. Concern for the rights of the patient must not be sacrificed for the convenience of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">It is worth remembering that patients at these mental institutions are unwilling wards of the state. They have done nothing to merit anything but consideration and compassion. It surely is not asking too much of the state to require it to balance its legitimate needs with a regimen that infringes on the patient\u2019s constitutional rights to the least intrusive extent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b369-8\">.
