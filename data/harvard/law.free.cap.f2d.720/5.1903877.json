His sole claim on this appeal is that the statute is contrary to international law and his conviction invalid because the United States lacks jurisdiction to prosecute one of its citizens for a drug offense committed outside the territory of the United States \u2014 on a foreign vessel on the high seas. There was no evidence that the drugs were to be distributed within the United States or that the crime would have any other effect within the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-20\">The short and conclusive answer to appellant\u2019s claim lies in authoritative statements of international law and in authoritative opinions of the Supreme Court that run directly contrary to his argument. The <em>Restatement of Foreign Relations Law </em>says that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-21\">[a] state has jurisdiction to prescribe a rule of law ... attaching legal consequences to conduct of a national of the state wherever the conduct occurs....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-22\"><em>Restatement (Second) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States </em>\u00a7 30 (1965). In <em>Skiriotes v. Florida, </em>313 U.S. 69, 61 S.Ct. 924, 85 L.Ed. 1193 (1941), the Supreme Court wrote that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 73, 61 S.Ct. at 927; <em>accord Blackmer v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 421, 436-37, 52 S.Ct. 252, 254-55, 76 L.Ed. 375 (1932); <em>United States v. Bowman, </em>260 U.S. 94, 43 S.Ct. 39, 67 L.Ed. 149 (1922); <em>The Hamilton, </em>207 U.S. 398, 403, 28 S.Ct. 133, 134, 52 L.Ed. 264 (1907); <em>The Apollon, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 362, 370, 6 L.Ed. 111 (1824); <em>Rose v. Himely, </em>8 U.S. (4 Cranch) 241, 279, 2 L.Ed. 608 (1808); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>680 F.2d 255, 257 (1st Cir.1982), <em>cert. </em>denied, \u2014U.S.\u2014, 103 S.Ct. 738, 74 L.Ed.2d 960 (1983); <em>see also </em>I. Brownlie, <em>Principles of Public International Law </em>303 (3rd ed. 1979); 1 L. Oppenheim, <em>International Law </em>\u00a7 145 (H. Lauterpacht 8th ed. 10th impression 1974). In the absence of significant authority to the contrary, appellant\u2019s argument \u2014 that the facts of these cases suggest alternative bases of jurisdiction \u2014 does not warrant departing from the principle that the Supreme Court has so clearly articulated.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-23\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>[t]he United States is not debarred by any rule of international law from governing the conduct of its own citizens upon the high seas or even in foreign countries when the rights of other nations or their nationals are not infringed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>The judgment of the district court is <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
