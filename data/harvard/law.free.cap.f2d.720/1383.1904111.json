(Commonwealth) (settling EEOC charges of hiring and promotion discrimination against women and Puerto Ricans at Commonwealth\u2019s Peneulas, Puerto Rico, facilities), Commonwealth filed suit in federal district court for attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 706(k) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k) (1976), asserting that it was the prevailing party and that the EEOC\u2019s suit was brought in bad faith. The district court determined that there was no genuine issue of material fact and granted the EEOC\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We find that the district court erred in granting summary judgment without holding a full hearing to resolve the issues presented by Commonwealth\u2019s claim: whether the defendant Commonwealth \u201cprevailed\u201d and if so, whether the EEOC acted in bad faith and/or pressed frivolous claims. Therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1384\">*1384</page-number>we remand for an evidentiary hearing and findings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-4\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1480-5\">In February 1975, an EEOC charge was filed against Commonwealth alleging that the company was violating Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>by discriminating against women and Puerto Ricans with respect to hiring, promotion and compensation at its Peneulas, Puerto Rico, petrochemical complex. An investigation followed and in February 1977 the EEOC issued a decision finding reasonable cause to believe specific portions of the charge true. Ensuing conciliation efforts, though complicated by Commonwealth\u2019s intervening insolvency and Chapter XI reorganization proceeding,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ultimately led to a conciliation agreement. A consent decree was entered by the parties and approved by the bankruptcy court in January 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-6\">The consent decree set out procedures whereby Commonwealth was to publicize equal employment policies and programs, and provided for monitoring its compliance. Commonwealth agreed to increase the representation of Puerto Ricans and women in entry level positions in six different operational departments, and to contact local Puerto Rican colleges and referral agencies in its future recruitment efforts. The decree also instituted procedures to identify, and even counsel and train, current female employees for promotion into certain \u201ctarget area jobs.\u201d Commonwealth agreed to budget $50,000 a year to fund these efforts. In addition, the consent decree provided relief for all identifiable women and Puerto Ricans against whom Commonwealth had discriminated in hiring or promotion between February 1973 and the date of the decree. The decree provided that a Special Master, empowered to award back wages and preferential seniority and order preferential hiring or promotion, would hear all cases that the parties could not resolve through informal conciliation efforts. A fund of one million dollars was established to satisfy any potential liability on these past claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-7\">Commonwealth\u2019s reorganization efforts proved successful, and in June 1981 a plan of arrangement was approved by the bankruptcy court. Subsequently, the company brought this action in federal district court seeking attorney\u2019s fees against the EEOC pursuant to \u00a7 706(k) of Title VII alleging that (a) it had prevailed against the EEOC in the proceedings initiated by the 1975 charge, and (b) that the EEOC had proceeded \u201cin bad faith and with no reasonable belief in the merits of the factual and legal positions it espoused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-8\">Commonwealth\u2019s Amended Complaint asserted three separate \u201cclaims for relief\u201d on which it purportedly prevailed. The first advanced two theories to conclude that Commonwealth had been the prevailing party under the consent decree: (a) that the decree contained \u201cno remedy or relief for many of the more substantial discriminatory practices [that had been originally] alleged in the [EEOC\u2019s original charge and subsequent determination]\u201d; and (b) that the decree ultimately entered by the parties afforded less relief than had been offered by Commonwealth to the EEOC in earlier conciliation negotiations. The second asserted that Commonwealth was a prevailing party in its successful effort (before entry of the consent decree) to defeat the EEOC\u2019s attempt to evade Chapter XI\u2019s automatic stay provision, Bkrptcy. R. ll-44(a), which barred the EEOC from commencing a Title VII suit in district court. The third asserted that Commonwealth had been a prevailing party because 77 of the 109 names initially identified as likely victims of past discrimination under the provisions of the consent decree were ultimately withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-9\">Commonwealth sought $525,000 in fees plus the costs and fees incurred in bringing the fee action itself. The EEOC filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative for summary judgment, and Commonwealth filed a cross motion for summary judgment. The district court concluded that no genuine issues of material fact existed, denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1385\">*1385</page-number>Commonwealth\u2019s motion, and granted that of the EEOC. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-5\">On appeal, Commonwealth asserts that it prevailed against the EEOC on claims advanced by the EEOC which were either frivolous or undertaken in bad faith and is therefore entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 706(k) of Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-6\">II. <em>The \u201cPrevailing Party\u201d Test Applied to Defendants</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ampg\">Section 706(k) of Title VII provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1481-7\">In any action or proceeding under this subchapter the court, in its discretion, may allow <em>the prevailing party, </em>other than the Commission or the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs, and the Commission and the United States shall be liable for costs as a private person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1481-8\">(Emphasis added). As is well known, Supreme Court decisions, most notably <em>Chris-tiansburg Garment Co. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, </em>434 U.S. 412, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978), have grafted onto the \u201cpermissive and discretionary language of the statute,\u201d <em>Chris-tiansburg, </em>434 U.S. at 418, 98 S.Ct. at 699, further requirements for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees which differ radically depending on whether the party deemed \u201cprevailing\u201d is plaintiff or defendant. Prevailing civil rights plaintiffs are to recover fees \u201cin all but special circumstances,\u201d 434 U.S. at 417, 98 S.Ct. at 698, citing <em>Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, </em>422 U.S. 405, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975). . Prevailing defendants may recover only upon a finding that the plaintiff\u2019s claim is frivolous, unreasonable, groundless, made in bad faith, or persisted in after its character as one of these has become clear. 434 U.S. at 421, 98 S.Ct. at 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-11\">Both decisional authority and the unequivocal language of \u00a7 706(k) itself, however, require a plaintiff, equally with a defendant, to demonstrate that he is the \u201cprevailing party\u201d as a threshold for recovery of attorney\u2019s fees. Our Court\u2019s test of status as \u201cprevailing party\u201d in civil rights cases, laid down early and reaffirmed in case after case, declares: \u201cThe proper focus is whether the plaintiff has been successful on <em>the central issue </em>... as exhibited by the fact that he has acquired <em>the primary relief sought.\u201d Iranian Students Ass\u2019n v. Edwards, </em>604 F.2d 352, 353 (5th Cir.1979) (Goldberg, J.) (emphasis added). <em>See also Taylor v. Sterrett, </em>640 F.2d 663, 669 (5th Cir.1981) (identical language, citing <em>Edwards); Coen v. Harrison County School Bd., </em>638 F.2d 24, 26 (5th Cir.1981) (identical language, citing <em>Edwards </em>and other cases).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have applied this' test of \u201cprevailing party\u201d status equally to both plaintiffs and defendants. <em>See EEOC </em>v. <em>Kimbrough Investment Co., </em>703 F.2d 98, 103 (5th Cir.1983) (awarding costs to employer as prevailing party but denying attorney\u2019s fees under <em>Christiansburg; United States v. Allegheny-Ludlum Industries, </em>558 F.2d 742, 743 (5th Cir.1977) (withdrawn in part, 568 F.2d 1073, 1074 (5th Cir.1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-12\">While it may not easily lend itself to further articulation, this single test provides a commonsense, practical yardstick of success. In many if not most lawsuits, whether tried or settled,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it is possible to compare the allegations made with the results obtained and pick out a winner: a plaintiff who carried the day on his major <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1386\">*1386</page-number>claim, a defendant who defeated the major thrust of the suit. In other cases it may be that neither party could fairly be said to have carried the day, and in such event there should be no fee award to either.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-4\">Thus, the district court below was required by Section 706(k) and case precedent to weigh the claims for relief advanced by the EEOC against the results obtained by it to determine whether Commonwealth was the prevailing party as the initial step in determining whether Commonwealth was entitled to a fee award. As the next step, it was required to determine whether the claims advanced by the EEOC were frivolous, vexatious or brought to harass Commonwealth.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, the order issued by the trial court granting summary judgment for the EEOC sets forth no grounds for its decision, nor were any opinion, findings, or conclusions of law separately filed. This leaves both this Court and the parties in limbo. Indeed, on appeal Commonwealth argues that the trial court\u2019s decision was based on the notion that the res judicata effects of the consent decree barred Commonwealth\u2019s claim. Both the undeveloped state of the record and our restricted role as an appellate court prevent us from divining the several grounds on which the district court may have based its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-5\">Because of the lack of clarity in the district court\u2019s order, and because of the lack of express findings on whether Commonwealth prevailed or whether it is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under <em>Christiansburg, </em>we remand for an evidentiary hearing on these issues. <em>See Neidhardt v. D.H. Holmes Co. Ltd., </em>701 F.2d 553 (5th Cir.1983) (remanding for determination of defendant\u2019s entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 706(k) where basis for denial unclear).

As the Supreme Court indicated in passing in a recent decision reversing an award of attorney\u2019s fees because the district court did not properly consider the relationship between the extent of plaintiffs success and the amount of the fee award, the test applied in this Circuit differs from the \u201cgenerous formulation\u201d applied in the First, Seventh and Ninth Circuits under which \u201cplaintiffs may be considered \u2018prevailing parties\u2019 for attorney\u2019s fees purposes if they succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.\u201d <em>See Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1939 and n. 8, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1481-16\">.

Ignoring controlling precedent of the Supreme Court, as well as flouting common sense, the majority accepts Commonwealth\u2019s argument, asserted by this post-decree suit, that it might be regarded as \u201cprevailing\u201d \u2014 despite the plaintiff Commission\u2019s seeming victory achieved by the consent decree \u2014 because the Commission did not prevail on <em>all </em>the issues in the case, and because, in Commonwealth\u2019s characterization, the latter issues (instead of the ones on which the Commission prevailed) were the central issues and the major thrust of the suit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1387\">*1387</page-number>For reasons to be elaborated, the district court correctly rejected Commonwealth\u2019s arguments and found that, as a matter of law, under the facts shown Commonwealth could not be a Title VII prevailing party entitled to attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-5\">The Supreme Court has most recently summarized the principles that apply to the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the \u201cprevailing party\u201d in civil rights and Title VII litigation:</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-6\">\u201c[A] prevailing plaintiff \u2018should ordinarily recover an attorney\u2019s fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hensley v. </em>Eckerhart, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1937, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). The \u201c \u2018plaintiffs may be considered \u201cprevailing parties\u201d for attorney\u2019s fee purposes if they succeed on <em>any </em>significant issue in litigation which achieves <em>some </em>of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 103 S.Ct. at 1939 (emphasis added). \u201cA prevailing defendant may recover an attorney\u2019s fee only where the <em>suit </em>was vexatious, frivolous, or brought to harass or embarrass the defendant.\u201d \u2014U.S. at \u2014, 103 S.Ct. at 1937 (emphasis added). With regard to the present litigation, where the <em>plaintiff </em>did not recover on the merits on <em>all </em>the claims advanced by its suit, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1483-12\">Where the plaintiff has failed to prevail on a claim that is distinct in all respects from his successful claims, the hours spent on the unsuccessful claim should be excluded in considering the amount of a reasonable fee. Where a lawsuit consists of related claims, a plaintiff who has won substantial relief should not have his attorney\u2019s fee reduced simply because the district court did not adopt each contention raised. But where the plaintiff achieved only limited success, the district court should award only that amount of fees that is reasonable in relation to the results obtain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1483-16\">\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 103 S.Ct. at 1943.</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-17\">Application of these principles to the present undisputed facts seems to me to be plain. With regard to the Title VII litigation concluded by the consent decree, the plaintiff Commission \u2014 whether it be regarded as having won \u201csubstantial relief\u201d (as to me is apparent it did) or instead as achieving \u201conly limited success\u201d (as Commonwealth claims) is the prevailing party and entitled to attorney\u2019s fees (which thus far it has not sought). The defendant Commonwealth, having lost on the merits on some of the \u201csignificant issues\u201d advanced by the Commission, is thus not entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees: the Commission\u2019s \u201csuit\u201d against Commonwealth, which did obtain relief ending employment discrimination, was, if only because of the Commission\u2019s success, not \u201cvexatious, frivolous, or brought to harass or embarrass\u201d so as to entitle Commonwealth to relief, even if Commonwealth <em>had </em>been the prevailing party in the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-18\">For these simple and easily administered tests, the majority substitutes a post-judgment procedure whereby a court may award a defendant employer attorney\u2019s fees, even though the Title VII claimant won substantial relief on the basis of the employer\u2019s past discrimination. Deduced from a few scattered decisions of this circuit on quite different issues, the majority finds that, after the conclusion of the litigation affording employment-discrimination relief against the employer, the court may determine that the employer is the prevailing party (and thus entitled to attorney\u2019s fees), enunciating for the first time a requirement that, after merit-litigation concludes, the court must weigh the claims advanced by the Commission against the successful results obtained, and then determine whether the rejected claims were frivolous, vexatious, or brought to harass the employer. Pretermitting that in defiance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1388\">*1388</page-number>of Supreme Court and circuit jurisprudence (and of common sense) this would permit characterization as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d of a defendant employer against whom substantial relief was ordered, the procedural scheme and issues envisaged fly in the face of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent injunction in <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, supra, </em>that \u201c[a] request for attorney\u2019s fees should not result in a second major litigation.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 103 S.Gt. at 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-7\">The majority reaches this curious conclusion on the basis of inapposite decisions by this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-8\">It relies on the test stated in <em>Iranian Students Association v. Edwards, </em>604 F.2d 352 (5th Cir.1979) \u2014 where the civil rights <em>plaintiffs </em>prevailed \u2014 , in which we stated that \u201c[t]he proper focus is whether the <em>plaintiff </em>has been successful on the central issue\u201d or \u201chas acquired the primary relief sought.\u201d 604 F.2d at 503 (emphasis added). The majority overlooks that the issue in this inapposite decision was only whether a plaintiff, which had obtained relief after a temporary restraining order, could be regarded as a prevailing party in the absence of a showing of \u201cprobable success on the merits\u201d (had the case been fully tried). <em>Id. </em>The court\u2019s actual holding was that \u201ca plaintiff can be a \u2018prevailing party\u2019 even though the relief he has obtained is only preliminary [citation omitted] or is the result of a consent decree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>I am unable to read from the language or holding of this decision any implication that a civil rights <em>defendant, against </em>whom relief has been ordered, can somehow become the prevailing party because the defendant might have lost more than he actually did.</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-9\">The other decisions relied upon by the majority are similarly inapposite to the present issue. In <em>Taylor v. Sterrett, </em>640 F.2d 663, 669-70 (5th Cir.1981), where in reiterating the test, a civil rights plaintiff (who had been awarded attorney\u2019s fees for success on the merits) was denied attorney\u2019s fees for supplementary proceedings in which he did not prevail on the merits on the central (or any) issue of those supplementary proceedings. 640 F.2d at 670. Likewise in <em>Coen v. Harrison County School Board, </em>638 F.2d 24 (5th Cir.1981), where the civil rights plaintiffs had not prevailed on a merit-trial but arguably were a \u201cprevailing party\u201d because the relief sought had been voluntarily granted after suit was filed, the court cited the central issue test, but nevertheless affirmed the denial of all but nominal attorney\u2019s fees because the suit was not \u201ca major factor in bringing [success] about. A civil rights plaintiff may not collect attorney\u2019s fees for demanding that a state officer do what he would have done in any case.\u201d 638 F.2d at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-11\">The final decision relied upon by the present majority seems to be contrary to the majority\u2019s position in the present case. In <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Kimbrough Investment Company, </em>703 F.2d 98, 103 (5th Cir.1983), an employer had prevailed on the merits (unlike the present defendant employer), but was nevertheless denied attorney\u2019s fees as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under the strict test applicable to Title VII defendants \u2014 that the suit be \u201cunreasonable, frivolous, meritless, or vexatious,\u201d 703 F.2d at 103 \u2014 even though the employer won on the merits and previous thereto, inter alia, the government had rejected the employer\u2019s offer of settlement through adoption of an affirmative action plan, and even though the Commission had used statistical evidence that substantially lacked probative value. The court pointed out that the government\u2019s \u201cinvestigation showed a potential for unlawful discrimination\u201d and that some of the evidence was \u201cprobative\u201d of \u201c[discriminatory] hiring practices,\u201d and it concluded that therefore \u201cthe case was not vexatious.\u201d 703 F.2d at 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-12\">Thus, in <em>Kimbrough, </em>a Title VII defendant who <em>prevailed </em>after trial on the merits was held not entitled to \u201cprevailing party\u201d attorney\u2019s fees under the strict test applicable to such defendants, because the government\u2019s action could not be held to be vexatious where the government had relied upon probative (but eventually rejected) evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1389\">*1389</page-number>of discriminatory hiring practices. Here, the Title VII defendant not only did <em>not </em>prevail on the merits, but by the consent decree was ordered to end discriminatory practices and to allot one million dollars for backpay potentially owed because of them. <em>Kimbrough, </em>if applicable, is contrary in rationale and result to the majority\u2019s holding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1485-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-6\">For the reasons perhaps too lengthily stated, the majority in my opinion ignores the controlling jurisprudence in holding that the Title VII defendant employer, Commonwealth, could conceivably be the prevailing party in this litigation, which was concluded by a consent decree remedying Commonwealth\u2019s past discriminatory practices and requiring it to allot one million dollars to pay claims of those aggrieved by its past employment discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-7\">Under these views, it is irrelevant to discuss the issues upon which Commonwealth claims to have prevailed. However, because the majority so lightly glides by them in the context of the entire litigation, I am attaching an overview of the litigation and these issues as an appendix to this opinion, for the benefit of subsequent en banc or Supreme Court review. Were I to reach the merits of Commonwealth\u2019s contentions in this regard, I would be inclined to view them as insubstantial in the light of the jurisprudence insofar as attempting to depict Commonwealth as a prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-8\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-9\">\n<em>Appendix</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-10\">Neither the majority nor the dissent felt to be relevant the actual content and significance of the issues upon which Commonwealth claims to have prevailed. In my view, in the context of the litigation, the issues upon which Commonwealth claims to have prevailed are insubstantial. For the benefit of those who might be interested in this aspect of the issues before us, I am setting forth: I. The Context Facts; and II. The Issues Upon Which Commonwealth Claims to Have Prevailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-12\">I. <em>The Context Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1485-13\">In February 1975, an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charge was filed against the Commonwealth Oil Refining Company alleging that the company was discriminating against women and Puerto Ricans with respect to hiring, promotion and compensation at its Peneulas, Puerto Rico petrochemical complex. An investigation followed, and in February 1977, the Commission issued a decision, finding reasonable cause to believe the charge true. Ensuing conciliation efforts, though complicated by Commonwealth\u2019s intervening insolvency and Chapter XI reorganization proceeding, ultimately led to a conciliation agreement. A consent decree was entered by the parties and approved by the bankruptcy court in January 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-14\">The consent decree provided procedures whereby Commonwealth was to publicize equal employment policies and programs, and for monitoring its compliance therewith. Commonwealth agreed to increase the representation of Puerto Ricans and women in entry level positions in six different operational departments, and to contact local Puerto Rican colleges and referral agencies in its future recruitment efforts. The decree also instituted procedures to identify counsel, and train current female employees for promotion into certain \u201ctarget area jobs\u201d. Commonwealth agreed to budget $50,000 a year to fund these efforts. In addition, the consent decree provided relief for all women and Puerto Ricans that Commonwealth had discriminated against in the past (in hiring or promotion between February 1973 and the date of the decree) that the Commission was able to identify. The decree provided that a Special Master, empowered to award back wages, preferential seniority and order preferential hiring or promotion, would hear all cases that the parties could not resolve through informal conciliation efforts. One million dollars was allotted to satisfy these past claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-15\">Commonwealth\u2019s reorganization efforts proved successful, and in June 1981 a plan of arrangement was approved by the bankruptcy court. Subsequently, the company brought an action in federal district court seeking an allowance of attorney\u2019s fees against the Commission pursuant to \u00a7 706(k) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k), alleging that (a) it had prevailed against the Commission in the course of the proceedings initiated by the 1975 charge, and (b) that the Commission had proceeded \u201cin bad faith and with no reasonable belief in the merits of the factual and legal positions it espoused\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-16\">Commonwealth sought $525,000 in fees plus the costs and fees incurred in bringing the fee action itself. The Commission filed a motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment, and Commonwealth filed a cross motion for summary judgment (accompanied by a 40 page affidavit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1390\">*1390</page-number>prepared by a member of Commonwealth\u2019s in-house legal staff, detailing the history of the Title VII controversy, and appending several hundred pages of documentary exhibits). The district court concluded that no genuine issues of material fact existed, Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c), denied Commonwealth\u2019s motion, and granted that of the Commission. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-5\">On appeal, Commonwealth asserts that it prevailed against the Commission on claims either frivolous or undertaken in bad faith, and is therefore entitled to' an award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 706(k) of Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-6\">II. <em>The Issues Upon Which Commonwealth Claims to Have Prevailed</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1486-7\">Commonwealth\u2019s Complaint asserted three separate \u201cclaims for relief\u2019 in which it purportedly prevailed:</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-8\"><em>A. </em>The first advanced two theories to conclude that Commonwealth had been the prevailing party under the consent decree: (1) that the decree contained \u201cno remedy or relief for many of the more substantial discriminatory practices [that had been originally] alleged in the [Commission\u2019s original charge and subsequent determination]\u201d; and (2) that the decree ultimately entered by the parties afforded less relief than had been offered by Commonwealth to the Commission in earlier conciliation negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-9\"><em>B. </em>The second asserted that Commonwealth had been a prevailing party against the Commission because 77 of the 109 names initially identified as likely victims of past discrimination under the provisions of the consent decree, were ultimately withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-10\"><em>C. </em>The third asserted that Commonwealth was a prevailing party in its successful effort to defeat (prior to entering the consent decree) the Commission\u2019s attempt to evade the effect of Chapter XI\u2019s automatic stay provision which barred the Commission from commencing its Title VII suit in district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-11\"><em>A. and B. Alleged Only </em>\u2014 Partial <em>Success of Commission</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1486-12\"><em>As </em>noted in the text of the dissent, a Title VII plaintiff may be considered the prevailing party for attorney\u2019s fee purposes if he succeeds on \u201c \u2018any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit ... sought in bringing the suit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). It seems to me to be axiomatic that if the plaintiff is \u201cthe\u201d prevailing party and thus entitled to attorney\u2019s fees, the defendant cannot also be \u201cthe\u201d prevailing party in the same litigation on the same issues and also entitled to attorney\u2019s fees agains the \u201cother\u201d prevailing party. See Title VII, Section 706(k): \u201c[T]he Court, in its discretion, may allow <em>the </em>prevailing party ... a reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as part of the costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-15\">Comparing the Commission\u2019s initial charge and subsequent determination of discrimination against Puerto Ricans and women in hiring and promotion with the considerable relief afforded to both groups pursuant to the consent decree (a yardstick for measuring success that Commonwealth itself proposes in its complaint), in light of the entire record, the relief achieved by the Commission on the merits (to increase employment of women and Puerto Ricans at the entry level, a $1,000,000 allotment for claimants of past discrimination, and $50,000 a year in programs to recruit and promote members of this group) cannot be considered insignificant, nor could it be concluded that the Commission was not, at the very least, a significant catalytic factor in effecting such relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While Commonwealth might be said to have been successful in ameliorating its defeats to the Commission, such reduced losses cannot be considered the prevailing success upon which award of attorney\u2019s fees may be based.</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-18\">Even if the Commission rejected chances of a more advantageous settlement (as Commonwealth asserts) or Commonwealth\u2019s negotiation ability did, as it contends, successfully preserve many features of a foreign service employment program (that <em>it </em>considered important and asserts was the subject of attack by the Commission during the parties\u2019 conciliation negotiations), interim victories and defeats within the settlement negotiation process are immaterial to the ultimate issue of whether a plaintiff instead of a defendant is the prevailing party under the settlement reached. Settlement efforts refused along the way are \u201cof no moment\u201d. <em>Fernandes v. Limmer, </em>663 F.2d 619, 637 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, \u2014 </em>U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 5, 73 L.Ed.2d 1395 (1982). The consent decree here afforded considerable relief, some of the significant benefit sought by the Commission\u2019s suit. As we have long held, a plaintiff need not obtain a judgment or settlement satisfying <em>every </em>claim asserted in order to \u201cprevail\u201d. <em>Id. </em>Thus, even if the preservation of Commonwealth\u2019s foreign service program (by which bonus incentives were given to non-Puerto Ricans to work in Puerto Rico) was a victory for it and a defeat for the Commission, in the context of the suit as a whole, the defendant could not be a prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-20\">Likewise meritless is Commonwealth\u2019s argument that it \u201cprevailed\u201d because, by entering the settlement, it reduced its potential liability for past discrimination to a fraction of that originally claimed or because 77 of the names initially submitted by the Commission were ultimately withdrawn. In reducing its overall potential liability for past discrimination from an initially claimed $2,800,000 to $1,000,000, Commonwealth achieved neither more or less than does any defendant who agrees by settlement to partially satisfy a plaintiff\u2019s claim, and thus avoids the risk of having to satisfy the whole of the plaintiffs original claimed damages following a trial on the merits. Analogously, by successfully opposing certain individual claimants of the group initially proposed by the Commission, Commonwealth has done no more than a defendant who succeeds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1391\">*1391</page-number>in having certain party plaintiffs dismissed in a suit ultimately lost on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-6\">Although Commonwealth may have, as it maintains, preserved policies deemed important to its operations, reduced its potential aggregate liability from several million dollars to one million dollars, and reduced the number of claimants initially proposed by the Commission as victims of past hiring discrimination, the incremental lessening of losses that these \u201cvictories\u201d represent cannot be equated with a positive receipt of money damages, benefits, or injunctive relief. The civil rights plaintiff here has \u201clost\u201d only that which it might have gained from the defendant, while the civil rights defendant has only \u201cgained\u201d the opportunity of keeping a part of what it already had. Its victory consisted of losing less than it might have.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-7\">The benefits received by the Commission were substantial, not nominal. Thus, even if the defendant settled on terms <em>it </em>regarded as advantageous, the Commission remained as a partially successful civil rights plaintiff, a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1487-8\">\n<em>C. Commonwealth\u2019s Procedural Victory with Regard to Chapter XI Stay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-9\">In <em>Hanrahan v. Hampton, </em>446 U.S. 754, 100 S.Ct. 1987, 64 L.Ed.2d 670 (1980), the Supreme Court made plain that, to be awarded attorney\u2019s fees as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d in civil rights litigation, a party may be so entitled only where he \u201chas established his entitlement to some relief on the <em>merits </em>of his claim.\u201d 446 U.S. at 747, 100 S.Ct. at 1989 (emphasis added). Commonwealth\u2019s only other purported victory, defeating the Commission\u2019s attempt to avoid the automatic stay provision of Chapter XI, is exactly the species of mere interlocutory procedural victory rejected as insufficient to support a fee award in <em>Hanrahan. Accord: Fernandes v. Limmer, supra, </em>663 F.2d at 637 (rejecting \u201cinterim setbacks on interlocutory motions\u201d as immaterial to the determination of which party is the \u201cprevailing\u201d party).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1482-7\">. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had filed a complaint against the defendant Commonwealth alleging that Commonwealth\u2019s employment practices discriminated on the basis of sex and national origin and that this corporation was liable in damages for approximately $2.8 million. In January 1981, a consent decree was entered into by the parties and approved by the court, which, inter alia, provided for affirmative steps and hiring goals to end discrimination against Puerto Ricans and females and by which Commonwealth allotted one million dollars to satisfy past claims for back wages and denial of seniority arising from past discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1482-15\">. However relevant these arguments might be to a contention by Commonwealth that the Commission only partially prevailed or <em>(dubi-</em>tante) even was not the \u201cprevailing party\u201d for purposes of the award of attorney\u2019s fees, they are completely irrelevant, as the dissent will elaborate, to the issue before the court\u2014 whether Commonwealth itself was the \u201cprevailing party\u201d in the present litigation, which was ended by a consent decree by which, inter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1387\">*1387</page-number>alia, it allotted one million dollars to pay back-wage and other claims for past employment discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1485-11\">. The majority also cites <em>United States v. Allegheny-Ludlum Industries, </em>558 F.2d 742 (5th Cir. 1977), which (1) remanded the claim of an employer (which had prevailed on an appeal) to the district court to determine whether it had prevailed on \u201ca \u2018significant and discrete\u2019 proceeding\u201d (relating to dismissal of an intervention), 558 F.2d at 743, and (2) held that attorney\u2019s fees against unsuccessful Title VII <em>plaintiffs </em>could be assessed on the same basis as against unsuccessful defendants, a stance the panel was later forced to rescind. 568 F.2d 1073 (5th Cir.1978) (on petition for rehearing). I am unable to see any relevance of this decision to the present issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1486-17\"> Although Commonwealth claims that it was willing early in its negotiations with the Commission to voluntarily comply with certain of the Commission\u2019s demands, it does not deny that such offers were made in direct response to the Commission\u2019s proceedings, nor that the Commission was the precipitating cause of either these early offers or the remedial action to which Commonwealth ultimately consented pursuant to the decree.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
