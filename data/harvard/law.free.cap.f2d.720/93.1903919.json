In this petition for review, Friends of the River and Dale Meyer (FOR or petitioners) challenge as inconsonant with both statutes FERC\u2019s license to the Calaveras County Water District (CCWD) to operate a hydroelectric plant on the North Fork Stanislaus River in California. We find that in one respect FERC did not attend with due care to NEPA\u2019s procedural requirements. Because we conclude that the Commission\u2019s decision is in other respects unassailable, and because a remand to cure the procedural lapse would serve no sensible purpose, we affirm the Commission\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-20\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b191-21\">In November 1978, CCWD, a California county water district, applied to FERC for a license to construct a hydroelectric plant (the project or the Calaveras project) on the North Fork Stanislaus River in Alpine, Tuo-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>lumne, and Calaveras Counties, California.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The project, as described in CCWD\u2019s application, involves the construction of a series of dams, the enlargement of an existing reservoir, and the construction of two new powerhouses. As planned, the project will produce an average annual energy yield of over 500 gigawatt-hours (Gwh), equivalent to the energy produced by roughly one million barrels of oil, and have a total power capacity of about 200 megawatts (MW).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">The principal ecological effect of the plant will stem from the enlargement of the Spicer River Reservoir, which at its maximum elevation will inundate approximately 1,780 acres of forest, meadow, and riparian habitat. While the reservoir will be moderate in size compared to nearby water projects, the loss of Gabbot Meadow, part of</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">the inundated area, is likely to have a negative effect on deer and other wildlife populations. In its total dimension, the project will mean the loss of about 2,500 acres of wildlife habitat.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">The power generated by the project is to be sold to the Northern California Power Agency (NCPA).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> NCPA is a consortium of twelve small utilities, each responsible for the retail distribution of electrical power within its service area. At the time of the 1978 application, the NCPA utilities did not generate any of the power they supplied to their customers; instead, they relied entirely on power purchased from Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG &amp; E), the largest electrical utility in California, and from the Central Valley Project (CVP), also located in California, of the federal Western Area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Power Administration. NCPA, and a number of other utilities, including CVP, are bundled together with PG &amp; E to compose a \u201cPG &amp; E area\u201d for purposes of statewide planning by the California Energy Commission (CEC). <em>Electricity Tomorrow </em>49. NCPA\u2019s relationship with PG &amp; E, however, is purely contractual. PG &amp; E\u2019s charter does not place it under a legal obligation to supply power to NCPA or to customers within NCPA\u2019s service area. Rather, PG &amp; E\u2019s priority charge is to supply customers within its own service area as defined by its charter, an area distinct from NCPA\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">NCPA intervened in the licensing proceedings before FERC immediately after CCWD filed the 1978 application. For NCPA, the project represents an important step towards energy self-sufficiency in the years to come. For CCWD, the project means an increase in the firm yield of water on the North Fork Stanislaus River; in addition, revenue generated by the project can be applied to the cost of the water CCWD provides, and can be used, in the future, to finance additional water projects in the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Litigation aimed at stopping the project began soon after CCWD filed the 1978 license application, when FOR filed suit in state court claiming that the environmental impact report filed by CCWD pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act did not satisfy the requirements of that Act. In 1979, judgment was entered in California Superior Court rejecting all claims made by environmental plaintiffs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">FERC commenced its investigation of the desirability of the Calaveras project in 1978. In late 1979, it issued a draft environmental impact statement (EIS) setting forth the environmental impacts of the project. It received extensive comments on the draft EIS from federal and state agencies as well as private parties, and issued a revised, final EIS in 1980. That document accorded only summary attention to the concern\u2014 raised before the agency \u2014 whether, in lieu of the project, NCPA\u2019s power needs could be met by continued reliance on purchases from other utilities. The Commission did state in the EIS that power purchase contracts between NCPA members and PG &amp; E \u201ccan be terminated on 6 to 24 months notice and cannot be considered as firm resources,\u201d J.A. 187; it further stated that resort to other sources of energy, including purchased power, in preference to licensing the hydroelectric Calaveras project, \u201cwould consume nonrenewable fossil-fuel resources.\u201d J.A. 328. FERC took testimony commenting on the final EIS at public hearings in Washington, D.C. and Angels Camp, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">In February 1982, FERC issued an order and opinion granting CCWD a license to construct the Calaveras plant. It denied FOR\u2019s petition for rehearing in an opinion issued in July 1982. The July order explained more cogently why the Commission rejected prospects for further reliance on purchased power as a ground for refusing the license. FERC observed that \u201cPG &amp; E\u2019s [own] ability to meet load in the future is uncertain,\u201d J.A. 960, and cited studies, in <em>Electricity Tomorrow </em>and a later (March 1981) CEC staff report, supporting that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">Petitioning for our review of the Commission\u2019s grant of the license, FOR contends that the Commission has neglected its duties both under the FPA and under NEPA; we consider separately below FOR\u2019s challenges under each statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">II. FPA Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b193-14\">Section 10(a) of 'the Federal Power Act provides that the Commission may issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>a license for a hydroelectric plant only where</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-4\">the project ... shall be such as in the judgment of the Commission will be best adapted to a comprehensive plan for improving or developing a waterway or waterways for the use or benefit of interstate or foreign commerce, for the improvement and utilization of waterpower development, and for other beneficial public uses, including recreational purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Federal Power Act, 10(a), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 803(a) (1976). Pursuant to this provision, the Commission has a multifaceted obligation to investigate, before approving any license, whether construction of the project is in the public interest. <em>Udall v. FPC, </em>387 U.S. 428, 87 S.Ct. 1712, 18 L.Ed.2d 869 (1967). Once the Commission makes its investigation, however, its findings may be upset on judicial review only if they are not supported by substantial evidence. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 8257(b) (1976); <em>see Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. FPC, </em>453 F.2d 463, 467-68 (2d Cir.1971) <em>(Udall </em>did not overturn the traditional \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d review standard), <em>cert. denied, </em>407 U.S. 926, 92 S.Ct. 2453, 32 L.Ed.2d 813 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">FOR asserts the inadequacy of FERC\u2019s decisionmaking in multiple respects. Petitioners claim that need for the project has not been demonstrated; FERC, they contend, has overprojected demand for power in NCPA\u2019s service area, and underprojected supply. Moreover, petitioners charge that FERC improperly rejected reasonable alternatives, including purchase of power from other utilities, and alternate means of constructing the project. FOR further argues that FERC misconceived the overall negative environmental effects of the project, and misjudged what is in California\u2019s \u201cpublic interest,\u201d by overlooking state policy that attaches a low priority to new hydroelectric projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">Our review securely indicates that only one of FOR\u2019s claims warrants discussion \u2014 the claim that the project is unnecessary because NCPA can continue to purchase all the power it needs. FOR\u2019s other contentions are insubstantial. The administrative record fully supports FERC\u2019s appraisal of projected NCPA demand for power,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the Commission\u2019s evaluation of future NCPA generating capacity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>tial evidence in the record also supports FERC\u2019s rejection of the Utica-Union, Low Spicer Storage Complex alternative to building the CCWD project at its present location. Equally adequate evidence backs up FERC\u2019s conclusion that the environmental impact mitigation measures negotiated by CCWD, the California Department of Fish and Game, and the U.S. Forest Service are reasonable and attainable. California\u2019s announced policy concededly ranks large hydroelectric projects low among possible new power plant development, but ample evidence sustains FERC\u2019s independent determination, as a <em>federal </em>agency, that the licensed hydroelectric plant is an appropriate development.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">FOR urges most strenuously that FERC should have declared the project unnecessary because NCPA\u2019s power needs can be met reliably through continued purchases from PG &amp; E, NCPA\u2019s traditional source of electric power. FERC responded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF9\">PG &amp; E\u2019s ability to meet load in the future is uncertain. Under adverse hydrological conditions, PG &amp; E\u2019s reserve margin in 1985 could be as little as 3 percent. Moreover, ... by 1992 the PG &amp; E system will require, in addition to the [Calaveras] and another proposed hydroelectric project, an additional 493 MW of new capacity to be able to provide reliable electric service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Order Denying Rehearing, J.A. 959, 960. FERC has also noted that the NCPA-PG &amp; E purchase contracts are terminable by PG &amp; E on six to twenty-four months notice, and that PG &amp; E\u2019s priority responsibility is to customers within its own service area. J.A. 187, 411, 443. These findings, FERC argues, more than adequately justify its conclusion that NCPA cannot safely rely on PG &amp; E power, and should be permitted to develop the capacity to stand on its own feet in the years to come.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">We examine in turn FOR\u2019s assertions that (1) substantial evidence does not underpin FERC\u2019s conclusion that PG &amp; E\u2019s own resources will be insufficient to support NCPA\u2019s growing needs, and (2) even if PG &amp; E\u2019s resources, considered in isolation, are inadequate to support NCPA, FERC should have extended its examination to the energy resources of utilities <em>beyond </em>PG &amp; E, resources that could be made available to PG &amp; E \u201cduring emergency conditions.\u201d Brief for Environmental Petitioners at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">A. <em>Extent of PG &amp; E\u2019s Own Resources</em></p>\n<p id=\"AfE\">The most up-to-date set of energy forecasts in the agency record indicates that peak demand<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in the PG &amp; E planning area will rise to 19,407 MW by 1992. <em>Electricity Tomorrow </em>62. To meet a peak demand increase of this magnitude, PG &amp; E will have to add 4,376 MW of capacity over and above what it now has. <em>Id. </em>Further, PG &amp; E\u2019s current reserve margin is \u201cwell below the optimum,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 22; to bring its reserve margin up to a safe level, PG &amp; E will have to add an additional 1,394 MW by 1992. <em>Id. </em>at 67. Finally, PG &amp; E cannot securely rely on all the power it is receiving now; some of its generating plant is outmoded, and all of its long-term contracts for purchase of firm capacity from other utilities are due to expire in the 1980s. Even assuming renewal of two long-term contracts with Pacific Northwest utilities, PG &amp; E will have to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>add 1,754 MW of capacity to make up for retirements and contract expirations. <em>Id. </em>at 67-68. In sum, based on forecasts in the record, PG &amp; E, to stay safe, must add a minimum of 7,524 MW of capacity by 1992 \u2014a figure equivalent to about half of PG &amp; E\u2019s current demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">To meet its energy needs, PG &amp; E has developed a comprehensive plan to build coal-fired, hydroelectric, and cogeneration plants. The plan is dominated by additions of nuclear power plants in the early 1980s and coal-fired capacity in later years. <em>Electricity Tomorrow </em>328. It appears that PG &amp; E \u2014 and CEC \u2014 have <em>included </em>the Calaver-as project in their resource planning.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Even including the Calaveras project in the estimation, however, PG &amp; E faces a shortfall in capacity additions reasonably expected to be operating by 1992.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Just how PG &amp; E is to make up this shortfall is not clear. One CEC staff report asserts that additional efforts along lines such as conservation and further geothermal generation will be sufficient. J.A. 987-92. The extent of PG &amp; E\u2019s future capacity needs, however, together with the utility\u2019s heavy reliance on nuclear power generation, may place PG &amp; E in an uncomfortable position in the next few years. <em>Electricity Tomorrow </em>reports that \u201cif Diablo Canyon [nuclear power plant] is not licensed and operated, the PG &amp; E area may require assistance from other utilities if unscheduled very large power plant outages are experienced.\u201d <em>Electricity Tomorrow </em>316. CEC studies further indicate that in a worst-case analysis, viewing the PG &amp; E planning area as an isolated system, PG &amp; E\u2019s reserve margin could drop as low as 2.7% by 1985, more than 10% below optimum levels. <em>Id. </em>at 317. While other utilities could come to PG &amp; E\u2019s rescue in emergency conditions, the prospect remains that PG &amp; E will end up in the next few years not as a seller of surplus energy but, to meet its own needs, as a purchaser of power from other systems with surplus supplies. <em>See Electricity Today </em>331 (\u201cThe potential delay in obtaining the Diablo Canyon operating licenses has prompted PG &amp; E to seek purchases of short-term capacity....\u201d). This state of affairs has persisted. <em>See Power Shortage </em>\u2014 Or <em>Sham?, </em>Newsweek, June 13, 1983, at 64 (\u201cPG &amp; E remains confident it can help fill its growing needs by purchasing power from other systems with surplus supplies.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">CEC\u2019s apparent inclusion of the Calaveras project in its resource planning indicates the vulnerability of FOR\u2019s assertions concerning the adequacy of PG &amp; E\u2019s resources. FOR maintains that NCPA can rely on power from PG &amp; E. FOR cites in support of its assertions, however, CEC studies that assume PG &amp; E\u2019s reliance on power from NCPA. CEC has found, moreover, that even if Calaveras is built, PG &amp; E, if it is to bolster its reserve margin, will still need extensive capacity additions. FOR can thus tenably argue only that, if the Calaveras project is not built, some other project somewhere else perhaps could be built to take up the slack. But this possibility hardly undercuts the substantial record support for FERC\u2019s finding that PG &amp; E\u2019s resources do not obviate the need for power the Calaveras project will generate.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">B. <em>Purchases from Beyond PG &amp; E</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">FOR next argues that even if the Commission acceptably analyzed PG &amp; E\u2019s own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>resources, FERC did not go far enough. The Commission should have looked beyond California, FOR maintains; it should have extended its supply-demand analysis to the Pacific Northwest. FERC indicated that it regarded interconnections with utilities outside California as a speculative matter; it said in response to comments on the draft EIS:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-4\">An additional intertie with the Pacific Northwest would not provide the dependable capacity equivalent to the proposed project. The amount of power available from the Pacific Northwest depends on the magnitude of the power loads in the Pacific Northwest and the amount of water available for generation. At times, there is no power available for transfer from the Pacific Northwest, and, as future loads in that area increase, less power will be available to California.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">J.A. 415. Concededly, FERC did not undertake detailed examination of resources beyond PG &amp; E\u2019s. It did not attempt to estimate what PG &amp; E might buy from Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and Manitoba, and sell to NCPA. We conclude that FERC was not required to enlarge its inquiry as FOR proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">Regional power planning is difficult and uncertain; it becomes increasingly difficult and uncertain as its scope is extended in time and space.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> One scholar has characterized regional power planning as \u201ca task that confronts a degree of uncertainty and risk without historical precedent.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As to the Pacific Northwest, the same author stated: \u201c[T]he <em>best </em>one can do\u201d in that region with current planning methods still entails \u201cmajor risks\u201d of faulty prediction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">FERC initially analyzed projected supply and demand in NCPA\u2019s service area and found a need for new generating capacity. FOR pointed to the supply source next door, PG &amp; E. FERC examined PG &amp; E\u2019s projected reserve margin and found it low; PG &amp; E, it is reasonably anticipated, will need new sources of power even on the assumption that CCWD\u2019s project is built. FOR contends FERC should have proceeded to the next door, a very large one, the Pacific Northwest.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> FERC\u2019s terse response is not surprising. No one, apparently, has made projections that would justify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>safe reliance on Northwest power. California itself subdivides the state into distinct \u201cplanning areas\u201d; CEC has noted that one of the state\u2019s objectives is to meet demand while \u201cnot substantially increasing power purchases from utilities outside California.\u201d <em>Electricity Tomorrow </em>354.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">We are in no position to require FERC, in the circumstances of this case, to survey power availability more broadly than it did. How far in time and space a power projection investigation ought to extend is a question involving practical considerations of feasibility and a balancing of costs against expected useful results. Resolving these issues requires technical expertise and is properly left to the informed discretion of the responsible federal agency. <em>Cf. Kleppe v. Sierra Club, </em>427 U.S. 390, 412, 96 S.Ct. 2718, 2731, 49 L.Ed.2d 576 (1976). It is impossible to say, on review of the record before us, that FERC failed to exercise its discretion intelligently.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\"><em>Udall v. FPC, </em>387 U.S. 428, 87 S.Ct. 1712, 18 L.Ed.2d 869 (1967), a lead decision in this area, does not counsel a different result. It involved a controversy between the Secretary of the Interior and the FPC. Interior initially took the position that a consortium of four private utilities should not be licensed to develop a hydroelectric project on the Snake River at the Idaho-Oregon border until means of protecting anadromous fish (principally salmon and steelhead) had been studied. Later, Interior added its view that the project should be constructed by the federal government, not by private utilities; further, Interior questioned the immediate need for the plant. The FPC nevertheless approved the utilities\u2019 proposal. The Court, per Justice Douglas, overturned that decision, and remanded the matter to the FPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The Court identified as the primary ground for remand the agency\u2019s failure to take evidence on whether development of the river basin should proceed under federal rather than private, state, or municipal auspices. <em>Id. </em>at 431-32, 87 S.Ct. at 1714. It observed that the issue of federal, as distinguished from private or municipal, control \u201c[might] conceivably make a vast difference in the functioning of the vast river complex\u201d in question. <em>Id. </em>at 435, 87 S.Ct. at 1716. \u201cSince the cases [had to] be remanded to the Commission,\u201d the Court thought it appropriate to instruct the agency to consider as well the alternative of no development at all. <em>Id. </em>at 436, 87 S.Ct. at 1716.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">In the wide-ranging discussion in the second part of the <em>Udall v. FPC </em>opinion, the Court conveyed this message: where a project may have major adverse environmental effects, the Commission should carefully consider the need for the project, in light of its multiple impacts on commerce, recreation, wilderness and wildlife preservation, before granting a license. A determination of need, the Court said, required more than affirmation that the project would be \u201cbeneficial to the licensee\u201d combined with ascertainment that the region would \u201cbe able to use the additional power.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 450, 87 S.Ct. at 1724.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">The project proposed in <em>Udall v. FPC </em>risked \u201cdestroying] the river as a waterway,\u201d yet the agency had not addressed \u201cthe desirability of [the river\u2019s] demise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court declared that the Commission should have explored alternate sources of power supplies, and the regional and even national need for the recreational and commercial resources, including fish and other wildlife, threatened by the project in question. <em>Id. </em>at 440, 442, 444, 450, 87 S.Ct. at 1718, 1719, 1720, 1724.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The public in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>terest determination under section 10(a) of the Federal Power Act,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> in sum, should be overarching, the Court said; it should encompass the effects of the proposed project on navigation, water supply, recreation, and other public uses of a waterway, and not simply regional power demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">In the case at hand, FERC\u2019s performance is hardly comparable to the FPC\u2019s in <em>Udall v. FPC. </em>The Commission did not restrict its inquiry to the benefits of the project to CCWD and NCPA. Nor did it stop at the region\u2019s demand for additional power. It took into account alternate sources of power within the region, and the interest in preserving the region\u2019s wilderness areas and wildlife. It cannot fairly be faulted, as the Court indicated the agency could in <em>Udall v. FPC, </em>for wholesale neglect of issues relevant to the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">One portion of Justice Douglas\u2019 opinion in <em>Udall v. FPC, </em>it is true, broadly discusses the entire world\u2019s future supplies of power, and suggests that hydroelectric projects should be evaluated in light of the fact that \u201cMy the end of the century \u2018nuclear energy may account for about one-third of our total energy consumption.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 446-47, 87 S.Ct. at 1721-23 (quoting Brown, The Next Hundred Years 109 (1957)). But this part of the decision does not instruct the Commission on how far afield it should go in considering alternate power sources. The opinion quotes a long passage from Interior\u2019s petition to intervene in the FPC proceedings, in which Interior included a list of Northwest power resources inside and outside the utilities\u2019 service areas. 387 U.S. at 444-46, 87 S.Ct. at 1720-21. As far as one can tell from the opinion, however, the only alternate sources of power the Court noted as immediately relevant to the FPC\u2019s decision were projects physically located <em>within </em>the service area of the utilities the FPC had licensed. <em>Id. </em>at 448, 87 S.Ct. at 1723. All one can conclude from this less than crystalline part of <em>Udall v. FPC </em>is that the Commission must look beyond any single utility\u2019s or consortium of utilities\u2019 independent resources. FERC did that in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">We hold that the Commission did not abuse its discretion in declining to pursue an investigation into the amount of power PG &amp; E might be able to purchase from Pacific Northwest utilities. FERC\u2019s decision to limit close consideration of demand and resources to meet the demand to the NCPA and PG &amp; E areas, and to avoid an excursion into more distant regions, was reasonable and comfortably within the Commission\u2019s authority.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">III. NEPA Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">FOR reasserts under a NEPA heading several of the contentions we found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>insubstantial when raised under an FPC rubric. <em>See supra </em>pp. 97-99. We find them no more worthy of discussion when presented under a different label.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We can deal summarily as well with FOR\u2019s contention that the EIS should have examined \u201cwater supply\u201d aspects. CCWD\u2019s plans in this regard were not sufficiently concrete to warrant evaluation in conjunction with the Calaveras power project. <em>See Kleppe v. Sierra Club, </em>427 U.S. 390, 401-02, 96 S.Ct. 2718, 2726, 49 L.Ed.2d 576 (1976).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">, . . \u201e FORs claim concerning the prospect of purchasing power m lieu of constructing a hydroelectric plant, however, bears separate discussion in the NEPA context. To the extent that FOR challenges the size of the region considered by FERC the <em>dimensions </em>of the Commission\u2019s investigation\u2014 our discussion relating to the FPA largely answers FOR\u2019s criticism and we need not write many more words here. FOR raises a graver concern with respect to the <em>timing </em>of the investigation the Commission did undertake; FOR s final contention concerning the need for a supplemental EIS on the other hand, does not require extended discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-27\">,<em>A. The Dimensions of FERCs Invest\u00edSatIon</em></p>\n<p id=\"A2I\">Section 102(2)(E) of NEPA calls upon each federal agency to \u201cstudy, develop, and describe appropriate alternatives to recommended courses of action in any proposal which involves unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(E) (1976). This provision parallels the general EIS requirement of discussion of \u201calternatives to the proposed action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4332(2)(iii). FOR contended that the Commission was obliged to look to PG &amp; E and beyond to satisfy the command in <em>Udall v. FPC, supra, </em>that the agency&gt; in carrying out its mission under the FPA, explore \u201calternatiye sourceg of power.\" We have explained above why the examination FERC conducted satisfied the FPA requirement and was consistent with the Court\u2019s instructions in <em>Udall. See supra </em>pp 100-103. FOR makes the same arguments in contending that purchasing power was an \u201calternative\u201d the Commission should have considered expansively to carry out its obligations under NEPA.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AVF\">We note j^j that it is not altogether apparent why power purchasing should rank ag a course \u201calternative\u201d to power generation. Purchasing prospects are per-baps more appropriately considered a component of need. Power purchasing is feasible and desirable only if a producer <em>in the </em>reievant region has excess supplies to sell, supplies adequate to obviate the need for new production in the area. FOR\u2019s dominant claim is not that FERC failed to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>sider \u201calternative\u201d courses for production of power, but that there was no need for additional power generation.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> However, this court has once before accepted categorization of purchased power as an \u201calternative\u201d within the meaning of NEPA,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and we will adhere to that view.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Just as we ruled in considering FPA strictures that FERC was not obliged to survey power availability more broadly than it did, so we conclude here that the Commission properly confined its consideration of demand and available power supplies to the NCPA and PG &amp; E areas. And for the same reasons. We add only the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition in <em>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC, </em>435 U.S. 519, 98 S.Ct. 1197, 55 L.Ed.2d 460 (1978), that \u201cthe concept of alternatives [under NEPA] must be bounded by some notion of feasibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 551, 98 S.Ct. at 1215.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> FERC\u2019s decision as to the space dimensions of its demand and supply exploration in this ease was properly bounded by reasonable considerations of what could be forecast with a fair degree of reliability and with the energy, research, and time resources available to the agency. <em>See NRDC v. Morton, </em>458 F.2d 827, 837 (D.C.Cir.1972).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">B. <em>The Timing of FERC\u2019s Investigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ath\">We are secure in the conclusion that the Commission\u2019s investigation of power purchasing as a means to satisfy NCPA\u2019s need, or as an \u201calternative\u201d course, was <em>substantively </em>unassailable. However, an important question remains whether the license should be set aside and the matter returned to FERC because the agency did not present its analysis adequately in the EIS itself ; instead, the Commission delayed adequate statement until its July 1982 order denying FOR\u2019s rehearing petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">The crux of the problem here lies in the difference between typical \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d review of agency decisionmaking on the one hand, and NEPA review on the other. \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d review essentially concerns the merits of the decision ultimately reached by the agency \u2014 is that decision sustained by the evidence in the record taken as a whole? <em>See Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951); <em>American Public Gas Association v. FPC, </em>567 F.2d 1016, 1028-29 (D.C.Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 907, 98 S.Ct. 1456, 55 L.Ed.2d 499 (1978). Substantial evidence there must be, but that evidence may be scattered throughout the record. NEPA, on the other hand, establishes an \u201cessentially procedural\u201d requirement. Vermont <em>Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC, </em>435 U.S. 519, 558, 98 S.Ct. 1197, 1219, 55 L.Ed.2d 460 (1978). It calls upon agencies to present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>evidence and discussion relevant to their environmental decisionmaking in one comprehensive document \u2014 the environmental impact statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Section 102(2) of the Act</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6o\">requires that responsible officials of all agencies prepare a \u201cdetailed statement\u201d covering the impact of particular actions on the environment, the environmental costs which might be avoided, and alternative measures which might alter the cost-benefit equation. The apparent purpose of the \u201cdetailed statement\u201d is to aid in the agencies\u2019 own decision making process and to advise other interested agencies and the public of the environmental consequences of planned federal action.... Moreover, by compelling a formal \u201cdetailed statement\u201d ..., NEPA provides evidence that the mandated decision making process has in fact taken place and, most importantly, allows those removed from the initial process to evaluate and balance the factors on their own.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9Y\"><em>Calvert Cliffs\u2019 Coordinating Committee v. AEC, </em>449 F.2d 1109, 1114 (D.C.Cir.1971). The EIS serves as an assurance that the agency has indeed adverted closely and carefully to the environmental impacts of its actions. By \u201cgathering] in one place a discussion of the relative environmental impact of alternatives,\u201d <em>NRDC v. Morton, </em>458 F.2d 827, 884 (D.C.Cir.1972), the EIS makes it possible for the public and reviewing courts to consider conveniently how and why the agency made its final choices. <em>See generally Grazing Fields Farm v. Goldsch-midt, </em>626 F.2d 1068 (1st Cir.1980). And of particular importance, the EIS requirement inhibits <em>post hoc </em>rationalizations of inadequate environmental decisionmaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">FERC, we are impelled to say, did not measure up to NEPA\u2019s command. Most of FERC\u2019s analysis of the power purchase issue appears in the Commission\u2019s- July 1982 order, not in the EIS. Were we confronted with the slim references to the question in the EIS itself, unsupplemented by the discussion in the July 1982 order, we might consider a remand unavoidable. Once power purchasing is ranked an \u201calternative\u201d course for NEPA purposes, <em>see supra </em>p. 104, a reviewing court appears bound to conclude that what FERC reported in the EIS was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The special circumstances this case presents, however, deter us from ordering a remand so that FERC can compose a new EIS. This court has recognized that \u201c[t]he EIS ... is not an end in itself, but rather a means toward the goal of better decision-making.\u201d <em>North Slope Borough v. Andrus, </em>642 F.2d 589, 599-600 (D.C.Cir.1980). A remand here, we believe, would treat the EIS as \u201can end in itself\u201d and would not meaningfully serve NEPA\u2019s goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Were we to return the case, the Commission would be instructed to evaluate prospects for NCPA\u2019s continued reliance on purchasing power rather than generating it, and to write up the evaluation in the form of an EIS. But well before the start of this review proceeding, the Commission <em>did </em>make such an investigation, after receiving and responding to extensive comments from interested persons outside the agency, and FERC incorporated its findings in an opinion accessible to the public \u2014 the July 1982 order. Thus a remand here is not needed to \u201caid in the agencies\u2019 own [environmental] decision making process,\u201d <em>Calvert Cliffs\u2019 Coordinating Committee v. AEC, </em>449 F.2d at 1114, for that process has already occurred and we have set out our reasons for finding it bona fide and sufficiently extensive. <em>See supra </em>pp. 99-103. The Commission\u2019s July 1982 order, read in conjunction with the EIS, adequately \u201cadvise[s] other interested agencies and the public\u201d of FERC\u2019s reasoning and the information on which it rests. Id.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We are not left to rely on <em>post hoc </em>rationalizations, <em>see Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number><em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance </em>Co., \u2014 U.S.\u2014, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 2870, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983); we have before us FERC\u2019s assessment, embodied in an opinion composed after due investigation and before the matter was brought to court.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Sending the matter back \u201cto teach the agency a lesson\u201d would be an essentially punitive measure; we can discern no benefit to the public in such a course, and no genuine service to the policies NEPA advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The result we reach, and the reasons for it, are not novel. We note particularly <em>Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. FPC, </em>453 F.2d 463 (2d Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>407 U.S. 926, 92 S.Ct. 2453, 32 L.Ed.2d 813 (1972), involving a hydroelectric plant, licensed by the Commission, with no document on file titled an EIS. The Commission had rendered a comprehensive opinion, however, which included considerable discussion of environmental impacts. Though NEPA governed, the court saw no purpose in a remand so that the agency\u2019s discussion could be circulated for comment under a corrected label. It sufficed that the Commission\u2019s opinion demonstrated \u201cfull compliance with the National Environment Policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">A more conspicuous default is described in <em>Warm Springs Dam Task Force v. Gribble, </em>621 F.2d 1017 (9th Cir.1980). There, new information about earthquake fault lines matured the Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 obligation to supplement an EIS it had filed prior to beginning construction of a dam in Sonoma County, California. The district court, ruling on a suit filed by environmentalist groups to enjoin further construction, found that the Corps had complied with NEPA even though it had taken no action to investigate the earthquake safety problem. The Ninth Circuit disagreed \u2014 -the Corps had unlawfully ignored its obligation to investigate. The appellate court noted, however, that subsequent to the start of the district court hearing the Corps had finally ordered studies; and those studies largely obviated seismic safety concerns. It therefore declined to remand; it would be pointless, the Ninth Circuit said, to \u201corder the Corps to conduct studies already completed to answer questions the Corps has already answered on a basis that could not be successfully challenged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1026.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">Finally, in <em>Swinomish Tribal Community v. FERC, </em>627 F.2d 499 (D.C.Cir.1980), our court confronted a situation similar to the one at hand. The Commission\u2019s EIS, covering construction of a hydroelectric plant, failed to discuss at all the alternative of building a dam lower than the one proposed. There was nothing facially unreasonable about building the lower dam. The Commission eventually discussed the lower dam alternative at reasonable length; as in this case, much of the discussion appeared in the Commission\u2019s order denying rehearing. We quoted from FERC\u2019s order denying rehearing, concluded that the Commission had given the lower dam alternative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>the requisite consideration, <em>id. </em>at 514, and affirmed the Commission\u2019s action.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">We appreciate the need for caution in cases in which an agency slights the EIS requirement. A reviewing court must be certain that the basic policies of NEPA are satisfied, and that a remand would indeed be pointless, before it rejects that course. <em>Arizona Public Service Co. v. FPG, </em>483 F.2d 1275 (D.C.Cir.1973), is illustrative. That case involved the Commission\u2019s denial of a license to transport natural gas, an action that arguably had a significant effect on the environment. But no EIS was filed, nor did any agency statement account for the omission. The court was not positioned to say whether the agency in fact engaged in sound environmental decisionmaking, for nothing in the record demonstrated that it had. Remand is essential in such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">We recognize too that language can be found in decisions suggesting that pleas of \u201cfutility\u201d will never do to justify noncompliance with NEPA. Invariably, such statements appear when there is no cogent demonstration, of the kind made here, that the agency gave due consideration to the relevant environmental factors and made that consideration manifest in an accessible,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> intelligible<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> form. Understandably, courts have low tolerance for futility arguments pressed by parties who seek release from an obligation to engage in serious environmental decisionmaking on the ground such an enterprise would not change the party\u2019s mind about a planned development. <em>See, e.g., Jones v. Lynn, </em>477 F.2d 885 (1st Cir. 1973) ; <em>Hanly v. Mitchell, </em>460 F.2d 640, 648 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 990, 93 S.Ct. 313, 34 L.Ed.2d 256 (1972); <em>Pennsylvania v. Morton, </em>381 F.Supp. 293, 300 n. 14 (D.D.C. 1974) ; <em>City of New York v. United States, </em>337 F.Supp. 150 (E.D.N.Y.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">But insistence on form when we have before us a case in which the agency did in fact \u201ccompl[y] with the National Environment Policy,\u201d <em>Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. FPC, </em>453 F.2d at 481, would jeopardize NEPA\u2019s \u201clofty declarations.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Remands in such cases would inevitably breed cynicism about court commands; they would likely yield going-through-the-motions responses on the part of those told to attend to the court\u2019s costly, resource-consuming instruction to redo, under the proper heading, what has already been done effectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">C. <em>Supplementation of the EIS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-14\">FOR urges, referring to submissions annexed to its brief and its Application for Leave to Adduce Additional Evidence before FERC and Motion for an Order Establishing Appropriate Procedures, <em>see supra </em>note 6, that we direct FERC to compile a supplemental EIS, thereby taking into account the most recent information relevant to PG &amp; E\u2019s ability to provide energy to NCPA, NCPA\u2019s own future electrical capacity, and future electrical demand in the NCPA service area.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> General<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>ly, the initial decision whether a supplemental EIS is required should be made by the agency, not by a reviewing court. <em>People Against Nuclear Energy </em>v. <em>NRC, </em>678 F.2d 222, 233-34 (D.C.Cir.1982), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear </em>Energy, \u2014U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 1556, 75 L.Ed.2d 534 (1983). The record does not indicate that FOR ever presented a request to the Commission asking for supplementation of the EIS, although arguably FOR could have done so even after the close of administrative proceedings with respect to the license. <em>See Michigan Consolidated Gas Co. v. FPG, </em>283 F.2d 204, 225 (D.C.Cir.1960). We need not consider the effect of FOR\u2019s apparent failure to approach the Commission first, however, since we reject FOR\u2019s request on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Under the Council on Environmental Quality\u2019s NEPA Guidelines, an agency should prepare a supplemental EIS if there exists \u201csignificant new . .. information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.9(c) (1981).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> This guideline does not mean that an agency must release and circulate a formal supplemental EIS, or a formal document explaining why the agency believes a supplemental EIS is unnecessary, every time some new information comes to light. Rather, a reasonableness standard governs. <em>See California </em>v. <em>Watt, </em>683 F.2d 1253, 1268 (9th Cir.1982), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 2083, 77 L.Ed.2d 295 (1983); <em>Warm Springs Dam Task Force v. Gribble, </em>621 F.2d 1017, 1024 (9th Cir.1980); <em>People Against Nuclear Energy </em>v. <em>NRC, </em>678 F.2d at 234 (expressly adopting the <em>Warm Springs </em>analysis); <em>Humane Society of the United States v.

Even if the information were somewhat more weighty, however, we would hesitate to command FERC to attend to it. CEC, as part of its continuing task of surveying California\u2019s energy picture, issues new forecasts and predictions every few months, each soon to be superseded by the next. Were we to order the Commission to reassess its decisions every time new forecasts were released, we would risk immobilizing the agency. As the Supreme Court has admonished:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-14\">Administrative consideration of evidence ... always creates a gap between the time the record is closed and the time the administrative decision is promulgated [and, we might add, the time the decision is judicially reviewed], ... If upon the coming down of the order litigants might demand rehearings as a matter of law because some new circumstance has arisen, some new trend has been observed, or some new fact discovered, there would be little hope that the administrative process could ever be consummated in an order that would not be subject to reopening.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7z\"><em>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v.

After prolonged consideration, FERC issued the CCWD license in 1982; review and reassessment of that decision, absent sufficient reason, should not continue indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Our decision accords FERC no license to ignore requirements Congress has established for its decisionmaking process.

Cir.1971). But in this case, while FERC fell short of a formal requirement, its decision-making adequately responded to the concerns underlying NEPA. <em>See Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. FPC, supra. </em>We therefore decline to order a remand that would cause added delay and added cost to the public without genuinely advancing any purpose served by NEPA. Accordingly, the order of the Commission is</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b191-12\"> A companion decision, issued today, resolves et al., <em>Pacific Gas and Elec.

FERC took over the functions of the Federal Power Commission (FPC) on October 1, 1977, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7172 (Supp. V 1981).

This was not the first license application filed in connection with the Calaveras project; CCWD initially applied for a license fifteen years earlier, in 1963, and applied again in 1975. The 1975 application was substantially revised to meet environmental objections, yielding the November 1978 application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b192-6\">. <em>Energy </em>is the capability of doing work, <em>e.g., </em>lighting a light bulb. Energy is measured in gigawatt-hours (Gwh). The <em>annual energy yield </em>of an electric utility system is the total amount of electrical energy the system delivers in a year. The <em>capacity </em>of an electric utility system is the maximum amount of electrical energy the system can make available at any given moment of time. Capacity is measured in megawatts (MW).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\"><em>Annual energy demand </em>indicates the total amount of energy required in a year to satisfy consumers\u2019 needs. <em>Peak demand </em>indicates the amount of energy required at those moments when consumers are using electricity at the highest rate. A utility is said to be capable of satisfying an area\u2019s <em>power needs </em>if it can satisfy peak demand, that is, if its capacity equals or exceeds peak demand. See <em>generally </em>T. Sullivan &amp; F. Heavner, Energy Reference Handbook (3d ed. 1981); California Energy Commission (CEC), Electricity Tomorrow, 1981 Final Report 17 \u2014 18 [hereafter, <em>Electricity </em>Tomorrow].</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">If electrical generating plants could run continuously at full rated capacity, then plants capable of satisfying peak demand would necessarily be capable of satisfying the area\u2019s overall energy needs as well; that is, they could produce an annual energy yield that equaled or exceeded the area\u2019s annual energy demand. In fact, however, an electrical generating plant cannot run continuously at peak capacity; CEC assumes that each plant will generate only 65% of the energy it would generate if it could run at full capacity throughout the year. For this reason, it is not always the case that generating facilities capable of meeting peak demand will be capable of satisfying an area\u2019s energy needs. Even though the generating facilities can supply the energy needed by the area at any isolated instant, they cannot perform at that level 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">The area in which the Calaveras project will be located, however, is atypical in this respect; Peak demand there is unusually high compared to average demand, and the electric utility system, in order to satisfy peak demand, must have a great deal more capacity than is ordinarily found in systems with comparable overall energy needs. As a result, the capacity needed to meet peak demand is enough to assure generation of an annual energy yield exceeding the area\u2019s annual energy demand even after taking into account the 65% assumption. Achieving the area\u2019s power needs (by meeting peak demand) will thus mean achieving the area\u2019s overall energy needs as well. <em>See Electricity Tomorrow </em>44.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b192-13\">. <em>See </em>Joint Appendix (J.A.) 631, 645 (power purchase contract between NCPA and CCWD); <em>see also </em>CEC Project Status Report No. 4, Staff Report, April, 1982 at 196 (100% of Calaveras power will go to NCPA); Affidavit of Robert E.

FOR concedes that FERC\u2019s estimates of future demand were made on the basis of the most current information then available. Brief for Environmental Petitioners at 14 [hereafter, FOR Brief], FOR requests, however, that we order a reopening of the administrative record, pursuant to 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 8257(b) (1976), so that still newer projections can be considered. See Application by Environmental Petitioners for Leave to Adduce Additional Evidence before FERC and Motion for an Order Establishing Appropriate Procedures. We deny this request on the ground that it does not \u201c \u2018clearly appear that the new evidence would compel or persuade to a contrary result.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rocky Mountain Power Co. v. FPC, </em>409 F.2d 1122, 1128 n. 21 (D.C.Cir.1969) (quoting <em>Louisville Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v.

Throughout this proceeding FERC has used the latest electricity demand figures available to it; to allow the administrative process to function we must at some point call a halt to the parade of revised and further-revised studies. <em>ICC v. City of Jersey City, </em>322 U.S. 503, 514, 64 S.Ct. 1129, 1134, 88 L.Ed. 1420 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">The precise choice of projected growth rates to predict NCPA peak electrical demand, in any case, lacks overriding significance; the NCPA service area will face a more-than-200 MW shortfall in the years to come even if we assume a zero growth rate for the area. Further, the new evidence FOR cites hardly demonstrates that anticipated decline in PG &amp; E\u2019s overall demand is great enough to change significantly PG &amp; E\u2019s overall capacity needs. FERC has argued cogently that much of the \u201cadditional evidence\u201d FOR would adduce is cumulative, unreliable, or not material. In sum, FOR has not demonstrated that the additional evidence it seeks to present would affect the outcome of the case. <em>See Greene County Planning Bd. v.

FOR claims that by 1986 \u201ca total of 339.99 MW of electricity is reasonably expected to occur by virtue of NCPA projected capacity additions.\u201d FOR Brief at 16. FOR appears to have arrived at this figure, however, by including in its count the estimated capacities of almost every potential project listed in CEC files with some predicted in-service date. The CEC Project Status Report data on which FOR draws encompass <em>all </em>proposed projects that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>have reached the stage of preliminary planning. There is no assurance that many of the projects listed will in fact be built. The Calaveras project, for example, is listed with a 1985 start-up date. Looking only to projects marked as in construction or operational \u2014 an approach within FERC\u2019s expert discretion \u2014 we find only 140.4 MW of capacity scheduled to go in service by 1986. FERC\u2019s 150 MW projection of NCPA\u2019s generating capacity thus seems to be a generous one.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Even if we look to FOR\u2019s most recent figures relating to NCPA capacity additions, material outside the agency record, we find no new information casting serious doubt on FERC\u2019s calculations; this newest set of figures shows only 152.9 MW of capacity represented by NCPA projects beyond the planning stage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b195-15\">. Federal and state views in this area do not always coincide, as one of the courses advocated by CEC illustrates.

In a hydroelectric licensing proceeding, FERC is responsible for balancing these often competing goals. Two statutes give content to this task: the Federal Power Act (FPA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The FPA, which sets forth a public interest licensing standard, requires that FERC take a comprehensive, regional approach in investigating the need for and alternatives to a proposed hydroelectric facility. NEPA, an \u201cessentially procedural\u201d mechanism, sets forth a number of requirements designed to ensure that the agency has taken a \u201chard look\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> at the reasonable alternatives to its proposed action.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">In the instant proceeding, environmental groups, private citizens, and California agencies have persistently and forcefully argued that the need for the proposed North Fork Stanislaus project\u2019s power is greatly exaggerated, and that the alleged need can easily be met through the reasonable alternative of purchasing power from intrastate or interstate suppliers. In response to these arguments, however, FERC devoted a total of two scattered and misleading sentences to the issue in its Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Regardless of adamant public criticism of its draft EIS, the agency made no revisions. Turning to the licensing order, FERC did not address the alternative of purchased power <em>at all. </em>In its Order Denying Rehearing, FERC finally gave explicit treatment to the role of PG &amp; E and other utilities in supplying NCPA\u2019s needs. This treatment, however, was limited to two points: first, the fact that the issue \u201cwas not new to this Commission\u201d; and second, a statistic in the California Energy Commission\u2019s (CEC) 1981 Electricity Tomorrow (ET)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Report concerning PG &amp; E\u2019s \u201creserve margin.\u201d FERC\u2019s treatment of this statistic, however, was patently capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-14\">The court today holds that this shoddy performance satisfies the exacting statutory requirements of the FPA and NEPA. A careful analysis of precedent and the licensing record, however, demonstrates that FERC has violated both the letter and the spirit of these statutes. I therefore respectfully dissent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-15\">I.

Section 2.1 of the EIS states that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>\u201c[t]he sale of the power generated by this project would reduce the cost of water to the residents of Calaveras County.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This section indicates that power will be sold, not only to NCPA, but \u201cthroughout the Northern California area power systems.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AiO\">A licensee\u2019s bare \u201cpurpose\u201d is not enough under either NEPA or the FPA; FERC must also determine that a \u201cneed\u201d for the power exists.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Despite the statement in section 2.1 of the EIS that power will be sold <em>\u201cthroughout </em>the Northern California area,\u201d it has not focused on statewide energy needs. Instead, it has <em>consistently </em>sought to demonstrate a need for the power solely by reference to the NCPA area. NCPA\u2019s needs, painted in apocryphal terms, formed the basis both of the EIS and of FERC\u2019s licensing order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">The reasoning presented is straightforward: based on (sharply-contested) demand projections, NCPA will have certain capacity and energy requirements in future years. Purchases from the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) and NCPA\u2019s development of its own geothermal facilities will meet a portion of this need. After accounting for these projected supplies, however, a deficit will remain.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although contradict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>ing section 2.1 of the EIS, section 1.1 states that \u201call of the electric power produced by the project will be sold to NCPA.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This power will reduce NCPA\u2019s deficit.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Until now, \u201calmost all\u201d of NCPA\u2019s needs have been met through purchase contracts with WAPA and PG &amp; E.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> FERC did not, however, consider continued power purchasing (other than the WAPA contracts) to be a feasible resource for meeting NCPA\u2019s needs, and therefore did not include this alternative in the alternatives section of the EIS.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the entire EIS, FERC gave a one-sentence explanation of why PG &amp; E could no longer be relied upon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">The contracts for the purchase of power between individual members of NCPA and PGE can be terminated on 6 to 24 months notice and cannot be considered as firm resources to meet NCPA\u2019s load in 1985, when the proposed project is scheduled to be operational.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtE\">The only other discussion of the power-purchase alternative consists of one sentence that appears one hundred forty-one pages later in the EIS, asserting that denial of the license would force NCPA \u201cto secure or develop other means to meet its electrical capacity and energy requirements, which would consume nonrenewable fossil-fuel resources.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">Public comments in response to the Draft EIS sharply criticized FERC\u2019s failure to assess power purchasing as an alternative. For example, the California Resources Agency, parent agency of the CEC, asserted that this failure, among \u201cseveral other major deficiencies,\u201d required that \u201ca new complete draft ... be prepared and made available for public comment.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Resources Agency stated: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>FERC\u2019s staff responded with three words of commentary: \u201cSee Section 1\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u2014 a reference to the one-sentence analysis that prompted the Resources Agency\u2019s criticisms.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>The need for the energy is not demonstrated. The report merely states that the Northern California Power Agency (NCPA) wishes to have their own generation facilities instead of continuing to buy energy from the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) and Pacific Gas and Electric (PGandE). There is no showing whatsoever that WAPA or PGandE have insufficient power for NCPA areas. Most, if not all, of this capacity already exists in WAPA and PGandE facilities; nor does the applicant make any kind of convincing argument that a controlled utility such as PGandE could arbitrarily deny municipalities needed, available energy.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>The Resources Agency continued; \u201cThe alternatives section is substantially deficient. It does not include even all the obvious alternatives for energy production. Certainly the alternative of continued purchases from WAPA and PGandE appears reasonable. An additional intertie with the Pacific Northwest is another alternative for peaking power that should be analyzed.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The staff responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">NCPA would continue to purchase power from the Western Area Power Administration and PGE, although the proposed project would reduce the amount of power that NCPA would be required to purchase from PGE. The power that PGE would not have to supply NCPA would come primarily from oil- and coal-burning generating units that PGE intends to acquire. An additional intertie with the Pacific Northwest would not provide the dependable capacity equivalent to the proposed project. The amount of power available from the Pacific Northwest depends on the magnitude of the power loads in the Pacific Northwest and the amount of power available for generation. At times, there is no power available for transfer from the Pacific Northwest, and, as future loads in that area increase, less power will be available to California.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">Friends of the River (FOR) also criticized the EIS\u2019s needs analysis for failing to document the need for the power. In addition, FOR objected to FERC\u2019s failure to take state-wide needs and policies into account.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> FERC\u2019s staff responded, once again, by simply referring back to section 1 of the EIS.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-13\">Comments received from Dale Meyer continued the theme of the Resources Agency\u2019s and FOR\u2019s criticisms: \u201cThe need for the project power is not documented .... The State of California Energy Commission data would lead one to conclude the peak demand for the NCPA servpce] area may be greatly overestimated.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Again the staff responded with the unhelpful observation, \u201cSee Section 1 for discussion of need for project power.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The staff added a surprising observation. Although the need for the project power was premised on the unavailability of additional firm supplies, the response to Meyer continued: \u201cIt is Staff\u2019s position that NCPA should not be denied the option to develop its own generation resources even if a private supplier can supply NCPA\u2019s needs at present.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-14\">Arguments that the power was not needed, and that NCPA could continue to secure energy from PG &amp; E and other suppliers, also dominated the licensing proceeding.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>In its licensing order, however, FERC did not discuss power purchasing from PG &amp; E or other utilities <em>at all. </em>Rather, it proceeded to use precisely the same analytic process as in the EIS: NCPA\u2019s projected needs, minus WAPA and geothermal supplies, yielding a deficit that required construction of the North Fork Stanislaus facility.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">At the rehearing stage, the environmental petitioners renewed their criticisms of the EIS\u2019s needs and alternatives analyses, arguing that CCWD had failed to meet its burden of establishing the project\u2019s need.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> This time FERC explicitly addressed the environmental petitioner\u2019s criticisms. First, it stated in its Order Denying Rehearing, the petitioner\u2019s arguments \u201care not new to this Commission.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Second, the CEC\u2019s 1981 ET Report \u201cin fact demonstrates that PG &amp; E\u2019s ability to meet-load in the future is uncertain. Under adverse hydrological conditions, PG &amp; E\u2019s reserve margin in 1985 could be as little as 3 percent.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">II. FPA Claims</p>\n<p id=\"A8Z\">A. <em>FERC\u2019s Planning Duty</em></p>\n<p id=\"At-\">Section 10(a) of the FPA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">That the project adopted ... shall be such as in the judgment of the Commission will be best adapted to a comprehensive plan for improving or developing a waterway or waterways for the use or benefit of interstate or foreign commerce, for the improvement and utilization of waterpower development, and for other beneficial public uses, including recreational purposes.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">In <em>Udall v. Federal Power </em>Commission,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> the Supreme Court held that this language imposes a comprehensive planning duty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4Kq\">The grant of authority to the Commission to alienate federal water resources does not, of course, turn simply on whether the project will be beneficial to the licensee. <em>Nor is the test'solely whether the region will be able to use the additional power. The test is whether the project will be in the public interest. </em>And that determination can be made only after an exploration of all issues relevant to the \u201cpublic interest,\u201d <em>including future power demand and supply, alternate sources of power, </em>the public interest in preserving reaches of wild rivers and wilderness areas, the preservation of anadromous fish for commercial and recreational purposes, and the protection of wildlife.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqs\">This duty to assess needs and alternatives imposes a difficult burden, fraught with the uncertainties of prediction. But as the FPC (predecessor of FERC) noted shortly after <em>Udall:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-13\">An applicant seeking to utilize the nation\u2019s waterways for the development of power has an obligation to look beyond its own needs to those of the region in which it operates. <em>Western Massachusetts Electric Co., </em>39 FPC 723, 734-35, 40 FPC 296 at 300. Far from being merely an unwelcome burden we are convinced that the <em>reasonable regional planning required to be detailed by the exhibit will, </em>in most cases, <em>be beneficial to the prospective licensee, as well as the general public.</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>One of the keys to comprehensive planning is the consideration of whether power purchasing is a feasible alternative to new construction. Power purchasing is a straightforward concept: utilities in need of energy and capacity contract with other utilities for the purchase and transfer of firm supplies. Transfer of this power is accomplished either through \u201cinterconnection\u201d \u2014 use of transmission lines \u2014 or through \u201cdisplacement\u201d across power grids.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Within the utility industry, interconnection through power-purchase contracts is an integral and basic tool. The record demonstrates that <em>every </em>California utility analyzed in the CEC\u2019s 1981 ET Report relies, to some extent, on both intrastate <em>and </em>interstate interconnections for the delivery of firm, purchased capacity and energy.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">California\u2019s state energy policy also encourages the use of interconnection for meeting future energy needs.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The ET Report, in the chapter on Policies and Recommendations, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">California should support the construction of additional transmission interconnections between the state and out-of-state utilities and between utilities within the state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">Studies by the Energy Commission, by the California Power Pool, and by the U.S. General Accounting Office have consistently shown that increased interconnections between Northwestern, California, and Southwestern utilities would provide substantial benefits to all utilities.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">At the federal level, it is clear that the FPA requires consideration of power purchasing in a licensing proceeding. In <em>Udall, </em>for example, there was evidence in the record indicating that purchased power from other sources was an alternative with \u201creasonable prospects of realization.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The Court held that the FPC\u2019s failure to explore this alternative violated its statutory duty to examine \u201cfuture power supply and demand\u201d and \u201calternative sources of power.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Even before <em>Udall, </em>federal courts had held that alternate sources of power, including interconnection, must be considered. In <em>Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power </em>Commission,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> for example, the -Second Circuit held with respect to the FPC\u2019s licensing of a New York pumped-storage hydroelectric project:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"avg-dedup-0\">The Commission neither investigated the use of interconnected power as a possible alternative to the Storm King project, nor required Consolidated Edison to supply such information. The record sets forth Consolidated Edison\u2019s interconnection with a vast network of [New England] utilities .... There is no evidence in the record to indicate that either the Commission or Consolidated Edison ever seriously considered this alternative.... <em>[T]his failure of the Commission ... cannot be reconciled with its planning re</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number><em>sponsibility under the Federal Power Act.</em><footnotemark><em>40</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">In addition to its general section 10(a) planning duties, FERC is also responsible for pursuing interconnection as a result of section 202(a) of the FPA.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApC\">For the purpose of assuring an abundant supply of electric energy throughout the United States ... the Commission is empowered to divide the country into regional districts for ... interconnection .... <em>It shall be the duty of the Commission to promote and encourage such interconnection and coordination within each such district and between such </em>districts<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApF\">Pursuant to this provision, FERC has promoted transfer of interconnected power in the California area through the Pacific Northwest \u2014 Southwest system, a series of three major north-south transmission lines linking California with the Northwest and the Southwest.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">B. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The court holds that FERC has fully complied with the letter and the spirit of its planning function. In this case, however, the record fails to support this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"AI-\">1. <em>NCPA\u2019s Relationship with PG &amp; E</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">The court accepts without question FERC\u2019s assertion that NCPA cannot rely on continued power purchases from PG &amp; E because contracts between the two utilities are short-term in nature and not necessarily renewable.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> FERC has argued that PG <em>&amp; </em>E is likely to cut off power to NCPA in the future.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Yet there is no evidence in the record to substantiate this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-15\">First, there is nothing about short-term purchase contracts that <em>per se </em>excludes them from being considered in long-range forecasting. Utility industry practice is to the contrary. In its resource planning, for example, PG &amp; E projects 600 MW of diversity exchanges with Bonneville Power Administration to continue <em>indefinitely, </em>even though the current contract is short-term and scheduled to expire in 1986<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-16\">Second, the court has pointed to nothing in the record suggesting an actual possibility that PG &amp; E would \u201crefuse to serve the NCPA area in the reliably consistent manner it has for so many years.\u201d <footnotemark>47</footnotemark> NCPA\u2019s members <em>are </em>customers of PG &amp; E. As a regulated utility, PG &amp; E bears responsibility for meeting the energy and capacity needs of its entire planning and service area. NCPA is part of this area.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The PG &amp; E area\u2019s generation needs and resources are considered as a whole both by PG &amp; E and by the CEC<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> when establishing forecasts and considering plans for facilities. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Both NCPA\u2019s expected demands and the various possible resources that might meet them are accounted for by PG &amp; E\u2019s forecasts and plans.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The only hard piece of evidence cited by FERC in support of its dismissal of future power purchases from PG &amp; E concerns the worst-ease \u201creserve margin\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> for NCPA. Citing Table III-2 of the CEC\u2019s 1981 ET Report, FERC argued in its Order Denying Rehearing that data on PG &amp; E\u2019s reserve margin demonstrates that \u201cPG &amp; E\u2019s ability to meet NCPA\u2019s load in the future is uncertain.\u201d <footnotemark>52</footnotemark> FERC uses this uncertainty to justify its conclusion that PG &amp; E might terminate service to the NCPA area. Table III \u2014 2 shows that, under a \u201cworst-case analysis,\u201d <footnotemark>53</footnotemark> PG &amp; E\u2019s reserve margin in 1985 could be as low as three percent. FERC\u2019s use of this data is capricious.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">In setting forth PG &amp; E\u2019s \u201cworst case scenario\u201d reserve-margin projections, the CEC cautioned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">The margins shown for the PG &amp; E area are for that system operating in isolation; PG &amp; E\u2019s existing interconnections with other utilities and their likely support of PG &amp; E during emergency conditions is ignored. Thus, if Diablo Canyon is not licensed and operated, the PG &amp; E area may require assistance from other utilities if unscheduled very large power plant outages are experienced during the next few years. PG &amp; E is well interconnected with other utilities and will become more so with its intended construction of the third 500 kV AC line to the Pacific Northwest. Thus, with continued cooperation among the state\u2019s utilities and regulatory' agencies in developing and implementing contingency measures as has occurred over the last few years, California will continue to have reliable electric supplies.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-14\">In short, Table III \u2014 2 calculates the reserve margin while explicitly ignoring the significance of interconnection. The table cannot then be used to show the inadequacy of such interconnection. Despite FOR\u2019s persistent efforts, FERC has not responded to this important qualification at <em>all. </em>There is nothing in the record to suggest that the CEC\u2019s analysis is erroneous. FERC\u2019s cryptic reliance on the CEC reserve-margin forecast is misleading and should therefore fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-15\">2. <em>NCPA\u2019s Relationship with Suppliers Beyond PG &amp; E</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-16\">In response to criticism of its refusal to consider outside power-purchases, FERC\u2019s staff stated: \u201cAt times, there is no power available for transfer from the Pacific-Northwest, and, as future loads in that area increase, less power will be available to California.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Based on nothing more than this assertion, FERC continued its refusal to expand the inquiry beyond PG &amp; E. The court notes that FERC did <em>not </em>undertake a detailed examination of resources beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>PG &amp; E\u2019s. Yet, it holds that FERC was not required to enlarge its inquiry.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">a. <em>Scope of Inquiry</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Central to the court\u2019s holding is the notion that the area of inquiry is within the agency\u2019s discretion, not for judicial determination. Although this is not in dispute, the limits of the inquiry must still reflect a rational determination, supported by substantial evidence. FERC\u2019s treatment of sources beyond PG &amp; E must be consistent with its planning duty. The scope of the inquiry has to bear some resemblance to reality. Current utility practice, CEC policy, and judicial precedent all demonstrate that power purchasing from beyond PG &amp; E is not at all \u201cspeculative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">b. <em>Availability of Power</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Although FERC contends there is sometimes no power available for transfer, this assertion is squarely contradicted by the record. Power is available and is forecast to be available from other California utilities as well as the Pacific Northwest,<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Canada,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> the Southwest,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> other states in the western region,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> and Mexico.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> The CEC fully anticipates that other utilities will continue outside purchases.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> The utilities themselves incorporate their reliance on these power purchases in their internal forecasts.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">The utility industry in this country is highly dependent on power purchasing and interconnection. Both intrastate and interstate arrangements are common practice.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> PG &amp; E relies heavily on power purchasing and intends to do so in the future.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> The CEC has vigorously promoted increased inter-utility reliance in its future policy recommendations.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> In light of these considerations, FERC\u2019s refusal to consider power-purchasing beyond PG &amp; E <em>at all </em>is unjustified.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-19\">c. <em>Geographic Boundary of FERC\u2019s Inquiry</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-20\">While refusing to look any further than PG &amp; E in its exploration of alternatives, FERC <em>does </em>look to WAPA,<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> a source clearly outside of the geographic boundary FERC imposed on its inquiry. To set a geographic limit for its investigation of alternatives, yet arbitrarily to ignore it by considering purchases from WAPA, constitutes capricious action on the part of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-21\">d. <em>The GEC\u2019s Posture</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-22\">The court argues that the CEC has included the Calaveras project in its future energy projections. Yet, this assumption is not supported by the CEC\u2019s ET Report. This report, on which the majority relies, contains two sets of energy projections. The first, prepared by PG &amp; E, is entitled \u201cProposed Utility Resource Plan.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> The second, prepared by the CEC itself, is entitled \u201cAlternative Scenario.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> PG &amp; E\u2019s \u201cProposed Utility Resource Plan\u201d does include Calaveras in its forecast.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> The CEC\u2019s \u201cAlternative Scenario,\u201d however, does not.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> The CEC explicitly states that the \u201cAlternative Scenario\u201d is its \u201cPreferred Out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>look\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> and the forecast that it adopts in planning.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Special weight should be given to the official state policy embodied in the CEC recommendation.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> This court should look to the \u201cPreferred Outlook\u201d which allows for California\u2019s future energy needs absent power from the Calaveras project.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The majority emphasizes that California has set a goal of limiting out-of-state power purchases.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> Indeed, this statement is made once in the ET Report.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> It must, however, be viewed within the context of the entire report. The importance of future construction of additional transmission interconnections with out-of-state utilities and b\u00e9tween utilities within the state receives far greater emphasis.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> The CEC actively promotes continued and increased interconnection in the future while ranking additional hydroelectric development low among its priorities.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The California Resources Agency, the entity charged with registering the state\u2019s reaction, has vigorously opposed the Calav-eras project throughout all stages of the proceedings. It found FERC\u2019s treatment of the power-purchasing alternative completely inadequate and without any basis.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Curiously, the court ignores the Resources Agency\u2019s substantial opposition to the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-14\">III. NEPA Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b215-15\">A. <em>The Requirements of NEPA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-16\">NEPA requires that in all significant federal actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-17\">all agencies of the Federal Government shall ... study, develop, and describe appropriate alternatives to recommended courses of action in any proposal which involves unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-18\">The agency must set forth its analysis in a \u201cdetailed statement,\u201d the EIS. NEPA sets forth exacting procedural requirements governing exactly what must be included in the EIS. These requirements cut to the very heart of NEPA; they are the \u201clinchpin\u201d of the Act.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-19\">Determining which alternatives are \u201cappropriate,\u201d therefore warranting detailed treatment, is a common-sense inquiry. An \u201cEIS cannot be found wanting simply because the agency failed to include every alternative device and thought conceivable by the mind of man.\u201d<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> .

The standard of review is therefore governed by the \u201crule of reason.\u201d<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> In evaluating an agency\u2019s choice of alternatives for inclusion in the EIS, a reviewing court gives cohtent to the rule-of-reason standard by looking to, <em>inter alia, </em>agency and judicial precedents, comments received by the agency in response to the draft EIS, and the administrative record.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> The quest is to ensure that the agency has taken a \u201chard look\u201d at alternatives; <footnotemark>93</footnotemark> the \u201cdetailed statement\u201d requirement \u201cprevents stubborn problems from being shielded from internal and external scrutiny.\u201d<footnotemark>94</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">In considering whether an agency\u2019s discussion of alternatives complies with NEPA, a reviewing court must ultimately employ two criteria: it must decide (a) whether the discussion indicates that the agency in \u201cgood-faith objectivity\u201d has taken the required \u201chard look\u201d at alternatives; <footnotemark>95</footnotemark> and (b) whether the discussion is detailed enough to permit those who did not participate in its preparation to \u201cunderstand and consider meaningfully\u201d the reasoning, premises, and data relied upon, and to permit a \u201creasoned choice among different courses of action.\u201d<footnotemark>96</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-14\">The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) has promulgated regulations governing the implementation of NEPA.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> These regulations are entitled to \u201csubstantial deference\u201d as interpretations of NEPA.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> Moreover, FERC\u2019s own regulations bind it to deal fully \u201cwith alternative courses of action to the proposal and, to the maximum extent practicable, the environmental effects of each alternative.\u201d<footnotemark>99</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-15\">The CEQ regulations require the Commission to <em>\u201c[r]igorously </em>explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives.\u201d <footnotemark>100</footnotemark> It must \u201cidentify any methodologies used and shall make explicit reference ... to the scientific and other sources relied upon for conclusion in the statement.\u201d<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> The agency must respond to comments received regarding the Draft EIS.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> If it determines that the comments do not warrant further agency response, an explanation must be given, \u201cciting the sources, authorities, or reasons which support the agency\u2019s position ....\u201d<footnotemark>103</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>B. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The FPA and NEPA impose many similar requirements on the agency. The procedural requirements of NEPA, however, are distinct from and far more stringent than the duties imposed by the FPA. Compliance with the FPA is no guarantee of compliance with NEPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">1. <em>Power Purchasing from Beyond PG &amp; E</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The court recognizes that power purchasing from sources beyond PG &amp; E received no treatment in the EIS.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> Yet because it finds purchasing to be \u201cspeculative,\u201d<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> it holds that this alternative does not require detailed consideration in the EIS. At least five factors demonstrate that, under the \u201crule of reason,\u201d power purchasing is an \u201cobvious,\u201d \u201creasonable,\u201d and completely \u201cfeasible\u201d alternative that must receive \u201cdetailed\u201d treatment in the EIS.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">a. <em>Public comments. </em>Numerous commentators noted that the Draft EIS had failed absolutely to provide any information why FERC believed that, with the exception of WAPA sales, NCPA could no longer rely on contractual deliveries of firm capacity and energy. They noted the alternative, pursued by numerous other California utilities, of interconnection with the Northwest.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">b. <em>Industry practice. </em>The power-purchase contract is an integral and basic tool in the utility industry. The record demonstrates that <em>every </em>California utility analyzed in the CEC\u2019s 1981 ET Report relies, to some extent, on both intrastate <em>and </em>interstate interconnections for the delivery of firm, purchased capacity and energy.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-15\">c. <em>California policy. </em>California ranks power-pooling and interconnections among utilities near the top of its list of \u201cPreferred Options for Meeting Electricity Needs\u201d\u2014 and much higher than conventional hydro facilities.<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> State policy actively encourages these practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-16\">d. <em>NCPA\u2019s previous practice. </em>Until now, NCPA has always met its power needs exclusively through power purchasing from other suppliers. These contractual deliveries have apparently been sufficient to meet NCPA\u2019s needs, even in adverse hydro years. This history demonstrates the reasonableness of continued purchasing as an \u201calternative\u201d to be considered under NEPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-17\">e. <em>Precedent. </em>Previous cases that have examined this issue have held that power purchasing is a reasonable alternative requiring detailed treatment in an EIS. In <em>National Wildlife Federation v. </em>Andrus,<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> for example, the Department of the Interi- or had authorized a 23 MW powerplant on the San Juan River in New Mexico. In its EIS, the department dismissed the alternative of \u201cobtaining the necessary power from alternative power sources already extant in the area\u201d in a three-sentence- discussion strikingly similar to FERC\u2019s cryptic analysis in the instant case.<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>held this analysis \u201clacking in the detail which is clearly required by the statute itself and in the \u2018rigorous exploration and objective evaluation of the environmental impacts of all reasonable alternative actions, particularly those that might . .. avoid some or all of the adverse environmental effects.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> Moreover, the alternative of \u201cobtaining power from the uncommitted reserves stored in the Colorado River Storage Project system\u201d was brought to the agency\u2019s attention, but not treated at all in the EIS. The court held that this alternative was \u201cnot unreasonable .. . and [it] should have been discussed in the FES.\u201d <footnotemark>113</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The failure to consider power purchasing in <em>National Wildlife </em>contrasts with <em>Mason County Medical Association v. Knebel.</em><footnotemark><em>114</em></footnotemark><em> </em>There the issue was whether the Rural Electrification Administration, in authorizing a coal-fired steam generating facility, had failed in its EIS \u201c \u2018to adequately discuss or seriously consider the alternative of purchasing winter peak power\u2019 from nearby \u2018summer-peaking\u2019 utilities\u201d in neighboring states.<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> The district court and the court of appeals held that this alternative had received sufficient consideration in the EIS. The EIS <em>itself </em>set forth <em>seven distinct reasons </em>why'power purchasing could not meet projected needs. These reasons were supported by citation in the EIS to various studies, letters, and affidavits. The EIS clearly showed that other utilities had been contacted about power purchasing; it set forth in a coherent, comprehensive manner why those utilities were unable or unwilling to supply the projected needs. Based on this treatment of the power-purchasing alternative, the Sixth Circuit held that the EIS \u201cpresents sufficient information for a reasoned choice of alternatives.\u201d<footnotemark>116</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">The power-purchasing issue also was presented in <em>Swinomish Tribal Community </em>v. <em>FERC.</em><footnotemark><em>117</em></footnotemark><em> </em>There FERC had authorized the raising of the Ross Dam, in Seattle, Washington, to provide additional power for Seattle\u2019s projected growth in energy demand. The D.C. Circuit found that power purchasing, along with other alternatives, had been \u201cconsidered in detail\u201d in the EIS: The annual costs of power purchasing were \u201cestablished and compared\u201d with the costs of alternative energy sources, and the \u201cbeneficial and detrimental environmental effects\u201d of purchased power were \u201ccarefully considered\u201d and explicated in the EIS.<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> Moreover, it was \u201cunchallenged\u201d that Seattle\u2019s major supplier had already given the city written notice that, within several years, it would be unable to meet Seattle\u2019s growth in energy demand.<footnotemark>119</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-14\">2. <em>Rehabilitation of the EIS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-15\">The court holds that although FERC violated NEPA by failing to include its discussion of power purchasing in the EIS, the violation was cured by the Commission\u2019s July 1982 Order Denying Rehearing. I agree that \u201cthe EIS is not an end in itself, but rather a means toward the goal of better decision-making.\u201d<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> FERC, however, failed to meet this goal through either the EIS, the Order Denying Rehearing, or both documents read together.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-16\">The Order Denying Rehearing did <em>not </em>contain the detailed consideration of alternatives lacking in the EIS.<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> Moreover, its \u201canalysis\u201d was limited to Table III \u2014 2<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> of the ET Report which completely ignores <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>interconnection. Reliance on this table\u2019s statistics in isolation results in inaccurate treatment of PG &amp; E.<footnotemark>123</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Of even greater significance, the Order Denying Rehearing did not discuss reliance on utilities beyond PG &amp; E <em>at all; </em>the discussion was limited to PG &amp; E\u2019s role. Power purchasing from beyond PG &amp; E was a reasonable alternative requiring detailed treatment in the EIS. The Order Denying' Rehearing did nothing to correct the EIS\u2019s failure to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Even if the Order Denying Rehearing had contained the discussion lacking in the EIS, however, it would not cure FERC\u2019s NEPA violation. In analyzing the adequacy of an EIS, the reviewing court may look to the entire administrative record only for certain narrowly defined reasons. First, the EIS may, for the sake of convenience, have cited to data, studies, and other materials in the administrative record to support its analyses of alternatives.<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> Second, \u201c[s]tudy of the administrative record by the court helps to assess the degree of discussion any particular alternative deserves ....\u201d<footnotemark>125</footnotemark> Dissection of the record cannot, however, cure an otherwise-defective EIS. \u201cNEPA expressly places the burden of compiling information on the agency so that the public and interested government departments can conveniently monitor and criticize the agency\u2019s action.\u201d<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> A court \u201ccan use the administrative record to set the standard for how much discussion within the EIS a particular alternative merits, but cannot deem the unincorporated record to satisfy that standard.\u201d<footnotemark>127</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">In the instant case the Order Denying Rehearing was not circulated for comment. There was no opportunity for the public and other agencies to raise objections to the order through comments. To say that the reading of the Order Denying Rehearing together with the EIS satisfies the statute is to undermine the very foundation of NEPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">The court expresses the fear that a remand of this case would breed cynicism towards the law.<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> I strongly disagree. NEPA\u2019s strict procedural requirements are not a \u201cpointless technicality.\u201d<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> They are the procedural means Congress and the CEQ have specified \u201cto vindicate the substantive goals of NEPA.\u201d<footnotemark>130</footnotemark> This court is faced with an instance in which FERC has palpably failed to carry out its statutorily mandated investigation. It is the function of a reviewing court to determine whether an agency has complied with its congressional mandate, not to decide when a.noncomplying agency is \u201cclose enough.\u201d Failure to order a remand, in light of blatant statutory violations, can only breed far greater cynicism towards the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-14\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b219-15\">The court today holds that power purchasing from beyond the PG &amp; E area need not be considered under either the FPA or NEPA. As the court notes, predictions of this type confront a degree of uncertainty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>and risk without historical precedent.<footnotemark>131</footnotemark> It is precisely because of such uncertainty and risk, however, that FERC\u2019s myopic approach must be rejected. As uncertainty increases, so does the need for comprehensive and intelligent planning. \u201cDespite the explosion of uncertainty \u2014 indeed because of it \u2014 it is more urgent than ever to plan and to share risks regionally.\u201d <footnotemark>132</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The FPA mandates regional planning, the promotion of interconnection, and the consideration of alternate sources of power. NEPA requires the rigorous consideration of alternatives in a form which will facilitate public comment. Because FERC has abdicated these statutory duties, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-9\">. <em>Kleppe v.

Yet, NEPA\u2019s procedures are designed to ensure consideration of alternate means of achieving a given objective; means which might prove environmentally less destructive.

If power purchases can meet this objective, they are a reasonable alternative and one which requires inclusion in the EIS.
