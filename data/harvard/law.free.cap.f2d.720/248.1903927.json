The judgments were entered following defendants\u2019 agreement, consented to by the government and the court, to plead guilty on that count on the condition that they be allowed to challenge on appeal the lawfulness of the seizure by the United States Coast Guard of the marijuana from the hold of the vessel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendants contend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>here that the judgments should be reversed and the indictment dismissed because (1) the vessel was not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and hence the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and (2) the Coast Guard\u2019s boarding, search, and seizure of the vessel violated defendants\u2019 rights under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. Although we find no merit in the second ground, we conclude that a question remains as to the jurisdictional ground and we remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">Pinto-Mejia and his codefendants are Colombian nationals who were members of the crew of the RICARDO, a vessel intercepted by the Coast Guard on the high seas, some 200 miles off the point of Montauk. Most of the material facts as to the interception, presented to the district court largely through affidavits and testimony at a suppression hearing, are undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah0\">A. <em>The Interception, Boarding, and Search of the RICARDO</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">On June 26, 1982, the Coast Guard cutter DUANE, an ocean-going ship, was engaged in a cadet training cruise and a routine law enforcement patrol in an area approximately 100 miles southeast of Nantucket, Massachusetts. At approximately 8:10 a.m., deck officer Ensign Thomas Willis detected by radar a vessel headed on a southwesterly course toward the United States mainland. The course of the DUANE was then altered so that the vessel could be intercepted and its identity determined. At about 9:15 a.m., Willis sighted the vessel through high-powered binoculars from a distance of about seven miles and observed that it appeared to be a fishing boat some 70 t\u00f3 80 feet long, traveling at a speed of about 9 knots. The vessel, which was not flying a flag, was then on a southeasterly course headed away from the mainland. As the DUANE drew closer to the fishing boat, Willis noticed that the name \u201cRICARDO\u201d was crudely painted on the stern of the boat, that there was a large quantity of running rust on the hull, that the boat\u2019s block and tackle were in a state of disrepair, and that the RICARDO carried no fishing gear such as would normally be carried by an active fishing vessel. Willis also noted that the waterline on the RICARDO appeared to be freshly painted and to be higher than the level of the boat\u2019s natural waterline. Based on these observations and his Coast Guard experience with other vessels exhibiting similar characteristics, Willis concluded that the RICARDO might be smuggling narcotics. ^ cbeck ^he DUANE s computer revea^ that on April 29, 1982, the RICAR1)0 had been seen in Barranquilla, Colombla\u2019 a known dru^ exporting port.</p>\n<p id=\"AIB\">As the DUANE approached the RICARDO, the Coast Guard attempted to contact the RICARDO by radio, by the ship\u2019s public address system, and by bullhorn in both Spanish and English, requesting that the RICARDO call the DUANE by radio. No response was received, but a half-hour later a member of the RICARDO\u2019s crew raised a Venezuelan flag. The Coast Guard continaed /e(iuests radf and broadcast a message that the DUANE was attempting to contact the Venezuelan f\u00b0r pem\u201c to board the RI'</p>\n<p id=\"A2n\">During the afternoon of June 26, as the DUANE followed the RICARDO at a distance of some 200 to 300 yards&gt; Lieutenant Thomas Haas, the officer in charge of cadet training, detected from his position on the deck of the DUANE the odor of marijuana drifting back from the RICARDO.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Haas testified, without objection from the defend ants, that the operations officer and commanding officer also had smelled the odor marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqj\">The DUANE continued to follow the RICARDO and to try to establish communication with it throughout June 26 and on June 27. On the afternoon of June 27, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Coast Guard repeatedly sought permission to board the RICARDO, and eventually one of the crew members of the RICARDO came onto the deck and directed a thumbs-up signal toward the DUANE, which the Coast Guard interpreted as permission to board.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following the thumbs-up signal, the Coast Guard broadcast a request that the RICARDO stop, which it promptly did. Five Coast Guardsmen boarded the RICARDO, with Ensign Willis in charge. Consistent with Coast Guard policy, all members of the boarding party were armed, but their weapons were neither aimed at the RICARDO\u2019s crew nor carried in such a manner as to give the impression that force was being used.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Once on board the RICARDO, Willis was informed<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by one member of the crew, later identified as defendant Roberto Nunez-Riasco, that the captain of the RICARDO had sailed away in a small boat three days earlier, seeking food and water, and had taken the RICARDO\u2019s registration papers and other documentation with him. Nunez-Riasco stated that he did not know from where the RICARDO was coming or where it was going, and that the captain had told the crew to steer a 180-degree course until he returned. Willis requested and received from Nunez-Riasco permission to look around the vessel and to open its compartments. Willis and members of the boarding party then opened the main hold and discovered what turned out to be approximately 20 tons of marijuana. Upon searching the rest of the vessel, Willis found, among other things, four flags under a mattress, including flags of Ecuador and the Dominican Republic. A crew member stated that the boat was of Venezuelan nationality.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Notwithstanding discovery of the marijuana, the Coast Guard informed the RICARDO\u2019s crewmen that they were not under arrest, that the Coast Guardsmen were guests on board, and that the crewmen need not accede to requests by the Coast Guardsmen. A member of the crew gave permission for the Coast Guard to pilot the RICARDO in a northwesterly direction. Eventually, on June 28 at about 7:00 p.m., the crewmen were informed that they were under arrest by authority of the United States government.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">B. <em>The Indictment and the Ensuing Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">Each member of the RICARDO\u2019s crew was charged in a two-count indictment with violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 955a(a) and with conspiring to violate that provision, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 955c. Section 955a(a) makes it unlawful for \u201cany person on board a ... vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States on the high seas\u201d to possess a controlled substance with the intent to manufacture or distribute it. In 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 955b(d), \u201cvessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\u201d is defined to \u201cinclude[ ] a vessel without nationality or a vessel assimilated to a vessel without nationality, in accordance with paragraph (2) of article 6 of the Convention on the High Seas, 1958.\u201d Article 6 of the Convention on the High Seas, <em>opened for signature </em>April 29, 1958, 13 U.S.T. 2312, T.I.A.S. No. 5200 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>(\u201cConvention on the High Seas\u201d), provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">Article 6: 1. Ships shall sail under the flag of one State only and, save in exceptional cases expressly provided for in international treaties or in these articles, shall be subject to its exclusive jurisdiction on the high seas. A ship may not change its flag during a voyage or while in a port of call, save in the case of a real transfer of ownership or change of registry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">2. A ship which sails under the flags of two or more States, using them according to convenience, may not claim any of the nationalities in question with respect to any other State, and may be assimilated to a ship without nationality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Eight defendants promptly moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the RICARDO was not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. All defendants moved to suppress, <em>inter alia, </em>the marijuana seized from the RICARDO on the ground that the Coast Guard\u2019s boarding, search, and seizure had violated their Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">1. <em>The Denial of the Jurisdictional Motions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">Prior to holding an evidentiary hearing, the district court, after hearing argument and considering the above events as described in the parties\u2019 papers, denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court found that (1) when first observed by the Coast Guard, the RICARDO was flying no flag and was headed toward the United States mainland; (2) the RICARDO changed course away from the mainland and hoisted a Venezuelan flag as the DUANE neared; (3) the RICARDO was found to be carrying flags of several other states; and (4) although the RICARDO claimed Venezuelan nationality, its registration with that country had expired more than two years before the seizure occurred. On the basis of these findings, the court ruled that the RICARDO was a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States because \u201cat the very least, ... when seized, [it] was a vessel \u2018assimilated to a stateless vessel,\u2019 and at best, ... was a vessel without nationality.\u201d (Sept. 30, 1982 Transcript (\u201c9/30 Tr.\u201d) at 30.)</p>\n<p id=\"b349-15\">For its finding that the RICARDO\u2019s registration had expired, the court initially relied on the government\u2019s assertion in its brief that it had obtained a certificate from the Venezuelan Ministry of Transportation and Communications, Bureau of Maritime Transportation and Traffic (the \u201cCertificate\u201d), stating that the RICARDO had been registered in Venezuela, but that the registration had expired as of May 21, 1980, and no record of a renewal or reinstatement could be found. Some weeks later, at the evidentiary hearing on defendants\u2019 motions to suppress, the government offered in evidence the Venezuelan Certificate itself. The Certificate, which is set out in full in the margin,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> stated in part that the RICAR<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>DO had been registered in Venezuela; that it had \u201cevidently sailed clandestinely\u201d from a Venezuelan port and had last been heard from on May 21, 1979; and that \u201cfailing to have any further news from it since that date, May 21, 1979, the Maritime Authority has found grounds for the expiration of its registration .... \u201d The Certificate concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\">Therefore, the motor boat \u201cRicardo\u201d, originally registered in the Harbor Master\u2019s Office of Las Piedras, in view of the expiration of its registration, as of May 21,1980, could not invoke the Venezuelan nationality to protect its status under any circumstance, particularly in situations involving a crime or infraction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">Reinstatement to its status of Venezuelan vessel after the said date (May 21, 1980) would have required the renewal of its documents, after justifying its absence and receiving a favorable decision from the Venezuelan authorities, something that did not ever take place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Defendants objected to the introduction of the Certificate under Fed.R.Evid. 803(10), which permits receipt of an appropriate certification of the absence of a public record; their argument was cut short, however, by the government\u2019s disclaimer of reliance on Rule 803(10) and its invocation instead of Rule 803(8), which governs existing public records. The court agreed that the Certificate did not show an absence of a record, and it admitted the document into evidence over defendants\u2019 objections that admission was not authorized by Rule 803(8) and would violate their rights of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">In a ruling announced on October 20, 1982, the court stated that it had considered the Venezuelan Certificate and confirmed its September 30, 1982 finding that the RICARDO was a stateless vessel at the time of its seizure. Accordingly, the court adhered to its decision denying defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the indictment for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">2. <em>The Denial of the Suppression Motions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">Following the evidentiary hearing, the district court denied defendants\u2019 motions to suppress the marijuana seized from the RICARDO. The court ruled that, in all the circumstances set forth above, the Coast Guard\u2019s stopping, boarding, and search of the RICARDO were based upon a reasonable suspicion that the vessel was engaged in narcotics smuggling. In addition, the court held that defendants had voluntarily consented to the stopping, boarding, and search.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-14\">3. <em>The Conditional Pleas of Guilty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-15\">Following these rulings, each defendant entered a conditional plea of guilty to one count of violation of \u00a7 955a(a), and the government agreed to the dismissal of the conspiracy count. With the approval of the court, the parties stipulated that defendants reserved their right to appeal the \u201clawfulness of the Coast Guard\u2019s seizure of\u201d the marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>II. ISSUES PRESERVED FOR APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"AW7\">On this appeal defendants pursue their contentions that the United States lacks jurisdiction to prosecute them and that the actions of the Coast Guard violated their Fourth Amendment rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The stipulation pursuant to which the pleas of guilty were entered conditioned those pleas on defendants\u2019 being \u201cpermitted to reserve and raise only the following issue on appeal from the judgment herein, i.e. the lawfulness of the Coast Guard\u2019s seizure of approximately 20 tons of marijuana from the hold of the \u2018Ricardo\u2019 on June 27, 1982.\u201d The narrowness of this stipulation creates questions as to whether defendants are entitled to pursue their jurisdictional and constitutional challenges on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">A. <em>The Jurisdictional Question</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In its brief, the government has suggested that defendants\u2019 challenge to the jurisdiction of the United States to prosecute them is improper because it is beyond the issue of \u201cseizure\u201d preserved by the stipulation. We reject the government\u2019s suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">A question as to the court\u2019s jurisdiction to try a defendant may be raised at any time during the pendency of the proceedings. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b). Accordingly, in ruling in particular cases that a defendant who has pleaded guilty has waived his right to appeal or that his conditional plea has preserved only the specifically mentioned issues and waived all others, we have taken care to specify that the waiver applies only to defects that are \u201cnon-jurisdictional.\u201d <em>E.g., United States v. Doyle, </em>348 F.2d 715, 718-19 (2d Cir.) (quoting <em>United States v. Spada, </em>331 F.2d 995, 996 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 865, 85 S.Ct. 130, 13 L.Ed.2d 67 (1964)), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 843, 86 S.Ct. 89, 15 L.Ed.2d 84 (1965). Since it is a responsibility of the appellate court no less than of the trial court to see to it that the jurisdiction of the trial court, which is defined and limited by statute, is not exceeded, <em>Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Co. v. Mottley, </em>211 U.S. 149, 152, 29 S.Ct. 42, 53 L.Ed. 126 (1908), and since the stipulation is construed <em>infra </em>to preserve issues of fact and law arising from the stopping and boarding of the RICARDO as well as the seizure of marijuana, we will entertain on appeal defendants\u2019 challenge to the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">B. <em>The Constitutional Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">Notwithstanding the stipulation\u2019s preservation of the right to appeal \u201conly\u201d the lawfulness of the Coast Guard\u2019s \u201cseizure\u201d of the marijuana from the hold of the RICARDO, defendants have proceeded to challenge the lawfulness not only of the seizure itself but also of the Coast Guard\u2019s stopping and boarding of the vessel. The government properly notes that the defendants have no Fourth Amendment right to challenge only the seizure. As crew members of the RICARDO having no proprietary interest in the vessel\u2019s cargo and having no legitimate expectation of privacy in its cargo hold, defendants have no personal rights to vindicate in challenging the Coast Guard\u2019s search of the cargo hold or the seizure of the marijuana, and such a challenge would be rejected on that ground. <em>See United States v. Salvucci, </em>448 U.S. 83, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1980); <em>Rakas v. Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978); <em>United States v. Streifel, </em>665 F.2d 414, 419 n. 6 (2d Cir.1981); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>589 F.2d 210, 214 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>The government has not, however, disputed as unauthorized by the stipulation defendants\u2019 appeal from the district court\u2019s rulings upholding the Coast Guard\u2019s stopping and boarding of the RICARDO. In the circumstances, we shall, on this occasion, give the parties to the stipulation the benefit of the doubt and infer that they and the court understood that defendants were to preserve their right to challenge such actions leading to the seizure as they had the right to challenge, <em>i.e., </em>the Coast Guard\u2019s stopping and boarding of the RICARDO.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the future, however, we shall expect the parties to use care and precision in framing the issues to be preserved for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">III. JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"A6b\">Defendants attack the court\u2019s jurisdiction on two fronts. They contend that the district court\u2019s ruling that the RICARDO was stateless had an insufficient foundation and that since the RICARDO was not shown to be stateless it was not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States within the meaning of \u00a7 955a(a). In addition they contend that even if the RICARDO was stateless, it was not subject to prosecution in United States courts because there was no showing of any nexus between the United States and the RICARDO. While we reject the latter contention, we find some merit in the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">A. <em>Statelessness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The district court cited four factors that led it to conclude that the RICARDO \u201cat the very least, ... when seized, was a vessel \u2018assimilated to a stateless vessel,\u2019 and at best, ... was a vessel without nationality.\u201d (9/30 Tr. at 30.) The first two factors \u2014 that when first sighted the RICARDO was flying no flag, and that after being sighted the RICARDO changed course and headed away from the United States mainland \u2014 are, by themselves, wholly inadequate to support a finding of statelessness. The third factor \u2014 that flags of several states were found aboard the RICARDO \u2014 also is inconclusive. The RICARDO was observed flying only the Venezuelan flag, and its crew claimed that it was of Venezuelan nationality.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There was no evidence that it at any time \u201csail[ed] under\u201d any flag other than that of Venezuela, using those other flags \u201caccording to convenience\u201d within the meaning of Article 6, paragraph 2 of the Convention on the High Seas. Further, Ensign Willis testified that he did not consider it unusual to find flags of several countries on the RICARDO because it is common practice for a ship of one nationality to fly the flag of another country, in addition to that of its own country, upon entering the foreign country\u2019s port. Thus, the finding of the flags of several states aboard the RICARDO did not provide a sound basis for concluding that the RICARDO was assimilated to a ship without nationality.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">The propriety of the court\u2019s conclusion that the RICARDO was stateless thus depends upon whether the district court properly relied on its fourth factor, the Venezuelan Certificate showing that the vessel\u2019s Venezuelan registration had expired in 1980. Despite its claim at the suppression hearing that it relied only on Fed.R.Evid. 803(8) as the basis for admissibility of the Certificate, the government here invokes both Rule 803(8) and Rule 803(10). We conclude that neither of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>exceptions to the hearsay rule authorized the district court\u2019s receipt of the document into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Fed.R.Evid. 803(10) provides that the following category of evidence is not excluded by the hearsay rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">(10) <em>Absence of public record or entry. </em>To prove the absence of a record, report, statement, or data compilation, in any form, or the nonoccurrence or nonexistence of a matter of which a record, report, statement, or data compilation, in any form, was regularly made and preserved by a public office or agency, evidence in the form of a certification in accordance with rule 902, or testimony, that diligent search failed to disclose the record, report, statement, or data compilation, or entry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">At the hearing the district court ruled that the Venezuelan Certificate did not qualify as an absence of public record, and we believe this ruling was correct. What is envisioned by Rule 803(10) is a statement that, after a diligent search of the records regularly kept by a public office or agency, a certain record, entry, report, etc., has not been found. <em>United States v. Yakobov, </em>712 F.2d 20, 26-27 (2d Cir.1983). From such a statement the factfinder may infer that an event that normally would be reflected in the public record did not occur. Instead of a certification of an absence of record, the Venezuelan Certificate is principally a potpourri of descriptions of existing records <em>(e.g., </em>confirming that the RICARDO had been registered in Venezuela), speculation (stating that the RICARDO \u201cevidently sailed clandestinely from Venequelan [sic] port\u201d), description of official action (\u201cthe Maritime Authority has found grounds for the expiration of [the RICARDO\u2019s] registration\u201d), and statement of legal conclusion (\u201cin view of the expiration of its registration, as of May 21, 1980, [the RICARDO] could not invoke the Venezuelan nationality to protect its status under any circumstance, particularly in situations involving a crime or infraction\u201d). Only after the descriptions of existing records, speculation, past government actions, and legal conclusion does the Venezuelan Certificate make a statement that could possibly be construed, in part, as certifying the absence of a record: it states that \u201c[Reinstatement\u201d of the RICARDO\u2019s status as a Venezuelan vessel \u201cwould have required the renewal of its documents, after justifying its absence and receiving a favorable decision from the Venezuelan authorities, something that did not ever take place.\u201d Assuming that this means that there is no record of a request for reinstatement, a statement that Venezuelan records reveal no application for reinstatement is virtually meaningless standing alone. Its significance depends on the Certificate\u2019s earlier statements, most particularly on that describing the Venezuelan authority\u2019s revocation of the RICARDO\u2019s registration: without knowing of the revocation, one cannot draw an inference of nonregistration from a failure to seek reinstatement. Hence we regard the Venezuelan Certificate as inappropriate for receipt in evidence under Rule 803(10), and we reject the government\u2019s attempt to invoke that rule on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Nor do we find the Venezuelan Certificate admissible under Rule 803(8), the rule under which it was offered in the district court. Rule 803(8) provides that certain types of records and reports are not excluded by the hearsay rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-10\">(8) <em>Public records and reports. </em>Records, reports, statements, or data compilations, in any form, of public offices or agencies, setting forth (A) the activities of the office or agency, or (B) matters observed pursuant to duty imposed by law as to which matters there was a duty to report, excluding, however, in criminal cases matters observed by police officers and other law enforcement personnel, or (C) in civil actions and proceedings and against the Government in criminal cases, factual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law, unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">An examination of the Certificate reveals that both as a whole and in pertinent part the Certificate runs afoul of Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>803(8)(C)\u2019s exclusion of \u201cfactual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law\u201d against defendants in criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">First, we note that the Certificate, made by the District Director General of Water Transportation, does not fit within either part (A) or part (B) of Rule 803(8), as it sets forth neither the activities of an office or agency nor matters observed by the District Director General. Rather, the Certificate purports to report the factual findings of the District Director General as a result of his investigation into the RICARDO\u2019s status in his \u201cexercis[e of] the attributes conferred upon him by law.\u201d Further, the very part of the Certificate on which the court focused for its finding that the RICARDO\u2019s Venezuelan registration had expired, <em>i.e., </em>the statement that \u201cthe Maritime Authority has found grounds for the expiration of its registration\u201d \u201cas of May 21, 1980,\u201d indicates that the Maritime Authority made an investigation resulting in its finding that grounds existed for the revocation of the registration. We thus conclude that neither the Certificate as a whole nor the part of the Certificate disclosing the revocation of registration was admissible against the defendants under Rule 803(8)(C). Further, since the reason for Rule 803(8)\u2019s nonauthorization of the use of investigative findings against defendants in criminal cases is to avoid abridgment of a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 803(8)(C) advisory committee note; <em>United States v. Oates, </em>560 F.2d 45, 69-84 (2d Cir.1977), admission of such investigative findings against defendants in criminal cases is also not authorized by Rule 803(24), the \u201ccatchall\u201d exception for trustworthy hearsay. <em>Id. </em>at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Nor do we see that the contents or circumstances of the Certificate should inspire any particular confidence in its trustworthiness. The Certificate contains obvious speculation as to the RICARDO\u2019s \u201cevident[ ]\u201d \u201cclandestine[ ]\u201d movement, and has an aura of eagerness to deny the RICARDO the ability to \u201cinvoke the Venezuelan nationality to protect its status ... in situations involving a crime or infraction.\u201d Most importantly, the Certificate, which does not identify the \u201cMaritime Authority\u201d that apparently revoked the RICARDO\u2019s registration, also does not state <em>when </em>that Authority took its action, and there is nothing to indicate that the finding of grounds for expiration was not made after the Coast Guard intercepted the RICARDO and inquired as to its registration. If the Maritime Authority\u2019s action did precede the Coast Guard\u2019s involvement with the RICARDO, one might expect the Certificate to contain a plain statement that the RICARDO was unregistered in Venezuela on June 27 when it was boarded by the Coast Guard. The absence of such a straightforward statement and the silence of the Certificate as to the date of the Authority\u2019s action are circumstances suggesting that the Certificate lacks the trustworthiness necessary to support its admission as proof that the RICARDO was stateless on June 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">In sum, we conclude that the Certificate was improperly received by the district court to show the RICARDO\u2019s statelessness. As none of the other evidence presented by the government established that fact, there was no substantial basis for the court\u2019s ruling that the RICARDO was subject to the jurisdiction of the United States within the meaning of \u00a7 955a(a). We therefore remand to the district court for such further proceedings on defendants\u2019 jurisdictional challenges as may be appropriate. If the government adduces no new evidence sufficient to show that the RICARDO was stateless, the indictment must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">B. <em>The Nexus Contention</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Defendants contend that even a proper finding that the RICARDO was stateless would not establish that the vessel was subject to the jurisdiction of the United States since international law prohibits a state\u2019s exercise of penal jurisdiction over a stateless vessel on the high seas unless there is some nexus between the state and the vessel. We disagree with defendants\u2019 interpretation of international law.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>First, we note that in enacting statutes, Congress is not bound by international law. <em>Rainey v. United States, </em>232 U.S. 310, 316, 34 S.Ct. 429, 431, 58 L.Ed. 617 (1914); <em>Whitney v. Robertson, </em>124 U.S. 190, 194, 8 S.Ct. 456, 458, 31 L.Ed. 386 (1888). If it chooses to do so, it may legislate with respect to conduct outside the United States, in excess of the limits posed by international law. As long as Congress has expressly indicated its intent to reach such conduct, \u201ca United States court would be bound to follow the Congressional direction unless this would violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>Leasco Data Processing Equipment Corp. </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>468 F.2d 1326, 1334 (2d Cir.1972). <em>Accord, United States v. Howard-Arias, </em>679 F.2d 363, 371 (4th C3r.), <em>cert. </em>denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 165, 74 L.Ed.2d 136 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Our review of the language and history of \u00a7 955a <em>et seq. </em>persuades us that, assuming that the RICARDO was stateless, Congress intended these sections to reach the conduct of the defendants in this ease. In \u00a7 955a(h), Congress expressly stated its intention to reach acts committed \u201coutside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d In addition, in the legislative history of \u00a7 955a, there is evidence that Congress had as a primary goal the ability to reach stateless possessors of narcotics who could not be proved to have intent to distribute the narcotics in the United States. The Senate Report accompanying H.R. 2538, which noted the technical amendments the Senate Committee made to the bill before it was enacted as \u00a7 955a, stated that \u201cthe bill [was] intended to address acts committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d S.Rep. No. 855, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 2 (1980), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 2785. Experts who testified at the hearing on H.R. 2538 noted that many drug traffickers responsible for transporting drugs that ended up in the United States were able to travel with impunity over the high seas because of the then-existing requirement that the traffickers intend to distribute the drugs in the United States before being subject to prosecution there. The difficulty of proving intent allowed many such traffickers to go free, although their wares were in fact intended to be distributed in the United States. <em>Coast Guard Drug Law Enforcement: Hearings on H.R. 2538 Before the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Navigation of the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries, </em>96th Cong., 1st Sess. 48 (1979) <em>(\u201cHearings </em>\u201d) (statement of Peter B. Bensinger, Administrator of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration); <em>id. </em>at 65, 68 (statement of Michael P. Sullivan, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Criminal Division, Southern District of Florida). Section 955a was enacted to close this loophole. Thus, the House of Representatives Report accompanying H.R. 2538 observed that United States jurisdiction was to be extended to \u201cvessels without nationality on the high seas,\u201d and that \u201c[a]ny person on board such a vessel, of either U.S. or foreign citizenship, is prohibited from ... possessing with the intent to ... distribute any controlled substance.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 323, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 9 (1979). The Report noted that \u201c[t]he intent to distribute need not be within the United States. Moreover, the intent element may be inferred by proof of a presence of a large quantity of the narcotic or dangerous drug, giving rise to the inference of trafficking,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 10, and that \u201cit would not be necessary to prove that the vessel or the controlled substance was bound for the United States,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 12. Congress\u2019s explicit intention, therefore, was to extend the reach of \u00a7 955a to foreigners on stateless vessels on the high seas who possess large quantities of narcotics that they may or may not intend for distribution in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Defendants point out that despite this explicit intention, Congress also expressed its intention that \u00a7 955a be consistent with the strictures of international law, <em>see, e.g., </em>H.R.Rep. at 11 (\u201csection [955a] is designed to prohibit all acts of illicit trafficking in controlled substances on the high seas which the United States can reach under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>international law\u201d),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and they argue that international law permits the extension of the jurisdiction envisioned by Congress only if there is some nexus between the vessel and the state seeking to assert jurisdiction. Defendants\u2019 argument fails, however, since it apparently was Congress\u2019s understanding \u2014 and correctly so \u2014 -that international law does not provide such protection to vessels that are stateless.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">One of the basic principles of international law is that \u201call nations have an equal and untrammelled right to navigate on the high seas.\u201d <em>United States v. Marino-Garcia, </em>679 F.2d 1373, 1380 (11th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 748, 74 L.Ed.2d 967 (1983); <em>see </em>Convention on the High Seas Art. 2. With this right, of course, comes responsibility. To preserve all nations\u2019 freedom to travel on the high seas and to avoid conflict among nations, Article 2 of the Convention provides that each state must exercise its right \u201cwith reasonable regard to the interests of other States in their exercise of the freedom of the high seas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">To enforce compliance with these principles among individual ships traveling on the high seas, Articles 5 and 6 of the Convention provide that a ship has the nationality of the state whose flag it flies and that the ship is subject to that state\u2019s jurisdiction. Each state has the responsibility of fixing the conditions \u201cfor the grant of its nationality to ships, for the registration of ships in its territory, and for the right to fly its flag.... [I]n particular, the State must effectively exercise its jurisdiction and control in administrative, technical and social matters over ships flying its flag.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Art. 5. To eliminate any confusion over which state has jurisdiction over a ship, Article 6 provides that a ship may sail under the flag of only one state and that while doing so, it is generally subject to that state\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction. A ship may not change flags during a voyage except when a real transfer of ownership or registry occurs, and a ship that flies under the flags of more than one state, claiming the nationality of whichever it deems convenient, is considered to be a ship without nationality that may not claim the protection of any of the nationalities in question. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">The suggestion underlying these principles is that a stateless vessel, which does not sail under the flag of one state to whose jurisdiction it has submitted, may not claim the protection of international law and does not have the right to travel the high seas with impunity. There is ample evidence that Congress properly understood that these principles were consistent with its desire that' \u00a7 955a reach stateless vessels on the high seas whether or not the narcotics carried were intended for distribution in the United States. During the hearings on H.R. 2538, Congress was repeatedly presented with statements by experts, reflecting what was apparently a common understanding among those interested in the bill, that the United States could, consistent with international law, assert jurisdiction over stateless vessels on the high seas. <em>See, e.g., Hearings, supra, </em>at 48 (statement of Peter B. Bensinger, Administrator of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration) (\u201cWe can, under both international law and United States case law, assert jurisdiction over these [stateless] vessels ....\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 51 (statement of Robert Chasen, Commissioner of the United States Customs Service) (\u201c \u2018Stateless\u2019 vessels ... also present prosecutorial problems, although permission to board is not required.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 55 (statement of Morris D. Busby, Director of Ocean Affairs, OES Bureau, Department of State) (\u201cThere is also an exception [to international law] which allows us to board a vessel on the high seas which is without nationality ....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">In light of these principles and Congress\u2019s manifest intentions, courts have agreed uniformly that stateless vessels on the high seas are, by virtue of their statelessness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. <em>United States v. Marino-Garcia, supra, </em>679 F.2d at 1382-83 (construing \u00a7 955a); <em>United States v. Howard-Arias, supra, </em>679 F.2d at 371 (same); <em>United States v. Rubies, </em>612 F.2d 397, 403 (9th Cir.1979) (construing 14 U.S.C. \u00a7 89(a)), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 940, 100 S.Ct. 2162, 64 L.Ed.2d 794 (1980); <em>United States v. Dominguez, </em>604 F.2d 304, 308 (4th Cir.1979) (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1014, 100 S.Ct. 664, 62 L.Ed.2d 644 (1980); <em>United States v. Cortes, </em>588 F.2d 106, 109 (5th Cir.1979) (same); <em>see United States v. Monroy, </em>614 F.2d 61, 64 (5th Cir.) (implicitly construing 14 U.S.C. \u00a7 89(a)), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 892, 101 S.Ct. 250, 66 L.Ed.2d 117 (1980). As the court in <em>Marino-Garcia </em>put it,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aezp\">[vjessels without nationality are international pariahs. They have no internationally recognized right to navigate freely on the high seas.... Moreover, flagless vessels are frequently not subject to the laws of a flag-state. As such, they represent \u201cfloating sanctuaries from authority\u201d and constitute a potential threat to the order and stability of navigation on the high seas....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">The absence of any right to navigate freely on the high seas coupled with the potential threat to order on international waterways has led various courts to conclude that international law places no restrictions upon a nation\u2019s right to subject stateless vessels to its jurisdiction.... Thus, the assertion of jurisdiction over stateless vessels on the high seas in no way transgresses recognized principles of international law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">679 F.2d at 1382 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">We find inapposite the authorities invoked by defendants in their effort to show that a nexus must exist before the United States may exercise jurisdiction over a stateless vessel on the high seas. The nexus requirement has been applied only to a vessel that is registered with, and is flying the flag of, one state to whose jurisdiction it has submitted. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Cadena, </em>585 F.2d 1252, 1257-58 (5th Cir. 1978). <em>See also </em>Restatement (Second) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7\u00a7 18, 28, 33, 34 (1965). In such cases, international law requires the state seeking to assert jurisdiction to show a nexus between it and the foreign vessel that is sufficient to justify supplanting the flag state\u2019s normally \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d granted by Article 6 of the Convention on the High Seas. Only a limited number of such nexuses have been found to be sufficient to warrant permitting a state to assert jurisdiction over another state\u2019s vessel. Restatement (Second) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7\u00a7 18 (vessel engaged in illegal activity intended to have an effect in the state), 33 (vessel engaged in an activity that threatens the state\u2019s security or governmental functions), 34 (vessel engaged in a universally prohibited activity, such as piracy) (1965). <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Marino-Garcia, supra, </em>679 F.2d at 1380-82. But we find no authority in international law for requiring any nexus where the ship otherwise would be subject to the jurisdiction of no state.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">We conclude, therefore, that international law provides no bar to an assertion of jurisdiction over a stateless vessel by the United States pursuant to \u00a7 955a(a), even absent proof that the vessel\u2019s operators intended to distribute their cargo in the United States. <em>Accord, United States v. Marino-Garcia, supra, </em>679 F.2d at 1383; <em>United States v. Howard-Arias, supra, </em>679 F.2d at 372. Consequently, we conclude that a properly supported finding by the district court that the RICARDO was stateless would, in itself, be sufficient to establish the court\u2019s jurisdiction over the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">' IV. CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE STOP AND BOARDING</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">The district court rejected defendants\u2019 constitutional challenges to the Coast Guard\u2019s stopping and boarding of the RICARDO principally on the ground that these actions were appropriate in light of the Coast Guard\u2019s reasonable suspicion that the vessel was engaged in illegal activity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>We see no basis for overturning this ruling.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Since the district court found, implicitly if not explicitly, that the Coast Guard\u2019s stopping and boarding of the RICARDO did not amount to an arrest of the defendants, probable cause for the Coast Guard\u2019s action was not required. <em>See United States v. Streifel, </em>665 F.2d 414, 421 (2d Cir.1981). Rather, since the stopping and boarding constituted an investigatory stop, those actions were lawful if the Coast Guardsmen were \u201c \u2018aware of specific articulable facts, together with rational inferences from those facts that reasonably warranted] suspicion\u2019 that the individual .. . was, or [was] about to be engaged in criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 884, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 2581, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975)). To determine whether an officer\u2019s suspicion was reasonable, the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d must be considered, <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417, 101 S.Ct. 690, 694, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981), and \u201cdue weight must be given, not to his inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch,\u2019 but to the specific reasonable inferences which he is entitled to draw from the facts in light of his experience.\u201d <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1883, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Here the Coast Guard officers had reasonable, articulable factual grounds for suspecting that the RICARDO was engaged in drug smuggling. The Coast Guard officers who decided to intercept and investigate the RICARDO were experienced law enforcement officers who were practiced in the detection and prevention of drug smuggling activities on the seas. They had observed that the RICARDO was a fishing vessel in disrepair with no active fishing gear, that the vessel\u2019s waterline was painted artificially high (a circumstance that suggested an effort to make the vessel appear empty when in fact it was carrying cargo), that the name of the vessel was crudely painted, that the vessel was flying no flag, and that it had changed course after its detection so that it was headed away from the mainland by the time the Coast Guard cutter drew near. Ensign Willis testified that in his experience, these characteristics were often exhibited by drug smuggling vessels, and a computer search indicated that the RICARDO had been seen recently in a known drug exporting port in Colombia. In addition, there was evidence that officers on the DUANE smelled the odor of marijuana emanating from the RICARDO. Although defendants challenge Haas\u2019s testimony to this effect on the ground that it is incredible, and the testimony does appear to bespeak unusually sensitive olfactory nerves, we cannot say that the testimony was incredible as a matter of law. Thus, we may not disturb the decision of the district judge, who had the opportunity to view and assess the demeanor of the witness, to credit Haas\u2019s testimony. Given the above circumstances, the district court\u2019s finding that the stop was justified by the Coast Guard\u2019s reasonable suspicion must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Finally, we find no basis for concluding that the Coast Guard\u2019s stopping and boarding of the vessel were accomplished in an unreasonably intrusive manner. The RICARDO stopped immediately upon being asked to do so, a request which followed the RICARDO crew member\u2019s thumbs-up signal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>in response to the Coast Guard\u2019s attempted request to board. The Coast Guard made no show of force to accomplish the stopping. Nor was force used in the boarding. The court found that although the boarding party carried weapons, they kept their weapons pointed in the air and never aimed them at the defendants. Likewise, the machine gun aboard the DUANE was always pointed in the air rather than at the RICARDO, and the DUANE\u2019s five-inch gun was never loaded or manned.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Given the governmental interest in preventing the smuggling of narcotics into the United States, we conclude that in the totality of the circumstances, including the facts that the RICARDO was originally seen to be headed on a course toward the United States mainland, that there was a reasonable basis for suspecting that the RICARDO was engaged in smuggling marijuana, and that there was a minimal show of force in connection with the stopping and boarding, defendants\u2019 constitutional challenge to the stopping and boarding was properly rejected. With that rejection, any challenge by the defendants to the lawfulness of the seizure of the marijuana must also fail, since defendants have no personal rights, see Part II.B. above, to challenge the seizure independently of the events that preceded it. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>589 F.2d at 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The judgments of conviction are vacated and the matter is remanded to the district court for such further proceedings as may be appropriate with respect to the question of the jurisdiction of the United States over the RICARDO.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-12\">.

In addition, defendants Nunez-Riasco and Angulo-Quinones contend that their sentences were unduly harsh. We find in their contentions no basis for reversal. \u201c \u2018The rule is well settled that a United States Court of Appeals is without power to review or revise a sentence which is within permissible statutory limits,\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Lo Duca, </em>274 F.2d 57, 59 (2d Cir. 1960) (quoting <em>Roth v. United States, </em>255 F.2d 440, 441 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>358 U.S. 819, 79 S.Ct. 31, 3 L.Ed.2d 61 (1958)), in the absence of an indication that the sentence has been based on improper considerations or incorrect information, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Tramunti, </em>513 F.2d 1087, 1120 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 832, 96 S.Ct. 54, 46 L.Ed.2d 50 (1975). The sentences imposed were below the possible maximum terms allowed by statute, and no improper consideration or misinformation has been called to our attention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b352-7\">. We shall assume that the district court, which approved the conditional plea agreement, also so understood, for without court approval, the reservation agreement would be ineffective. See, <em>e.g., United States v. Sykes, </em>697 F.2d 87, 89 (2d Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Mann, </em>451 F.2d 346, 347 (2d Cir.1971) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b352-8\">. We find inapposite the cases relied on by the government to support its contention that it adequately established the RICARDO\u2019s statelessness, since each case involved fraudulent or dual claims of nationality. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Marino-Garcia, </em>679 F.2d 1373 (11th Cir.1982) (vessel registered in Honduras, but crew claimed her nationality was \u201cMiami, Florida\u201d); <em>United States v.

The Senate Report accompanying H.R. 2538 similarly stated that the bill \u201cwould give the Justice Department the maximum prosecutorial authority permitted under international law.\u201d S.Rep.

Since we uphold the ruling that the Coast Guard\u2019s actions were justified by reasonable suspicion, we need not rule on the district court\u2019s finding that the stop and boarding were permissible because of the defendants\u2019 consent. Defendants contend that there was no meaningful evidence to show that they consented, in part because the communications that preceded the crew member\u2019s thumbs-up signal did not intelligibly request such consent. We have set forth in note 3 above the requests that were, according to government witnesses, communicated to the defendants. There seems little doubt that, if the testimony at the suppression hearing be accepted, the requests were garbled. According to one witness, Haas, the request was for permission to \u201cembarque tu barco,\u201d which both of the interpreter witnesses testified sought permission to \u201cship your ship\u201d and said nothing about boarding. According to Dillman, who actually made the request, she asked permission to \u201cembajar a su barco\u201d; but the word \u201cembajar\u201d does not exist in Spanish.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
