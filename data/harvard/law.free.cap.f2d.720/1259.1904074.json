MORGAN, Senior Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1356-21\">The appellants, Sherman Harris, Johnny Lewis Holt, Bernard Turner, Ernest Wilcox, Jr., and John Williams, were convicted by a jury in the Northern District of Georgia on a single count of conspiracy to possess heroin and cocaine with the intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. The evidence at trial established that each of the appellants operated as a \u201cretail\u201d distributor of illegal drugs for a network managed in New York by Carolyn Wade and numerous others. Wade\u2019s group obtained the drugs from Richard Sheridan. Carolyn Wade was charged in the indictment along with the appellants, but she pled guilty and testified for the government. Richard Sheridan was also a co-defendant with the appellants, but he changed his plea to guilty after Wade testified. In this appeal, appellants raise eight issues: (1) whether the evidence was sufficient to prove appellants were engaged in a single conspiracy as alleged in the indictment, or involved in several separate conspiracies; (2) whether Sheridan\u2019s change of plea during the government\u2019s case de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>prived the other defendants of a fair trial; (3) whether Holt and Wilcox were denied effective assistance of counsel because of their representation by the same attorney; (4) whether the trial court properly refused to grant a motion for severance; (5) whether Harris was denied effective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to move for a bill of particulars; (6) whether the trial court properly refused to strike the entire jury panel after a prospective juror made potentially prejudicial remarks to another prospective juror; (7) whether the trial judge\u2019s stern admonishment of Harris\u2019 attorney during closing arguments deprived appellants of a fair trial and Harris of effective assistance of counsel; and (8) whether the trial court erred by denying Harris\u2019 pretrial motion to exclude evidence of his earlier drug related convictions. After a careful review of the record and applicable law, we find no reversible error but believe the latter two issues merit further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-7\">The issue concerning the trial judge\u2019s admonishment of Harris\u2019 attorney arises from the following circumstances. During his opening statement, Richard Sheridan\u2019s attorney referred to Carolyn Wade\u2019s pending motion to reduce sentence pursuant to Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Sheridan\u2019s attorney then inferred that Wade would be rewarded by the trial judge for favorable testimony during the appellants\u2019 trial. Outside the presence of the jury, the judge clearly and sternly reprimanded Sheridan\u2019s attorney for making the improper inference. Despite this earlier reprimand, Harris\u2019 attorney made a similar inference in his closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-8\">That motion, that Rule 35 motion by [Carolyn Wade\u2019s] attorney was before Judge Forrester, and you have it in evidence before you now, and last night after listening to her testimony, after hearing it himself, Judge Forrester decided he wasn\u2019t going to take one day off that. He wasn\u2019t going to take one day off that, and he denied her motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-9\">Now nobody does 12 years on a 12 year sentence and I don\u2019t know what she is actually going to have to do, probably</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-10\">five or six. But that is not important. Her mind when she sat there was, if I give the government what they want, and the judge hears it he is going to take time off my sentence. He will reduce it to ten or eight, and I\u2019ll only have to do 3 or 4. Judge Forrester heard her testimony and Judge Forrester said you will do fifteen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1357-11\">Record, vol. 13, at 85. The government immediately objected and the jury was excused. At this point the trial judge was extremely angry with Harris\u2019 attorney for attempting to infer that Wade\u2019s motion for a reduction of sentence was denied because the judge did not believe her testimony. He stated to Harris\u2019 attorney: \u201cI really\u00bb don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ll tell you this, if I grant a mistrial, ... you will never step foot in the Northern District of Georgia again, is that clear?\u201d Court then recessed in order for the judge to \u201ccool off.\u201d After court reconvened, the trial judge made the following statement to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-12\">Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the court finds that Mr. Nisonoff has argued that you should infer from my denial of Mrs. Wade\u2019s motion to reduce sentence that I did not believe her testimony during trial. Mr. Nisonoff knows that I made no such finding, and the court finds that he intentionally attempted to mislead you concerning the inference which you should draw from this action. He is reprimanded in your presence for this impropriety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-13\">As he said earlier, I\u2019ll instruct you and you should disregard his argument, but do not hold his impropriety against his client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1357-14\">Record, vol. 13, at 89. On appeal, the appellants argue that these remarks to the jury deprived them of a fair trial by disparaging the defense and giving credibility to Wade\u2019s testimony. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-15\">A trial judge is more than a referee to an adversarial proceeding. Indeed, the judge may question witnesses, comment on the evidence, and interrupt the trial in order to correct an impropriety. <em>Moore v.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1358-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number><em>United States, </em>598 F.2d 439 (5th Cir.1979). The judge\u2019s participation is limited only by <em>the </em>need to remain impartial. \u201cOnly when the judge\u2019s conduct strays from neutrality is the defendant thereby denied a constitutionally fair trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 442. In the present ease, we find that the trial judge certainly was warranted in speaking to the jury in order to correct the statement made by Harris\u2019 attorney. It is the manner and content of the judge\u2019s statement which concerns us. The blunt reprimand in the jury\u2019s presence served more to embarrass the attorney than to correct his impropriety, While we conclude that the judge\u2019s statement was unnecessary and improper, we do not believe it violated his duty of neutrality to the extent that it is reversible error. In reaching this decision, we are guided by <em>United States v. James, </em>510 F.2d 546 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 855, 96 S.Ct. 105, 46 L.Ed.2d 81 (1975). In that case the trial judge responded to a defense objection by stating that an issue could be reviewed by the Fifth Circuit. On appeal the defendant argued that the judge\u2019s statement evidenced a belief that conviction was properly forthcoming. The <em>James </em>court rejected this argument citing three factors. First, the panel believed that the jury understood the proper meaning of the trial judge\u2019s statement. Second, they noted that the statement was only a few seconds of a very lengthy trial and concerned a procedural question far removed from the substantive issues. And third, the trial judge properly instructed the jury at the conclusion of trial. Our decision in the present case is based on similar reasons. We do not believe that the jury below could have interpreted the judge\u2019s statement as vouching for the credibility of Wade\u2019s testimony, nor can we find that it is unfairly critical of the defense case. Furthermore, the trial judge carefully instructed the jury to separate the actions of Harris\u2019 attorney from the question of guilt and later instructed the jury to form no opinions based on the judge\u2019s remarks or actions. Record, vol. 13, at 123. This case does differ from <em>James </em>in one aspect, however, since the questionable judicial conduct occurred during closing arguments and related to the integrity of the defense attorney. We do not believe this distinction is insignificant, but after review-mg the totality of the circumstances we remain convinced that no reversible error occurred. The trial judge did not impermissibly stray from neutrality.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Cox, </em>664 F.2d 257 (11th Cir.1981); <em>United States v. Onori, </em>535 F.2d 938 (5th Cir.1976); <em>United States v. Cook, </em>461 F.2d 906 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 949, 93 S.Ct. 269, 34 L.Ed.2d 219 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"ang-dedup-0\">The second issue we must address concerns Harris\u2019 conviction on drug conspiracy and possession charges in 1975. During the course of the trial below Harris moved to prevent the government from introducing evidence of these convictions if he chose to testify. He claimed that the resulting prejudice would outweigh any probative value as discussed in Rule 609 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. The district judge heard arguments on the motion and denied it for two reasons. First, the judge found that evidence of the conviction would be admissible under Rule 404 to establish intent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, he concluded that evidence of the conviction would be admissible under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>Rule 609 for an attack on Harris\u2019 credibility since Harris had attacked the credibility of the government\u2019s main witness by using evidence of prior convictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Record, vol. 12, at 10. On appeal Harris argues that the judge erred in reaching this decision, and further argues that the error is not harmless because the judge\u2019s decision effectively prevented him from testifying in his own defense. In rejecting this argument, we recognize the potential danger to a defendant of admitting evidence of a prior conviction, especially when the prior conviction is for the same crime with which he is charged. <em>See United States v. Ortiz, </em>553 F.2d 782 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 897, 98 S.Ct. 277, 54 L.Ed.2d 183 (1977). We find, however, that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Harris\u2019 motion. As the trial judge noted, evidence of Harris\u2019 previous convictions would have been admissible under Rule 404 to establish intent. <em>United States v. Glen-Archila, </em>677 F.2d 809 (11th Cir.1982), <em>cert. </em>denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 165, 74 L.Ed.2d 137 (1983); <em>United States v. Ricardo, </em>619 F.2d 1124 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1063, 101 S.Ct. 789, 66 L.Ed.2d 607 (1980). Moreover, the record clearly establishes that the judge weighed the possible prejudice to Harris against the probative value of the evidence as required by Rule 609, and concluded that to exclude the evidence would unfairly allow Harris to appear pristine while at the same time he vigorously used evidence of prior convictions to attack the credibility of the government\u2019s witnesses. We find no abuse of discretion in a decision based on this reasoning. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>588 F.2d 961 (5th Cir.1979); <em>United States v. Wiggins, </em>566 F.2d 944 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>436 U.S. 950, 98 S.Ct. 2859, 56 L.Ed.2d 793 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-8\">For these reasons, the convictions of the appellants are</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1358-5\">. Harris also claims that the reprimand of his attorney in the jury\u2019s presence and other remarks made by the judge outside the jury\u2019s presence deprived him of effective assistance of counsel He argues that his attorney was too devastated by the judge\u2019s criticism to continue effective representation. We find this argument wholly without merit. Harris has failed to specify one instance of ineffective representation by his attorney. On the contrary, the record establishes that Harris\u2019 attorney continued a vigorous, coherent closing argument after his colloquy with the trial judge. See <em>Ward v. United States, </em>694 F.2d 654 (11th Cir. 1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"ABjj\">.
