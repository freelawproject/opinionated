Ivic, </em>700 F.2d 51, 64-65 (2d Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Huber, </em>603 F.2d 387, 395-96 (2d Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 927, 100 S.Ct. 1312, 63 L.Ed.2d 758 (1980). <em>See also United States v. Altese, </em>542 F.2d 104, 108-11 (2d Cir.1976) (Van Graafeiland, J., dissenting), cer<em>t. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1039, 97 S.Ct. 736, 50 L.Ed.2d 750 (1977). Because such misuse has occurred in the instant case, we are compelled to reverse appellants\u2019 convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Following a jury trial before Judge Mish-ler in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, appellants were convicted of violating and conspiring to violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c) by fixing horse races. The convictions were based on proof that appellants had attempted several wagering coups in 1978 by drugging some of the horses entered in races at the Roosevelt and Yonkers racetracks and then betting on the undrugged horses. In return for benefits paid or promised by appellants, James Veno, a licensed groom, assisted in this wrongful undertaking. In every instance, however, Veno helped appellants locate and drug horses other than those which he, himself, groomed.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Appellants\u2019 conduct was in clear violation of N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 180.50 (McKinney 1975), which proscribed tampering with any animal involved in a sports contest in a manner contrary to the rules governing such a contest. However, because violation of section 180.50 was only a class A misdemeanor permitting a one-year maximum sentence, N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 70.15(1), it did not fall within RICO\u2019s definition of \u201cracketeering activity\u201d, which requires that a predicate State law violation be punishable by imprisonment for more than one year, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1). Accordingly, the Government based its RICO charges on N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 180.40, violation of which is a class D felony permitting imprisonment for up to seven years, N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 70.00(2)(d). Nefarious though appellants\u2019 scheme was, it did not violate this felony statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">Section 180.40 provides in pertinent part that a person is guilty of sports bribing when he \u201c[cjonfers, or offers or agrees to confer, any benefit upon a sports participant with intent to influence him not to give his best efforts in a sports contest.\u201d There is no logical way in which that statute can be read to embrace the facts of this case. \u201c[Bjest efforts in a sports contest\u201d are directed toward the achievement of victory or expanding the margin of victory. By proscribing bribes aimed at inducing sports participants not to give their best efforts, the New York Legislature obviously intended to prohibit the bribing of participants to lose or to narrow their margin of victory.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">This interpretation of section 180.40 is supported by the clear scope of its predecessor statutes. New York first prohibited the bribing of sports participants in 1921 when it enacted a law to prohibit the bribing of baseball players. 1921 N.Y. Laws c. 80. The 1921 law prohibited bribes given with intent to influence a baseball player \u201cto lose or try to lose a baseball game.\u201d In each of the years 1935,1941,1945,1951 and 1952 the statute was expanded to cover additional sports and sports participants. 1935 N.Y. Laws c. 790; 1941 N.Y. Laws c. 753; 1945 N.Y. Laws c. 602; 1951 N.Y. Laws c. 147; 1952 N.Y. Laws c. 355. In 1952, the Legislature added a prohibition against the bribing of sports referees or other officials \u201cto affect [their] decisions or the performance of [their] duties in any way.\u201d 1952 N.Y. Laws c. 355. For any other sports participant, including a \u201cgroom\u201d, the statute continued to prohibit only those bribes given to influence him \u201cto lose or try to lose or cause to be lost or to limit his or his team\u2019s margin of victory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When the Penal Law was revised in 1965, it was this prohibition that was substantially restated by the phrase \u201cnot to give his best efforts\u201d. <em>See </em>Temporary State Commission on Revision of the Penal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>Law and Criminal Code, Proposed New York Penal Law, Commission Staff Notes to \u00a7 185, at 367 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Appellants did not ask Veno to refrain from giving his best efforts. Instead, they sought Veno's help in drugging horses that were competing with those under his care. In other words, Veno was bribed to help his horses win races, not lose them. Because bribery for this purpose was not \"plainly and unmistakably\" proscribed by N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 180.40, the judgments of conviction must be reversed. See Dunn v. United States, 442 U.S. 100, 112-13, 99 S.Ct. 2190, 2197, 60 L.Ed.2d 743 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-17\">Reversed and remanded to the district court with instructions to dismiss the indictment. ment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
