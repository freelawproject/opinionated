We find that: (1) appellees may state their claim under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d) because the records disposal statutes do not preclude judicial review by committing their implementation to agency discretion; (2) at least some appellees in this case have standing under the records disposal statutes and are arguably within the zone of interests protected by those statutes; (3) the district court correctly found that the FBI and NARS failed to carry out their statutory responsibilities in developing and approving the 1975 and 1976 records disposal schedules for FBI field office files; (4) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>district court was only in part correct that the 1977 records disposal schedule for FBI headquarters files was in violation of the records laws; and (5) the district court lacked authority to order a NARS records management inspection of three categories of restricted use records \u2014 tax returns and return information, grand jury materials, and electronic surveillance materials.</p>\n<p id=\"A8rX\">I. The District Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"A-\">Appellees initiated this action on June 26, 1979, alleging that the FBI and NARS had ignored for many years the statutes regulating the management and disposal of federal records. Appellees sought both to enjoin the FBI from destroying its records and to make the FBI\u2019s files into permanent records retained by the National Archives. On January 10, 1980, after reviewing \u201c[vjoluminous memoranda and other documents\u201d and conducting an evidentiary hearing, the district court, per the Honorable Harold Greene, issued a preliminary injunction halting destruction of FBI records. <em>American Friends Service Committee v. Webster, </em>485 F.Supp. 222, 225, 236 (D.D.C. 1980). The district court also ordered NARS to develop an FBI records retention plan that met the statutory standards discussed in its opinion and ordered the FBI to formulate records control schedules consistent with that plan. <em>Id. </em>at 236. The court stated that it would lift the injunction upon its approval of the plan and schedules. <em>Id. </em>The government did not appeal this order.</p>\n<p id=\"ANV\">The government subsequently requested exemptions from the ban on destruction for certain classes of records. In orders dated February 20, April 3, and April 22,1980, the district court granted the government\u2019s motions in part and denied them in part, amending the preliminary injunction accordingly.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The government filed a notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s orders of April 3, and April 22,1980, but subsequently dismissed the appeal voluntarily. On April 15, 1980, the government sought unsuccessfully to dissolve the district court\u2019s preliminary injunction for lack of standing \u2014 relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, </em>445 U.S. 136, 100 S.Ct. 960, 63 L.Ed.2d 267 (1980). <em>See American Friends Service Committee v. Webster, </em>494 F.Supp. 803 (D.D.C.1980). The government did not appeal the district court\u2019s denial of its motion.</p>\n<p id=\"AZq\">In February 1981, more than a year after the district court imposed the preliminary injunction, the court called a hearing to review the government\u2019s apparent lack of progress in developing and submitting to the court for approval the records retention plan and records control schedules. In a memorandum opinion and order of June 9, 1981, the district court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACb\">that no significant action had been taken to carry out the Court\u2019s mandate; that the government had no legitimate excuse for its failure to act; and that, except for vague and indefinite plans, no implementing action was being undertaken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgB\"><em>American Friends Service Committee v. Webster, </em>No. 79-1655, mem. op. at 3-4 (D.D.C. June 9, 1981) (footnote omitted), <em>reprinted in </em>Appendix (\u201cApp.\u201d) at 39, 41-42. In light of this recalcitrance, the district court set forth detailed remedial procedures in its order \u201cto insure compliance with the laws enacted by the Congress and with its own orders.\u201d <em>See </em>App. at 42, 52-56. The procedural requirements included substantial standard-setting and record examination roles for NARS personnel, who were to receive \u201cfull and complete access to all of the files and records of the FBI covered by the [January 10, 1980 order].\u201d App. at 53-55. The \u201cbottom line\u201d of the court\u2019s order was for NARS:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajv\">to submit a recommended retention plan to the FBI by September 28, 1981, [for] the FBI ... to submit a records disposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>tion schedule based on that plan by October 16, 1981, and [for] both agencies . .. [to] file with the Court detailed retention plans and disposition schedules by November 9, 1981.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">App. at 46, 55. On July 1, 1981, the district court issued an order that made the January 10,1980 injunction (as amended) permanent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Our decision today reviews the government\u2019s appeals of the district court\u2019s orders of June 9, and July 1, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Subsequent orders of the district court dealt in piece-meal fashion with government motions to bar NARS from inspecting certain restricted documents and to permit the FBI to dispose of some other limited categories of materials.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These proceedings culminated in the district court\u2019s October 20, 1982 memorandum opinion and order, which in large part denied the government\u2019s motions to bar inspections by NARS. The government appeals the October 20, 1982 order, which we also review today. <em>See American Friends Service Committee v. Webster, </em>No. 79-1655 (D.D.C. filed Oct. 20, 1982), <em>reprinted in </em>Joint Supplemental Appendix (\u201cJ.S.A.\u201d) at 62-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">While these appeals have been pending, NARS and the FBI have gone forward under the district court\u2019s order with their preparation of a new FBI records plan and new disposal schedules. The government submitted its records disposal proposal in November 1981, appellees responded in October 1982, and the government replied in February 1983. To date, the district court has not decided whether the government\u2019s proposal for FBI records preservation and disposal is adequate and should be put into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">II. The Statutory Framework</p>\n<p id=\"A8T\">The basic laws pertaining to the management, disposal, and archival preservation of federal records are codified at chapters 21 (\u201cArchival Administration\u201d), 29 (\u201cRecords Management by Administrator of General Services\u201d), 31 (\u201cRecords Management by Federal Agencies\u201d), and 33 (\u201cDisposal of Records\u201d) of title 44 of the United States Code.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In general, these laws establish a unified system for handling the \u201clife cycle\u201d of federal records \u2014 covering their creation, maintenance and use, and eventually their disposal by either destruction or deposit for preservation. Because this case involves allegations of improper destruction of records, our description of the records statutes concentrates on Congress\u2019 directives regarding the selection of records for preservation or elimination.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-14\">The Archivist of the United States, operating subject to the general direction of the Administrator of GSA, plays a number of key roles under the four records management chapters. The Archivist has a general responsibility to \u201cprovide guidance and assistance to Federal agencies with respect to records creation, records maintenance and use, and records disposition.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 2904. He also has a set of more specific duties, including to \u201cpromulgate standards, procedures, and guidelines with respect to records management.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2904(2). In particular, this task includes the establishment of \u201cstandards for the selective retention of records of continuing value,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>assistance to agencies in applying the standards. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2905(a). However, his authority is not limited to instructing agencies in principles of records management; to carry out his mandate, the Archivist or his staff may themselves get down in the trenches (or in this conflict, the file rooms) by exercising their prerogative to \u201cinspect records or records management practices ... of any Federal agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2906(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">In addition, the Archivist plays a major part in the later stages of the records life cycle. He establishes \u201cprocedures for the compiling and submitting to him of lists and schedules of records proposed for disposal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3302(1). And the Archivist also must examine the lists or schedules submitted to him by agencies to determine whether or not any of the records \u201chave sufficient administrative, legal, research, or other value to warrant their continued preservation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3303a. The chapter 33 procedures prescribe the <em>exclusive </em>means by which federal records may be destroyed. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3314.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Finally, the Archivist is in direct charge of the records deposited in the National Archives. This includes, among other tasks, accepting for deposit and, under certain conditions, directing the transfer to the National Archives of federal records that \u201chave sufficient historical or other value to warrant their continued preservation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2103. Once the records are received by the National Archives, the Archivist is to preserve them and make them available to the citizenry: He is to provide facilities for furnishing records to other agencies and to the public and, in the course of exhibiting the records, he may prepare guides to facilitate their use. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2105, 2106, 2901(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">While the records statutes obviously assign the Archivist the responsibility to orchestrate the records management effort, the heads of the various agencies remain responsible for the performance of their own instrumentalities. Each one is to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">make and preserve records containing adequate and proper documentation of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, and essential transactions of the agency and designed to furnish the information necessary to protect the legal and financial rights of the Government and of persons directly affected by the agency\u2019s activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-11\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3101. Each head of an agency is to develop a program for records management, including provision for cooperation with the Archivist \u201cin applying standards, procedures, and techniques.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3102(2). Each agency head is also to \u201cestablish safeguards against the removal or loss of records,\u201d including making it known that agency records are not to be destroyed except in accordance with <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3301-3314. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3105. The sections in chapter 33 referred to by <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3105 include the records disposal procedures supervised by the Archivist, as discussed above. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3302, 3303, 3303a.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">Whether performed by the Archivist or an agency head separately, or by both in tandem, the records management functions are supposed to implement a set of seven objectives listed in <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2902. We find two of these statutory objectives particularly noteworthy in this case: (1) the \u201c[ajccurate and complete documentation of the policies and transactions of the Federal Government\u201d; and (2) the \u201c['judicious preservation and disposal of records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2902(1), (5). To give these general goals more specificity, we draw on the district court\u2019s summary of the statutory descriptions of categories of records that the government must preserve:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axg\">(1) those which contain \u201cdocumentation of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, and essential transactions of an agency\u201d (sections 3101, 3301); (2) those having \u201csufficient historical or other value to warrant their continued preservation\u201d (section 2103); (3) those which are necessary to protect the financial and legal rights of persons directly affected by an agency\u2019s activities (section 3101); and (4) those which have sufficient \u201cadministrative, legal, research, or other value to warrant their further preservation\u201d (section 3303). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number><em>American Friends Service Committee v. Webster, </em>485 F.Supp. at 228.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">III. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">A. <em>District Court Findings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The district court found that review of the challenged official actions taken under the records management and disposal statutes is available under the APA. First, the court properly pointed out that \u201c5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701, 702, 706, provide that the action of an administrative agency is subject to judicial review <em>unless </em>a statute precludes review or the matter is by law committed to agency discretion.\u201d <em>American Friends Service Committee v. Webster, </em>485 F.Supp. at 226 (emphasis added) (citing <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971)). Second, the court observed that \u201c[n]one of the records management statutes expressly or impliedly precludes review of the actions of either the Archivist or the FBI.\u201d 485 F.Supp. at 226. Third, it set out a test from <em>Overton Park </em>to determine whether actions are \u201ccommitted to agency discretion\u201d: \u201cOfficial actions are deemed to be committed to discretion when the statutes involved \u2018are drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.\u2019 \u201d 485 F.Supp. at 226 (quoting <em>Overton Park, </em>401 U.S. at 410, 91 S.Ct. at 820). Finally, it explained that because \u201c[t]he records management laws contain specific standards and directives with respect to record preservation,\u201d a number of which we discussed above in Part II, \u201cthere clearly is Taw to apply.\u2019 \u201d 485 F.Supp. at 226. Therefore, the district court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYp\">review is available under the Administrative Procedure Act to determine whether the official actions were arbitrary or capricious, constituted an abuse of discretion, or failed to meet statutory or procedural requirements, and the Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">B. <em>The Government\u2019s Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">The government\u2019s challenge to federal court jurisdiction is based on the exception from judicial review for agency action \u201ccommitted to agency discretion by law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2). While the government admits that \u201ca statute should not be Tightly interpreted] ... to confer an unreviewable power,\u2019 \u201d it also asserts that \u201c \u2018the ultimate analysis is always one of Congress\u2019 intent.\u2019 \u201d Government\u2019s Opening Brief at 39 (quoting <em>Southern Railway Co. v. Seaboard Allied Milling Corp., </em>442 U.S. 444, 454, 99 S.Ct. 2388, 2394, 60 L.Ed.2d 1017 (1979)). The government contends that three characteristics of the records management and disposal statutes reveal Congress\u2019 intent to leave their implementation to the agencies\u2019 discretion, without judicial review: (1) \u201cthe nature of the responsibility that has been delegated by Congress\u201d; (2) \u201cthe terms of the delegation\u201d; and (3) \u201cCongress\u2019 retention of a direct oversight role.\u201d Government\u2019s Opening Brief at 39-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">In brief, the government\u2019s contentions on the nature of Congress\u2019 delegation of responsibility rely heavily on the Supreme Court\u2019s comments about the records management statutes in <em>Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, </em>445 U.S. 136, 100 S.Ct. 960, 63 L.Ed.2d 267 (1980). <em>Kissinger </em>held that the records management statutes do not create a private right of action to compel parties possessing wrongfully removed agency records to return them to the agency; the Court explained that the only remedy for wrongful removal of records under the records statutes is a suit by the Attorney General under 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3106. <em>Id. </em>at 148, 100 S.Ct. at 967. The government acknowledges that <em>Kissinger </em>included a footnote, <em>see </em>445 U.S. at 150 n. 5, 100 S.Ct. at 968 n. 5, stating that the Court did not decide what remedies might be available to private plaintiffs bringing an action under the APA against the Attorney General and others for failing to enforce the records statutes because no such action was brought. Government\u2019s Opening Brief at 44 n. 30. But it argues nonetheless that an action against the Administrator of GSA and the Attorney General for failure to protect or retrieve records is tantamount to an action calling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>for an unreviewable decision not to undertake enforcement action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">The government\u2019s argument on \u201cthe terms of the delegation\u201d corresponds to the <em>Overton Park </em>\u201claw to apply\u201d test employed by the district court to find jurisdiction. But the government asserts that the records statutes do <em>not </em>provide any \u201cstandards by which a court can judge records management and disposal decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41. In particular, the government rejects the \u201cstandard\u201d for records disposal in 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3303a \u2014 \u201csufficient administrative, legal, research, or other value to warrant their continued preservation by the Government\u201d \u2014arguing that those words give no guidance to a court. Government\u2019s Opening Brief at 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The third characteristic signaling unre-viewable discretion to the government is Congress\u2019 retention of an oversight role for itself in the records disposal process. The government points out that \u201cCongress directly exercised the final power of approval [over records disposal schedules] until 1970.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 45 (citing 44 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3304-3307, <em>repealed by </em>Act of June 23, 1970, Pub.L. No. 91-287, \u00a7 2, 84 Stat. 320, 321-22). While the Administrator of GSA (through the Archivist) now has the final say on disposal, the statutes still maintain \u201coversight,\u201d \u201cconsultation,\u201d and \u201cmediation\u201d roles for Congress. Government\u2019s Opening Brief at 45-46 (citing, <em>inter alia, </em>44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3303a(c), (f)).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Finally, the government states that \u201c[t]he fundamental issue presented by plaintiffs\u2019 claim[,] is who shall make records management and disposal decisions for the federal government.\u201d Government\u2019s Opening Brief at 40. Our analysis, however, identifies the key issue to be whether Congress intended to foreclose even limited APA judicial review over records disposal actions of an agency or NARS that allegedly violate the records management and disposal statutes. It is in that context that we now proceed to consider the government\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">C. <em>Analysis of Jurisdiction to Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">1. <em>Exceptions from Judicial Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">The Supreme Court has traditionally not been sympathetic to arguments that judicial review is not available under the APA. For example, the Court has stressed that the APA\u2019s \u201c \u2018generous review provisions\u2019 must be given a \u2018hospitable\u2019 interpretation.\u201d <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 141, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1511, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967) (quoting <em>Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, </em>349 U.S. 48, 51, 75 S.Ct. 591, 594, 99 L.Ed. 868 (1955)). It has often reiterated that \u201conly upon a showing of \u2018clear and convincing evidence\u2019 of a contrary legislative intent should the courts restrict access to judicial review.\u201d <em>Abbott Laboratories, </em>387 U.S. at 141, 87 S.Ct. at 1511 (quoting <em>Rusk v.

SEC].</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\n<em>2. The Effect of Kissinger on Reviewa-bility</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">We first take up the government\u2019s suggestion that <em>Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, </em>445 U.S. 136, 100 S.Ct. 960, 63 L.Ed.2d 267 (1980), foreclosed the availability of judicial review in this case. <em>Kissinger </em>arose out of FOIA requests that sought access to transcripts of Kissinger\u2019s telephone conversations during the periods he served as National Security Adviser and as Secretary of State. Kissinger had removed the relevant transcripts from the State Department\u2019s control and deposited them with the Library of Congress (under an agreement with limits on access). <em>See id. </em>at 139-42, 100 S.Ct. at 963-64. The Attorney General had not taken action, as he is authorized to do with GSA\u2019s assistance-, <em>see </em>44 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2905, 3106, to recover the documents. The Court ruled that the records management statutes did not create a private right of action to compel parties possessing wrongfully removed agency records to return the records to the agency so as to be evaluated under a FOIA request. <em>See </em>445 U.S. at 145-50, 100 S.Ct. at 966-68.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The government argues that <em>Kissinger </em>necessarily implies that <em>no </em>government actions under the records management laws would be subject to APA review.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">The government\u2019s interpretation of <em>Kissinger </em>would of course render meaningless the Court\u2019s footnote that explicitly left the question of APA review undecided. <em>See id. </em>at 150 n. 5, 100 S.Ct. at 968 n. 5.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Equally important, the APA action before us involves an alleged abuse of discretion of a very different kind from the one the <em>Kissinger </em>plaintiffs might have raised; the actions here are of a nature that Congress probably intended to be subject to judicial review under the APA. On the <em>Kissinger </em>facts, allegations of breach of duty by agency administrators and the Attorney General could have focused only on the agency actions that permitted removal of documents to the Library of Congress and on the Attorney General\u2019s decision not to take action to retrieve the documents. This case, on the other hand, involves allegations of unauthorized records <em>destruction </em>and is based on the protections of 44 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3101, 3303, 3303a. Moreover, the allegedly illegal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>destruction is attributed to the very agencies in charge of filing suit to protect the records. In a situation where GSA and the FBI (part of the Justice Department) are the allegedly guilty parties that have agreed to the destruction of the records, it is highly unlikely that Congress intended the exclusive remedy to be a Justice Department suit to recover the records (and to have the remedy triggered by FBI or GSA notification of improper records removal). We therefore conclude that <em>Kissinger </em>left, open the issue of the availability of judicial review in this situation and that <em>Kissinger\u2019s </em>facts and rationale do not suggest a finding of no reviewability here.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">3. <em>Reviewability o\u00ed the Agency Actions in this Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">In <em>NRDC v. SEC, </em>this court identified \u201cthree particularly important factors\u201d to guide our analysis of whether Congress definitely intended to commit the implementation of the records disposal laws to agencies\u2019 unreviewable discretion: (1) \u201cthe need for judicial supervision to safeguard the interests of the plaintiffs\u201d; (2) \u201cthe impact of review on the effectiveness of the agency in carrying out its congressionally assigned role\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe appropriateness of the issues raised for judicial review.\u201d 606 F.2d at 1044 (citation omitted).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cFinally,\u201d the court concluded, one should \u201cinquire whether the considerations in favor of nonreviewability thus identified are sufficiently compelling to rebut the strong presumption of judicial review.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">As to the first factor listed in <em>NRDC v. SEC, </em>there is substantial need to safeguard plaintiffs\u2019 interests<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> through judicial supervision of FBI and NARS actions under these laws. Day-to-day operating needs will always dictate in large part which records an agency maintains; agency personnel will decide which records are in fact preserved even if they are implementing a plan developed in consultation with archivists. But of course these limits on the perfectability of a records program do not propel us to the conclusion that Congress wanted the agencies and NARS to operate without any review. Congress was certainly aware that agencies, left to themselves, have a built-in incentive to dispose of records relating to \u201cmistakes\u201d or, less nefariously, just do not think about preserving \u201cinformation necessary to protect the legal and financial rights ... of persons directly affected by the agency\u2019s activities.\u201d 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101. And NARS itself vigorously points out it does not have the resources to check all agency records disposal practices. Given this tension, Congress would probably want a check on NARS\u2019 review of the disposal practices of a mammoth, inherently secretive agency like the FBI, whose files contain a great deal of information about the government\u2019s treatment of citizens\u2019 \u201clegal rights\u201d and will include materials of considerable \u201cadministrative, legal, [or] research ... value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3303, 3303a. Congress almost certainly would have wanted a limited APA review to protect against the possibility of such actions as the improper destruction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>World War II counterintelligence records (because they concern today\u2019s allies) or the shredding of documents on the ground that they present unflattering portrayals of the FBI\u2019s relations with local law enforcement agencies or informants during the civil rights movement.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Despite the government\u2019s arguments that the standards of delegation provide no basis for review, we agree with the district court that there is some \u201claw\u201d to apply.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Congress itself developed some guidelines, albeit leaving substantial discretion to the agencies. The records disposal standard of <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3303, 3303a \u2014 \u201csufficient administrative, legal, research, or other value\u201d \u2014 originated in the Records Disposal Act of 1943. Pub.L. No. 78-115, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4, 6, 57 Stat. 380, 381. The House Report explained that the new standard was devised to replace an \u201cambiguous phrase\u201d \u2014 \u201cpermanent value or historical interest to the Federal Government.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 559, 78th Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (1943). Under the new standard, the House Report noted, the disposal of records warranting preservation would be prevented and the disposal of less valued records would be facilitated. <em>See id. </em>at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">The Federal Records Act of 1950, in which Congress set out the standard in \u00a7 3101 for guiding agency heads on preservation duties, did much more than transfer discretionary authority: While Congress instructed agencies to dispose of useless records, it took care to reemphasize that agencies\u2019 new zeal to thin out files must not blind them to the need to preserve information relating to the legal and financial rights of both the government and persons directly affected by it.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>81-754, \u00a7 506(a), 64 Stat. 583, 586. The Federal Records Act of 1950 drew extensively from a task force report of the first \u201cHoover Commission,\u201d see U.S. Commission on the Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government, <em>Task Force Report on Records Management </em>(1949). That report was greatly concerned with making federal recordkeeping more efficient, but it also stressed that certain categories of records <em>(eg., </em>of historical interest, concerning legal rights) must be preserved for eventual use by public officials, scholars, and others. <em>See id. </em>at 9, 10, 23, 26, 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Furthermore, through both regulations and a Records Management Handbook, NARS has announced additional criteria, based on the statutory standards, for appraising records of permanent value. <em>See </em>41 C.F.R. \u00a7 101-11.4 (1982); GSA Records Management Handbook, <em>Disposition of Federal Records </em>(1978) [hereinafter \u201cNARS Handbook\u201d], <em>reprinted in </em>J.S.A. at 587-652. Congress <em>required </em>NARS to establish these \u201cstandards for the selective retention of records of continuing value.\u201d 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 2905; 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 101-11.405-1. This requirement is hardly an indicator that Congress was content to leave the records disposal process solely to the agencies\u2019 and NARS\u2019 discretion.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Moreover, the regulations and the NARS Handbook provide additional specifications<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> against which a court may analyze a decision on disposal schedules.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">The need to protect plaintiffs\u2019 interests through some type of supervision of agency actions under the records disposal laws \u2014 along with some evidence that Congress intended to provide standards on what to preserve \u2014 does not of course inexorably lead to the conclusion that <em>judicial review </em>is called for. Congress may have intended an alternative means of supervi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>sion. The government suggests two. We have already discussed why we think the initiation of an action by the Attorney General is not an option Congress would have relied on to cope with allegations such as those presented here. The government\u2019s second counter is that Congress retains a direct oversight role through its review of NARS\u2019 reports and its availability to offer advice on difficult choices GSA refers to it. <em>See </em>44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3303a(c), (f). We are not persuaded. The government\u2019s argument, if accepted, would create an enormous exception to judicial review: Congress exercises oversight over all agencies, gets reports from many, and is often consulted by the executive branch before specific actions are taken. Reliance on congressional supervision to supplant judicial review would run counter to Congress\u2019 decisions in 1970 to abolish the Joint Committee on Disposition of Executive Papers and to abandon the perfunctory business of \u201cdeciding\u201d on records disposition. See Act of June 23, 1970, Pub.L. No. 91-287, 84 Stat. 320; S.Rep. No. 914, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 2 (1970), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 3297. That legislation, by creating 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3303a, carved out a role for GSA (or NARS) to work with agencies on records disposal practices. It is the exercise of that role that appellees now question under the limits of APA review</p>\n<p id=\"AC7\">_ , . \u201e\u201e\u201e\u201e To sum up our evaluation of <em>NRDC v. </em>SEC\u2019S first factor, we conclude there is a practical need for supervision of the FBI s and NARS\u2019 actions under the records disposal laws in order to protect plaintiffs\u2019 interests. Furthermore, Congress passed statutory language that provides some guidance on which records are to be preserved, so it is possible to review the FBI\u2019s and NARS\u2019 performance. Finally, Congress gave up formal responsibility for deciding on records disposal plans and delegated that authority to NARS.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">The second factor proposed in <em>NRDC v. SEC </em>is \u201cthe impact of review on the effectiveness of the agency in carrying out its congressionally assigned role.\u201d 606 F.2d at 1044. The government worries about the demands that may be placed on a small NARS staff. This 'is a strange argument for the government to put forward because the allegations in this case do not aim at some tangential NARS responsibility, the discharge of which will undermine NARS\u2019 execution of its key mission, NARS\u2019 performance of its duties in the records disposal process is at the <em>heart </em>of NARS\u2019 reason for existence. We are not impressed with the argument that since NARS\u2019 staff is too small to carry out its statutory duties effectively, we should not bother it with review. On the other hand, the FBI s prime mission is not in the nature of arcbival and recordkeeping work. But the government has not maintained that the ^BIs performance of its core assignments would be hinderfd by our revlfv' ^he FBI has, m fact, already developed a deta;lled mterAnal recordkeeping system (with about 200 basic filing classifications), SerJeS a va\u201c support function for lbs enforcement work and which could provide the structure for dlsposal schedules'</p>\n<p id=\"A1s\">We recognize, however, that the district court nudged NARS to dig deeply and with considerable effort into the FBI\u2019s record-keeping practices in this case. We expect that this experience will turn out to have been an extraordinary one for NARS. First, as we will explain further in Part V.C.2, we do not agree with the district court that all these duties are required <em>(e.g., </em>inspection under 44 u.S.C. \u00a7 2906) absent a f\u00ednding of NARS&gt; abuse of its discretion. gecondj we believe that it is reasonable that NARS may have to spend more resources deVeloping and checking records plans for agencies whose files are especially likely to contain significant information pertaining to legal rights and topics of particular interest to historical researchers. Third, once NARS devises a records disposal plan with an agency and implements it, there is no reaSon to expect that the task would have to be repeated very often.</p>\n<p id=\"ABy\">Finally, we believe that the papers NARS and an agency prepare in the course of reaching records disposal decisions should make their actions easily reviewable with little or no extra work for them. The re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>cordkeeping agency\u2019s object is to draft records schedules that explain which categories of records will be disposed of and why. The agency must include a reasoned explanation so that NARS can evaluate the disposal schedules under 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3303a. The final schedules must also include enough guiding detail to instruct the agency personnel who will implement it. These papers should provide the record basis of a court\u2019s review.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The third factor proposed in <em>NRDC v. SEC </em>is whether the issues are appropriate for judicial review. As noted, it is likely that the records disposal planning process will suitably frame the issues for judicial consideration. It is true that the preparation of records disposal schedules, as parts of a large records system, will involve deliberations about managerial and efficiency concerns. NARS\u2019 tasks also require archival expertise. But we are not being asked to review the FBI\u2019s management information systems or its cost analyses on how to perform the records preservation job most efficiently.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Nor are we called upon to second-guess NARS\u2019 reasoned judgment to dispose of certain types of records within specific categories pertaining to historical research or legal rights \u2014 such as the FBI\u2019s campaign against organized crime. We can and should, however, review records disposal plans to determine if there is a rational basis for the FBI\u2019s and NARS\u2019 decisions on how to deal with files of such obvious interest. Judges are not novices on matters such as whether records have administrative, legal, or research value, or whether records are necessary to protect the legal and financial rights of persons directly affected by an agency\u2019s acts, <em>see </em>44 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3101, 3303a; we are certainly competent to review the FBI\u2019s and NARS\u2019 records disposal plans for abuse of discretion or an unreasonable explanation. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">4. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Our analysis of these three factors leads us to conclude that \u201cthe considerations in favor of nonreviewability ... are [not] sufficiently compelling to rebut the strong presumption of judicial review.\u201d <em>NRDC v. SEC, </em>606 F.2d at 1044. Judicial review in this case supplies an important need by ensuring that NARS and the FBI did not overlook plaintiffs\u2019 interests when applying the statutory standards on records disposal and preservation. Second, our review should enhance rather than hinder NARS\u2019 performance, without burdening the FBI. And third, the examination will involve issues within our competence. In the course of this analysis we have discussed and refuted the government\u2019s three main arguments against reviewability: (1) that in <em>Kissinger </em>the Supreme Court implied that Congress delegated unreviewable discretion to the agencies to destroy their records; (2) that the terms of Congress\u2019 delegation provide no \u201claw to apply\u201d; and (3) that Congress\u2019 retention of an oversight role substitutes for judicial review of records destruction decisions. We stress, however, that we have measured Congress\u2019 intent with a focus on the records preservation and disposal decisions under these statutes. Our action here does not address judicial review of other agency decisions on recordkeeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">IV. Standing</p>\n<p id=\"A0t\">A. <em>District Court Findings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">The district court addressed the standing issue both before and after the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kissinger. </em>In its first opinion, the court set out a two-part standing test, which required:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-4\">(1) a case or controversy .., that is, if the parties have a sufficiently personal stake ... and ... have suffered injury in fact, and (2) ... a fairly traceable causal connection between the claimed injury and the challenged conduct, such as where the claims asserted are within the zone of interests protected or regulated by the statutes involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-5\"><em>American Friends Service Committee </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>485 F.Supp. at 226 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Next the court divided the plaintiffs into three categories so as to focus more sharply its application of the standing test. The first group included \u201cindividuals and organizations whose claimed need for FBI documents arises out of their professions as historians, journalists, teachers, film writers, or attorneys.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This group had in the past made FOIA requests for FBI documents (which allegedly were destroyed notwithstanding the requests), had other requests pending, and intended to request FBI files in the future. Since the plaintiffs needed the documents for their professional research, the court found that continued records destruction would lead to \u201cconcrete and personal damage\u201d to their careers. The court explained that the damage may take the form of economic harm, but at a minimum would be \u201cequivalent to the type of non-economic [aesthetic or environmental] injury recognized ... in <em>United States </em>v. <em>SCRAP, </em>412 U.S. 669, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 37 L.Ed.2d 254 [ (1972) ].\u201d 485 F.Supp. at 226-27 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The second group of plaintiffs consisted of \u201cindividuals who, as subjects of FBI investigations or alleged victims of FBI activities, claim to have suffered legal wrongs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226. The court said that these plaintiffs, who also had requested or intended to request FBI files, had an interest in preserving possible . documentary \u201cevidence necessary for legal action to remedy these alleged wrongs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 227. Their \u201cstake in this action,\u201d their harm, is \u201can inability to obtain the FBI documents relating to their particular claims.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">The third category of plaintiffs included organizations that sought to further \u201ccivil liberties; civil rights; social, cultural, and economic change; and world peace.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). These plaintiffs argued that the destruction of FBI files deprived them of primary research materials, from which they could glean and disseminate information for organizational, educational, and political purposes. The court stated that this asserted injury was more questionable. The court concluded, however, that \u201cthe plaintiffs in the other groups have adequately shown injury for standing purposes,\u201d so that it need not decide if the organizations in the third category had failed to do so. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">The district court found that all the plaintiffs \u201csatisfped] the second prong of the standing test,\u201d including the \u201czone of interests\u201d requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-12\">[T]he various laws here involved govern the creation, preservation, maintenance, and disposal of federal records. These laws are designed primarily for the orderly management of government files, but among their other important purposes is the preservation of documents which may be of use to private citizens.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b142-14\">The district court\u2019s second opinion on standing responded to a government motion arguing that the intervening <em>Kissinger </em>decision \u201cdestroyed] plaintiffs\u2019 standing to sue\u201d by undermining the district court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs were \u201carguably\u201d within the \u201czone of interests\u201d of the records management statutes. <em>American Friends Service Committee </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>494 F.Supp. 803, 804-05 (D.D.C.1980). A footnote to the district court\u2019s opinion ably summarizes most of the distinctions between <em>Kissinger </em>and this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>[O]ne cannot conclude that . .. because parties may not have a legally-cognizable interest [a private right of action] in the direct recovery of records which governmental authorities have permitted a private person to take, they also lack an interest, sufficient for standing purposes, in preventing government itself to destroy records which under the terms of the law it is required to retain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">494 F.Supp. at 806 n. 8 (citing <em>Kissinger, </em>445 U.S. at 150 n. 5, 100 S.Ct. at 968 n. 5). Furthermore, the district court pointed out that <em>Kissinger's </em>footnote five left open \u201cthe issue whether private parties might have a remedy [through an APA action] in the event the agency heads and the Attorney General breach their duty to enforce the Records Act against unauthorized removals by private parties. 494 F.Supp. at 805-06 (footnote omitted). Reasoning that it would have been illogical for <em>Kissinger </em>to have left the issue of this APA remedy open at the same time it foreclosed standing to bring the APA action, the district court concluded that <em>Kissinger </em>should not be read to imply that the zone of interests of the records laws does not encompass plaintiffs injured by such an alleged breach of duty. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AS0\">B. <em>The Government's Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-31\">The government\u2019s argument on standing does not question plaintiffs\u2019 injury in fact.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Instead, the government relies solely on a challenge to the district court\u2019s finding that the plaintiffs are \u201cnot within the zone of interests protected or benefited by the fed-</p>\n<p id=\"Aem\">eral records management and disposal laws.\u201d Government\u2019s Opening Brief at 30. The government points out that \u201c[s]atisfaction of the zone of interests component of the standing inquiry requires some indicia that the litigant\u2019s particular interest was <em>intended </em>to be protected, benefited, or regulated by the statute upon which the litigant\u2019s claim is based.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original) (citing <em>Copper &amp; Brass Fabricators Council, Inc. v.

It cites a passage from the Senate Report on the Federal Records Act of 1950 that states that records come into existence first of all to serve administrative purposes<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> as evidence that the records statutes\u2019 <em>only </em>purpose is to increase the usefulness of records for agency executives. See Government\u2019s Opening Brief at 32. The government also contends that the records disposal criteria in \u00a7\u00a7 3303, 3303a, which Congress first laid out in the Records Disposal Act of 1943, Pub.L. No. 78-115, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4, 6, 57 Stat. 380, 381, only clarified the prior standard, which referred to records of \u201cpermanent value or historical <em>interest to the Federal Government.\u201d </em>Records Disposal Act of 1939, Pub.L. No. 76-295, \u00a7\u00a7 3-5, 53 Stat. 1219, 1220 (emphasis added). Thus, the standard of \u00a7\u00a7 3303, 3303a is supposedly only concerned with the <em>government\u2019s </em>interest in records. Finally, the government reminds us that the 1943 legislation, \u201clike every major piece of modern federal records management and disposal legislation!]] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 was meant to facilitate, not retard, disposition of government records.\u201d Government\u2019s Opening Brief at 33-35 (footnote and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The government tries to erect a Chinese wall between plaintiffs\u2019 interests in this case and parts of the records statutes that it admits do indicate \u201cthat members of the public might have an interest in government records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35. The first of these references to the public interest is in 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101, which requires the \u201chead of each Federal agency\u201d to \u201cmake and preserve records containing adequate and proper documentation ... designed to furnish the information necessary to protect the legal and financial rights ... of persons directly affected by the agency\u2019s activities.\u201d The government strains to isolate \u00a7 3101 from plaintiffs\u2019 interests in records disposal by arguing that \u00a7 3101 imposes a duty on the FBI, not NARS or GSA, and therefore the section \u201cdoes not limit the [GSA] Administrator\u2019s authority to approve disposal of agency records [in accord with \u00a7 3303a].\u201d Government\u2019s Opening Brief at 36-37. In addition, the government suggests that \u00a7 3101 does not establish an interest for plaintiffs in the records because the section leaves the FBI discretion to determine what documentation is \u201cadequate.\u201d Government\u2019s Opening Brief at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The government considers the second reference to the public \u2014 in 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106 and \u00a7 2901(9), which together require the Administrator to provide facilities for furnishing National Archives records (or information from them) to the public \u2014 to be \u201c[t]he only recognition of possible general public interest in federal records ... found in the records management and disposal laws.\u201d Government\u2019s Opening Brief at 37. It argues that these sections do not provide evidence that the \u201czone of interests\u201d of the records laws encompasses the plaintiffs\u2019 interests because this dispute does not involve the records in the Archives. Even if it did, the government continues, the statutes only require the Archives to make information (not records) available, and the Administrator has discretion to decide which Archives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>information services to offer the public.

We approach the \u201czone\u201d test with some trepidation. This court has lamented on a number of occasions that the test is amorphous and confusing.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Our perplexity is not unique; the absence of a clear explanation of the \u201czone\u201d test by the Supreme Court has led other federal courts to apply the test in divergent fashion.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> There certainly has been no dearth of critics of the test,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> one of whom has even pronounced it \u201cextinct\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> \u2014 a bit precipitously. The Supreme Court recently restated, in dicta, that the \u201czone\u201d test remains one of the \u201cprudential principles that bear[s] on the question of standing.\u201d <em>Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church &amp; State, Inc., </em>454 U.S. 464, 474-75, 102 S.Ct. 752, 759-60, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Therefore, we must endeavor again to make sense of the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-15\">The Supreme Court introduced the \u201czone of interests\u201d test in four cases decided in 1970 and 1971.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The spirit that motivated the test was \u201cthe trend ... toward enlargement of the class of people who may protest administrative action.\u201d <em>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150,154, 90 S.Ct. 827, 830, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970). The Court stated that this new test stood in the place of the eroded requirement that a party must have a \u201clegal interest\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> in the agency action under challenge. <em>See id. </em>at 153, 90 S.Ct. at 829. And in all four cases the Court found that the litigants met the new \u201czone\u201d test. Unfortunately, the Court\u2019s explanation of how the \u201czone\u201d test should be applied was cursory, and the conclusory nature of its own application was not elucidating.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Moreover, two members of the Court asserted that the prudential \u201czone\u201d test was not necessary; they believed that the \u201cinjury in fact\u201d test for standing was sufficient. <em>Barlow </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>397 U.S. 159, 167-70, 90 S.Ct. 832, 838-39, 25 L.Ed.2d 192 (1970) (Brennan, J., joined by White, J., concurring in the result and dissenting).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">This court, like others, has struggled to \u201cmak[e] a principled application of [the \u2018zone\u2019] standard.\u201d <em>Control Data Corp. v. Baldrige, </em>655 F.2d 283, 293 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 881, 102 S.Ct. 363, 70 L.Ed.2d 190 (1981). We have concluded that a court applying the \u201czone\u201d test \u201cmust discern whether the interest asserted by a party in the particular instance is one intended by Congress to be protected or regulated by the statute under which suit is brought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 293-94 (footnote omitted) <footnotemark>36</footnotemark> (citing <em>Constructores Civiles de Centroamerica, S.A. v.

Department of the Treasury, </em>679 F.2d 951, 952 (D.C.Cir.1982) (\u201czone\u201d standard requires some slight indicia that the statutory intent was to protect, benefit, or regulate the litigant\u2019s interest). To evaluate whether Congress had such an intent, our court and others generally have looked to relevant statutory provisions and their legislative history. <em>Control Data, </em>655 F.2d at 294 (footnotes and citations omitted).<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> A court obviously has considerable leeway in applying this test, through both its identification of the perimeter of the \u201czone\u201d of statutory interests and \u201cthe nature and quantity of the \u2018beneficial indicia\u2019 it requires\u201d to fall within the \u201czone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). This court has stated that \u201cslight beneficiary indicia\u201d are sufficient to sustain standing. <em>Constructores Civiles de Cen-troamerica, </em>459 F.2d at 1189.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Of course if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>there is <em>\u201cno </em>evidence of an intent to protect or benefit\u201d plaintiffs, the \u201czone\u201d test cannot be met. <em>Control Data, </em>655 F.2d at 295 (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">This guidance on how to apply the \u201czone\u201d test is not altogether satisfactory. <em>See Copper &amp; Brass Fabricators Council, </em>679 F.2d at 953-55 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in the result). We have two particular concerns. First, a test that focuses on whether Congress <em>intended </em>to protect or benefit certain interests may be stricter than the Supreme Court\u2019s statement that the complainant\u2019s interest need only be <em>\u201carguably </em>within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute ... in question.\u201d <em>Data Processing, </em>397 U.S. at 153, 90 S.Ct. at 829 (emphasis added). Second, it may run counter to the Court\u2019s purpose for developing the \u201czone\u201d test \u2014 to enlarge the class of people with standing \u2014 to deny standing to parties who have both suffered concrete injury caused by agency action and satisfied other prudential concerns, solely because a search for snippets of congressional language about their particular interest reveals nothing determinative. <em>Cf. Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., </em>438 U.S. 59, 80-81, 98 S.Ct. 2620, 2634, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1978) (\u201cWhere a party champions his own rights [as distinguished from the rights of a third party], and where the injury alleged is a concrete and particularized one which will be prevented or redressed by the relief requested, the basic practical and prudential concerns underlying the standing doctrine are generally satisfied when the constitutional requisites are met.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">Given these concerns with our own court\u2019s \u201czone\u201d test, it is especially important in applying the test to keep in mind the Court\u2019s statement in <em>Valley Forge College </em>\u2014that the prudential principles of standing (including the \u201czone\u201d test) are \u201cclose[ly] relatfed] to the policies reflected in the Art. Ill requirement of actual or threatened injury amenable to judicial remedy.\u201d 454 U.S. at 475, 102 S.Ct. at 760.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The government does not contest in this case any Article III requirements or any prudential limitations other than the \u201czone\u201d test. Therefore, in examining whether the requisite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>slight indicia of congressional concern with the plaintiffs\u2019 acknowledged injury are present, we believe it appropriate to define a wide perimeter for the \u201czone\u201d and to recall the Supreme Court\u2019s formula that plaintiffs\u2019 interests need only be \u201carguably\u201d within that zone.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">2. <em>The Effect of Kissinger on Plaintiffs\u2019 Standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">We turn first to the government\u2019s assertion that <em>Kissinger </em>should settle the \u201czone\u201d issue here without further analysis. Like the district court, we cannot accept this short cut through the \u201czone.\u201d First, <em>Kissinger </em>analyzed the records management statutes to determine whether the plaintiffs could assert a private right of action under those laws. Certainly the relatively rigorous requirements for establishing congressional intent to create a private right of action<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> should not be equated with the \u201cslight\u201d indicia standard under the \u201czone\u201d test. Since <em>Kissinger </em>made its findings about congressional intent in a different context and with a different standard, it would be inappropriate to have them control here absent additional supporting analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Second, <em>Kissinger </em>stated that it was <em>not </em>deciding the question of whether Congress intended private parties to have any remedies under the APA for agency actions in breach of a duty to enforce the records laws. 445 U.S. at 150 n. 5, 100 S.Ct. at 968 n. 5. Like the district court, we cannot reconcile how the Court could leave open the question of an APA remedy for private parties while it also supposedly decided that the records laws would not permit any private plaintiffs the standing to seek the remedy. <em>See American Friends Service Committee v. Webster, 494 </em>F.Supp. at 805-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">Third, the <em>particular interests </em>of the plaintiffs in <em>Kissinger </em>were different from those of the plaintiffs here. In <em>Kissinger, </em>the plaintiffs wanted the Library of Congress to return allegedly wrongfully removed records to the State Department so that the records could be processed under FOIA requests. In this case, the plaintiffs, who have sought or plan to seek access to FBI records, want to halt alleged wrongful record <em>destruction </em>(no chance of later retrieval or access through another government institution) <em>by the government itself. </em>As we explained above, the \u201czone\u201d test is supposed to focus on \u201cthe interest asserted by a party in the particular instance.\u201d <em>Control Data, </em>655 F.2d at 293-94 (footnote omitted). Since <em>Kissinger </em>involved interests substantially different from those of the plaintiffs here, we are understandably wary of extending to the plaintiffs\u2019 interests here, without further analysis, <em>Kissinger\u2019s </em>statements about Congress\u2019 intentions regarding the <em>Kissinger </em>plaintiffs\u2019 interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">Finally, we decline to accept the government\u2019s suggestion that one sentence characterizing Senate Report language quoted in <em>Kissinger </em>necessitates our reversal of the district court. The sentence and quotation are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>The legislative history of the [Records] Acts reveals that their purpose was not to benefit private parties, but solely to benefit the agencies themselves and the Federal Government as a whole. The Senate Report to the Federal Records Act of 1950 reveals this focus. S.Rep. No. 2140, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 4 (1950). The Report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">\u201cIt is well to emphasize that records come into existence, or should do so, not in order to fill filing cabinets or occupy floor space, or even to satisfy the archival needs of this and future generations, but <em>first </em>of all to serve the administrative and executive purposes of the organization that creates them. There is danger of this simple, self-evident fact being lost for lack of emphasis. The measure of effective records management should be its usefulness to the executives who are responsible for accomplishing the substantive purposes of the organization.... [The] <em>first interest </em>is in the establishment of a useful system of documentation that will enable [the executive] to have the information he needs available when he needs it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-6\"><em>Kissinger, </em>445 U.S. at 149, 100 S.Ct. at 968 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">To begin with, we must question whether the passage from the Senate Report supports the Court\u2019s statement that the purpose of the records acts \u201cwas ... solely to benefit the agencies .. . and the Federal Government.\u201d The Senate Report states that the records are <em>created \u201cfirst of all\u201d </em>to serve the organization and that the <em>\u201cfirst interest\u201d </em>of an executive is an information system that gives him what he needs when he needs it. This language suggests the existence of a number of interests. Indeed, the same paragraph of the Senate Report states that \u201c[t]he establishment of an orderly system of [records] disposal is not the <em>major interest </em>of an executive in records.\u201d S.Rep. No. 2140, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 4 (1950), U.S.Code Cong.Serv. 1950, pp. 3547, 3550 (emphasis added). And the paragraph concludes that \u201c[tjhere is no essential conflict in these <em>two interests </em>[orderly records disposal and an information system that maintains necessary materials], but they should be kept in proper perspective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">Thus, the 1950 Senate Report reveals that the records laws are concerned at a minimum with two interests \u2014 providing public executives with useful information and disposing of records in an orderly manner. But the quoted passage from the \u201cGeneral Statement\u201d section of the 1950 Senate Report is not a good source of evaluating whether <em>plaintiffs\u2019 interests </em>might be within the \u201czone\u201d of the records laws concerning <em>disposal, see </em>44 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3302, 3303, 3303a, because the disposal laws were not even a part of the Federal Records Act of 1950.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> To identify whether there are slight indicia that plaintiffs\u2019 interests are within the \u201czone\u201d of the disposal laws, we look next to statutory sources that deal directly with records disposal and preservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">3. <em>The \u201cZone\u201d Reflected in the Statutory Language</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-13\">The key features of the records disposal system are set out in 44 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3302, 3303, 3303a. We have already referred to the statutory standard for records maintenance: \u201csufficient administrative, le<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>gal, research, or other value to warrant their further preservation by the Government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3303, 3303a. (Subsection 3303a(a) substitutes the word \u201ccontinued\u201d for \u201cfurther,\u201d which appears in both \u00a7 3303 and \u00a7 3303a(d).) Standing alone, that phrase suggests that Congress intended the records to be available for specific purposes, but does not imply for whom. One subsection suggests, however, that Congress had something other than a corporative state notion in mind, wherein the government\u2019s records would only be available for the government\u2019s administrative, legal, and research interests. Subsection 3303a(c) permits the Administrator of GSA to seek advice from Congress on the disposal of any \u201cparticular records\u201d that he considers may be of \u201cspecial interest to the Congress\u201d or when he considers consultation to be \u201cin the public interest.\u201d Both these considerations undercut the notion that records are kept only for executive branch management purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Congress may well have considered that it might need to be consulted about records disposition when the disposal decision evoked significant public concern or outrage. As the body representing the public\u2019s various interests, Congress could best advise NARS about how a disposal decision should take account of \u201cthe public interest,\u201d a criterion for consultation identified by \u00a7 3303a(c) itself. In practice, we expect that Congress\u2019 counsel to NARS depends in large part on public reactions to and fears about records destruction.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Therefore, there appears to be an intent underlying this specific consultative mechanism to recognize and protect the public\u2019s interests in government records (not just the agency\u2019s interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">This evidence that Congress expected private parties to have an interest in records preservation is bolstered considerably by <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3101, which sets out the general records management duties of agency heads. That section requires agency heads to \u201cpreserve records ... to furnish the information necessary to protect the legal and financial rights of the Government <em>and </em>of persons directly affected by the agency\u2019s activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The final phrase is right on target for one of the three categories of plaintiffs bringing this action; those plaintiffs do not just hit the zone, they score a bull\u2019s-eye. The government contends that we should ignore \u00a7 3101 because it imposes a duty on the FBI, not NARS, does not limit NARS\u2019 authority to approve of disposals under \u00a7 3303a, and leaves the FBI the discretion to determine what is \u201cadequate\u201d documentation. This argument overlooks two points: (1) this case involves both the FBI\u2019s and NARS\u2019 performance of records preservation and disposal duties, and (2) in a \u201czone\u201d standing analysis we do not evaluate the correctness of the FBI\u2019s or NARS\u2019 actions, but only determine if there is even slight evidence of congressional intent to protect, benefit, or regulate plaintiffs\u2019 interests. There is no doubt that \u00a7 3101 is evidence of Congress\u2019 intent to protect some of the plaintiffs\u2019 interests here.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">The laws pertaining to the National Archives also provide evidence of Congress\u2019 intent to benefit these plaintiffs through preservation of records of \u201cresearch\u201d value under \u00a7\u00a7 3303, 3303a. The government charily admits, as discussed above, that 44 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2106, 2901(9) provide \u201c[t]he only recognition of a possible general public interest in federal records.\u201d Government\u2019s Opening Brief at 37. We find other sections that also support the public\u2019s interest in Archives materials. <em>See, e.g., </em>44 U.S.C. \u00a7 2103(3) (authorizing transfer of Archives records \u201cto public or educational institutions or associations\u201d), \u00a7 2105 (requiring exhibition of records as appropriate, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>guides to facilitate use and publication of historical works), \u00a7 2110 (authorizing preservation, exhibition, and release \u201cfor nonprofit educational purposes\u201d of films, still pictures, and sound recordings).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The government would ignore this evidence of Congress\u2019 intent to protect and benefit plaintiffs\u2019 interests and seal it off from the \u201czone\u201d of the records management and disposal laws. The government argues that this case does not involve Archives records. This contention severs the \u201czone\u201d from the \u201czone of interests\u201d test. It also ignores the simple, practical fact that government records can only be accepted by the Archives, where they may be made available to the public, if the agency that creates them has not destroyed them first. As explained in Part II, the records management and disposal laws constitute an integrated system for handling records. Under this system agencies generally manage their own records programs, while operating under NARS principles and guidance. When it comes time for an agency to dispose of records, the agency proposes records schedules for disposal to NARS, which must decide whether the schedules meet the \u00a7 3303a standard. The term \u201cdisposal\u201d itself is defined to include transferring records of \u201csufficient historical or other value to warrant continued preservation\u201d to the National Archives. 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 2901(5)(C). Finally, NARS may accept and select certain agency records for deposit in the Archives. In evaluating whether Congress intended to protect or benefit particular interests through the records disposal process, we cannot ignore what Congress said about the interests it intended to benefit through its records preservation requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">4. <em>The \u201cZone\u201d Reflected in the Legislative History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">We have found in the pertinent records statutes considerably more than slight indi-cia that Congress intended to benefit and protect some of the plaintiffs\u2019 particular interests in this case. Therefore, we make only a few supplementary supportive points about the legislative history of these laws. First, the government argues that when Congress created the records disposal standard of 44 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3303, 3303a in 1943, it only restated more clearly the prior standard, which referred to records of \u201cpermanent value or historical interest to the Federal Government.\u201d <em>See </em>Records Disposal Act of 1939, Pub.L. No. 76-295, \u00a7\u00a7 3-5, 53 Stat. 1219, 1220. The present standard refers to \u201csufficient administrative, legal, research, or other value to warrant ... preservation by the Government.\u201d 44 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3303, 3303a. The legislative history\u2019s only explanation of the substitution is that the old standard was \u201cambiguous.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 559, 78th Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (1943). The government wants us to believe that Congress, in the course of specifying its preservation criteria more carefully, did not realize that it was deleting the reference to the government\u2019s interest as an exclusive one. This is unlikely. It is more probable that Congress wanted to clarify the reasons for preserving records and this refinement included removing any impression that only the government would have an interest in the records. This is how NARS appears to have interpreted its mandate to set standards for preservation according to its Handbook on the disposition of federal records.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">Second, we note that the legislative history of the Federal Records Act of 1950, Pub.L. No. 81-754, 64 Stat. 583, also suggests a congressional intent to benefit and protect plaintiffs\u2019 interests \u2014 thereby adding yet another reason why we cannot rely solely on the 1950 Senate Report passage, cited first in <em>Kissinger </em>and then by the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>ment, to resolve the \u201czone\u201d issue. Subsection 506(a) (codified at 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101) of the 1950 legislation stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\">The head of each Federal agency shall cause to be made and preserved records containing adequate and proper documentation of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, and essential transactions of the agency and designed to furnish the <em>information necessary to protect the legal and financial rights </em>of the Government and <em>of persons directly affected by the agency\u2019s activities.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">64 Stat. 586 (emphasis added). Both the Senate and House Reports stated that \u00a7 506(a) \u201cprovides a general declaration by the Congress [to maintain adequate records].\u201d S.Rep. No. 2140, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 15 (1950), U.S.Code Cong.Serv. p. 3562 [hereinafter \u201c1950 S.Rep.\u201d]; H.R.Rep. No. 2747, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 14 (1950) [hereinafter \u201c1950 H.R.Rep.\u201d]. The reports also explained that the provision was necessary because \u201c[s]pecific laws direct the heads of certain agencies to ... maintain certain records, but there is no general requirement.\u201d 1950 S.Rep. at 15, U.S.Code Cong. Serv. 1950, p. 3562; 1950 H.R.Rep. at 14. The government seizes on the phrases \u201cgeneral declaration\u201d and \u201cgeneral requirement\u201d to imply that Congress did not intend \u00a7 506(a) to impose any particular duty. This contention cannot overcome the specific language at the end of the subsection, which imposes a responsibility to preserve records to furnish information to protect the rights of persons directly affected by agency activities. That language imposes a \u201cgeneral\u201d duty in the sense that Congress imposed it without adding exact instructions on implementation and in the sense that the requirement is applied across-the-board to all agencies. Specific laws direct particular agency heads to preserve certain records, as the report language explained, but Congress apparently believed that the need to protect records concerning allegedly injured private parties was a general one extending to all agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Section 507 of the 1950 legislation (codified as amended at 44 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2101, 2103-2110), also reflects Congress\u2019 recognition that private parties such as some of these plaintiffs have an interest in agency records. Section 507 dealt in part with transferring records from agencies to the National Archives. It included \u201ca general repeal clause [for records in existence for 50 years] to statutory and other restrictions governing the <em>use of records by scholars and the public generally.\u201d </em>1950 S.Rep. at 16, U.S.Code Cong.Serv. 1950, p. 3563; 1950 H.R.Rep. at 15. (Emphasis added.) If Congress did not expect the public to have access to and an interest in these records, there would be no reason for the restrictions on the use of some records and no purpose served by the general rule that restrictions should be removed after 50 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">This 50 year limit was reduced to 30 years in 1978, see Act of Oct. 5, 1978, Pub.L. No. 95 \u2014 416, 92 Stat. 915 (amending 44 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2103, 2104). At that time Congress reiterated the interest that researchers and the general public have in agency records. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1522, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 2, 3 (1978), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 2288. In particular, the House Report explained that the change from 50 to 30 years was designed to make access by the public <em>easier:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">The Archivist has no authority [under the pre-1978 law] to remove restrictions placed by agencies until the documents are 50 years old. As a result, requests for restricted documents must be made under the Freedom of Information Act, an inefficient way to deal with large numbers of historical documents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-10\">More careful scrutiny when restrictions are proposed should <em>simplify access problems for the researcher, </em>the agency, and the Archives.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 2, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 2289 (emphasis added). A letter from the Acting Administrator of GSA, expressing GSA\u2019s views on the bill to the House committee, also recognized the public\u2019s interest. This bill, he wrote, \u201cwould assure a more equitable balance between protecting those records which legitimately require protection for a period of time and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>providing greater public access to records of historical significance and interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 2291 (appending letter of July 10, 1978, from Robert Griffin, Acting GSA Administrator, to the Hon. Jack Brooks, Chairman of the House Committee on Government Operations).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">5. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">In sum, the legislative history of the records acts supports a finding that Congress intended, expected, and positively desired private researchers and private parties whose rights may have been affected by government actions to have access to the documentary history of the federal government. Of course, that access is subject to various restrictions, including possibly an appropriate delay of time. At this date, however, even a 30-year wait would permit access to records on World War II, the Korean War, the Rosenbergs\u2019 investigation and trial, and the McCarthy era.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Various private parties and the public cannot review records that an agency has destroyed in violation of the disposal laws. This appears to us to be a sufficient interest, given Congress\u2019 expressions about these parties\u2019 and the public\u2019s expected access to records, to be \u201carguably\u201d within the \u201czone\u201d of the disposal statutes. The disposal laws refer to administrative, legal, and research concerns. It is clear that Congress did not expect that only the government would have those concerns and that only the government would benefit from proper disposal practices. In addition, some of the plaintiffs\u2019 interests are even more directly covered by the language of the laws dealing with preservation duties. <em>See </em>44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101. Therefore, we conclude that the plaintiffs meet the \u201czone of interests\" test for standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">V. Compliance with the Disposal Laws</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">A. <em>District Court Findings</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ah2\">The district court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-12\">[t]he evidence ... shows that the Archivist and those under his supervision have failed for a period of over thirty years adequately to carry out [their] statutory and regulatory responsibilities with respect to the records of the Federal Bureau of Investigation..</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-13\"><em>American Friends Service Committee v. Webster, </em>485 F.Supp. at 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-14\">In its review of the facts, the court stressed that the Archivist rarely exercised any review over FBI records disposal practices during that thirty-year period. <em>Id. </em>at 229. In 1946, the Archives approved an FBI request to destroy all closed field office files, operating under what the court found to be \u201cthe [incorrect] theory ... that these files were mere duplicates of the records . .. maintained at FBI headquarters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In 1969, NARS \u201cpromulgated a new plan purporting to establish document retention standards and providing that FBI records officers would identify the specific series of files to be retained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). In 1975 and again in 1976, the FBI made requests, the longest of which was about 150 words (half a page), to dispose of certain field office files, and the Archives granted both promptly. In 1977, NARS approved a slightly more extensive FBI records disposal schedule covering primarily headquarters files. <em>See id. </em>at 229-31.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"a0b-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>The district court found it especially troubling that \u201c[d]uring that entire period, neither in connection with the approval of the various plans and schedules nor during the interim years did a single employee of the Archives see a single FBI file.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229 (footnote omitted). Not until 1978, \u201cas a result of media and congressional interest ..., [did] two or three Archives employees ... inspect ... some seventy-six files\u201d at FBI headquarters and several field offices. <em>Id. </em>at 230. \u201cBut even that inspection was limited to records which FBI personnel had preselected (after the Archives employees had designated the general areas in which they wished to cond\u00fact audits).\u201d Id.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The court noted that as a result of this extreme deference to the FBI, all NARS decisions were made on the basis of the FBI\u2019s representations \u2014 which \u201cwere in some respects incorrect, and in all respects unverified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229. In particular, NARS never ensured \u201cthat the FBI, on its own, was preserving not only records suited to its own bureaucratic and operational needs but also records useful for historical and other research and for the safeguarding of legal rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">On the basis of these facts, the district court made its legal conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">It is thus clear that the Archivist never discharged his statutory responsibility to make independent judgments concerning the record retention and destruction practices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation... . [T]he Bureau\u2019s records disposal program, never having been considered and passed upon in any meaningful way by the Archives, cannot continue to be implemented consistently with the statutory mandate that records may be destroyed only pursuant to standards and procedures promulgated and approved by the archival authorities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">The district court stressed three aspects of NARS\u2019 \u201carchival neglect.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>48</em></footnotemark><em> </em>First, NARS failed to inspect records. Second, NARS \u201cfailed to conduct critical examinations of the [1975,1976, and 1977] schedules submitted [by the FBI] ... to ascertain whether, by the FBI\u2019s own descriptions, records were being retained in accordance with the standards imposed by law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Third, NARS did not \u201crequire the FBI to submit the very minimal forms required under the regulations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">Finally, the court noted two of the harms caused by the government\u2019s failure to implement the records laws properly. First, it observed that the destruction of field office files meant that \u201c[r]aw investigative data[,] . .. ordinarily maintained solely in the field offices,\u201d would be lost for all time. <em>Id. </em>at 232. The court remarked that these data are both \u201cthe stuff of primary research\u201d for scholars inquiring how and why FBI investigations are conducted, and the core evidence for people claiming that FBI investi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>gative practices violated their legal rights. Moreover, the court stated that the government\u2019s witnesses conceded that their standard for forwarding material to FBI headquarters was <em>solely </em>whether the records would assist the headquarters staff in law enforcement and in making agency decisions. <em>Id. </em>\u201cNo effort was made at any time to forward to headquarters data which might be regarded as useful or significant in other respects; <em>e.g., </em>records having historical or research value, [or] documents bearing on the legal rights of individuals....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The second harm was that NARS \u201cacquiesced in ... FBI measures to escape the burdens of the Freedom of Information Act by disposing of some of its files.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Even though \u201c[i]t appears likely that the agencies\u2019 concerns were . .. limited to minimizing the administrative difficulties,\u201d the court believed \u201cit is clear that the FOIA influenced the drafting of the 1977 schedule and reflected an [impermissible] bias ... in favor of the destruction ... of governmental records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">B. <em>The Government\u2019s Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The government offers three challenges to the district court\u2019s conclusions. First, the government contends that the FBI\u2019s records disposal system has been, and continues to be, in compliance with the law. It traces the FBI\u2019s authority to dispose of closed field office files to the 1946 approval of a disposal schedule by Congress\u2019 Joint Committee on the Disposition of Executive Papers. <em>See </em>Government\u2019s Opening Brief at 48 (citing 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3306, <em>repealed by </em>Act of June 23, 1970, Pub.L. No. 91-287, \u00a7 2, 84 Stat. 320, 321-22); Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit 17 (the 1946 FBI disposal schedule, including notation of congressional approval of disposal job no. 346-S237). The government maintains that this disposal authority was not affected by Congress\u2019 decision in 1970 to delegate to NARS the power to approve of disposal schedules. Government\u2019s Opening Brief at 49-50. The 1975 and 1976 disposal schedules for field office files, approved by NARS, \u201csimply reaffirmed the determination ... made in 1946.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50-51. Furthermore, the government states that the district court was \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d in finding that NARS, in evaluating disposal schedules for field office files, assumed that field office and headquarters records were practically identical. <em>Id. </em>at 51-52. The government concludes that the court wrongly imposed its own assessment that \u201craw investigative data\u201d in field office files were the valuable \u201cstuff of primary research\u201d \u2014 -and the government adds that Congress has not required the FBI to preserve primary research material in any case. <em>Id. </em>at 52-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Second, the government maintains that it does not have any duty to inspect agency records before it approves of their disposal. In evaluating agency proposals for records disposal, NARS need only \u201cexamine the lists and schedules submitted.\u201d 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3303a(a). The government points out that NARS may decide to inspect records under <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2906, but that the \u00a7 2906 authority is permissive, not required. <em>See </em>Government\u2019s Opening Brief at 53-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">Third, the government attacks the district court\u2019s conclusion that NARS \u201cabdicated\u201d its statutory responsibilities to the FBI. The government believes the court was confused about the allocation of duties under the records laws: It argues that it is NARS\u2019 responsibility to set \u201cgeneral standards indicating what kind of records the FBI should preserve,\u201d and the FBI\u2019s duty to apply those standards. <em>Id. </em>at 57-58. Moreover, the government suggests that the court\u2019s focus on the 1977 schedule is misplaced because that schedule has never been implemented.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> In addition, the government explains that NARS could \u201crely on the FBI to apply the standards set in the 1946, 1975, and 1976 records disposal schedules\u201d because Congress approved those basic standards in the 1946 schedule. <em>Id. </em>at 58. And the Records Retention Plan (an approach NARS has abandoned) developed from 1968 to 1970 also supposedly did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>involve improper delegation by NARS because under the regulations in effect it was the FBI\u2019s job to identify the specific series or records segments for preservation within the general categories established by NARS. <em>Id. </em>at 59-60 (citing 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 101-11.403.3(c) (1979)). Finally, the government maintains that NARS correctly aided the FBI in minimizing administrative difficulties associated with FOIA requests and that in doing so NARS actually protected FOIA concerns. Government\u2019s Opening Brief at 61-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">C. <em>Analysis of Alleged Disposal Violations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">1. <em>Scope of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Under the APA, we \u201cshall hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). In this case, this test requires two basic inquiries. The first is whether NARS properly interpreted its statutory responsibilities \u2014 whether its actions were \u201cin accordance with law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In making this inquiry we give the agency interpretation some deference, but by no means forego our traditional role of deciding \u201call relevant questions of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 706. <em>See Federal Election Commission v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, </em>454 U.S. 27, 32, 39, 102 S.Ct. 38, 42, 46, 70 L.Ed.2d 23 (1981); <em>Office of Communication of the United Church of Christ v. FCC, </em>707 F.2d 1413, 1422-23 (D.C.Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The second question is whether the agency actions taken under the statutory authority are \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d The Supreme Court recently summarized the requirements of this standard in <em>Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983). \u201cThe scope of review ... is narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2866. \u201cNevertheless, the agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2866-67 (quoting <em>Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 156, 168, 83 S.Ct. 239, 245, 9 L.Ed.2d 207 (1962)). \u201cIn reviewing that explanation, we must \u2018consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2867 (quoting both <em>Bowman Transportation, Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., </em>419 U.S. 281, 285, 95 S.Ct. 438, 441, 42 L.Ed.2d 447 (1974) and <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 823, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971)). Of course, we recognize that there is a major analytical difference between reciting this guidance and applying it to the facts of specific agency action. As this court commented in <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. SEC, </em>606 F.2d 1031 (D.C.Cir.1979) (footnote omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-11\">[T]he concept of \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d review defies generalized application and demands, instead, close attention to the nature of the particular problem faced by the agency. The stringency of our review, in a given case, depends upon analysis of a number of factors, including the intent of Congress, as expressed in the relevant statutes ...; the needs, expertise, and impartiality of the agency as regards the issue presented; and the ability of the court effectively to evaluate the questions posed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-12\"><em>Id. </em>103 S.Ct. at 1050, <em>quoted in Office of Communication of the United Church of Christ, </em>707 F.2d at 1425 n. 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">2. <em>Statutory Responsibilities</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-14\">The district court found that NARS failed to carry out a number of statutory and regulatory responsibilities with respect to the disposal of FBI records. First among these omissions was the failure to inspect FBI records. While we agree that NARS\u2019 ability to make independent judgments about records retention and destruction practices would be enhanced by such inspections, we conclude that inspections are not required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>The pertinent language of 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 2906(a)(1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\">In carrying out his duties and responsibilities under <em>this chapter </em>[44 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2901 to 2909], the Administrator ... or his designee <em>may </em>inspect the records or the records management practices and programs of any Federal agency solely for the purpose of rendering recommendations for the improvement of records management practices and programs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aa-dedup-0\">(Emphasis added.) The use of the word \u201cmay\u201d grants permissive authority without requiring any action. Furthermore, the reference to chapter 29, which deals primarily with NARS\u2019 functions of setting standards for and offering advice to agencies, suggests that this inspection authority is not directly linked to the records disposal provisions in chapter 33. While we certainly do not imply that NARS\u2019 inspections and follow-up recommendations on \u201crecords management practices and programs\u201d under \u00a7 2906 cannot address records disposal and preservation issues, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2902(5), 2905(a), such inspections are not compulsory.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">We also cannot find a duty for NARS to inspect records in the statutes dealing specifically with records disposal. Section 3302 requires NARS to promulgate regulations establishing both procedures for compiling and submitting lists and schedules of records for disposal, and procedures for disposing of records. After agencies propose lists or schedules of records for disposal, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3303, NARS is to examine them (not necessarily the records themselves) under \u00a7 3303a. Section 3303a then requires NARS to \u201cdetermine [ ] that ... the records listed in a list or schedule\u201d meet the disposal standards, a mandate that invites record sampling but again does not require it.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The district court\u2019s one specific citation supporting its finding of a duty to inspect, 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 101-11.403-4(e) (1979), also cannot bear the weight of an inspection requirement. That regulation stated that NARS \u201cwill conduct periodic inspections to assure that the [regulatory] provisions [dealing with the maintenance of specific records or file segments specified for retention] ... are being carried out.\u201d The inspections under \u00a7 101-11.403-4(e) appear to have been linked to the disposal process. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 101-11.403-2(c) (1979).<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> It is not clear, however, whether those inspections would have necessarily involved screening particular records. It is arguable that a records check would have been necessary to ensure that an agency had been segregating the specific records or files segments it had marked for retention. But we need not pursue this argument because there is a more important limit on our ability to act on the basis of \u00a7 101-11.403-4(e) in this case: Subsection 101-11.403-4(e) and the particular preservation program of which it was a part have been superseded in the regulations; the present regulations focus agency efforts on the development of comprehensive schedules for records disposal rather than an identification of a core set of records for preservation. <em>See </em>Government\u2019s Opening Brief at 12 n. 10, 59; <em>compare </em>41 C.F.R. \u00a7 101-11.404-1 (1982) <em>with id. </em>\u00a7 101-11.403 (1979). Given plaintiffs\u2019 request for prospective relief with respect to FBI records, even if we found that NARS had failed to perform required inspections under the old system, that shortfall would have no current significance so long as the FBI\u2019s present disposal program complies with present regulations.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>The district court also found that NARS misinterpreted its duty under \u00a7 3303a to conduct critical examinations of the 1975, 1976, and 1977 FBI disposal schedules before approving them. On its face, \u00a7 3303a requires an examination and determination by the GSA Administrator (or NARS) that the records disposal lists and schedules proposed by an agency meet the disposal stan- \u2019 dards. <em>See also </em>41 C.F.R. \u00a7 101-11.404-1 (1982) (outlining NARS\u2019 role in the preparation and approval of comprehensive agency records disposition schedules); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 101-11.405 (explaining that NARS sets standards for and determines whether records are of permanent value); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 101-11.406 (describing the process through which NARS approves requests to dispose of records). The government presents three arguments to the effect that NARS need not have undertaken a critical examination of these three schedules. We find them unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">First, the government suggests that NARS\u2019 duty extends only to setting standards for records retention and providing advice to agencies on how to operate their records programs. True, NARS is required to perform these functions. <em>See, e.g., </em>44 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2904, 2905. But neither these tasks nor its limited number of personnel relieve NARS of its statutorily assigned duties in the records disposal process. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3302, 3303a. In 1970, Congress clearly intended to transfer final approval authority over the disposal of records to NARS; in doing so it repealed the laws that required referral of all disposal lists and schedules to a joint congressional committee for review and recommendation. <em>See </em>Act of June 23, 1970, Pub.L. No. 91\u2014 287, \u00a7 2, 84 Stat. 320, 321-22 (1971). NARS now has sole approval responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Second, the government contends that the 1975 and 1976 schedules for field office files merely \u201creaffirmed\u201d the 1946 schedule approved by Congress; therefore, they need no scrutiny. This reasoning would have us rely on a one paragraph description of field office records in the 1946 schedule<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> \u2014 which contains almost no explanation of why these records do not warrant preservation and which Congress approved almost forty years ago \u2014 to immunize all FBI field office files from the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 3302, 3303a (and regulations thereunder) until the FBI decides to propose a \u201cnon-affirming\u201d schedule. If we accorded such a long reach to the 1946 approval, we would allow the FBI to circumvent Congress\u2019 subsequent statutory instructions on records preservation duties and retention standards, <em>see, e.g., </em>44 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2905, 3101, as well as the statutory process for approving disposals that Congress recrafted in 1970, see <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3303a.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">Congress did not intend to grant the FBI such a blank check for records disposal. Section 3314 states that \u201c[t]he procedures prescribed by [chapter 33] are exclusive, and records of the United States Govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>ment may not be alienated or destroyed except under [chapter 33].\u201d Section 3105 requires agency heads to establish safeguards to prevent records destruction except in accord with \u00a7\u00a7 3301 to 3314. Of course chapter 33 includes \u00a7 3303a, which requires the Administrator of GSA (or NARS) to examine and approve all proposed schedules for records disposal. The government comes close to admitting that it must comply with \u00a7 3303a in its explanation of why it offered the 1975 and 1976 schedules in the first place \u2014 \u201cthe FBI was concerned that it comply with the spirit of the records disposal laws as well as their letter.\u201d Government\u2019s Opening Brief at 50. In evaluating whether NARS needed to evaluate and approve the 1975 and 1976 schedules, we abide by the letter of \u00a7 3303a, which states that NARS had that duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The government\u2019s argument is further undercut by its own regulations. The present regulations define \u201ctemporary records\u201d as records that the <em>Archivist </em>has determined to be of insufficient value to warrant preservation. 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 101-11.-406-2 (1982). By designating records as \u201ctemporary,\u201d NARS earmarks them for future destruction or donation. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 101-11.402, .406-2. According to \u00a7 101-11.406-2, NARS\u2019 determination may take one of three forms: a one-time authorization of records identified on a disposal list; a designation as disposal under a General Records Schedule issued by NARS for records common to many agencies <em>(e.g., </em>payroll and personnel records); or \u201c[a] series of recurring records designated as disposable in an agency records disposition schedule approved by NARS (\u00a7 101-11.404-1).\u201d The only category the 1946 schedule could even remotely fit is the third. But an examination of \u00a7 101-11.404-1 reveals that it falls woefully short of the requirements of \u201cComprehensive agency records disposition schedules.\u201d These schedules are to cover all agency records, to include certain specific statements and descriptions, to be reviewed annually, to be updated as necessary, and to be approved by NARS. In sum, the 1946 schedule does not meet the regulatory requirements authorizing ongoing disposal, so the 1975 and 1976 schedules cannot \u201creaf-f\u00ed\u00edm[ ]\u201d the 1946 schedule unless they meet the statutory and regulatory requirements on their own.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Finally, the government proposes that we need not review NARS\u2019 approval of the 1977 schedule because it has never been put into effect.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Because Congress and the public expressed fears about FBI records destruction, NARS decided to seek congressional advice under \u00a7 3303a(c) after approving but before implementing the 1977 schedule. To the best of our knowledge, Congress never responded to NARS\u2019 request, either positively or negatively. Therefore, NARS and the FBI decided not to take any action under the 1977 schedule; the government asserts \u201cthat no general disposal of FBI headquarters records ever has taken place.\u201d Government\u2019s Opening Brief at 14 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">We do not believe that this hiatus warrants our passing over the 1977 schedule. NARS has approved the schedule in accord with the requirements of \u00a7 3303a. There is nothing in the language of \u00a7 3303a(c) that suggests that NARS and the FBI could not put the 1977 schedule into effect after seeking Congress\u2019 advice (especially after getting no response). Indeed, the FBI would be in violation of the records regulations if it does not have a records disposition program <footnotemark>55</footnotemark> covering headquarters files and \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>comprehensive records schedule for all records in its custody.\u201d 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 101-11.-404-l(a) (1982). \u201cFormulation and application of these schedules is mandatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 101-11.404-1 (citing \u00a7\u00a7 3303, 3303a).<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> If the 1977 schedule is meaningless and headquarters files are left out of the FBI records program, the district court was correct to take action to force NARS and the FBI to abide by the regulations and to develop a headquarters records schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">In sum, we find that NARS does not have a statutory duty to inspect FBI records, but has a duty under \u00a7 3303a to examine the FBI\u2019s records disposition schedules and to reject the schedules if they do not meet the preservation and disposal standards. As discussed above, the Director of the FBI also has a duty under \u00a7 3101 to preserve certain agency records. The regulatory process and standards governing the preparation and evaluation of these schedules has changed slightly over the past ten years. But the changes in regulations have not been significant for purposes of our review: The FBI has continually had the duty to prepare records disposal schedules for at least all major groups of its records (both headquarters and field office systems should have been addressed), and NARS has continually had the duty to examine the schedules to ensure that they meet the disposition standards. Therefore, we must review the FBI\u2019s three records disposition schedules \u2014 1975, 1976, 1977 \u2014 to determine whether the FBI and NARS have properly carried out their statutory responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">3. <em>Review of Agency Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-14\">a. <em>The 1975 and 1976 Schedules</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-15\">The 1975<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> and 1976<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> schedules provide almost no explanation of why the FBI sought to destroy field office materials. The only two nuggets of guidance we can mine from these schedules are that the \u201c[f]iles no longer possess sufficient reference or evidentiary value to merit retention\u201d (1975), and \u201c[t]he originals, duplicates or summarizations of substance ... are contained in the permanent files of the [FBI] Headquarters\u201d (1976). J.S.A. at 362A, 369. The 1975 comment only parrots part of the statutory standard to be met. The 1976 statement only tells us that some originals and copies of field office files are sent to headquarters while other files are summarized \u2014 without explaining which types of records receive which treatment, the reason for using summaries in some situations, and the information that should be incorporated in the summaries. Neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>schedule provides an explanation of what factors were considered in arriving at the conclusion that the records listed do not \u201chave sufficient administrative, legal, research, or other value to warrant their continued preservation.\u201d 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3303a(a). In addition, there is no explanation of why these records need not be preserved \u201cto furnish the information necessary to protect the legal and financial rights ... of persons directly affected by the [FBI\u2019s] activities,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3101, even though the FBI surely real-\u00edzes that its activities affect citizens\u2019 legal rights often and significantly.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"abj-dedup-0\">The 1975 and 1976 schedules also do not articulate any connection between factual findings about the nature of the information in these records (or why certain types of summaries suffice under the preservation and disposal standards), and the decision to classify the records as without appropriate value and thereby as suitable for destruction. The two schedules make it clear that the FBI was only concerned about preserving records that might serve its own institutional needs.</p>\n<p id=\"ALz\">We are not insisting that the FBI must necessarily preserve \u201craw investigative data.\u201d What we ask for, and what the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d test of the APA requires, is some reasoned justification explaining why certain types or categories of investigative data should be destroyed under the preservation standard of \u00a7 3101 and the disposal standard of \u00a7 3303a. The same sort of justification is necessary to explain the FBI\u2019s decisions, with NARS\u2019 approval, to retain summaries of field office files and to destroy the original documents upon which the summaries are based. We do not disagree with the government\u2019s general point that the FBI may satisfactorily summarize much investigative data. But the summaries need to account in some reasonable fashion for historical research interests and the rights of affected individuals \u2014 not just the FBI\u2019s immediate, operational needs, We suspect that decisions on which field office files to preserve and what summaries are sufficient might depend on factors such as the type of investigation and alleged crime, the individuals involved, and the connections to events of historic interest. But it is not our role to dictate explanatory criteria for disposal decisions; this was the task NARS and the FBI should have performed within the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 3101, 3303, 3303a.</p>\n<p id=\"as-dedup-0\">The district court found that the FBI&gt;S disp0sal schedules for field office files were based on an incorrect assumption by the FBI and NARS that all field office documents were duplicated at FBI headquarters. We acknowledge the government\u2019s objection on this point, but we do not find this debate over the meaning of \u201cduplication\u201d to be central here. Even if all the pertinent employees of the FBI and NARS recognized that the concept of duplication included summarization, the FBI or NARS would still need to explain, as they have not, why these summaries justified destruction of the underlying field office documents. This justification would have to address the means through which the determined, for different types of records&gt; that the information that must be preserved under \u00a7\u00a7 3101, 3303a would be part of the summaries.</p>\n<p id=\"A4K\">The government also seems to make the argument that no explanation for the 1975 and 1976 disposal schedules is necessary because Congress approved the laconic 1946 schedule under the same presenvation standard carried forward by \u00a7 3303a. Again, this would neatly exclude future disposal of FBI field office files from \u00a7 3303a examination \u2014 and, understandably, we cannot reconcile that result with Congress\u2019 actions after 1946. Congress imposed the \u00a7 3101 preservation duty in 1950; surely we must hold subsequent schedules to its standard. Congress also gave NARS the job of evaluating disposal requests in 1970 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>because the members of the Joint Committee on the Disposition of Executive Papers admitted that for years they had had no idea of what they were approving.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Even rarified judicial air will not permit us to rely on such a perfunctory congressional \u201capproval,\u201d granted 30 (and now almost 40) eventful years ago, and agreed to without consideration of the statutory standards in effect today.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The 1975 and 1976 schedules do not even meet the government\u2019s own standards of explanation as established in its regulations. The regulations in effect at the time NARS approved the two schedules stated that \u201c[a]ll schedules shall take into account the actual filing arrangements in existence.\u201d 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 101-11.401-3(c) (1977). In addition, schedules were to \u201cclearly identify and describe the series of records covered, ... contain instructions that ... can be readily applied,\u201d and \u201cbe readily adaptable ... so that each office will have standing instructions for the disposition or retention of records in its custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 101-11.-401-3(b). The present regulations contain similar requirements for the comprehensive schedules that agencies are supposed to have in place today. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 101-11.404-1(a) (1982). The 1975 and 1976 schedules, however, do not even refer to the almost 200 basic classifications in the FBI\u2019s central records system. The records identification and disposal instructions are broad enough to justify wholesale destruction or selective, standardless retention on the basis of \u201cadministrative needs.\u201d <em>See </em>J.S.A. at 362A, 369; Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">We do not see how NARS could have made a rational evaluation and determination of the FBI\u2019s records disposal proposals on the basis of these schedules. If NARS had undertaken a thorough investigation, it might have been able to compensate for the lack of <em>explanation </em>in the schedules by providing its own justification for our review. But NARS did not do so.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Moreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>schedules would still fail to include any reasonable <em>instructions </em>for records disposal that could ensure that the \u00a7\u00a7 3101, 3303a preservation and disposal requirements would be observed. It is almost inconceivable that any explanation could justify these broad disposal instructions. Furthermore, \u201c[t]he reviewing court should not attempt itself to make up for such deficiencies: \u2018We may not supply a reasoned basis for the agency\u2019s action that the agency itself has not given.\u2019 \u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>103 S.Ct. at 2867 (quoting <em>Bowman Transportation, Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., </em>419 U.S. at 285-86, 95 S.Ct. at 441-42 and citing <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 196, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 1577, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947)). NARS simply has not explained why it exercised its discretion to approve the 1975 and 1976 schedules, which definitely do not carry the weight of a justifiable explanation themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">b. <em>The 1977 Schedule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The 1977 schedule is a more complete effort than the 1975 and 1976 versions. <em>See </em>J.S.A. at 384-96. It begins by describing the content and arrangement of the central records system, including the approximately 200 core classifications (generally by type of violation) for subject matter files. <em>See id. </em>at 384, 391-96. But the schedule refers to that system only twice: to state that administrative files (covering policies and procedures) of each classification will be preserved permanently, and to explain that the criminal, security, and applicant investigative files under 18 classifications (and all classifications created in the future) will be subject to \u201cspecific retention guidelines\u201d determined by NARS. <em>Id. </em>at 386, 390. The schedule does not explain why the 18 classifications warrant special guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">In general, investigative files warrant permanent retention under the schedule if they meet one of five criteria. <em>See id. </em>at 387- 88.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> The schedule admits that \u201cthe criteria [are] general in nature and selection is basically a matter of informed judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387. The schedule divides investigative files that do not merit permanent retention into four groups (criminal, security, applicant, and conflicts with the Privacy Act of 1974) and assigns each a time for eventual destruction. <em>See id. </em>at 388- 89. \u201cTransitory documents such as air-tels, teletypes, [and] memoranda,\u201d the substance of which has been incorporated in more permanent documents, should be destroyed after the \u201ctransitory documents] no longer servef] a useful purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>389- 90. The schedule also notes that authority already exists to destroy field office records because headquarters files contain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>or summarize the information from them that should be retained. <em>See id. </em>at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Clearly the heart of the schedule is the list of five criteria employed to screen permanent investigative files. The district court found \u201cthese criteria [to be] excessively and unnecessarily vague.\u201d <em>American Friends Service Committee </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>485 F.Supp. at 231 (footnote omitted). The district court believed that such vagueness was necessary because the schedule could have drawn on the approximately 200 file classifications (by type of crime) \u201cto define more specifically the criteria for retention of files.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 231 n. 23. We agree that the schedule would be improved if it incorporated the specificity of the subject matter classifications. This integration would also better serve the requirement in the regulations to \u201ctake into account the existing filing system so that destruction or transfer can be handled in blocks.\u201d 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 101-11.-404-l(a)(4) (1982). However, we do not find the schedule\u2019s criteria to be so vague as to be \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d The criteria provide sensible guidance to agency personnel who are supposed to be sensitive to archival and historical values; they also reflect some consideration of res\u00e9arch interests other than those of the FBI.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">We also do not accept the district court\u2019s finding that the 1977 schedule was in some way tainted because the FBI and NARS, in the course of developing the schedule, discussed the fact that there would be administrative burdens associated with the FOIA. We cannot expect agency recordkeepers to remain oblivious to major legislation that will materially affect their jobs. Indeed, they would not be serving the records statutes\u2019 objectives relating to efficient management unless they considered such events. Absent some indication that a desire to avoid FOIA responsibilities led the FBI to schedule the destruction of records that should have been preserved, we will examine the schedules for compliance with the law without a presumption of wrongful intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">There are, however, three respects in which the 1977 schedule falls short. First, the schedule does not take into account the \u00a7 3101 requirement to preserve information pertaining to the legal rights of persons directly affected by the FBI\u2019s activities. Second, the schedule\u2019s treatment of \u201ctransitory documents,\u201d like its few comments about field office files, does not reveal a glimmer of recognition that these records may be of administrative, legal, or research value \u2014 or that they might contain important information about how the FBI affected individuals\u2019 legal rights. We need some explanation of why these records (or which ones) need not be preserved. Third, the schedule fails to provide any reason why 18 classifications (and all new ones) are excluded from disposition standards for criminal, security, and applicant investigative files. It is far from obvious to us why NARS needs to determine specific retention guidelines for records classifications as diverse as \u201cTraining Schools,\u201d \u201cSubversive Matter (Individuals),\u201d and the \u201cLabor Management Relations Act, 1947.\u201d J.S.A. at 391, 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">In sum, the 1977 schedule fails in three respects to justify NARS\u2019 approval. And NARS has not provided any other suitable justification. NARS\u2019 approval of the 1977 schedule does not comport with its obligation under \u00a7 3303a, and the FBI\u2019s submission of the schedule reveals that it overlooked its records preservation and disposal duties under \u00a7\u00a7 3101, 3303.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">4. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">Our analysis of the alleged records disposal violations reveals that NARS does not have a duty to inspect FBI records, but does have a statutory responsibility to subject the FBI\u2019s proposed disposal schedules to critical scrutiny to ascertain whether they are in accord with the statutory standards of \u00a7\u00a7 3101, 3303a. In addition, the FBI has the duties to preserve certain record information under \u00a7 3101 and to propose the disposal of records in conformity with the requirements of \u00a7 3303. Neither NARS nor the FBI performed their statutory re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>sponsibilities properly with respect to the preparation and approval of the 1975, 1976, and 1977 disposal schedules. The 1975 and 1976 disposal schedules for field office records are wholly deficient. The 1977 disposal schedule for FBI headquarters records is partially unsatisfactory for three reasons we explained above. Since NARS and the FBI have not amended these three disposal schedules to correct their noncompliance with the statutory standards and approval requirements, we conclude that the FBI\u2019s records disposal program is in violation of the records disposal laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">After the district court found that the FBI and NARS had not carried out their statutory responsibilities, the court required them to formulate and submit to it a records retention plan and disposal schedules consistent with that plan. <em>American Friends Service Committee v. Webster, </em>485 F.Supp. at 236. When the district court determined at a hearing over a year later that NARS and the FBI had not taken significant action to carry out the court\u2019s mandate, the court issued a more detailed order designed to insure compliance with the records disposal laws. <em>See American Friends Service Committee v. Webster, </em>No. 79-1655, mem. op. at 3, 5-8 (D.D.C. June 9, 1981), <em>reprinted in </em>App. at 41, 43-46. In light of NARS\u2019 and the FBI\u2019s inability or unwillingness to begin remedying the noncomplying disposal schedules over the course of a year, we believe the district court was within its authority to issue that detailed order and we will not disturb it except as explained in Part VI, which follows. While we have found that records inspections by NARS are not required by statute, we will not interfere either with the district court\u2019s discretion to order inspections to insure compliance with its mandate in this case. However, the district court\u2019s evaluation of the proposed FBI disposal schedule for headquarters records should take into account our finding that the FBI\u2019s 1977 schedule for headquarters files is deficient in only three respects, as explained above.</p>\n<author id=\"b165-9\">GINSBURG, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">VI.

Three categories of records, the government maintains, are immunized by law from the Archives\u2019 inspection access: tax returns and tax return information; grand jury materials; and electronic surveillance materials. In an order and memorandum filed October 20, 1982, the district court ruled that the FBI must allow NARS to inspect the records in question. <em>American Friends Service Committee v. Webster, </em>No. 79-1655 (D.D.C. filed Oct. 20, 1982) (\u201cMem. op. of Oct. 20, 1982\u201d), <em>reprinted in </em>J.S.A. at 62-78.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> The government seeks our review of that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">We hold that the district court erred in denying the three modifications at issue.

First, and probably best known to the public, NARS accepts for deposit in the National Archives records the Archivist determines \u201cto have sufficient historical or other value to warrant their continued preservation by the United States Government.\u201d 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 2103(1). In this \u201carchival administration\u201d role, NARS may \u201cdirect and effect the transfer to the National Archives .. . of records of a Federal agency that have been in existence for more than thirty years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2103(2) (Supp. V 1981). Second, the Archives has a recordkeeping and servicing function; it maintains and operates \u201crecords centers [at which files are stored] and centralized microfilming services for Federal agencies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2907. Third, NARS reviews lists and schedules submitted by agency heads proposing disposal of records that do not appear to have sufficient value to warrant preservation. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3303, 3303a. Finally, and directly at issue here, the Archives has a \u201crecords management role,\u201d which entails responsibilities for guiding and assisting \u201cFederal agencies with respect to records creation, records maintenance and use, and records disposition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2904.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The provision on which the appeal in No. 83-1025 centers, 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 2906, authorizes NARS to \u201cinspect the records ... of any Federal agency solely for the purpose of rendering recommendations for the improvement of records management practices and programs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2906(a)(1). The controversy we now address turns on what Congress intended when it qualified the general authority of the Archives to inspect agency records for records management improvement purposes by specifying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-12\">Records, the use of which is restricted by law or for reasons of national security or the public interest, shall be inspected, in accordance with regulations promulgated by the [Archives], subject to the approval of the head of the agency concerned or of the President.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-13\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2906(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-14\">We explain first why we conclude that part of what Congress meant is not in doubt in this case: The description, \u201c[r]ecords, the use of which is restricted by law,\u201d fits each of the record categories in question, and the laws restricting use contain no exception for records management inspection by the Archives. Next, we treat the critical, less readily answered issue: What authority did Congress vest in \u201cthe head of the agency concerned or ... the President\u201d with respect to the Archives\u2019 inspection, again for records management purposes, of \u201crestricted use\u201d records?</p>\n<p id=\"b166-17\">B. <em>The Relevant Laws Restricting the Use of Records</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-18\">1. <em>Tax Returns and Tax Return Information</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-19\">The government\u2019s motion to exclude tax returns and tax return information in FBI files from the Archives\u2019 records management inspection rests on section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> This large section comprehensively regulates the use and dissemination of tax returns and return information. The section opens with a statement of the main rule that returns and return information \u201cshall be confidential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6103(a). A primary purpose of the measure was to limit and control access to such information by government entities. <em>See Chamberlain v. Kurtz, </em>589 F.2d 827, 835 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 842, 100 S.Ct. 82, 62 L.Ed.2d 54 (1979).<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Section 6103 is a formidable law restricting the use of records. It contains many subsections listing persons and entities to whom disclosure may be made for specified purposes or under defined circumstances.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> The district court regarded subsection (n) as authorizing the NARS inspection at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"AkC\">Subsection 6103(n) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">Pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary, returns and return information may be disclosed to any person ... to the extent necessary in connection with the processing, storage, transmission, and reproduction of such returns and return information, and the programming, maintenance, repair, testing, and procurement of equipment, for purposes of tax administration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(n). The district court said of this provision: \u201cOn its face, the use of the word \u2018storage\u2019 appears to encompass the very sort of access envisioned by the archival statutes.\u201d Mem. op. of June 9, 1981, at 9, <em>reprinted in </em>App. at 47. The subsection does relate to one of the Archives\u2019 functions: returns and return information may be transferred <em>for storage </em>to a records center maintained and operated by NARS. <em>See </em>44 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2907, 3103.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> But the Archives\u2019 storage or warehousing function is distinct from its records management function.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Subsection 6103(n) authorizes disclosure to any person <em>to the extent necessary </em>to the performance of the listed services. Inspection of the contents of documents is not \u201cnecessary in connection with\u201d their storage. Congress expressly authorized inspection of agency records in conjunction with the Archives\u2019 records management function; it did not say inspection should occur when NARS stores an agency\u2019s documents at a records center. <em>Compare </em>44 U.S.C. \u00a7 2906 <em>with id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2907, 3103.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">Subsection 6103(n), moreover, authorizes disclosure to persons who perform record-keeping services \u201cfor purposes of tax administration.\u201d <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(b)(4) (defining \u201ctax administration\u201d). The inspection the district court ordered would serve no tax administration purpose. Instead, the order\u2019s objective is improvement of the FBI\u2019s records management practices and programs.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Further, disclosure under subsection 6103(n) is to occur \u201c[p]ursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary [of the Treasury].\u201d The Secretary\u2019s regulations, Treas.Reg. \u00a7 301.6103(n)-l, contain no prescriptions about records management inspection by the Archives.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">In sum, section 6103 concededly restricts the use of tax returns and tax return information. We have located no provision in the section that authorizes NARS inspection for the records management purpose at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">2. <em>Grand Jury Materials</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) states a general rule of secrecy shielding from disclosure \u201cmatters occurring before a grand jury.\u201d Codifying a restraint \u201colder than our Nation itself,\u201d <em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. United States, </em>360 U.S. 395, 399, 79 S.Ct. 1237, 1240, 3 L.Ed.2d 1323 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>(1959), Rule 6(e) unquestionably qualifies as a law restricting the use of records. The Rule lists four exceptions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-4\">Disclosure ... may be made to\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">(i) an attorney for the government for use in the performance of such attorney\u2019s duty; and</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">(ii) such government personnel as are deemed necessary by an attorney for the government to assist an attorney for the government in the performance of such attorney\u2019s duty to enforce federal criminal law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">Disclosure ... may also be made\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">(i) when so directed by a court preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding; or</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">(ii) when permitted by a court at the request of the defendant, upon a showing that grounds may exist for a motion to dismiss the indictment because of matters occurring before the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e)(3)(A), (C). None of these exceptions addresses records management inspections by the Archives.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">Appellees do not suggest, nor could they reasonably do so, that inspection by the Archives qualifies under the exceptions for government attorneys, personnel assisting government attorneys in the performance of criminal law enforcement duties, or defendants who show that grounds for dismissal of an indictment may exist. They assert, however, that the exception listed third applies here: \u201c[Ujnder the very terms ... of Rule 6, the district court was empowered to determine that it was necessary in connection with this judicial proceeding to have the Archives examine records of the FBI made up of grand jury transcripts and material.\u201d Brief for Appellees at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-15\">We reject appellees\u2019 potentially rule-swallowing reading of the \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d exception. Rule 6(e)(3)(C)(i) disclosure orders are appropriate \u201cto avoid a possible injustice in <em>another </em>judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, </em>441 U.S. 211, 222, 99 S.Ct. 1667, 1674, 60 L.Ed.2d 156 (1979) (emphasis added). The phrase \u201cin connection with a judicial proceeding\u201d does not indicate \u201cthe very proceeding instituted for the purpose of obtaining disclosure.\u201d <em>Hiss v. Department of Justice, </em>441 F.Supp. 69, 70 (S.D.N.Y.1977), <em>quoted in Fund for Constitutional Government v. NARS, </em>656 F.2d 856, 868 (D.C.Cir. 1981). The limitation of Rule 6(e)(3)(C)(i) to requests in aid of a claim or defense in <em>another </em>proceeding has been reiterated most recently in <em>United States v. Baggot, </em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 3164, 3166, 77 L.Ed.2d 785 (1983).<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Thus we cannot entertain appellees\u2019 argument that Rule 6(e) includes an exception for a claim such as this one in which uncovering confidential grand jury materials is part of the ultimate relief sought in the action.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-18\">3. <em>Electronic Surveillance (Title III) Materials</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-19\">Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520, authorizes the use of electronic surveillance in the investigation of certain serious offenses specified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516. <em>See generally United States v. Giordano, </em>416 U.S. 505, 94 S.Ct. 1820, 40 L.Ed.2d 341 (1974). The use and disclosure of materials obtained pursuant to Title III is governed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2517. With exceptions not relevant here, disclosure or use of Title III materials other than as provided by section 2517 is unlawful. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(l)(c), (d). Section 2517 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">(1) Any investigative or law enforcement officer who, by any means authorized by this chapter, has obtained knowledge of the contents of any wire or oral communication, or evidence derived therefrom, may disclose such contents to another investigative or law enforcement officer to the extent that such disclosure is appropriate to the proper performance of the official duties of the officer making or receiving the disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">(2) Any investigative or law enforcement officer who, by any means authorized by this chapter, has obtained knowledge of the contents of any wire or oral communication or evidence derived therefrom may use such contents to the extent such use is appropriate to the proper performance of his official duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Here too, we see no room for debate concerning the qualification of the materials in question as \u201c[r]ecords, the use of which is restricted by law.\u201d 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 2906(a)(2). Nor do we find in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2517 authorization for NARS records management inspection of Title III intercepts.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The section 2517 subsections set out above permit, respectively, disclosure of electronic surveillance materials to, and use of the materials by, investigative and law enforcement officers in the proper performance of official duties. Congress, the legislative history securely indicates, had in mind information sharing \u201cwithin the law-enforcement community.\u201d S.Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. 99 (1968), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1968, p. 2112. <em>See also id. </em>at 91. It envisioned \u201cuse of the contents of intercepted communications, for example, to establish probable cause for arrest, to establish probable cause to search, or to develop witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99 (citations omitted). <em>See also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(8)(a) (\u201cDuplicative recordings may be made for use or disclosure pursuant to the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) of section 2517 of this chapter <em>for investigations.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). Records management inspection by the Archives hardly fits within the criminal law investigation and enforcement objectives Congress sought to serve in allowing shared access to and use of Title III materials by law enforcement officers. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(7) (defining \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">Moreover, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(8)(a) provides that, upon expiration of the period of the surveillance order, the recordings</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYx\">shall be made available to the judge issuing [the order that authorized the surveillance] and sealed under his directions.

Abraham, </em>541 F.2d 624, 627 (6th Cir.1976) (Title III materials must be treated as \u201cconfidential court records\u201d). The order before us for review, to the extent that it directs inspection of Title III materials, is not in harmony with the controlling role Congress assigned to the district judge who superintended the surveillance.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">C. <em>The Meaning of Section 2906</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">The qualification of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103, Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2511, 2517, 2518 as laws restricting the use of records is evident, and we have found no provision in those laws authorizing the Archives to inspect the shielded records to improve their management by the FBI. But the district court\u2019s refusal to remove tax returns and return information, grand jury materials, and electronic surveillance materials from the records the FBI must open to the Archives\u2019 inspection ultimately did not rest upon that court\u2019s interpretation of the restricted use laws in question. Rather, the district court ruled as it did because it believed Congress, in 1976, had taken action overriding, <em>pro tanto, </em>laws restricting the use of records.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">Through 1976 amendments to 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 2906, the district court thought, Congress effectively withdrew records management <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>inspections by NARS from the governance of laws restricting access to the records of federal agencies. Such inspections, after the 1976 alteration of section 2906, the district court determined, simply would not constitute \u201cdisclosure\u201d under laws that shield records: \u201c44 U.S.C. [\u00a7] 2906(a)(2) specifically authorizes inspection of records \u2018the use of which is restricted by law ....\u2019\u201d Mem. op. of Oct. 20, 1982, at 13, <em>reprinted in </em>J.S.A. at 76. <em>See also </em>J.S.A. at 75; Mem op. of June 9, 1981, at 9-11, <em>reprinted in </em>App. at 47-49. We think the district court misapprehended what Congress meant when it formulated section 2906(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Prior to 1976, section 2906 read:</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\n<em>Personal inspection and survey of records</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH4\">The Administrator of General Services may inspect or survey personally or by deputy the records of any Federal agency, and make surveys of records management and records disposal practices in agencies.

No. 90-620, \u00a7 2906, 82 Stat. 1238, 1297 (amended 1976). As altered by the Federal Records Management Amendments of 1976, Pub.L. No. 94-575, \u00a7 2(a)(3), 90 Stat. 2723, 2725-26, section 2906 today provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">\n<em>Inspection of agency records</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ac-dedup-0\">(a)(1) In carrying out his duties and responsibilities under this chapter, the Administrator of General Services or his designee [the Archives] may inspect the records or the records management practices and programs of any Federal agency solely for the purpose of rendering recommendations for the improvement of records management practices and programs.

Congress did so, the district court concluded, by emphasizing that the Archives had a broad mandate to inspect records to make recommendations for improving federal agencies\u2019 records management practices; in carrying out its large authority, however, the Archives would be subject to' the strictures contained in the Privacy Act of 1974 and other federal laws prohibiting disclosure of information that inspections uncovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Under the district court\u2019s reading, and as appellees urge, section 2906(a)(2) \u201cdeals with the unlikely event that the head of the agency and the Archivist cannot agree upon the procedures for carrying out the inspection. Then it is the President who will provide the procedures and method to be applied.\u201d Brief for Appellees at 13-14. This view finds some support in the Senate Government Operations Committee Report on the Federal Records Management Amendments of 1976. The district court emphasized this passage from the Committee\u2019s Report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">The Committee desired to reiterate its position that the GSA Administrator or his designee would have the authority to inspect records in order to make recommendations for improving records management practices and programs. At the same time, the Committee intended to make clear that protections contained in the Privacy Act of 1974 regarding the disclosure of personal information apply to such activities of GSA. Due to the large and broad mandate given to the GSA to inspect the records of other Federal agencies and the requirement that such agencies give the GSA full cooperation in such inspections, it was felt that strong protection be provided for the protection of the personal information maintained about citizens which might be kept in certain government files.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">S.Rep. No. 94-1326, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 6 (1976), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, pp. 6150, 6155, <em>quoted in </em>Mem. op. of June 9, 1981, at 10, <em>reprinted in </em>App. at 48. We note too that the phrase in section 2906(a)(2), \u201cor of the President,\u201d was added by the 1976 amendments and occasioned this explanation from the Senate Committee: \u201cBy adding [that phrase], the statute provides for a clearly defined process in those instances where the Administrator and the agency head cannot agree on inspection procedures.\u201d S.Rep. No. 94-1326, <em>supra, </em>at 10, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, p. 6158.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">In our view, the language of section 2906, originally and as amended, does not support the district court\u2019s interpretation, and we find the legislative history cloudy. Subsection 2906(a)(1), tracking the prior provision, states that the Administrator <em>\u201cmay </em>inspect the records ... of any Federal agency solely for the purpose of rendering recommendations for the improvement of records management practices and programs.\u201d 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 2906(a)(1) (emphasis added). Subsection 2906(a)(2), again in large part tracking the prior provision, except for addition of the words \u201cor of the President,\u201d states that restricted use records <em>\u201cshall </em>be inspected, in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Administrator, subject to the approval of the head of the agency concerned or of the President.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2906(a)(2) (emphasis added). Appellees and, apparently, the district court read \u201csubject to the approval of [the agency head or the President]\u201d as modifying \u201cregulations.\u201d The government reads the approval clause as modifying \u201cshall be inspected.\u201d <em>See </em>Government\u2019s Supplemental Brief at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">If Plaintiff-appellees\u2019 reading of subsections 2906(a)(1), (2) is correct, the Archives would be permitted, but not required, to inspect records, use of which is <em>not </em>restricted by law, while NARS inspection of records, \u201cthe use of which is restricted by law,\u201d would be mandatory, subject only to settlement between the Archives and the agency head or the President of the procedures for carrying out the inspection. We would hesitate long before concluding that Congress <em>mandated </em>the Archives to inspect, for records management purposes, the nation\u2019s most sensitive and closely guarded records, and only those records. Absent an unmistakable legislative instruction to that effect, we resist the reading appellees urge. It seems to us far more plausible that Congress meant to limit, not to command, NARS records management review of restricted use records by conditioning such inspection on approval of the highest executive authorities \u2014 the agency head or the President.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">Supporting our view, the Senate Committee Report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-11\">[T]he only substantive change in the House-passed [version of section 2906] was to permit the President, as well as the agency head, to allow for the inspec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>tion of an agency\u2019s record[s] when the use of such records is restricted by law or for reasons of national security or the public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">S.Rep. No. 94-1826, <em>supra, </em>at 6, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, p. 6154. <em>See also </em>H.R.Rep. No. 94-1426, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1976). Moreover, during floor debate on the 1976 amendments, Senator Percy, who played a prominent role in the revision of section 2906, said that subsection 2906(a)(2)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">requires the approval of the head of an agency or the President before [the Archives] may inspect records, the use of which is restricted by law or for reasons of national security or the public interest. When access is approved to such records, [the Archives] shall issue regulations to govern such inspections, subject to the approval of the agency head or the President.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">122 Cong.Rec. 34559 (1976). We do not adopt Senator Percy\u2019s \u201cdouble approval\u201d interpretation \u2014 approval by the agency head or the President of both the inspection and the regulations setting procedures for its execution. But we do agree that section 2906, sensibly read, both before and after the 1976 reformulation, calls for top level executive approval before NARS undertakes inspection of restricted use records for purposes of improving agency management of such records.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The district court, as earlier observed,<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> regarded as highly significant the specifications in subsections 2906(a)(3) &amp; (b) that, <em>if </em>NARS inspects a record, its inspection shall comply with the Privacy Act and other federal laws. These specifications, the district court believed, showed that Congress envisioned NARS inspection in all cases without approval of the agency head or the President. We read subsections 2906(a)(3) &amp; (b) as carrying less weight. In our view, they simply prescribe the care NARS is to take whenever it inspects records, whether pursuant to the general authorization in subsection 2906(a)(1) or, in the case of restricted use records covered by subsection 2906(a)(2), upon approval of the agency head or the President.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">In sum, as we read section 2906, Congress did provide for a limited exception to laws restricting access to the records of federal agencies.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> But the exception operates only when the agency head or the President determines that the Archives should inspect the records to assist the agency in their sound management. The Archives has general authority to inspect agency records to \u201crender[] recommendations for the improvement of records management practices and programs,\u201d 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 2906(a)(1), but when use of the records in question has been \u201crestricted by law or for reasons of national security or the public interest,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2906(a)(2), inspection shall occur only upon \u201capproval of the head of the agency concerned or of the President.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>76</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In the event of such approval, inspection shall proceed \u201cin accordance with regulations promulgated by the [Archives],\u201d <em>id., </em>and all inspections shall be conducted in conformity with the Privacy Act and other relevant federal laws, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2906(a)(3), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>In this case, because neither the FBI Director nor the President has approved inspection by the Archives, we hold that the district court lacked authority to order a NARS records management review of the restricted use records in question. This is not to say that the district court must refrain from insisting that the FBI and the Archives deal with the FBI\u2019s management of tax returns and return information, grand jury materials, and electronic surveillance materials. These records are indeed appropriately considered in framing a records retention plan for the FBI. We hold only that in developing the plan, means other than inspection of the restricted use records must be employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">We note, finally, that our holding does not deal with NARS\u2019 \u201carchival administration \u2019 function, governed by 44 U.S.C. 2101-2114. The dispute before us requires a ruling on the Archives\u2019 authority to inspect agency records, for management purposes, while they remain in the agency\u2019s possession. Nothing we decide today bears on NARS\u2019 statutory authority to \u201cdirect and effect the transfer to the National Archives of the United States of records of a Federal agency that have been in existence for more than thirty years and determined by the Archivist ... to have sufficient historical or other value to warrant their continued preservation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2103(2) (Supp. V 1981).<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">D. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The district court\u2019s June 9, 1981, order directed the FBI to allow NARS inspection of files and records covered by the January 10, 1980, injunction. We agree with the government\u2019s contention that three categories of records in the FBI\u2019s possession \u2014 tax returns and tax return information, grand jury materials, and electronic surveillance materials \u2014 fall within the statutory description, \u201c[rjecords, the use of which is restricted by law.\u201d 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 2906(a)(2). Further, we find within the relevant laws restricting the use of records no exception for records management inspection by NARS. As we read section 2906(a)(2), NARS inspection of the records at issue is conditioned upon approval by the FBI director or the President. The requisite approval has not been granted. We therefore hold that the district court exceeded its authority by ordering a NARS records management review of these three categories of records.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">For the reasons stated in Parts I-V, the district court\u2019s orders of June 9 and July 1, 1981 are affirmed insofar as they accord with our instructions and explanation in Part V.C.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">For the reasons stated in Part VI, the district court\u2019s October 20, 1982, order is reversed insofar as it requires the FBI to permit NARS to inspect, for records management purposes, tax returns and tax return information, grand jury materials, and electronic surveillance [Title III] materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-13\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-37\">.

The 1975 and 1976 schedules had required disposal whenever either administrative needs had been met or a fixed time period had passed. The FBI amended the two disposal schedules accordingly. <em>See </em>Defendants\u2019 Exhibits 20, 21, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32; Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibits 21, 34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b154-15\">.

The district court criticizes both the FBI\u2019s final product and its delay in forwarding its portion of the plan to NARS (although the court notes that NARS personnel said they had access to the plan at the FBI\u2019s facilities). 485 F.Supp. at 230 &amp; n. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">We note that under that prior regulatory scheme, NARS\u2019 inspection of the FBI\u2019s portion of the plan, whether or not the FBI sent it to NARS, may have been sufficient so long as the FBI submitted lists and schedules of records for disposal to NARS for approval under 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3303a (or, prior to the enactment of \u00a7 3303a in 1970, to Congress). <em>See </em>41 C.F.R. \u00a7 101\u2014 11.403, .404 (1979).

NARS did not provide any additional justification for the 1975 and 1976 schedules at the time it approved them. In 1978, after a series of articles raised concerns about the destruction of FBI records, NARS conducted an evaluation of field office disposal practices. This study resulted in a December 1978 report that suggested some minor changes in the FBI field office records disposal schedules. <em>See </em>n. 47, <em>supra; </em>Defendants\u2019 Exhibit 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">NARS\u2019 1978 report discusses FBI disposal practices in greater detail than do the disposal</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">schedules, but its treatment of investigative data and field office files still reflects an insensitivity to research needs that do not correspond to the FBI\u2019s purposes for retaining records. In discussing field office records that should be preserved in headquarters files, the report stated approvingly that the FBI documented \u201cproductive aspects\u201d of investigations that were of \u201cvalue in bringing a case to a logical conclusion.\u201d Defendants\u2019 Exhibit 32, section IV at 5. Records of interviews, surveillance, searches, and evidence that were not of such value may or may not be summarized, and the primary materials would be left in field office files slated for eventual destruction. <em>See id. </em>NARS did not consider that certain records may be of particular interest to historians, researchers, or other private parties even though the records were not of value to the FBI in making investigative decisions. This approach toward records preservation is too limited. For example, a researcher may find an FBI informant\u2019s reports on his involvement with the Ku Klux Klan of great historical value (or related to private rights) even though those reports may not have helped the FBI to make an investigative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">NARS\u2019 assumption that FBI headquarters summaries are always sufficient to maintain all information of value involves a similar oversight: In certain cases that invoke substantial public or historical interest, it will be valuable for researchers to examine primary source material instead of relying on secondary source <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>summaries. In some cases, summaries cannot be trusted to address all important research issues that may arise, especially when the summaries are prepared with the FBI\u2019s objectives in mind. The 1978 report does not address this issue at all. The 1978 report also fails to show any awareness of the \u00a7 3101 requirement to preserve information related to the legal rights of parties directly affected by the FBI\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">In sum, the 1978 report does not provide a suitable subsequent reasoned justification for NARS\u2019 approval of the 1975 and 1976 disposal schedules and, insofar as it provides some explanation for disposal practices, it does not require new instructions in the schedules to ensure that FBI personnel will preserve the appropriate records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"62\">\n<p id=\"b163-8\">.

I choose only to express certain concerns and the belief that the FBI and other defendants can live with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>First of all, it is to be noted that the inspection by NARS of all records of which disposal is to be had is permissive. NARS is not required to inspect all the records. It does have a duty to conduct a critical examination of disposal schedules and procedures. We are holding that the tendered disposal schedules should provide a reasoned justification for record destruction. We hold the trial judge was correct in his evaluation of the schedules before him. Although his ruling might appear burdensome, I believe it was justified by the facts of this case. Our decision here today helps to clarify the duties assigned to NARS and its relationship with the federal agencies. As a result, conflicts such as those at issue in this case may be avoided in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">I would mention that if the schedules hereafter to be furnished are sufficiently detailed, NARS, in my opinion, may be able to satisfy its mandate without actual inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">While all cases and their records are important, I make particular mention of the tax records, grand jury proceedings, and electronic surveillance records. These records do fall under and are governed by Section 2906(a)(2). NARS\u2019 management of these records is limited. My concurrence is based upon the belief that NARS\u2019 inspection can only occur with the approval of the agency head or the President. It seems apparent that if the President thought a record or document should be restricted for reasons of national security or public interest and an agency head disagreed and tried to disregard a President\u2019s views of national security or the public interest, termination of the agency head\u2019s authority could and would be sure and certain and sufficient to ensure that irreparable harm would not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">I do not read into this law any intention on the part of the Congress to make easy the second-guessing of Judges like Irving R. Kaufman who have conscientiously made rulings which do not satisfy descendants of some of the parties, or to further overwork certain overworked agencies such as the FBI, or embarrass or punish its director whose work has been a source of pride to the judiciary from which he came.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Rather, I believe this opinion strengthens departmental and presidential control, places sensitive records outside NARS\u2019 jurisdiction and assists the Congress in answering satisfactorily the problems with which it was confronted, namely the handling of records, the use of which is and should be restricted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
