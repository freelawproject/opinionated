Porter, Senior Judge, United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b523-10\">MERRITT, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">After a jury trial in the Circuit Court for the County of Saginaw, Michigan, petitioner Roger L. Lyle was convicted of two counts of first degree felony murder and one count of assault with intent to murder, and was sentenced to three concurrent life terms. Having exhausted his state remedies, Lyle filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. He now appeals that court\u2019s decision to dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">This case arose out of shootings that occurred shortly after midnight on April 14, 1976, in the home of Feadow and Deborah Jones, both of whom died from the gunshot wounds they received. Alzenia Price \u2014 a third victim \u2014 survived the attack, although she had been shot twice in the head, and ultimately testified at appellant\u2019s trial. Price testified that four men forced their way into the Jones\u2019 house and took various pieces of jewelry before shooting the victims. One of the Jones\u2019 neighbors saw a large brown car with a beige top park in front of the Jones residence and, after hearing shots, observed the same car drive away quickly.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-16\">Shortly after the shootings, the Saginaw Police Department issued a radio report tying one Howard \u201cPussycat\u201d Johnson to the incident. In response to this report, two police officers proceeded to Johnson\u2019s neighborhood and arrested appellant and Nathaniel Kemp, both of whom the police observed leaving a house and entering a car that resembled the description of the assailants\u2019 getaway car. The police moved in to make the arrest when they recognized Johnson and another unidentified individual approaching the car in which Lyle and Kemp sat. The officers were unable to apprehend Johnson and his companion, both of whom fled on foot, but succeeded in taking Lyle and Kemp into custody. At a subsequent lineup, Price identified Lyle as one of her attackers but did not recognize Kemp. The police did, however, find a fingerprint left by Kemp at the Jones\u2019 home. Lyle and Kemp were both convicted following their joint trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-17\">Lyle challenges his conviction on several grounds, each of which we shall consider in turn. Because we find that he did not receive sufficient opportunity to confront the witnesses against him, we are compelled to reverse the judgment of the District Court denying his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-18\">INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b523-19\">In his closing argument to the jury, Lyle\u2019s trial counsel contended vigorously that the government had failed to prove Lyle\u2019s involvement in the shootings and that, as the District Court observed, \u201cpetitioner was being prosecuted ... [only] be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>cause of his supposed association with Howard \u2018Pussycat\u2019 Johnson.\u201d <em>Lyle v. Koehler, </em>Civ. No. 80-74578, at 5 (E.D.Mich.1982). Trial counsel also contested the government\u2019s theory that the homicides occurred in conjunction with a robbery, maintaining instead that they were drug related:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-4\">You don\u2019t commit an armed robbery by saying, \u201cwhere\u2019s the stuff? where\u2019s the stuff?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">You don\u2019t plan on committing an armed robbery and using other people\u2019s guns, either. You don\u2019t make people take their clothes off and make them go downstairs and tell them you are going to shoot them. This was an execution. This was an execution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">And it was for a reason. And it wasn\u2019t because of money or because of a watch or a couple of rings. Don\u2019t you believe it was, because it wasn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">(Tr. 966.)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Appellant insists that this argument amounted to an admission of guilt by his trial counsel, and thus constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. According to appellant, this argument effectively denied him of the right to a jury trial on the crimes charged. In <em>Wiley </em>v. <em>Sowders, </em>647 F.2d 642, 649 (6th Cir.1981), this Court held that although \u201c[cjounsel may believe it tactically wise to stipulate to a particular element of a charge or to issues of proof ... an attorney may not stipulate to facts which amount to the \u2018functional equivalent' of a guilty plea.\u201d Because trial counsel in <em>Wiley </em>explicitly admitted his client\u2019s guilt, we reversed the lower court\u2019s denial of the writ of habeas corpus. The instant case, however, involves no such explicit admissions of guilt by trial counsel. On the contrary, as the District Court noted, counsel\u2019s argument simply commented on the government\u2019s theory of the case and never conceded that Lyle was involved in any of the events that transpired at the Jones\u2019 residence. Although unsuccessful, the argument certainly met the standard set by this Court to govern effectiveness of counsel cases. <em>See Beasley </em>v. <em>United States, </em>491 F.2d 687, 696 (6th Cir.1974) (\u201cassistance of counsel required by the Sixth Amendment is counsel reasonably likely to render and rendering reasonably effective assistance\u201d). We, therefore, agree with the District Court that counsel\u2019s summation did not generate any violation of appellant\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">Lyle\u2019s second ineffectiveness of counsel claim involves trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the court\u2019s instruction that the jury might consider the number of witnesses presented by each side in the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the District Court, appellant framed this issue as a direct challenge to the constitutionality of the jury instruction, making no ineffectiveness of counsel allegation. Noting that the Michigan Court of Appeals had invoked the state\u2019s contemporaneous objection rule to dismiss this claim, the District Court held that it was barred under <em>Hockenbury v. Sowders, </em>620 F.2d 111 (6th Cir. 1980), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>633 F.2d 443 (1980), from considering the claim anew absent a showing of cause and prejudice as required by <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We refuse to permit appellant to escape the consequences of <em>Sykes </em>doctrine simply by recasting the issue as an ineffectiveness of counsel claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such a result would violate the fundamental principle that an appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>court may not consider claims not raised in the court below. <em>See Bannert v. American Can Co., </em>525 F.2d 104 (6th Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The same rationale governs our disposition of Lyle\u2019s third and final ineffectiveness of counsel claim, which cites his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the judge\u2019s jury instruction regarding felony murder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Having failed to present this theory in his petition to the District Court, appellant cannot now obtain review of the claim from this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S IMPEACHMENT OF ITS OWN WITNESSES</p>\n<p id=\"ayr-dedup-0\">At trial, the government called Kenneth Newton \u2014 a friend of both defendants \u2014 as a witness and proceeded to impeach his testimony regarding the defendants\u2019 supposed alibi. Lyle claims that the government\u2019s impeachment of its own witness and its'injection of the issue of alibi into the case deprived him of a fair trial. We disagree. Finding that Newton\u2019s alibi testimony was a surprise, the Michigan Court of Appeals held that'the government was entitled to show why it had called Newton as a witness under <em>People v. White, </em>401 Mich. 482, 508-10, 257 N.W.2d 912, 924-25 (1977). Moreover, as the District Court pointed out, the government would also have been permitted to impeach Newton under Fed.R.Evid. 607, which, while not controlling in a state trial, \u201ccertainly provides persuasive evidence that allowing the prosecutor to impeach his own witnesses does not rise to a constitutional violation meriting habeas corpus relief.\u201d <em>Lyle v. Koehler, </em>Civ. No. 80-74578, at 9-13 (E.D. Mich.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"Air\">CONFRONTATION CLAUSE VIOLATION<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Lyle and co-defendant Kemp were arrested together on the night of the shootings shortly after they left a house on the same street as the house of Kenneth Newton. Lyle argues that the admission at trial of several extra-judicial statements by Nathaniel Kemp about a person named \u201cRock\u201d incriminated Lyle because the jury would naturally have concluded that \u201cRock\u201d and Lyle are the same person. He argues that admission of this evidence thus deprived him of his sixth amendment right to confront adverse witnesses, inasmuch as Kemp did not testify at their joint trial. The state court and the District Court found that the Kemp statements do not incriminate Lyle and, therefore, do not violate the confrontation clause. We cannot sustain this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">While in jail awaiting trial, Kemp instructed his sister, Vyethel, to deliver two letters he had written to Kenneth Newton and Nelson Calhoun. The letters attempt to establish an alibi. At trial, the prosecutor had Vyethel Kemp identify the letters. At the end of the government\u2019s case, the following edited versions of the letters were admitted into evidence and read to the jury without limiting instructions. First, the letter to Mr. Newton:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-12\">What it is Squeeze....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-13\">Like dig, I guess you are already informed that these honkies are trying to frame me over some bullshit, so I need you to testify in my behalf. I know that I can count on you to take care of business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-14\">This is what I want you to run: Rock came by your house at 10:30 p.m. Tuesday. You\u2019all just kicked it around for a while. Rock was there about 20-25 minutes before I came by at about 5 or 10 minutes to 11:00 p.m., with my chess board and we played chess and just kicked it around for about <em>IV2 </em>hours. Then I asked you what time it was and you looked at your clock and said that it was 12:20 a.m. So, I said that \u201cI am getting ready to leave so that I can take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>my sister\u2019s car back to her.\u201d Rock asked if I would give him a ride home and I said, \u201cYea, come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d So Rock and I left. You walked us to the door but didn\u2019t come outside, so you didn\u2019t see where I was parked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-4\">Tell them that after you got back upstairs to your room, you heard tires screeching so you looked out your window and saw my car parked in a driveway on Carroll between 4th and 5th, and police cars had it surrounded and they had rifles and pistols out. Rock and I were standing in the back of my car with our hands stretched out on the trunk of it. Then they handcuffed us behind our backs and put us in a police car, for about 15 minutes the car just sat there, then the car they put us in left. The rest of the cars stayed there for about 10-15 minutes longer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">You didn\u2019t come down because you didn\u2019t know what was jumping off and you didn\u2019t want to get involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">After all the cars had left, you' walked to a pay phone and called my people to let them know that I was in some kind of trouble. You called Vy at about 1:00 a.m. and told her what had happen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">Dig, I was going to have Howard Nettles say that he was there but my lawyer told me not to change my story, since I had told the detectives there wasn\u2019t anybody else there at your house besides you, me and Rock. So run it on him when you see him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">That\u2019s all you have to run, and please don\u2019t change it. No matter what anybody say, because your alibi will be very fundamental for me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">In case they ask:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">1. You have never seen or heard me or Rock with Pussycat or mention his name in any conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">3. No, this wasn\u2019t the first time Rock and I had been over to your house at the same time. It really was a common thing for us to drop by since we were all cool.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">4. That it\u2019s not unusual for somebody to park down the street from your house, because there are a lot of roomers that stay in the same building as you and the house next to yours always have a lot of people running in. and out at all times of the day and night, so cars are generally parked in front of your house, so people park where they can.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-14\">5. You have never had a felony conviction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-15\">So, that\u2019s it, my man, it\u2019s all about you when the time comes. When you fully understand this letter, Destroy it because I don\u2019t want it to get into the wrong hands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-16\">Don\u2019t write me any letters, Yy comes up to see me often if it\u2019s important enough maybe she\u2019ll deliver the message.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-17\">My preliminary is Monday, May 10th at 9:30 a.m. I hope to beat this shit then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-18\">Later, Bro.

They got me charged with two counts of first Degree murder, and one count of assault with intent to commit murder. I need you to testify for me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-23\">All you have to say is that I came by your house at about 10:30 Tuesday night, over on Warren. I came by to ask you if you wanted to go over to Kenney Newtons house with me to play some chess, but you said no because you were waiting for somebody to come by. So, I stayed about 5 minutes and then left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-24\">That\u2019s all you have to run, nothing else. Can I count on you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-25\">Now in case they ask:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-26\">1. I was in my sisters car and I was by myself.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-27\">3. That I have never to your knowledge been over to Feido\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-28\">4. You have never seen me or Rock in the presence of Pussycat, nor have you ever heard us mention his name. .</p>\n<p id=\"b526-29\">5.

You will have to tell them that you\u2019re out on an appeal bond because they will ask you just to see if you are going to lie. They know all about anybody that is to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">So, that\u2019s the story my man. It\u2019s all about you now.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">I don\u2019t know exactly when I\u2019ll be going to court but I go to my preliminary Monday May 10th at 9:30 a.m. I hope to beat this shit then!</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">When you have understood this letter destroy it because I don\u2019t want it to get into the wrong hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">If you have any messages to send me, don\u2019t write to me because they will be tapping my mail, there are no ways of letting me know what you want. Dig it!</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">Be Smooth My Man,</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">Nate.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">Tr. at 911-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">Lyle contends that the proof left no doubt that \u201cRock\u201d and Lyle are one and the same person and that the introduction of these letters violated the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> According to that provision, \u201c[i]n all prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. In <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 403-04, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 1067-68, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965), the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe Sixth Amendment\u2019s right of an accused to confront the witnesses against him is ... a fundamental right and is made obligatory on the States by the Fourteenth Amendment,\u201d and that the right of cross-examination is included in that right. Then, in <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), the Court overturned the conviction of a petitioner because the confession of his non-testifying codefend-ant, which incriminated the petitioner as well, had been admitted at their joint trial. Although the trial court had explicitly instructed the jury that the confession was inadmissible hearsay against Bruton, the Supreme Court found that any limiting instruction was inadequate to preserve Bru-ton\u2019s confrontation right, citing \u201cthe practical and human limitations of the jury system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135, 88 S.Ct. at 1627. The Court further noted that such confessions 'are \u201cdevastating to the defendant,\u201d that \u201ctheir credibility is inevitably suspect\u201d given the speaker\u2019s clear \u201cmotivation to shift blame onto others,\u201d and that this unreliability \u201cis intolerably compounded\u201d by the defendant\u2019s inability to test the confessions through cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 136, 88 S.Ct. at 1628.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-17\">The <em>Bruton </em>Court closely identified the confrontation clause with the principles embodied in the hearsay rule. 391 U.S. at 136 n. 12, 88 S.Ct. at 1628 n. 12. Similarly, in his exploration of the theory behind the hearsay rule, Wigmore states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-18\">The main and essential purpose of confrontation is <em>to secure for the opponent the opportunity of cross-examination. </em>The opponent demands confrontation, not for the idle purpose of gazing upon the witness, or of being gazed upon by him, but for the purpose of cross-examination, which cannot be had except by the direct and personal putting of questions and obtaining immediate answers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-19\">5 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1395, at 150 (Chadbourn rev. 1974) (emphasis in original). The close relationship between these provisions of constitutional and evidentiary law suggest that the instant case should be analyzed as a hearsay question.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Although none of the lower courts involved in this ease has ever classified the letters as non-hearsay, and although the government has never challenged appellant's Bruton argument on that ground,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> conventional hearsay analysis prompts us to consider whether Kemp's letters fall within the definition of hearsay at all, that is, whether they were \"offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\" Mich.Ct.R.Evid. 801(c); Fed.R.Evid. 801(c). Believing the alibi to be false, the prosecution obviously did not seek to introduce the letters in order to demonstrate the truth of the particular statements they contained. Rather, the government intended to have the jury infer from the statements that Kemp was attempting to obtain fabricated alibi testimony, an act that revealed a \"guilty mind\" on his part regarding the shootings.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This guilty mind inference in turn invited the jury to infer Kemp's substantive guilt. See United States v. Hackett, 638 F.2d 1179, 1186 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1001, 101 S.Ct. 1709, 68 L.Ed.2d 203 (1980) (exculpatory statements used to prove declarant's guilty mind); United States v. Holbert, 578 F.2d 128, 130 (5th Cir.1978) (jury may decide whether defendant's false exculpatory statement implies guilty mind). Thus, in determining whether the letters constitute hearsay, we must.decide whether the inferences that the government sought to elicit by introducing them should be included within the set of \"assertions\" that the letters make.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-57\">This question highlights one of the few areas of disagreement between the two preeminent authorities on t~he law of evidence-Wigmore and Morgan. They differ on the question of when to cut off the chain of inferences to be made from an extra-judicial declaration in determining whether the statement is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Although neither scholar appears to have studied the precise situation presented here, it appears that Wigmore would have classified the letters as non-hearsay under his narrow interpretation of the hearsay definition. In a similar context, Wigmore cites the example of the statement \"I am the Emperor of Africa.\" Because the statement is not offered for its truth, but rather as circumstantial evidence of mental aberration, Wigmore classifies it as non-hearsay. 6 J. WIGMORE, supra, \u00a7 1766, at 250 (Chadbourn rev. 1974). Morgan, however, criticizes Wigmore's unwillingness to include the inferences implicit in such a statement as pari of the statement for hearsay purposes and notes that Wig-more's approach necessarily assumes the speaker's sincerity. Morgan, Hearsay Dangers and the Application of the Hearsay Concept, 62 HARv.L.REV. 177, 202-03 (1948). Morgan would not arbitrarily cut the chain of inferences before the necessary conclusion is reached if the purpose of introducing a declaration is to have the jury infer from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>it the assertion of a final proposition of fact (e.g., (1) \u201cwe need a false alibi,\u201d because (2) \u201cwe have no explanation of our conduct consistent with innocence\u201d because (3) \u201cwe are guilty\u201d). Under Morgan\u2019s view, the inference of Kemp\u2019s guilty mind, as reflected in the letters, is not severable from Kemp\u2019s raw statements; the letters accordingly present a hearsay problem.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Although we consider the question of the proper classification of the letters exceedingly close, we find that the inferences they necessarily invite form an integral part of the letters. They were introduced because by inference they assert the proposition of fact that Kemp and Lyle committed the robbery and hence need an alibi. Accordingly, we conclude that the letters are hearsay,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and that their use implicated Lyle\u2019s right to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">Apparently assuming that the letters were hearsay with regard to Lyle, the Michigan Court of Appeals nevertheless rejected petitioner\u2019s confrontation argument primarily on the ground that \u201cthe letters were not inculpatory of defendant Lyles [sic].\u201d <em>People v. Lyles </em>[sic], No. 77-1506 (Ct.App.1979). The Court of Appeals further stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>\u201c[t]here was no evidence that defendant Lyles [sic] was known as Rock, and the letters did not indicate that Rock was seeking improper alibi assistance.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The state maintains that these findings are factual determinations entitled to a presumption of correctness under <em>Sumner v. Mata, </em>449 U.S. 539, 101 S.Ct. 764, 66 L.Ed.2d 722 (1981). Although we entertain some doubt as to the applicability of <em>Mata </em>to the instant case, we conclude that, even with such a presumption, the Michigan Court\u2019s finding that the letters did not incriminate Lyle cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">While the letters do not refer to Roger Lyle by name, both of them frequently mention an individual named \u201cRock.\u201d The letter to Newton instructed him to testify that he had observed \u201cRock\u201d and Kemp being arrested together. Having already heard considerable testimony that Lyle was arrested with Kemp, the jury could not help but infer that \u201cRock\u201d was in fact the defendant, Roger Lyle. Elaborating on the Michigan Court\u2019s second argument \u2014 that \u201cthe letters did not indicate that Rock was seeking improper alibi assistance\u201d \u2014 the District Court asserted that \u201c[i]n order for the jury to draw an inculpatory inference with respect to \u2018Rock\u2019 they would have to speculate that \u2018Rock\u2019 helped prepare the letters, that the letters\u2019 object was to procure fabricated alibi testimony, and that such object evidenced a guilty mind.\u201d <em>Lyle v. Koehler, </em>Civ. No. 80-74578, at 9 (E.D.Mich.1982). The close association between Lyle and Kemp \u2014 as evidenced by their simultaneous arrest shortly after the killings \u2014 necessarily invited the jury to extend the inference of Kemp\u2019s guilty mind to the substantive guilt of both defendants. Introduced into evidence at the very end of the government\u2019s case \u2014 after the close association between the defendants had been firmly established \u2014 the letters were indeed \u201cpowerfully incriminating\u201d extrajudicial statements that \u201cadded substantial, perhaps even critical weight to the Government\u2019s case [against Lyle] in a form not subject to cross-examination.\u201d Bruton <em>v. United States, </em>391 U.S. at 135-36, 127-28, 88 S.Ct. at 1627-28, 1623-24.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">We reach this conclusion despite the District Court\u2019s observation that, since Kemp did not directly confess his guilt in the letters, the incriminating guilty mind inference is not compelled. It is inconceivable that a jury could infer anything but guilt from letters outlining desired testimony in such detail and instructing each recipient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>destroy his letter to prevent it from \u201cgetting into the wrong hands.\u201d Furthermore, it is clear that this is precisely the inference that the state sought to obtain by introducing the letters.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In his summation, the prosecutor emphasized that, during its deliberations, the jury could request to examine any of the exhibits that had been admitted into evidence, including the letters. Summarizing his case against both defendants, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-5\">Ladies and gentlemen, the evidence in this case, the direct evidence, the direct eyewitness testimony, the circumstantial evidence, the fingerprint, the statement by Mr. Kemp to Mr. Reeder at the jail, <em>these letters which you can read as many times as you like, </em>the descriptions, the fact that the descriptions are all fit together, the description of Mr. Lyles [s/e] being found with Mr. Kemp, being found in the vicinity of Mr. Johnson, Mr. Pussycat Johnson, all of these fit together on the question of guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">(emphasis supplied). Tr. at 945. Although under <em>Bruton, </em>no instructions limiting the jury\u2019s consideration of the letters to the case against co-defendant Kemp would have forestalled the violation in Lyle\u2019s case, the trial court\u2019s instructions actually reinforced the prosecutor\u2019s invitation for the jury to consider the letters when deciding Lyle\u2019s guilt or innocence. Leaving the decision whether to apply the letters against Lyle entirely up to the jury, the trial court instructed that \u201c[e]ach defendant is entitled to have his case determined from evidence as to his own acts and statements and conduct and <em>any other evidence which may apply to him. </em>Tr. at 1028. (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">That the jury had to draw a short chain of inferences in order to link the letters and Lyle\u2019s participation in the crime does not dissuade us from concluding that the letters constituted a substantial portion of the state\u2019s evidence against him. Apart from the letters, this evidence consisted of Price\u2019s identification, Lyle\u2019s presence with Kemp shortly after the crime in a car resembling the one seen leaving the scene of the shootings, and Lyle\u2019s proximity to a man believed to be Howard \u201cPussycat\u201d Johnson immediately before the arrest. While this independent evidence might have sufficed to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt of Lyle\u2019s guilt, we conclude that the letters engendered a substantial risk that the jury would consider them in deciding that issue. <em>See Hodges v. Rose, </em>570 F.2d 643 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>436 U.S. 909, 98 S.Ct. 2244, 56 L.Ed.2d 408 (1978) (consideration of weight of independent evidence both improper.and unnecessary to determination of <em>Bruton </em>issue by trial court). Thus, we reject the holdings of the Michigan Court of Appeals and District Court that the letters were not inculpatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">Lyle had the right to confront all of the witnesses against him. He had the right to cross-examine the author of the letters, to explore Kemp\u2019s motivation in writing them, to test his sincerity in the letters, and to illuminate any ambiguities that the letters contained. In short, Lyle was entitled to remove all of the dangers that have led courts to exclude hearsay evidence for the last three hundred years. <em>See </em>E. Morgan, <em>Some Problems of Proof under the Anglo-American System of Litigation </em>108, 142-43 (1956) (hearsay engenders risks regarding declarant\u2019s sincerity, memory, perception, and ambiguity of intended statement).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">The government\u2019s case was not sufficiently strong to justify a holding that the admission of the letters constituted error \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>See Parker </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>442 U.S. 62, 78, 99 S.Ct. 2132, 2142, 60 L.Ed.2d 713 (1979) (Blackmun, J., concurring); <em>Harrington v. California, </em>395 U.S. 250, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969). Appellant\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus accordingly must be granted, and we reverse and remand the case to the District Court with instructions to take such action in the event that the state does not grant Lyle a new trial within a reasonable time.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-9\">. Whereas the government presented many witnesses, neither Lyle nor his co-defendant called anyone to testify in his behalf.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b524-10\">. Similarly, as the District Court held, Lyle\u2019s failure to show cause and prejudice under <em>Sykes </em>precludes our review of two of his other claims: (1) that the prosecutor impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to the defense in his closing argument: and (2) that the trial court erred in not requiring the jury to find malice as an element of the crime of felony murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b524-14\">. Not only did the District Court never consider this particular ineffectiveness of counsel claim, the state court also did not receive any opportunity to address the argument. Were we to review the claim, we would thus violate the Supreme Court\u2019s rule against federal court review of habeas corpus petitions containing exhausted and unexhausted claims. <em>See Rose v. Lundy, </em>450 U.S. 910, 101 S.Ct. 1346, 67 L.Ed.2d 333 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b525-9\">. Appellant also raises this issue substantively in his allegation of constitutional error by the trial court, an argument that we likewise reject. <em>See supra, </em>note 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b525-15\">. In a related argument, Lyle claims that the trial court erred in refusing to grant his motion to sever his trial from Kemp\u2019s. Our disposition of the confrontation issue makes consideration of the severance argument unnecessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b527-14\">. Petitioner advances the same argument with regard to exculpatory oral statements made by Kemp to a detective after the arrest. Unlike the letters, however, these statements make no reference to any individual other than the witness and thus do not incriminate Lyle even indirectly. <em>See United States v. Dady, </em>536 F.2d 675 (6th Cir.1976) (no <em>Bruton </em>violation where testimony in question did not mention presence of any other individual).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b527-21\">. Despite the Supreme Court\u2019s recognition of the common principles underlying the confrontation clause and the hearsay rule, Justice Stewart later denied that the Court had ever \u201cequated\u201d the two provisions. <em>Dutton v. Ev</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>ans, 400 U.S. 74, 86, 91 S.Ct. 210, 218, 27 L.Ed.2d 213 (1970) (plurality opinion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b528-38\">. Apparently assuming that the letters are hearsay with regard to Lyle, the lower courts have upheld admissibility on the ground that the letters were not inculpatory. See discussion infra.

In his summation to the jury, the prosecutor argued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-46\">Why does Nate Kemp have to tell Kenny Newton to get ahold of Howard Nettles and tell him that they can't use Howard Nettles as a witness in this case because he discussed it with his attorney and now it is Mr. Kemp's idea and impression that it would be better just to stick with the original witnesses that he mentioned to Detective Reeder when he was interviewed in the jail complex.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-90\">What inference do you draw from that? Why does he have to tell Grizz and Squeeze to not mention to anybody that Rock or I have ever been seen in the presence of Pussycat, nor have you ever heard us mention his name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-96\">Why would you have to tell somebody that if they have never been seen in the presence of Pussycat and have never mentioned Pussycat's names? Wouldn't that be the normal answer you would get if you asked Mr. Newton: \"Have you ever seen Mr. Pussycat in the presence of Nathaniel Kemp?\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-103\">\"Well, no. I don't know.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-104\">Why did Mr. Kemp have to tell Kenny Newton: \"In case they ask, Squeeze, it is not unusual for somebody to park down the street from your house because there are a lot of roomers that stay in the same building.'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-110\">(Tr. at 943-44.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b529-6\">. Morgan discusses with approval the English case of <em>Wright v.

Although the proponent of the letters argued that they should be admitted as circumstantial evidence reflecting their authors\u2019 belief that Marsden was sane, the judges held that since this use amounted to a direct assertion by the authors, the letters were hearsay. <em>See </em>E. Morgan, Some Problems of Proof under the Anglo-American System of Litigation, 155-57 (1956); Morgan, <em>Hearsay Dangers and the Application of the Hearsay Concept, </em>62 Harv.L.Rev. 177, 207-08 (1948).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b529-7\">. The dissent argues that this issue is controlled by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Anderson v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 211, 94 S.Ct. 2253, 41 L.Ed.2d 21 (1974) and this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>675 F.2d 825 (6th Cir.) cert, denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 305, 74 L.Ed.2d 285 (1982). <em>Post </em>at 436-438. Examination of both of these cases, however, reveals that neither of them presented a situation analogous to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">In <em>Anderson, </em>the Supreme Court held that two codefendants\u2019 perjured statements at an election contest hearing were not hearsay because the statements were not offered for their truth; \u201cQuite the contrary, the point of the prosecutor\u2019s introducing those statements was simply to prove that the statements were made so as to establish a foundation for later showing through other admissible evidence that they were false,\u201d 417 U.S. at 220, 94 S.Ct. at 2260 (footnotes omitted). Thus, contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion, <em>post </em>at 436, the proponent\u2019s purpose in introducing evidence is highly pertinent to the proper classification of the evidence as hearsay or not hearsay. The government in <em>Anderson </em>sought to introduce the codefend-ants\u2019 perjury as exemplifying the defendants\u2019 illegal activities; the precise substance of the perjured statements was inconsequential. In the instant case, by contrast, the prosecution sought to have the jury infer the defendants\u2019 guilt directly from the substantive message embodied in the letters themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-14\">Nor does the <em>Gibson </em>case control. There we held that the instructions of the defendant\u2019s superior were not hearsay because they were not \u2014 and indeed, could not be \u2014 offered for their truth or falsity. Unlike Kemp\u2019s letters, however, the <em>Gibson </em>statements contained no implicit but inescapable assertion of fact. Their sole relevance lay in their possible effect on the defendant\u2019s state of mind before and during the commission of the crime, an issue without counterpart in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-15\">In the case at bar the prosecutor\u2019s purpose in introducing the letters is the same as the prosecutor\u2019s purpose in introducing the confession in <em>Bruton. </em>In both the alibi letters and the confession, the nontestifying codefendant is saying in an extra-judicial statement \u201cmy codefendant and I are guilty.\u201d Thus, unlike <em>Anderson </em>and <em>Gibson </em>where the mere existence of the statements and not their purpose is the relevant point, here the relevant point is for the jury to infer directly from the statements that \u201cLyle and I are guilty\u201d \u2014 the same message that the confession in <em>Bruton </em>conveyed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b529-16\">. Moreover, the letters do not fall within any recognized exception to the hearsay rule \u2014 either federal or state. Both federal and Michigan hearsay exceptions for co-conspirators\u2019 statements require that the statements be made in furtherance of the conspiracy rather than during the \u201cconcealment phase\u201d of the conspiracy. <em>Krulewitch v. United States, </em>336 U.S. 440, 443-44, 69 S.Ct. 716, 718-19, 93 L.Ed. 790 (1949); <em>People v. Trilck, </em>374 Mich. 118, 132 N.W.2d 134, 138 (1965). <em>Cf. Dutton v. Evans, </em>400 U.S. 74, 91 S.Ct. 210, 27 L.Ed.2d 213 (1970) (upholding state\u2019s use of co-conspirator\u2019s statements following arrest where state\u2019s co-conspirator exception extends to concealment phase of conspiracy).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b530-5\">. The Michigan Court of Appeals also based its rejection of Lyle\u2019s confrontation claim on a waiver argument, noting that Lyle had \u201cacquiesced in the extent of the editing done on them, and [that] any inference of the inclusion of another in the alibi could have been taken care of by editing.\u201d <em>People v. Lyles </em>[sic], No. 77-1506 (Ct.App.1979). The record, however, shows beyond any doubt that Lyle\u2019s trial counsel maintained an objection to admitting the letters in any form throughout the proceedings, an objection reflected in the following colloquy between the prosecutor and defense counsel regarding the presentation of the edited letters to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">MR. THOMAS: 84-A, Your Honor. I would ask if counsel has any more additions or deletions before it is presented to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">As I understand, they objected to the admission of the letter per se. The Court ruled on that and all counsel stipulated to this final form in chambers. This is the final form that will be given to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">MR. MARTIN: Your Honor, subject to my objection to the exhibits, themselves, I have no objection as to what is contained in the letters. Of course, my objection still remains. I do not want anything \u2014 I do not want the letters in completely, but I have stipulated if they are going to be read, they should be read in the content they are now given to me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">Tr. at 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-13\">Moreover, we note that the District Court did not invoke the state court\u2019s waiver argument in rejecting the claim, and that the government has failed to renew that argument in the appeal before this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b530-14\">. The dissent maintains that, even if the letters are hearsay, <em>Bruton </em>does not compel reversal because the letters were not \u201cpowerfully incriminating\u201d with regard to Lyle. <em>Post </em>at 440-441. Thus, the dissent cites <em>United States v. Dady, </em>536 F.2d 675, 678 (6th Cir.1976), where this Court held that because a codefendant\u2019s redacted statement incriminated the petitioner only when considered in conjunction with extrinsic testimony, no <em>Bruton </em>violation had occurred. Unlike the instant case, however, <em>Dady </em>involved a statement that made no mention of <em>any </em>individual other than the declarant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b531-11\">. <em>See supra </em>note 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>DAVID S.

However, while acutely aware of the high level of scholarship reflected by the majority\u2019s resolution of the confrontation issue, I must dissent from its holding on both significant points of that analysis. First, the Court\u2019s conclusion that the Kemp letters were hearsay because the \u201cinferences they necessarily invite form an integral part\u201d of the documents ignores the fundamental difference between hearsay and circumstantial evidence. Second, even were I to agree that a <em>Bruton </em>analysis was in order here, I would not conclude that such an analysis compels reversal on the facts of this case under existing precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Petitioner and one Kemp were tried together for felony murder and assault with intent to kill.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While in jail awaiting his preliminary hearing, Kemp wrote letters to two friends, Kenneth Newton and Nelson Calhoun. The letters were smuggled out of the jail where Kemp was being held by Kemp\u2019s sister, Vyethel, who testified at trial and identified the letters.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The letters clearly sought the assistance of Newton and Calhoun in establishing an alibi for Kemp; they inferentially indicate his \u201cguilty mind,\u201d and that was the prosecution\u2019s purpose in introducing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The letters sought to obtain fabrication of testimony; they were thus orders or instructions. As such, the letters did not contain any \u201cexpress assertion of past fact,\u201d <em>Dutton v. Evans, </em>400 U.S. 74, 88, 91 S.Ct. 210, 219, 27 L.Ed.2d 213 (1970), susceptible to proof or disproof. Rather, as the majority notes, \u201c[b]elieving the alibi to be false, the prosecution obviously did not seek to introduce the letters in order to demonstrate the truth of the particular statements they contained.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 432. However, the majority has concluded that the letters are to be characterized as hearsay, even though appearing to concede that they were not offered for the truth of the matters they assert, rather, they have concluded that \u201cthe inferences they necessarily invite form an integral part\u201d of the documents. <em>Ante </em>at 432 \u2014 433. Thus, the panel has concluded that the \u201cmatter[s] asserted\u201d by the letters included the inferences which the prosecutor wished the jury to draw from them; <em>i.e., </em>the very fact which made them relevant also rendered them hearsay. I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">Hearsay is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-10\">a, statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">Rule 801(c), Fed.R.Evid.; Rule 801(c), Mich. R.Evid. Today\u2019s decision drastically alters the meaning of the last clause of the rule. As review of the eases reveals, there has been little doubt in the past that the \u201cmat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>ter asserted\u201d was the matter asserted by the writing or speech, not the matter asserted by the proponent of the evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">In <em>Anderson v. United </em>States, 417 U.S. 211, 94 S.Ct. 2253, 41 L.Ed.2d 21 (1974), the Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of an individual who had been charged with stuffing ballot boxes. At a joint trial, the district court admitted evidence that two defendants had perjured themselves at a local inquiry into the elections. Anderson appealed his conviction on the basis that the assertedly hearsay statements of his code-fendants should not have been used at a joint trial because they inferentially inculpated him.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The Court rejected petitioner\u2019s entire argument. Justice Marshall wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">The obvious question that arises in the present case, then, is whether the out-of-court statements of Tomblin and Browning were hearsay. We think it plain they were not. Out-of-court statements constitute hearsay only when offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. The election contest testimony of Tomblin and Browning, however, was not admitted into evidence in the [district court] to prove the truth of anything asserted therein. Quite the contrary, the point of the prosecutor\u2019s introducing those statements was simply to prove that the statements were made ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajq\"><em>Id. </em>417 U.S. at 220, 94 S.Ct. at 2260 (footnotes omitted). I believe that <em>Anderson </em>constitutes an express rejection of the majority\u2019s premise that classification as hearsay may properly be grounded upon the inferences the proponent of the evidence seeks to have drawn.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The majority has determined that <em>Anderson </em>is not controlling here because the Court refers to \u201cthe point of the prosecutor\u2019s introducing\u201d the non-hearsay statements. <em>Ante </em>at 433 n. <em>11. </em>The majority concludes that this illustrates that it is appropriate to consider the inference sought by the proponent of the evidence when conducting a hearsay analysis. However, the <em>inference </em>sought by the prosecution in <em>Anderson </em>was that the defendants were guilty because the statements were made, there being no other logical explanation for them. It seems to me that <em>Anderson </em>demonstrates that hearsay analysis focuses on just what Rule 801 mandates: whether the statements were offered for their truth. As the Court further noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATN\">[h]ere, since the prosecution was not contending that anything Tomblin said at the election contest was true, the other defendants had no interest in cross-exam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>ining them so as to put their credibility in issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><em>Anderson, </em>417 U.S. at 220, 94 S.Ct. at 2260 (footnote and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Similarly, Lyle had no interest in cross-examining Kemp to put Kemp\u2019s credibility in issue. Lyle did not need cross-examination to argue that there was no evidence that he had anything to do with the letters, or that he even knew of them. The letters are simply circumstantial evidence of Kemp\u2019s guilty conscience. They were not offered to prove the truth of anything contained in them. Hence I see no ground for distinguishing <em>Anderson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">In <em>United States v. Hackett, </em>638 F.2d 1179 (9th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, 450 </em>U.S. 1001, 101 S.Ct. 1709, 68 L.Ed.2d 203 (1981)\u2014 one of the cases cited by the majority in this case, <em>ante </em>at 432 \u2014 the court held that a nontestifying codefendant\u2019s post-arrest exculpatory statements were not hearsay as against either defendant. The court concluded that the false exculpatory statements</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">were admitted not for their truth, but <em>merely for the fact that the statements were made. </em>Combined with other evidence showing Turner\u2019s statements to be false, the mere fact that Turner made them implied his consciousness of guilt. The agent who recounted Turner\u2019s statements was available for cross-examination on whether Turner in fact made them. Thus, cross-examination of Turner was not necessary to protect Hackett\u2019s confrontation right on the question whether Turner in fact made the statements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1187 (citations omitted; emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">Finally, this Court has recently considered whether or not evidence of an individual\u2019s instructions or requests to another constitutes hearsay, and concluded that it did not. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>675 F.2d 825 (6th Cir.1982), the district court in petitioner\u2019s trial for embezzlement had excluded, as hearsay, testimony that petitioner\u2019s superior had given him an instruction which inferentially explained part of petitioner\u2019s conduct. In ruling that the exclusion was erroneous, this Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABZ\">[w]e have no doubt that the statement should have been received. First, the hearsay rule bans in-court repetition of extra-judicial utterances <em>only when they are offered to prove the truth or falsity of their contents. </em>This rule does not apply to statements offered to show merely that they were made. [The statement] was not offered to show that the substance of . .. the utterance was true or false. <em>Indeed, a suggestion or an order is not subject to verification because such utterances do not assert facts </em>.... [The excluded testimony] was testimony about a circumstantial utterance ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 834 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-14\">The <em>Gibson </em>analysis plainly covers this case, and should control our decision today. Kemp\u2019s letters were \u201csuggestions\u201d and thus \u201cnot subject to verification at all.\u201d The letters were \u201ccircumstantial utterances,\u201d and so were not \u201coffered to prove the truth or falsity of their contents.\u201d The statements in <em>Gibson </em>were simply circumstantial evidence from which the jury could infer petitioner\u2019s innocence. The Kemp letters were also circumstantial evidence from which the jury could have drawn whatever inferences flowed from them, just as would be true of any other piece of circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-15\">The crux of my difficulty with the panel\u2019s position that the Kemp letters were hearsay is that by blurring the distinction between hearsay and circumstantial evidence, we are not only removing a valuable arrow from the prosecutor\u2019s sling, but, I believe, extending the hearsay rule in a manner which is totally inconsistent with its fundamental purpose.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the letters were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>hearsay, the state was entitled to their introduction for whatever purpose it wished \u2014 including the inferences which the majority finds to have been engrafted to them.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is well established that false exculpatory statements may be used as substantive evidence of guilt. <em>See e.g., United States v. Holbert, </em>578 F.2d 128, 129 (5th Cir.1978) and cases cited therein.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The rule is a salutary one, since such evidence is just as important with regard to the defendant\u2019s state of mind as evidence of, for example, flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">In fact, flight to avoid prosecution has from time to time been itself analyzed as a hearsay question. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lobo, </em>516 F.2d 883 (2d Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 837, 96 S.Ct. 65, 46 L.Ed.2d 56 (1975), the appellant\u2019s codefendant fled during trial, and the trial court permitted the trial to continue. Appellant argued that <em>Bruton </em>was violated by the continuation of the trial. In rejecting his argument, the court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqi-dedup-0\">[w]hile a flight, even though nonverbal conduct, has been said to be an assertion (in the form of an admission) of guilt ... it is treated in the Federal Rules of Evidence as a \u2018statement\u2019 but because it is an admission as \u2018not hearsay\u2019 .... <em>Preferably it is to be viewed as conduct offered as circumstantial evidence </em>rather than for its assertive, testimonial value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-13\">Id. at 884 n. 1 (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-14\">I see no substantial difference between flight as circumstantial evidence of guilt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>and Kemp\u2019s letters as circumstantial evidence of guilt. In each case, a defendant committed an act which is reasonably interpreted as consistent with guilty knowledge. The <em>Lobo </em>court\u2019s conclusion that evidence of flight \u201cis to be viewed as conduct offered as circumstantial evidence\u201d is in no way less applicable here because the case at bar concerns a writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">Thus, in my opinion, today\u2019s decision is one with implications which go well beyond <em>Bruton, </em>and which have nothing whatsoever to do with the confrontation clause. The rule enunciated by the majority is in effect a prohibition of the use of circumstantial evidence of a defendants guilt in a joint trial where that evidence, while squarely implicating only one defendant, arguably . ,, \\ \u201e j <em>, </em>spills over and implicates the codefendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-20\">jj</p>\n<p id=\"b536-21\">My second area of with the majority\u2019s analysis is that I do not believe that, even were <em>Bruton </em>properly applicable to this case,it would compel suppression of the Kemp letters. In order to develop this, I believe it necessary to expand upon the majority\u2019s brief description of <em>Bruton (ante </em>at 431-432)</p>\n<p id=\"AV9\">. , . Bruton and Evans were tried jointly on charges of armed postal robbery. Evans had orally confessed to a postal inspector ,, , , \u00bf _ j. i i .,, , that he, Evans, and Bruton had committed the robbery. The postal inspector was permitted to testify as to the confession. The jury was charged that the confession was competent evidence only as against Evans, and could not be considered by them as against Bruton. Both defendants were convicted; Evans\u2019 conviction was reversed because the confession was improperly admitted against him, but Bruton\u2019s conviction was left standing.</p>\n<p id=\"A3g\">The Court reversed Bruton\u2019s conviction, holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APm\">... Evans\u2019 oral confessions were in fact testified to, and were therefore actually in evidence. That testimony was legitimate evidence against Evans and to that extent was properly before the jury during its deliberations. Even greater, then, was the likelihood that the jury would believe Evans made the statements and that they were true \u2014 not just the self-incriminating portions but those implicating petitioner as well. Plainly, the introduction of Evans\u2019 confession added substantial, perhaps even critical weight to the Government\u2019s case in a <em>form </em>not subject to cross-examination, since Evans did not take the stand. Petitioner thus was denied his constitutional right of confrontation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATM\"><em>Bruton, </em>391 U.S. at 128, 88 S.Ct. 1623.

Thus, the <em>Bruton </em>holding was based upon the inability to confront one\u2019s accuser; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>the nature of the confession as clear hearsay against Bruton; the \u201cpowerfully incriminating\u201d nature of Evans\u2019 confession as against Bruton; and the \u201cinevitably suspect\u201d nature of the confession of an accomplice, who has a clear motive to implicate A ..... . . .. others so as to minimize his own role m the , , crime c arge \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"Aqcx\">^ .

As this point really <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>goes to the heart of my concern with the classification of these letters as hearsay, I shall not belabor it here. However, I think it clear that, as already noted, an essential part of the holding in <em>Bruton </em>was that the confession of the codefendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgI\">is inevitably suspect, a fact recognized when accomplices do take the stand and the jury is instructed to weigh their testimony carefully given the recognized motivation to shift blame onto others. The unreliability of such evidence is intolerably compounded when the alleged accomplice, as here, does not testify and cannot be tested by cross-examination. It was against such threats to a fair trial that the Confrontation Clause was directed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">391 U.S. at 137, 88 S.Ct. at 1628 (footnotes and citation omitted).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">In <em>United States v. Kendricks, </em>623 F.2d 1165, 1167 (6th Cir.1980), this Court considered the above-quoted passage from <em>Bru-ton </em>to provide a firm rationale for the admission of coconspirator\u2019s statements, made in the furtherance of the conspiracy, even though no conspiracy had been charged. <em>Id. </em>at 1168 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">I do not wish to suggest that any cocon-spirator\u2019s exception applies here. <em>See ante </em>at 433 n. 11. However, I believe that the statements here are endowed with the same strong indicia of reliability that the Court noted in <em>Kendricks, </em>and that this factor militates against application of the <em>Bruton </em>rule here, as it did in that case. Here, the letters were not a confession, as is the challenged testimony or document in virtually all <em>Bruton </em>cases; in fact,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> as the district court noted, they begin with the assertion that Kemp was being framed. <em>Lyle, </em>Civil No. 80-74578, Slip. Op. at 8. They were not statements made to officials in hope of advancing Kemp\u2019s own cause, potentially at the expense of petitioner\u2019s, as is intuitively true in the event of a confession. Rather, they were an attempt to conceal the criminal activity altogether \u2014 not to minimize it or shift the blame for it. They were, thus, simply not unreliable as indicators of the guilt of either defendant, in light of the other evidence adduced at trial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Of course, despite the foregoing, reversal would be appropriate had the trial court erred in granting the prosecution\u2019s motion to consolidate petitioner\u2019s and Kemp\u2019s cases for trial. I doubt that my belief that the motion was properly granted will come as a surprise; nonetheless, I briefly consider the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">As the district court noted, not only was this a case in which both defendants were charged with precisely the same crimes, but \u201cpetitioner\u2019s argument that he should have been granted a severance because of his co-defendant\u2019s incriminating statements loses much of its force when it is recognized that those statements were not <em>Bruton </em>violations.\u201d <em>Lyle, </em>Civil No. 80-74578, Slip Op. at 10-11. As I agree with this conclusion, I also agree with the resolution of the issue by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">I suspect that, given the majority\u2019s conviction that no cautionary instruction on the use of the letters would have been sufficient to cure the <em>Bruton </em>violation it has discerned in this case,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the majority would also conclude that consolidation was, here, an abuse of discretion. However, because I do not perceive the instant case as rising to the level of a <em>Bruton </em>violation, I similarly do not perceive this as a case in which consolidation \u201cwas so prejudicial that the [trial] court could have exercised its discretion in only one way.\u201d <em>Hackett, </em>638 F.2d at 1187. Therefore, I conclude that, based upon my understanding of the law in this area as it was before today\u2019s decision, there was no error in granting the prosecution\u2019s motion to consolidate petitioner\u2019s case with that of Kemp for purposes of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AvL\">I would affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-7\">. \u201cJoint trials are favored for the reason of judicial economy,\u201d <em>United States v. Hackett, </em>638 F.2d 1179, 1187 (9th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 1001, 101 S.Ct. 1709, 68 L.Ed.2d 203 (1981), and in this Circuit, \u201ca petitioner must show both an abuse of discretion and prejudice from denial of a severance motion\u201d (or, as in this case, granting of a motion to consolidate) to be entitled to relief by collateral attack. <em>Jenkins v. Bordenkircher, </em>611 F.2d 162, 168 (6th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 943, 100 S.Ct. 2169, 64 L.Ed.2d 798 (1980). For the reasons discussed <em>infra </em>p. 443, I conclude that joinder was properly granted in this case (an issue not addressed by the majority by virtue of its resolution of the confrontation claim).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b532-12\">. Portions of the letters were redacted prior to their admission, a fact which the majority does not mention. While the record before us does not reflect what portions of the letters were deleted or contain the letters as written, it seems fair to conclude that the trial court was aware of the potential for a <em>Bruton </em>problem, and proceeded in a manner consistent with cases holding that redaction of material which clearly incriminates a codefendant is an appropriate method of \u201csanitizing\u201d extrajudicial statements. <em>See United </em>States <em>v. Dady, </em>536 F.2d 675, 678 (6th Cir.1976) (per <em>curiam). </em>However, in light of my conclusion that the letters are not hearsay, redaction was not necessary at all under the confrontation clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b533-8\">. The majority appropriately notes that the question whether or not the letters were hearsay is \u201cexceedingly close.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 432-33. I agree that resolution of the differences between Wigmore and Morgan is difficult. This is shown by the thoughtful exposition of the relative positions of these two eminent scholars in the majority opinion. The result is to remove verbal acts from the realm of nonhearsay in certain instances. The rule governing when such acts should be considered hearsay will be difficult to apply because it is difficult to comprehend. One will have to examine the proffered evidence and determine whether it is an assertion, why it is offered, and whether the reason for which it is offered constitutes an assertion. If this sort of analysis is required as a matter of constitutional law in the implementation of the confrontation clause, then so be it. However, I cannot reconcile this with the rules and decided cases, especially <em>Bruton, </em>where the Court \u201cemphasize[d] that the hearsay statement inculpating petitioner was clearly inadmissible against him under traditional rules of evidence.\u201d 391 U.S. at 128 n. 3, 88 S.Ct. at 1623 n. 3 (citation omitted). Along with the fact that the codefendant\u2019s statement implicating the defendant was inherently untrustworthy, the fact that it was inadmissible under traditional rules of evidence was one of the reasons the Court found as it did.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b533-12\">. Anderson was, of course, a conspiracy case. However, the Court stated that \u201cthe prior testimony was ... admissible simply if relevant in some way to prove the conspiracy charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221, 94 S.Ct. at 2261. I do not read this phrase as enunciating a rule applicable only to conspiracy prosecutions; rather, the Court was, I believe, stating that, where evidence is in fact not hearsay, it is admissible as substantive evidence to prove whatever facts are at issue (given relevance and authenticity, neither of which appear to be disputed here). <em>See also United States v. Hackett, </em>638 F.2d 1179 (9th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 1001, 101 S.Ct. 1709, 68 L.Ed.2d 203 (1981) (concluding that because statements were not hearsay, \u201cit was not necessary that they were in furtherance of the conspiracy in order to be admissible against the other defendants\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b534-10\">.

See, <em>e.g., ante </em>at 432. Thus, by holding that it is the intention of the party propounding the evidence, instead of the content of the evidence itself, which is determinative in a hearsay analysis, today\u2019s decision sets the clearly stated position of the Advisory Committee on its ear.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b535-8\">.

Of course, there is always the possibility that evidence of false exculpatory statements or other circumstances would be too prejudicial to a codefendant to permit the trial to go forward without severance, although no cases so holding have been found. However, the standard which would control such a situation is the same as that which governs severance under other circumstances, and is wholly unrelated to the confrontation clause. Similarly, the trial court could, upon request, consider the matter under Rule 403, Fed.R.Evid. or its state-law equivalent, <em>see </em>Rule 403, Mich.R.Evid., which permit a trial court to exercise its discretion to exclude relevant but overly prejudicial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b535-17\">.

I have particular difficulty with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the inference of Lyle\u2019s guilt was compelled by the fact that the letters put Kemp and \u201cRock\u201d together at the time of their arrest. It was a fact in evidence that they were arrested together; any attempt at an alibi by either which did not take account of that fact would have been patently specious. Thus, the only inference which I see as necessarily drawn\u2014 assuming that the jury concluded that \u201cRock\u201d ' was petitioner \u2014 is what they already knew; that petitioner and Kemp were arrested together. <em>See United States v.

Thus, the right to confrontation attaches when the defendant might be able to challenge the accuser\u2019s statement at trial. <em>A fortiori, </em>when as in the case of circumstantial evidence, there is no challenge to which the evidence is susceptible, there is no benefit to be derived from examination; thus the purposes of the clause are not advanced. \u201cThe test ... is whether \u2018under the circumstances, the unavailability of the declar-ant for cross-examination deprived the jury of a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the extra-judicial statement.\u201d <em>Hackett, </em>638 F.2d at 1186. I am at a loss as to what petitioner could conceivably have accomplished through cross-examination of Kemp. The letters stood on their own, susceptible to neither embellishment nor impeachment. Of course, the defendant will, in the case of such evidence, be able to cross-examine the individual who propounds or authenticates the evidence; here, petitioner was able to cross-examine the woman who ferried the letters from Kemp\u2019s jail cell to his friends.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b538-11\">. As noted above, I believe that the letters were properly admitted as against petitioner, because they were not hearsay. It would be disingenuous to suggest that their admission was harmless error in the event that the Court\u2019s hearsay analysis is in fact correct. However, I believe that even were that analysis accurate, the letters were not \u201cpowerfully incriminating\u201d and were otherwise not excluda-ble under <em>Bruton. </em>Rather, I believe that petitioner\u2019s \u201cargument boils down to a claim that [he] would have had a better chance of acquittal in a separate trial at which [the letters] would have been excluded.\u201d <em>United States v. Lord, </em>565 F.2d 831, 839 (2d Cir.1977). That is, of course, not compelling. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, their admission, even if hearsay, was not a violation of <em>Bruton </em>at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b538-12\">. While the majority analysis is couched in terms of <em>Bruton, </em>and so appears to apply only to circumstantial evidence generated after the crime charged (e.g., concealment, flight), I see no significant distinction between such evidence and evidence of a defendant\u2019s behavior prior to the crime which spills over to the codefendant. I can only conclude that under the rule we establish today, the notebooks con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>sidered in <em>Wilson, supra, </em>n. 6, would be inadmissible as against the codefendants absent a conspiracy charge. Thus, the Court is providing prosecutors with an incentive to tack on a conspiracy count in order to gain admission of evidence which would be, under today\u2019s holding, otherwise inadmissible, or to accede to severance in every case where evidence is to be introduced which was generated by only one defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b539-8\">. The majority apparently faults the trial court here for not having given a cautionary jury instruction on the use of the Kemp letters, while noting that \u201cno instructions ... would have forestalled the violation in Lyle\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 434-435. I note both that counsel for petitioner specifically stated that \u201cwe do not request any further instructions nor do we object to any of the instructions as given,\u201d Tr. 1054, and that given the current level of frank awareness with regard to the efficacy of limiting instructions, <em>see Bruton, </em>391 U.S. at 129-133, 88 S.Ct. at 1624-1626 and accompanying notes, the Court is putting trial courts in the position of having to make a Hobson\u2019s choice with regard to the use of such instructions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
