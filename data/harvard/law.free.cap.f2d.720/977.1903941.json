Budwig instituted this action against Natelson\u2019s, Inc. Profit Sharing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>Retirement Plan, alleging improper allocation of benefits to him upon his termination of employment. The district court, the Honorable Albert G. Schatz, dismissed Bud-wig\u2019s complaint and held that the Trustee\u2019s action was not arbitrary or capricious nor was it inconsistent with ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">Budwig was employed by Natelson\u2019s on November 13, 1967, and his employment continued until he resigned on June 30, 1977. During this time, Natelson\u2019s maintained a retirement profit sharing plan for its eligible employees. The original retirement plan was amended by an ERISA Plan on February 1, 1976. Contributions to the plan for the benefit of Budwig were made by Natelson\u2019s on the thirty-first of January 1970 through 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">On February 27, 1978, Budwig submitted his written claim to the Trustee. The Trustee calculated Budwig\u2019s vested equity under the terms of both the original and the ERI-SA Plan and concluded that under both plans, Budwig was entitled to the same amount. The Trustee determined that Budwig\u2019s vested equity was fifty percent, that Budwig was not entitled to an allocation of Natelson\u2019s contribution for the Trust Year ending January 31, 1978, and that Budwig was not entitled to immediate distribution of an insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">We have carefully studied the record, including the trial court\u2019s opinion, the briefs and the arguments of the parties to this action. We find no merit to Budwig\u2019s arguments, and accordingly affirm pursuant to Rule 14 of the Rules of the court on the basis of Judge Schatz\u2019s opinion. <em>Budwig v. Natelson\u2019s, Inc. Profit Sharing Retirement Plan, </em>Civ. No. 81-O-24, (D.Neb. Oct. 18, 1982).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
