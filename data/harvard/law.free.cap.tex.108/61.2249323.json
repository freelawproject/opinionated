McCray v. Railway Co., 89 Texas, 168, recognizes that in .such cases the doctrine does not apply. We think the facts of the present case bring it within the rule, equally announced in McCray v. Railway Co., that the circumstances of a particular accident may themselves furnish proof of negligence; and it is for this reason that the writ of error is refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-16\">\n<em>Writ of error refused.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
