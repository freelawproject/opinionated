The defendants pleaded not guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-6\">In a prior action of ejectment for the same property, Baltzer Gehr, the plaintiffs\u2019 father, recovered a verdict and judgment: Sitler v. Gehr, 105 Pa. 577. The defendants in that action afterward brought ejectment against the heirs of Baltzer Gehr, who had died in the meantime, and recovered judgment therein: Gehr v. Miller, 20 W. N. 387. In each of those actions, as well as in the present, the question for determination was whether or not Baltzer Gehr was one of the heirs of Catharine Geehr, who died May 10, 1877, intestate, unmarried and without issue, seised in fee of the land in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-7\">At the trial, on December 2, 1889, testimony was presented substantially to the same effect as in Sitler v. Gehr, supra. Catharine Geehr\u2019s grandfather was Balser Geehr of Berks county. The plaintiffs claimed that their father, Baltzer Gehr, who was the son of Joseph ,Gehr, formerly of Lancaster county and later of Crawford county, was a nephew of Balser Geehr of Berks county. If this were the fact, the plaintiffs would have title to the undivided one third of the land in dispute. To prove it, the plaintiffs made offers to show by the testimony of Baltzer Gehr,1 Solomon Gehr,2 and Samuel Gehr,3 taken in the first ejectment, that the mother of Baltzer Gehr, and several other members of his family, all of whom were deceased, had made declarations, prior to the commencement of this controversy, tending to show that Balser Geehr, of Berks county, was the uncle of Baltzer Gehr of Crawford county. Each of these offers was objected to upon the ground that, before such declarations could be admitted, it must be proved by evidence aliunde, to the satisfaction of the court, that the declarant was connected with the family of Balser Geehr, of Berks county.

Solomon Gehr, of Crawford county, the witness who testified to the declarations of John Gehr, stated that this John Gehr was the father-in-law of the witness and was a son of Jacob Gehr, and a nephew of Baltzer Gehr; that he was born in 1784 and died in 1853. Asa Gehr, another witness for the plaintiffs, testified that Jacob Gehr, an uncle of the witness and a brother of Baltzer Gehr, lived in Crawford county, about twelve miles west of Meadville, and had a sou named John, and testified further as follows: \u201c Q. Did airy of the other brothers of your father have a son by the name of John? A. They had. Q. Which one? A. They called him Captain John Geehr. Q.

Joseph Kutz had testified that the grandfather of the witness was a brother of Balser Geehr, and had two sisters, Mrs. Croll and Mrs. Bast, whose first names the witness was unable to give, but whose husband\u2019s names were Michael Croll and Dewalt Bast, and that Mrs. Croll was buried at the Smoke Church near Hamburg. Jonas Kohler, another witness, had testified that he knew a certain Mrs. Croll, who</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AoK\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>died in 1832 and was buried at the Smoke Church, now St. Paul\u2019s; that she was called Margaret Croll, and the witness had heard her called Mrs. Michael Croll.

It had been shown by other testimony that the father of Balser Geehr, of Berks county, was Conrad Geehr. For the purpose of showing that Joseph Gehr and his brothers Andrew, John and Paul, were sons of John Gehr, and therefore could not be brothers of Balser Geehr, the defendants made the following offer:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-9\">Mr. Snyder: Baltzer Gehr testified that his father\u2019s name was Joseph Geehr and that he lived in Cocalico township, Lancaster county, having prior to 1782 lived on his brother Paul\u2019s land, and that his father had three brothers, Andrew, John and Paul, and two sisters, Mrs. Ginter and Catharine, the defendants now offer: (1) A mortgage dated November 21, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>1757, John Geehr, Sr., of the county of Lancaster, of the one part, and Paul Geehr and Andrew Geehr, both sons of the said John Geehr, of the second part. (2) A mortgage dated November 22,1760, from John Gehr, Jr., and George Gehr, single men, to John Gehr, Sr. (8) A deed dated January 12,1769, from Thomas Cadwallader to Paul Gehr, conveying lands in Cocalico township, Lancaster county. (4) Deed dated April 21, 1774, from John Gehr and George Gehr, sons of John Gehr, conveying lands to Joseph Gehr. (5) Deed dated March 28, 1783, from Francis Brumbach and Elizabeth, his wife (one of the daughters of Paul Gehr), releasing her interest in lands of her father, Paul Gehr, in Cocalico township, Lancaster county, to Joseph Gehr, of Cocalico township. (6) Next, the will of Paul Gehr, dated November 1, 1773, proved November 29, 1773, directing inter alia that this farm should be rented out by his executors and the rent used to support his family until after his two youngest sons should arrive at age, and then directing an appraisement to be taken-'and the farm to be given them upon certain conditions. (7) The account of the executors, filed April 13, 1790, showing that the farm was rented up to 1790, and the account showing pajunents to Joseph Gehr, under date of 1779, for taxes and for expenses at the valuation of the real estate. (8) Deed dated March 25, 1790, from the executors of Paul Geehr and his sons, on their arrival of age, to show that from the date of 1773, to 1790, there was a farm in Cocalico township, Lancaster county, known as \u201c Paul Gehr\u2019s farm,\u201d the title remaining in his estate. (9) Also, assessment lists to show that there was but one Paul Gehr assessed in Cocalico township, Lancaster county, fronr 1769, the date of the conveyance, to 1790, and that between 1773 and 1790 there is no assessment to Paul Gehr, he being dead, as shown by the will, in 1773. (10) Also, the assessment of Earl township, Lancaster county, which adjoins Cocalico township, to show that there was but one Paul Geehr in Earl township, and was, presumably, the Paul Geehr mentioned in the deeds and mortgages. (11) Also the signatures of Paul Gehr to the will and satisfaction of the mortgage, to show that they were one and the same person.

Green), </em>for the appellants:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-12\">1. The authorities are admittedly conflicting as to the applicatioxi of the rule requiring evidence aliunde of the relation^ ship of the declaraxxt to the family, when declarations as to pedigree are offered, and we ask the court to review the decision in Sitler v. Gehr, 105 Pa. 577. Surely it ought to be necessary to show that the declarants, in the present case, belonged to some branch of the family of Balser Geehr of Berks county, and of this the mere similarity of name is no evidence. The proof does not seem to have gone beyond that in this case, and the rule as to evidence aliunde has virtually been refined orrt of existence. Aside' from this consideratioxx, the declaratioixs of Baltzer Gehr hixnself should not have been received. It must be recollected that hearsay evidence, in cases of pedigree, is admissible only ex necessitate rei, and as Baltzer Gehr had himself testified and told what he knew, no such necessity existed for admitting his declarations in this instance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-13\">2. An offer to prove by Jacob C. Geehr, declarations of John Gehr, inconsistent with his declaration as testified to by Solomon Gehr, was rejected in Sitler v. Gehx\u2019, supra, for reasons which caxrnot apply to the similar offer in the present case. That the declarations thus offered were directly contradictory of the declaratioxis given in evidence by the plaintiffs is clear, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>and the offer was admissible if there was evidence that the different declarations were made by the same person. Upon this point we have more than mere identity in name. We have a correspondence in age; as, according to Solomon Gehr\u2019s testimony, J ohn Gehr was about sixty-three years old, and we proposed to show that the John Gehr, deceased, whose declarations we offered, was about fifty or sixty years of age. Again, we showed that John Gehr was a son of Jacob Gehr, who lived twelve miles west of Meadville, and that the only other brother who had a son named John, was Baltzer, and that son is still living. Time, place, circumstances, age and relationship all concur as evidences of identity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-6\">3. The well-settled law as to proof of identity warranted the admission of the inscription on Margaret Croll\u2019s tombstone. Identity of name is prima-facie evidence of personal identity: McConeghy v. Kirk, 68 Pa. 200; Burns v. Hyatt, 1 Clark 323; Kelly v. Valney, 5 Clark 300; McGennis v. Allison, 10 S. &amp; R. 197; Goodsell v. Hibbard, 32 Mich. 48; Atchison v. McCulloch, 5 W. 13; Greenl. Ev., \u00a7 575, note 3. The ruling on the question of identity in Sitler v. Gehr, 105 Pa. 577, does not collide with these authorities, as there is a good deal more evidence of personal identity in this instance than mere identity of name. Our offer of the Lancaster county records was made to rebut the proof that Balser Geehr of Berks county was a brother of Joseph Gehr, the father of Baltzer Gehr of Crawford county. The question is, whether the facts shown by those records do not so fit in with the facts testified to by Baltzer Gehr and other witnesses for the plaintiffs, as to make it probable that they are parts of the same family history, and that the Paul, Andrew and John Gehr of the records, who were the sons of John Gehr, Sr., are the same Paul, Andrew and John that, as Baltzer Gehr testified, were his father\u2019s brothers; from which it would follow that his father could not be a brother of Balser Geehr of Berks county, who was the son of Conrad Geehr.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-7\">4. That this is the case, is shown by a remarkable number of facts and circumstances, embodied in the records, which completely agree with the facts sworn to by the plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses, and make every member of the family fit into his proper place. These coincident facts completely supply every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>requisite which the law prescribes as necessary to show identity. Certain facts embodied in the offer, which have come to light since the trial of Sitler v. Gehr, 105 Pa. 577, viz., that John Gehr, as executor of Paul Gehr, rented the latter\u2019s farm until the youngest son became of age, and that Joseph Gehr appears to have been \u201c tenant to John Gehr,\u201d fully answer the objection made in Sitler v. Gehr, as to the identity of the Paul Gehr who died in 1773, by their correspondence with the statement of Baltzer Gehr, that his father had lived on his brother Paul\u2019s farm. An examination of the cases cited in Sailor v. Hertzogg, 2 Pa. 182, shows that the rule requiring \u201csome preliminary evidence \u201d of identity, is not based so much on remoteness of the transaction, as on \u201c the existence of circumstances to cast doubt on the identity.\u201d And see the facts in Sailor v. Hertzogg, as reported in 4 Wh. 259. See, also, Jackson v. Christman, 4 Wend. 277; Jackson v. King, 5 Cow. 241 (15 Am. Dec. 468); Abbott\u2019s Trial Ev., 101. It can no longer be asserted, however, that there is nothing but identity of name offered to be shown by these records.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b344-4\"><em>Mr. Isaac Hiester </em>(with him <em>Mr. John F. </em>Smith, <em>Mr. H.

Recitals in deeds are not evidence of pedigree against persons who are strangers to them: Fort v. Clark, 1 Russ. 604; Shaney v. Wade, 1 Myl. &amp; Cr. 838.

Gehr, 105 Pa. 577. This was not denied by the appellants, but we were urged to re-examine and re-consider those rulings with a view to a different judgment. In view of the importance of the interests, as well as the legal principles involved, I have examined that case with more than usual care, with a disposition to modify our rulings if found erroneous. Notwithstanding the zeal and ability with which the matter has again been called to our attention, I have been unable to find anything to shake our former views of the law of that ease. We do not deem it necessary now to re-enter upon its discussion. It would be in a great measure a repetition of what was there said.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The only new question is raised by the sixth assignment, in which it is alleged the learned court below erred in refusing to admit in evidence the inscription on the tombstone of Margaret Croll, the wife of Michael Croll and sister of Philip Gehr, in the churchyard near Hamburg, Berks county, under the following offer, viz :</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\u201c It having been testified by Joseph Kutz that the sister of his grandfather, Margaret Croll, lived in Greenwich township, and was buried, as much as he knows, at the Smoke Church, near Hamburg, and it having been further testified by Jonas Kohler that Margaret, wife of Michael Croll, was buried in. 1832, at the church of Lebanon with the nickname of Smoke Church, now St. Paul\u2019s, the defendants propose to prove that the said Margaret Croll was buried in 1832, at a church within two miles, or two miles and a half of Hamburg, and propose to give in evidence the record on the tombstone; this for the purpose of showing that she was Mrs. Margaret Croll, wife of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Michael Croll, the date of her death .and age, and that there is no tombstone showing such burial at the S.moke Church.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ALn\">While the fact here offered to be proved was not offered in Sitler v. Gehr, the principle by which it must be decided was ruled in that case. I do not understand the offer to be more .than an attempt to show, that in a churchyard within two miles of Hamburg there is a tombstone, on which is inscribed th.e name of Margaret Croll, wife of Michael Croll, with a record of her age and death. Who this Margaret Croll was, the inscription does not inform us; but we are asked to infer from the similarity of name, and that alone, that she was a sister of Philip Gehr. I do not find any evidence in the case that Philip Gehr had a sister Margaret. Be that as it may, it appears by the testimony of Joseph Kutz that Joseph had two sisters, and that one of them married a man named Michael Croll, and the other married a Bast. But the same witness distinctly said that he did not know the first name of either sister. Jonas Kohler had testified that a Mrs. Croll, named Margaret, who was the wife of a Michael Croll, was buried in the Smoke Church in 1832. This offer was to prove the inscription on a tombstone of a Margaret Croll, who was not buried at the Smoke Church, but who was buried at St. John\u2019s Church, two and a half miles from the Smoke Church. I do not see that this evidence would have damaged the plaintiffs\u2019 case, had it been admitted. It might possibly have confused the jury, and we think was properly rejected. It involved at most a mere identity of name; and, as was said in Sitler,v. Gehr, \u201cit would work great injustice if rights of property, after a great length of time, were allowed to depend upon mere identity of name. A prima-facie case thus submitted to a jury might be extremely difficult, if not impossible to disprove. I know of no case in which mere identity of name has been held sufficient, after the great lapse of time which exists here.\u201d This principle was sufficiently discussed in Sitler v. Gehr, and I do not propose to add to it beyond the citation of the following additional authorities as bearing upon it: 1 Whart. on Ev., \u00a7 656; 1 Greenl. Ev., \u00a7 493; Wedgwood\u2019s Case, 8 Greenl. 75; Berkeley Peerage Case, 4 Camp. 401; Mooers v. Bunker, 9 Fost. 431; Jackson v. Christman, 4 Wend. 283; American Life Ins. &amp; Trust Co. v. Rosenagle, 77 Pa. 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>The seventh and eighth assignments are but a re-arrangement of the offers of evidence in regard to the Lancaster county records, as we had them in Sitler v. Gehr, and as now presented do not disclose any substantial difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
