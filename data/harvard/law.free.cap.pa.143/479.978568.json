Prima facie the contract imported a guaranty demanding literal performance. That a sliding scale was provided for an allowance for an excess of iron, and a diminution for a deficiency, was not controlling. Apparently, the latter created but an option, which did not mitigate the strictness of compliance upon which the purchaser might insist.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b504-6\">2. Though a trade custom, or other relevant facts might- affect the determination of the defendant\u2019s right to strict- performance under the contract, yet a literal breach thereof by the plaintiffs being averred by the defendant, that averment was sufficient to prevent a summary judgment for the plaintiffs without a hearing.</syllabus>\n<judges data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b504-7\">Before Paxson, C.

A sample was forwarded and analyzed, showing the ore contained 59.586 of metallic iron and .025 of phosphorus, after drying the ore at two hundred and twelve degrees. A second sample was sent him by the plaintiffs, accompanied with a letter of August 31, 1886, a copy of which is annexed. This sample showed 53.598 of metallic iron and .026 of phosphorus, after drying the ore at one hundred and twelve degrees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-6\">\u201c Having received this letter and the samples, and having procured the analysis thereof, the defendant authorized shipments to be made, and two were made, one by the steamship Lorain and one by the bark Simpat\u00eda. Before the arrival of these vessels, relying on the samples and letter, the defendant authorized a contract to be made for future shipments, and the contract set out in the statement was made. After this, the vessels arrived and their cargoes were delivered and sent to the furnaces. These ores were then tested and ascertained not to accord with the samples or the guaranty in the contract, the analysis showing that the cargo of the Lorain contained 48.747 of metallic iron in the natural state and .038 of phosphorus, and the cargo of the Simpat\u00eda contained 49.40 of metallic iron in the natural state and .030 of phosphorus.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-7\">\u201c The defendant did not discover these facts until after the iron had been delivered at the furnaces and it had become impracticable to reject and return the ores, nor could he, in the usual course of business of this kind, have discovered the fact sooner. Immediately on ascertaining the fact that the ores shipped did not correspond to the quality guaranteed, the defendant repudiated the contract that had been made and refused to receive any more dre under it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-8\">\u201c As respects the averment that the plaintiffs have fulfilled their part of the contract, and were ready and willing to perform the same by loading ore of the kind stipulated for by the contract, the defendant believes this is not true, and expects to be able on the trial to prove that the ore that was sold by the plaintiffs, and for the loss on which he claims to recover, was not of the quality that the defendant was bound to accept if the contract had continued to be in force.\u201d ....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-9\">After argument of a rule, judgment was entered for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>plaintiffs for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, the court below filing no opinion. Thereupon, the defendant took this appeal, assigning the order entering judgment for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b508-6\"><em>Mr. R. C. </em>McMurtrie, for the appellant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-7\">The contract says, in express words, that the sellers undertake to mine and deliver ore guaranteed to contain a yield of fifty per cent of iron in the natural state. Natural state means, as it comes to the purchaser and before roasting or drying for the'purpose of analysis. Then follows the sliding scale. This is explained as intending to provide the terms of settlement, in case the ore is accepted and the right to reject it for nonconformity to the standard is not discovered until it is too late to reject it: Simond v. Bradden, 2 C. B., N. S., 336. If there was a warranty, was the defendant bound to accept the ore when it was not of the standard ? The defendant is not in court on the effect of a delivery and acceptance, but on the obligation to accept a thing that differs from the thing bought; and he was not bound to accept: Benj. on Sales, \u00a7 894; Depuy v. Arnold, 1 W. N. 157; Isaacs v. Maris, 1 W. N. 268.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b508-8\"><em>Mr. Isaac S. Sharp </em>(with him <em>Mr. S. H. Alleman), </em>for the appellees:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-9\">1. A contract must be \u201c read in the light which the business to which it relates, with all the incidents and usages of that business as conducted at the time, may throw upon it: \u201d Dexter v. Lathrop, 136 Pa. 565. There is no absolute warranty that the ore shall contain fifty per cent of iron, or provision that if it do not the purchaser may reject it. The contract was the work of the parties themselves, and the strict and technical meaning of the words should not be adopted. Can a man not warrant an article, and yet stipulate that after he shall have delivered it to the purchaser the latter shall not be at liberty to return it, but if it does not answer the guaranty or warranty the damages of the purchaser shall be limited to a certain sum, or measured by a certain scale ? Such a stipulation would not render the guaranty senseless, and it is not prohibited by statute or by the policy of the law: Heyworth v. Hutchinson, L. R. 2 Q. B. 447; Benj. on Sales, Bennett\u2019s ed., 565; Richardson v. Brown, 1 Bing. 344.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>2. All warranties, however expressed, are open to such construction, from surrounding circumstances and the established usage in similar cases, as will make the engagement of warranty conform to the intention and understanding of the parties: 1 Pars. on Cont., 5th ed., 576; Benj. on Sales, Bennett\u2019s ed., 522; Vernede v. Weber, 1 H. &amp; N. 311. And this was not a sale by sample: Benj. on Sales, Bennett\u2019s ed., 586, 625, 626. But, in any event, a sale by sample, under our common law, requires only a delivery of goods of the same description, not of the same quality. And the law of the place of the contract, in the absence of proof to the contrary, is presumed to be the same as the common law of the forum: 21 Am. Law Reg. 572; Boughton v. Bank, 9 W. N. 519; Pfaelzer v. Drexel, 11 W. N. 480.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"Arq\">Mu. Justice Green:</author>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">In this case judgment was entered against the defendant for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence. The facts set forth in the affidavit are\u201eto be taken as verity, and we have nothing before us but the plaintiff's\u2019 statement and the defendant\u2019s affidavit. The statement contains the contract upon which the action is founded. By the explicit terms of the contract, the plaintiffs sold and the defendant bought \u201c dry iron ore,\u201d of usual quality, \u201c guaranteed to contain fifty per cent of iron in the natural state, with a sliding scale at the rate of three pence per unit additional for every unit over fifty per cent, and with a deduction at the rate of four pence per unit for every unit under fifty per cent.\u201d The affidavit alleges that the first deliveries under the contract contained, one of them, 48.747 of metallic iron in the natural state and .038 of phosphorus, and the other contained 49.40 of metallic iron in the natural state and .030 of phosphorus, and that as soon as this was discovered the defendant repudiated the contract and refused to receive any more ore under it. As to all other matters contained either in the statement or affidavit, some of which involve considerations of fact and may possibly on a trial control the result, we can have nothing to say, and of course cannot determine either positively or inferentially.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">As the affidavit contains a positive averment that the ore delivered did not contain fifty per cent of metallic iron in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>natural state, a breach of the guaranty is asserted. This breach may or may not be vital to the plaintiffs\u2019 right of recovery. Possibly the variation from the percentage of metallic iron required by the contract, may be so slight as that the ore delivered may be a substantial compliance with the contract, or a compliance which the law, when better informed by testimony, may regard as adequate. But we cannot know that now, and we can only deal with the breach of a condition which the purchaser required by the terms of his obligation. Technically, guaranties demand literal performance. Such is the prima facies of the engagement. It is not for courts to know, as matter of law, whether there are or may be considerations extrinsic the written stipulations of the parties which may excuse a literal compliance with them. It is enough for present purposes to say that we do not find any matter in the contract itself which necessarily has that effect. The suggestion that a sliding scale is provided, for an allowance for an excess of iron and a diminution for a deficiency, is not controlling. Apparently that provision creates nothing more than an option, but does not mitigate the rigidnebs upon which the purchaser may insist if- he chooses. Possibly a trade custom or other legitimate facts may affect the determination of the purchaser\u2019s strict right. But we cannot either hear or decide them now. We know at this time only that a literal breach by the plaintiffs is alleged and claimed, and a literal breach is enough to defeat a compulsory judgment without a hearing. It seems to us that, if the defendant proves the facts set out in his affidavit, the burden will be cast upon the plaintiffs to relieve themselves from the imputation of a breach, and that consideration is enough to carry the case to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Judgment reversed and procedendo awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">On January 4, 1892, a motion for a re-argument was refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
