Ct.; court below, number and term not shown.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-9\">On January 7, 1889, the account of Reily L. Fisher, executor of the will of Thomas B. Reber, who died on August 27, 1887, was called for audit, when Elizabeth Reber, the widow of the testator, proved for allowance out of the estate in the executor\u2019s hands, a note, not under seal, made by the testator January 27, 1873, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-10\">\u201c I promise to pay to my wife Elizabeth, or order, the sum of seventeen hundred and twenty-five dollars on demand, with, lawful interest from this date until paid; without defalcation, value received.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-11\">On November 12, 1889, the auditing judge, Schwartz, P. J., filed an adjudication as to said claim as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-12\">The claim is allowed, with interest from August, 27, 1887, to date, now amounting to $1,950. In the court\u2019s opinion, this note should not pay interest during the testator\u2019s lifetime. True, the presumption is that the interest on a note is payable from the time it demands interest, in ordinary cases. Between husband and wife it is otherwise. In such cases, the presumption of law is that they lived off such interest, and that they consumed it from year to year; and this presumption may be rebutted only by showing that the husband and wife lived apart, each upon his or her own income.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-13\">\u2014A distribution having been reported accordingly, the claimant filed an exception. After argument, the exception was dismissed and the adjudication confirmed. Thereupon, the exceptant took this appeal, specifying that the court erred in not allowing interest upon said note from its date until paid.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-14\"><em>Mr F.

The learned judge appears to have thought, however, that no interest should be allowed until after the death of the maker, because, between husband and wife, as he expressed it, \u201cthe presumption of law is that they lived off such interest and consumed it from year to year; and this presumption can only be rebutted by showing that husband and wife lived apart, each on his or her own income.\u201d He evidently misapplied the principle of presumption which sometimes arises from an entirely different state of facts. In the case of an express, written promise to pay interest, etc., such as we have in this case, the principle he intended to invoke can never become applicable, except under special qualifying circumstances which must, of course, be shown by competent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">It is well settled that when a husband receives and uses his wife\u2019s money with her consent, but without any agreement to pay interest, he will not, as a general rule, be chargeable with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>interest; but, if be receives the money for her use and appropriates it to his own without permission, there is no reason why in such case he should not pay interest: May v. May, 62 Pa. 213; Hamill\u2019s App., 88 Pa. 363; Hauer\u2019s Est., 140 Pa. 420. When he has expressly agreed in writing to pay interest, his promise, in the absence of competent countervailing evidence, should be the measure of his liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">There was manifest error in not allowing appellant interest from the date of the note, according to the terms of her husband\u2019s contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Decree reversed, with costs to be paid by the appellees ; and record remitted for further proceedings in accordance with tbis opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
