C. C. P., and directed the confinement of appellant in the penitentiary for three years. The sentence will be reformed to direct appellant\u2019s confinement in the penitentiary for not less than two years nor more than three years, and as thus reformed the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
