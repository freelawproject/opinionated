That the trial court was in continuous session from June 1st to June 12th. That on June 16th thereafter the court reporter, who had taken down the testimony, was stricken with a heart attack, and immediately died therefrom. The appellant\u2019s attorney soon thereafter took the notebooks of the deceased reporter to two other court reporters, one of whom used the same shorthand system as the deceased reporter, and they both certify that they were unable to read such notes; that it was impossible for them to prepare an intelligible statement of facts therefrom. It also appears that there were many bills of exceptions taken on the trial of the case, the notes thereof being contained alone in the reporter\u2019s notes; that by agreement the exceptions and objections to the court\u2019s charge had been dictated to the reporter, who would afterwards transcribe the same and file them as of the date dictated, which objections had not been transcribed at the time of the reporter\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">It is claimed that there were many witnesses testifying, and many bills of exception taken, and the attorney trying same,\u2014 not expecting to have to prepare a statement of facts from memory, and not charging his mind with the matters contained in the bills of exception, \u2014 wholly relied upon the expectancy of the reporter furnishing him with not only a copy of the notes taken down at each occurrence but also a statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">Under the circumstances we are constrained to order a reversal of this cause on account of the fact that through no fault of appellant, or his attorney, he has been deprived of a statement of facts herein. See Little v. State, 97 S. W. (2d) 479, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>ON STATE\u2019S MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b637-5\">CHRISTIAN, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">We have carefully examined the State\u2019s motion for rehearing, with the affidavits attached thereto, in connection with the defendant\u2019s reply to said motion, which also has appended thereto the affidavit of the trial judge and of appellant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The affidavit of the trial judge, which appellant has attached to his reply, explains the judge\u2019s affidavit which the State has attached to the motion for rehearing. The judge says in his affidavit: \u201cI cannot now recall enough of the facts to prepare a statement of all of the facts in the case, unless defense counsel and State\u2019s counsel prepare in writing and tender to me their respective versions of the testimony adduced upon said trial. I make this affidavit to explain the affidavit heretofore prepared and filed in this court by the State\u2019s attorney. I express no opinion as to the difficulties, if any, between State\u2019s counsel and defendant\u2019s counsel in their efforts, if any, to prepare and present to me a statement of facts to be approved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">The affidavit of appellant\u2019s counsel, which is attached to appellant\u2019s reply to the State\u2019s motion for rehearing, is to the effect that many witnesses testified upon the trial and that many bills of exception were taken, and that counsel, \u2014 not expecting to have to prepare a statement of facts from memory, and not charging his mind with the matters contained in the bills of exception, \u2014 did not remember enough of the facts to prepare a statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">Viewing the situation in the light of the motion and the affidavits, we are constrained to the view that proper disposition was made of the appeal in the original opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
