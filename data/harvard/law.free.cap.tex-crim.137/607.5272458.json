Many complaints are made in such brief of the action of the trial court in the trial of the case, but such complained of actions are not found in the record. There are no bills of exception in the record, and, in the absence of such, we are unable to review the complaints found in such brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-16\">The facts seem to clearly establish the proposition that by means of an assault and by violence the appellants possessed themselves of the complaining witness\u2019 automobile and drove the same into New Mexico, where it was later recovered. They are deemed sufficient to establish the allegations contained in the indictment, and, in the absence of any errors shown, the judgment is affirmed as to both appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b632-17\">ON appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing.</p>\n<author id=\"b632-18\">CHRISTIAN, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b632-19\">In their motion for rehearing appellants contend that they were deprived of their bills of exception. No affidavits are presented in support of this contention. The averments in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>unsworn motion cannot be held sufficient to present the question for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-3\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
