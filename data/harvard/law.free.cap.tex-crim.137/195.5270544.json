It seems that this trial in the county court was an appeal from that justice court, and the county court trial resulted in a verdict and judgment of a fine of $50.00. Under the statute, Art. 53, C. C. P., we are without jurisdiction herein under the facts above set forth. Art. 53, C. C. P., reads as follows: \u201cThe Court of Criminal Appeals shall have appellate jurisdiction coextensive with the limits of the State in all criminal cases. This article shall not be so construed as to embrace any case which has been appealed from any inferior court to the county court or county court at law, in which the fine imposed by the county court or county court at law, shall not exceed one hundred dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">The fine herein imposed being for less than one hundred dollars, the appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
