Appellant\u2019s first advance towards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>her was to touch her on her arm which was on the back of her seat. He finally got up and mov\u00e9d his seat to one next to her, and soon thereafter he placed' his hand on her legs above her knees. She immediately got up and went to an usher and complained to him. Appellant started out of the theater, running out the aisle and exclaiming \u201cIt is a lie, I didn\u2019t do it, I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d The ushers then got a policeman who detained appellant, and appellant then said: \u201cIt is a lie, little girl, tell them it is a lie,\u201d at which time his pants were unbuttoned,\u2014 several buttons.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Appellant testified and denied that he touched the little girl, or if so that it was an accident; he was drinking he said, and went into this movie theater to sleep it off. He said that his pants had one broken button thereon, but were not further unbuttoned. He was thirty-three years of age, a jeweler, and had never before been charged with a crime. It can be seen that the testimony herein was conflicting, and the court who tried the case resolved the conflict against the appellant, and we do not feel inclined to disturb his finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">There is a further complaint relative to the punishment, which is claimed to be excessive. The uncontradicted testimony is to the effect that the little girl was only eleven years old, and therefore what would be in law termed a child, \u2014 See Branch\u2019s Penal Code, p. 928, Sec. 1573, the appellant\u2019s age being given at thirty-three years; that he attempted to fondle her person is also clearly shown by the little girl\u2019s testimony; that appellant\u2019s trousers were unbuttoned is also shown by the girl and the policeman. That the punishment for an aggravated assault could have been made more severe herein, had the trial court so decided, is plain, and we would not be justified in saying that one year in jail is an excessive punishment under the case as made out by the proven facts and the punishment allowed by the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b74-8\">ON appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing.</p>\n<author id=\"b74-9\">CHRISTIAN, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">After re-examining the record in the light of appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing we are still of opinion that the evidence is sufficient to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
