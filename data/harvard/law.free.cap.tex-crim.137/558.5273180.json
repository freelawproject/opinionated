Davidson, </em>State\u2019s Attorney, of Austin, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b583-10\">HAWKINS, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">Upon a plea of guilty appellant was convicted of theft of cattle, and his punishment assessed at two years in the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">Appellant asked for a suspended sentence which the jury declined to recommend.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-13\">We have not been furnished with a statement of facts. Appellant brings forward three bills of exception complaining of matters which he says impinged on his plea for suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-14\">Bill of exception number one recited that the district attorney asked appellant if he \u201cfarmed during the year 1938.\u201d The bill fails to show whether the question was ever answered, and if so, what the answer was. The bill then recites that appellant offered to show that on account of illness he was unable to work during the time mentioned. The court refused the proffered testimony and appellant complained of such ruling. In the absence of a statement of facts we think the bill of exception presents no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-15\">Bill number two recites that appellant placed his wife on the witness stand and proved by her appellant\u2019s good reputation as a law-abiding citizen, and that he had never been convicted of a felony, and that on cross examination the district attorney asked her \u201cwhat offense the defendant had been convicted of in the years 1928 and 1929 in Federal Court,\u201d and that over appellant\u2019s objection the court required the witness to answer, but the bill is entirely silent as .to what the answer was. This bill presents no error. See Branch\u2019s Ann. Tex. P. C., Sec. 210; 4 Tex. Jur., Sec. 211, p. 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Bill number three complains that the court over appellant\u2019s objection permitted the State to elicit the fact that some seven or eight years prior to the present trial appellant had been \u201ccharged\u201d with the theft of chickens. Appellant\u2019s objection was that it was too remote and because appellant had never been indicted upon such charge. Of course, if the accusation for chicken theft had never been merged into a legal charge the State could not prove the incident. See 45 Tex. Jur., Sec. 241, p. 102, and Branch\u2019s Ann. Tex. P. C., Sec. 167, p. 101; Newton v. State, 94 Tex. Cr. R. 288, 250; S. W. 1036. However, the bill recites that the inquiry of the State about chicken theft charge occurred \u201cafter defendant had shown that he had never been indicted for the alleged offense and was innocent of the charge.\u201d It thus appears from the bill that appellant first developed the chicken theft incident, whatever it may have been, and the inquiry by the State could not under the circumstances be held reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
