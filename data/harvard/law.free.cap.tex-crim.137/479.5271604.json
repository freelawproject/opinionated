By proper averments the fact of Taylor County being \u201cdry area\u201d was alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-17\">Appellant entered his plea of guilty before the County Judge, waiving a jury. The following judgment was entered in the minutes of the County Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-18\">\u201cThe State of Texas vs. J. M. Waltrip.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-19\">\u201cCharge: Liquor Law Violation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-20\">\u201cNo. 10208</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-21\">\u201cDate: Mar. 10, 1938</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-22\">\u201cThis day this cause was called for trial, and both parties appeared and announced ready for trial, and the defendant, J. M. Waltrip after being duly admonished of the consequences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>thereof by the Court, pleaded guilty to the charge herein, and waived a trial by jury and submitted his cause to the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">\u201cWherefore it is considered by the Court, that the defendant is guilty as charged, and his punishment is assessed at a fine of One Hundred &amp; No/100 Dollars and \u2014 days\u2019 imprisonment in the county jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">\u201cIt is therefore considered and adjudged by the Court, that the State of Texas do have and recover of the defendant J. M. Waltrip the said fine of One Hundred and No/100 Dollars and all costs of this prosecution and that he be imprisoned in the County jail of Taylor County, Texas, for--days, and the defendant being present in Court is placed in the custody of the sheriff \u2014 who will commit him forthwith to the jail of said county \u2014 until said period of imprisonment has expired, and thereafter-until said fine and costs are fully paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-9\">\u201cIt is further ordered by the Court that execution may issue against the property of said defendant for the amount of said fine and costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-10\">\u201cDefendant appeared in person and by attorney and entered a plea of guilty and fined $100.00 and costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">Appellant failed to pay his fine and costs. A capias pro fine was issued under which he was taken into custody. He sought release by a writ of habeas corpus before Hon. M. S. Long, District Judge. Upon a hearing he was remanded to custody and from said order this appeal is prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">As we understand it appellant sought relief through habeas corpus proceeding on the theory that the judgment of conviction was a void judgment and thus subject to attack in the manner indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-13\">While the judgment in question may be subject to some criticism we do not discover any defect therein which could not have been corrected by direct proceeding in the trial court, or by this court if appeal had been prosecuted. We do not believe the judgment is void. See Terry v. State, 30 Tex. Cr. R. 408; Ex parte Dickerson, 30 Tex. Cr. R. 448; Caples v. State, 91 Tex. Cr. R. 111, 237 S. W. 923; Ex parte Cross, 284 S. W. 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-14\">The judgment remanding appellant is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
