The penalty was enhanced under the provisions of Art. 61, P. C. The State introduced in evidence a certified copy of a judgment of conviction in which the name of the person convicted was Dave Potter. There was a failure to make other proof of the identity of the appellant as the person who committed the offense charged in the prior conviction. The mere recital in a certified copy of the judgment is not sufficient to prove the identity of the accused. McCann v. State, 60 S. W.
