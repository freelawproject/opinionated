There were also 144 cans of beer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Appellant was arrested, the liquor was seized, and the officers carried him and the liquor to San Saba.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Appellant, by bill of exception number one, complains of the admission of testimony by the officers relative to what they discovered as a result of the search of appellant\u2019s car without a search warrant. His objection thereto was that the arrest was without a warrant and the search of his automobile illegal; that consequently the evidence discovered as a result of the search was inadmissible under Art. 727a C. C. P. Under Sec. 30 of Art. 666 P. C., officers have a lawful right to make an arrest for a violation of the liquor law and to search on probable cause. If the officers had probable cause to make the arrest, then the evidence discovered as a result of the contemporaneous search was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">In order to determine this question, we must examine the testimony relative thereto. The deputy sheriff testified on the subject as follows: \u201cBefore we went out on the road and met them I got a phone call from Llano telling me that Jack Cothran, loaded pretty heavily, had started toward San Saba, and needed to be met. That was the reason I went out there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">This is the only information which the officers had. If this could be held to constitute probable cause for the arrest of appellant and the search of his automobile without a warrant, then the arrest was legal and the evidence admissible. The information conveyed by telephone to the officers is not, in our judgment, sufficient to convey the idea that appellant was heavily loaded with intoxicating liquor. The information was too indefinite and uncertain to show that appellant was loaded with whisky, so as to constitute probable cause for his arrest without warrant. It was not stated by the informant whether appellant was driving a truck and that it was \u201cloaded pretty heavily\u201d so as to constitute a violation of the truck load law, or whether he was carrying whisky in violation of the liquor law. The law authorizing a person\u2019s arrest and search on probable cause for violating the liquor law is more liberal than in other instances, and we do not feel justified in extending or enlarging it by judicial construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">From what has been said, it follows that the judgment of the trial court must be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b364-5\">HAWKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The State appears to rely largely upon our opinion in Martin v. State, 122 Texas Cr. R. 174, 54 S. W. (2d) 812, as a precedent for its contention that probable cause existed for the search of appellant\u2019s car in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The facts in Martin\u2019s case show that when the officers asked him what he had he replied that he had thirteen and a half gallons of whisky. In the present case appellant only said to the officers \u201cI am loaded.\u201d In other words nothing appellant said to the officers supplemented the indefinite information conveyed to them over the telephone. We think the same distinction is apparent in the other cases cited by the State in its motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">The State\u2019s motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
