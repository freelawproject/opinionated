Winter King, Judge of the Criminal Court of Dallas County sitting at the July Term, 1939, remanding the appellant to the County Jail of Dallas County. In his application for a writ of habeas corpus, appellant averred that he was being held in jail \u201cnot by virtue of any writ, order or process.\u201d In response to the writ, a capias pro fine, issued out of Walker County was introduced, showing that appellant was held for refusal or inability to pay a fine assessed against him in the amount of $15.25. No final judgment appears in the record. The same is before us without a statement of facts, briefs, or any exceptions whatsoever. Moreover notice of appeal appears only by docket entry and a recitation in the appeal bond. This is not sufficient. See Sec. 125 of Vol. 4, Tex. Juris., pp. 171-172.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">Consequently this court is without jurisdiction and the appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
