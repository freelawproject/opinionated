This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. RApp. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-17\">On October 12, 2000, Carter filed a complaint against the Sumner County, Tennessee, Jail (\u201cSCJ\u201d). Sumner County Sheriff J.D. Vandercook, SCJ Chief Deputy Bob Barker, SCJ Administrator Sonya Troutt, SCJ Captain Doug Carver, SCJ Nurse Ann Haymaker, and Sumner County District Attorney General Ray Whitley. Carter alleged that during his incarceration at the SCJ, he stepped into an open drain hole and injured his right knee. Relying upon the Eighth Amendment, Carter alleged that the defendants denied him proper medical care, subjected him to unconstitutional conditions of confinement, and inflicted severe pain upon him following the incident. Carter sought monetary relief and immediate release from confinement. He is no longer incarcerated at the SCJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-18\">A magistrate judge filed a report recommending dismissal of the complaint as frivolous. Over Carter\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and dismissed the complaint as frivolous pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). Carter\u2019s motions to alter or amend the judgment, which the district court construed as Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motions for relief from judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>were subsequently denied. Carter now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">We review de novo a judgment dismissing a suit as frivolous under \u00a7 1915(e)(2). <em>Brown v. Bargery, </em>207 F.3d 863, 866 (6th Cir.2000). A complaint \u201cis frivolous where it lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u201d <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Upon review, we conclude that Carter\u2019s complaint should not have been dismissed as frivolous pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae because his Eighth Amendment claims are not \u201cindisputably meritless\u201d and \u201ccould conceivably implicate Eighth Amendment concerns.\u201d <em>See Brown, </em>207 F.3d at 866. Instead, Carter\u2019s complaint should have been dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). \u201cDismissal of a complaint for the failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted is appropriate only if it appears beyond a doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The Eighth Amendment prohibits any punishment which violates civilized standards of decency or \u201cinvolve[s] the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\u201d <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 102-03, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976) (quoting <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 173, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976)). An Eighth Amendment claim contains both an objective and a subjective component. <em>Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 298, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991). The objective component requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that he has been subjected to specific deprivations that are so serious that they deny him \u201cthe minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities.\u201d <em>Rhodes v. Chapman, </em>452 U.S. 337, 347, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981); <em>see also Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 8-9, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992). The subjective component requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the prison officials acted wantonly, with deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs serious needs. <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); <em>Wilson, </em>501 U.S. at 298-99. Deliberate indifference is the reckless disregard of a substantial risk of serious harm; mere negligence will not suffice. <em>Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 835-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Carter\u2019s complaint failed to allege facts that, if proven, would rise to the level of the serious deprivation and deliberate indifference required to support an Eighth Amendment claim. With respect to his improper medical care allegations, Carter did not allege that any of the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs. Instead, Carter\u2019s complaint, at most, alleged negligence and his disagreement with the medical treatment that he received during his incarceration at the SCJ, which are insufficient to state an Eighth Amendment claim. <em>See Estelle, </em>429 U.S. at 106. Furthermore, to the extent that Carter asserted an Eighth Amendment claim based upon an alleged delay in medical treatment, his claim fails as he did not allege, much less provide verifying medical evidence to establish, the detrimental effect of the delay. <em>See Napier v. Madison County, Ky., </em>238 F.3d 739, 742 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">With respect to his unconstitutional conditions of confinement and infliction of severe pain allegations. Carter failed to allege that he was subjected to a substantial risk of serious harm and that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious needs. Under these circumstances, Carter\u2019s complaint, al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>though not frivolous, failed to state an Eighth Amendment claim for cruel and unusual punishment. We may affirm the district court\u2019s order \u201con any grounds supported by the record.\u201d <em>City Mgmt. Corp. v. U.S. Chem. Co., </em>43 F.3d 244, 251 (6th Cir.1994); <em>see also Russ\u2019 Kwik Car Wash, Inc. v. Marathon Petroleum Co., </em>772 F.2d 214, 216 (6th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order is affirmed.
