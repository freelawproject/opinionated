Schuh pleaded guilty to maintaining a drug house, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(1), and his initial prison sentence of 228 months\u2019 incarceration included an adjustment for being an organizer or leader. Schuh appealed, and we remanded his case for resentencing without the role-in-the-offense adjustment. <em>United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973 (7th Cir.2002). The district court resentenced Schuh to 151 months\u2019 incarceration, a term at the high end of the applicable guideline range. Schuh appeals his new sentence, arguing that the district court imposed it in reliance on inaccurate information.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">We have consolidated Schuh\u2019s appeal with that of a dealer who operated out of Jocko\u2019s, Christopher Mims. Mims pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), and was sentenced to 121 months\u2019 incarceration. Mims challenges his sentence, raising several arguments regarding the district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward based on his substantial assistance to authorities. For the reasons that follow, we dismiss Schuh\u2019s appeal and affirm Mims\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">A. Robert Schuh</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">At Schuh\u2019s resentencing the district court determined that the applicable guideline range, without the role-in-the-offense adjustment, was 121 to 151 months\u2019 incarceration. After hearing arguments about where in that range to sentence Schuh, the district court imposed a sentence at the high end:</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">[T]he Court believes that a sentence at the top of the guideline imprisonment range is warranted because the quantity of cocaine for which this defendant is accountable falls near the top of the range, 43.4 kilograms, and because his conduct spanned an extensive period of time involving innumerable transactions. Such a sentence will provide specific and general deterrence and hold the defendant accountable.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">The Court notes that his sentence at the top of the guideline range will provide imprisonment greater than that of codefendants consistent with defendant\u2019s control, operation, and maintenance of the drug house, Jocko\u2019s Rocket Ship, the Court believing that without such a facility available this extensive drug trafficking could not have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">Defense counsel objected, arguing that the district court\u2019s rebanee on Schuh\u2019s control over Jocko\u2019s could be relevant only to prove that Schuh played a greater role in the offense than his codefendants. Counsel argued that this court rejected such a conclusion. The district court replied that Schuh\u2019s sentence compbed with our earher ruhng:</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">Well, the Court took those remarks [regarding Schuh\u2019s control over Jocko\u2019s] from Count 1 of the Superseding Indictment and I don\u2019t bebeve that there\u2019s anything in the dicta or direct ruling from the Seventh Circuit which suggests this Court not consider the Indictment. The remand was for sentencing without an adjustment for being an organizer or leader.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">I don\u2019t bebeve that the Court of Appeals can restrain a court from fobowing the Indictment which has been pled to as guilty and the Court did ask questions and receive answers relating to that Superseding Indictment when it took the plea. And the Court bebeves it is appropriate that the defendant be sentenced for those reasons as enumerated, having done that with the assistance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>none other than the Indictment which was used in this matter, the very elements of the offense of keeping a drug house.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">On appeal Schuh argues that the district court erred in considering his control over Jocko\u2019s when deciding where within the guideline range to sentence him. But \u201cabsent an error of law or misapplication of the guidelines, there is no appellate jurisdiction over a district court\u2019s choice of a sentence within an otherwise correct guideline range.\u201d <em>United States v. Byrd, </em>263 F.3d 705, 707 (7th Cir.2001). A defendant, however, may challenge his sentence if the court relied on inaccurate information, <em>United States v. Polson, </em>285 F.3d 563, 567 (7th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Anaya, </em>32 F.3d 308, 314 (7th Cir.1994), and that is the argument that Schuh purports to make here.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">But in fact he makes no such argument. Schuh fails to identify any inaccurate information on which the district court relied and instead really contends that, by emphasizing his control over Jocko\u2019s, the district court inaccurately inferred that he played a greater role in the offense than his codefendants. But even if the district court made such an inference, it would not be contrary to our prior decision. All we concluded then was that Schuh did not satisfy the requirements for a \u00a7 3B1.1 adjustment. That did not preclude the district court from concluding that Schuh was more culpable than his codefendants, albeit to a lesser extent than required by \u00a7 3B1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment. (n.2) (explaining that, even though a defendant may not satisfy the requirements for a \u00a7 3B1.1 <em>adjustment, </em>an upward <em>departure </em>may be warranted when the defendant exercises management responsibility over property). Moreover, to the extent that Schuh relies on the shorter sentences of his codefendants in support of his argument, we have held that \u201ca disparity among co-defendants\u2019 sentences is not a valid basis to challenge a guideline sentence otherwise correctly calculated.\u201d <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>218 F.3d 692, 696 (7th Cir.2000) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, because Schuh\u2019s sentence falls within the applicable guideline range and because he fails to identify any inaccurate evidence on which the district court may have relied in selecting that sentence, we lack jurisdiction to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">B. Christopher Mims</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">In Mims\u2019s plea agreement the government agreed to move for a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 if Mims provided substantial assistance to authorities. A week before sentencing, the government filed its \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, accompanied by an affidavit of the prosecutor and two exhibits. Exhibit A was an eight-page FBI report of Mims\u2019s post-indictment proffer, and Exhibit B was the entire transcript of Mims\u2019s grand jury testimony. These exhibits detailed Mims\u2019s cooperation with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">Mims raises several arguments on appeal, and all but one relate to the district court\u2019s denial of the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. Mims first argues that the district court did not consider the entirety of his cooperation, or, at a minimum, that it is unclear from the record that the court considered such evidence. Next, Mims argues that the district court should have held a hearing to consider the extent of his cooperation. He then argues that the government breached the plea agreement by falling to inform the district court about the entirety of his cooperation and by not objecting to his sentence. Finally, Mims argues that his counsel provided ineffective assistance in various respects regarding the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion and by failing to argue that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>criminal history category overstated the seriousness of his criminal background.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Initially, we note that we lack jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s refusal to depart from a guideline range if the court was aware of its discretion to depart and the sentence contains no legal error. <em>United States v. Bosque, </em>312 F.3d 313, 318 (7th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Crucean, </em>241 F.3d 895, 898 (7th Cir.2001). There is no question that the district court here knew that it had the discretion to depart, and Mims\u2019s only allegation of legal error is that his sentence violated due process because the court did not have complete information regarding the extent of his assistance to authorities. Specifically, Mims alleges that the government did not provide the court with the FBI report of his proffer and the transcript of his grand jury testimony. Whether such an allegation raises a claim of legal error is questionable, but, even assuming that it does, Mims\u2019s claim is frivolous because the district court did have the FBI report and the grand jury transcript. The record establishes that the government included those documents as exhibits to its \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, and at sentencing the court specifically referred to Mims\u2019s grand jury testimony. Moreover, the documents were sent to this court as part of the record on appeal. Thus, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s refusal to depart.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Two of Mims\u2019s other claims-that the court should have held a hearing to determine Mims\u2019s cooperation and that the government breached the plea agreement-also rely on his erroneous belief that the government did not provide the district court with the FBI report and the grand jury transcript. Thus, because the government did submit those documents to the district court, those claims have no merit. Moreover, we are puzzled by Mims\u2019s contention that the court did not hold a hearing to determine his cooperation with government. He had several opportunities at sentencing to argue for a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure, and he never requested an additional evidentiary hearing to present more evidence of his cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Mims\u2019s remaining claim is that his counsel was ineffective because he failed to (1) provide the court with \u201ccrucial facts\u201d regarding his cooperation; (2) object to the sentence because of the \u201cmissing\u201d FBI report and grand jury testimony; (3) negotiate a provision in the plea agreement requiring the government to \u201centhusiastically argue\u201d for a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure; and (4) argue that his Category IV criminal history score overstated the seriousness of past crimes. Mims raises this claim despite our hesitancy to review ineffective-assistance claims on direct appeal, rather than in a collateral attack where the record can be developed. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Farr, </em>297 F.3d 651, 657 (7th Cir.2002). And even though a full evaluation of Mims\u2019s claim would require us to consider information not in the record, i.e., trial counsel\u2019s strategic decisions, we will address the claim now because Mims\u2019s new counsel raises it in his brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">Attorneys provide ineffective assistance when their performance falls below an objective standard of reasonableness and the defendant suffers prejudice. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To prove prejudice the defendant must show \u201ca reasonable likelihood that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>276 F.3d 360, 366 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>536 U.S. 924, 122 S.Ct. 2592, 153 L.Ed.2d 781 (2002). A reasonable likelihood is \u201cone sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Morris v. United States, </em>264 F.3d 726, 727 (7th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Mims\u2019s first two bases for his ineffective-assistance claim fail because they rely on his erroneous belief regarding the FBI report and grand jury transcript. Thus, he cannot even establish deficient performance, much less prejudice. Mims\u2019s remaining arguments fail because he cannot establish prejudice. First, it is questionable whether an attorney can bargain for a particular degree of enthusiasm from the government in making sentencing recommendations. <em>United States v. Benchimol, </em>471 U.S. 453, 456, 105 S.Ct. 2103, 85 L.Ed.2d 462 (1985). In any event, an \u201centhusiasm\u201d clause would not have mattered because the government informed the court of all of Mims\u2019s cooperation; the court was simply not persuaded, specifically noting that Mims\u2019s presentence report included a \u201csubstantial amount of information\u201d that Mims did not provide to the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Second, Mims cannot establish a reasonable likelihood that the district court would have departed because of his criminal history category. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. Mims received seven criminal history points-five points for prior state offenses and two points for committing the current offense while on probation. He contends that Category IV overstates his criminal history because only one of his prior offenses was a felony and because his probation term was almost complete when he committed the current offense. But it is unlikely that the district court would have departed from Category IV in light of its comments regarding his criminal background:</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The Court notes the defendant has a prior felony conviction for drug distribution. He was placed on probation and did not use that opportunity to distance himself from this criminal activity. He has a prior citation and a criminal conviction for drug possession. Were it not for his cooperation the Court would have imposed a sentence near the middle of the guideline range because that is particularly where not only the quantity of drugs is found but also the numerous transactions and the extended period of time in which Mr. Mims was involved in the conspiracy would have placed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Accordingly, Mims does not meet the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, and his ineffective-assistance claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">As a final matter, we deny Mims\u2019s motion (as well as his renewed motion) seeking to supplement the record with the FBI report and grand jury testimony. Those exhibits are already included in the sealed portion of the record on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">For the reasons explained above, we DISMISS Sehuh\u2019s appeal and AFFIRM Mims\u2019s sentence. We also DENY Mims\u2019s motions to supplement the record.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
