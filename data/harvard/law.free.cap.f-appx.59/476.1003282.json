He was apprehended on January 7, 2001 as a stowaway aboard a vessel entering the United States from South Africa. An Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) asylum officer found that Abraham did not demonstrate a credible fear of persecution or torture and was removable as an \u201carriving alien who is a stowaway.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225(a)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Abraham requested asylum and withholding of removal before an Immigration Judge, but was denied those requests. Abraham appealed to the Board, which dismissed. This petition for review followed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-15\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the Immigration Judge and Board properly determined that Abraham failed to meet his burden of proving eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-17\">Abraham testified through a Swahili interpreter that he was born in Yei, a small town in southern Sudan, and later moved with his parents and brother to a village in the town of Torit. He testified that he and his family were members of the Dinka minority ethnic group, that he and his family practiced Catholicism, and that his father and brother were members of a political party known as the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army (\u201cSPLA\u201d). Although Abraham had no documentation confirming his family\u2019s membership in the SPLA, he claimed that his parents would not let him leave home out of fear that he would be taken by government supported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>militia groups, such as the mujahadeen, which fought the SPLA and captured children and sent them to war.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Abraham testified that in 1994, when he was eleven years old, a group of men invaded and burned his home. He and his brother allegedly escaped to a town in Uganda, where they lived with a family for five years. Abraham could produce no letter, affidavit or other documentation from the family, nor could he provide an address. Nor could Abraham provide evidence regarding what happened to his parents, but claimed his mother had been killed and that his father was probably in jail. This information was allegedly conveyed to Abraham through his brother, who received the information from two young men. The young men claimed the mujahadeen carried out the attack. Abraham had no letter, affidavit, or other documentation in support of these allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In 1999, when Abraham was 16, he and his brother allegedly left Uganda for South Africa. At the South African border they were stopped by police who gave them a written order to leave the country within seven days. Abraham could not produce a copy of this document. The two men continued on to South Africa where they resided with other refugees in Johannesburg for nine months. Abraham did not know the address of the apartment, nor could he produce any evidence to confirm these claims. Abraham was unable to produce corroborating evidence from his brother or relatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">Asylum will be granted where an alien establishes that he is a refugee who is unable or unwilling to return to his country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), 1158(a). The Immigration Judge found that Abraham failed to provide consistent, detailed, and believable testimony to establish that he had a well-founded fear of persecution on account of his nationality, ethnicity, religion, or political affiliation. The Board deferred to the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision, stating, \u201cBecause we adopt the Immigration Judge\u2019s well-supported determination that the applicant\u2019s testimony cannot be accepted as credible, it follows that the applicant has failed to satisfy his burdens of proof and persuasion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">We review the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision to assess whether the Board\u2019s deference was proper.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Abdulai v. Ashcroft, </em>239 F.3d 542, 549 n. 2 (3d Cir.2001). The Board\u2019s determination must be upheld if \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>I.N.S. v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4)). It should be reversed only if Abraham presented evidence such that \u201ca reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, reversal is ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>propriate only if \u201cthe evidence not only <em>supports </em>the conclusion, but <em>compels </em>it\u2014 and also compels the further conclusion that [Abraham] had a well-founded fear\u201d that he would be persecuted <em>\u201cbecause of </em>that political opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481 n. 1. Direct proof of the persecutors\u2019 motives is not required, but there must be some evidence of it, either direct or circumstantial. <em>Id. </em>at 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The Immigration Judge found Abraham\u2019s testimony incredible regarding his nationality, ethnicity, and religion. Abraham conceded an inability to speak Dinka, which allegedly was the language primarily spoken in his home for the first 11 years of his life. The Immigration Judge found it implausible that Abraham had \u201ccompletely forgotten his native language in less than seven years.\u201d Furthermore, Abraham\u2019s comprehension of Arabic, which he alleged to have used extensively in his youth, extended no further than a few phrases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Abraham demonstrated proficiency in Swahili, which is not a language of the Sudan, and English. The Immigration Judge also questioned Abraham\u2019s religious affiliation. Abraham claimed to be a practicing Catholic but provided sparse testimony regarding Catholic practices and beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The inconsistencies in Abraham\u2019s testimony provided substantial evidence to support the Immigration Judge\u2019s adverse credibility finding. At the time Abraham left South Africa, he had lived relatively unmolested for 18 months and had resided in tranquility in Uganda for five years. He allegedly has numerous friends, family, and acquaintances throughout Sudan, Uganda, and South Africa. Yet Abraham failed to produce any evidence that attested to his identity, nationality, or religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">With regard to past persecution, the Immigration Judge concluded that the only possible basis to support Abraham\u2019s claim was his father\u2019s alleged participation in the SPLA that led to an invasion of Abraham\u2019s home, lolling of his mother, and imprisonment of his father. The Immigration Judge found this basis insufficient because Abraham did not see the men who invaded his home or know what happened to his parents. The only information regarding his parents\u2019 fate came from two young men who coincidentally ran into Abraham\u2019s brother. The Immigration Judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-12\">Assuming that such an unlikely encounter occurred and ignoring the presence of multiple levels of hearsay, the information provided by the young men is insufficient [to] corroborate the applicant\u2019s account of the invasion of his home. The young men themselves did not witness the attack on the home, nor did they explain whether the applicant\u2019s mother was killed at that time or at a later date or the manner in which she was killed. Additionally, the representation that the applicant\u2019s father was imprisoned and that the mujahadeen were responsible was admitted conjecture. Again, the applicant has provided no affidavits or other documentation to corroborate these representations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-13\">Furthermore, the Immigration Judge did not believe Abraham was from the Sudan and found he failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution because he neither speaks Dinka nor possesses the physical characteristics of a Dinka. In addition, the Immigration Judge found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>The applicant left Sudan when he was eleven years old, approximately seven years ago, during which time he has grown and matured into adulthood. There is nothing to indicate that the applicant, seven years later, would be identified, let alone recognized as a Catholic or Dinka, if he were to return to Sudan. Additionally, there is nothing to indicate that the applicant would be recognized or remembered for his family\u2019s affiliations with the SPLA. The applicant testified himself that his father was a mere member of the SPLA and did not hold any leadership position within the party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Thus, the Immigration Judge found a lack of any well-founded fear of future persecution, as is required for asylum. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Abraham bears the burden of establishing his eligibility for asylum, and the contradictions in his testimony regarding the heart of his claim support the conclusion that he has not done so. He has failed to establish that he suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution. Nothing in the record compels a result different from that reached by the Board and Immigration Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Abraham\u2019s application for withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture is based on the same testimony and evidence presented in support of his asylum claim. Abraham has not provided evidence sufficient to meet his burden of demonstrating that he is more likely than not to be tortured by, at the instigation of, or in acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.16(c)(4), 208.18(a)(1). Thus, we agree with the Board and Immigration Judge that Abraham has \u201cfailed to substantiate his claim by any means, either through his own testimony or corroborative documentation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">For these reasons, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-12\">.
