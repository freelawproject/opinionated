Singletary, </em>268 F.3d 196 (3d Cir.2001), forecloses relief on his appeal and so raises this issue only to preserve it for <em>en banc </em>rehearing before this Court or for review by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-21\">Pursuant to <em>Singletary, </em>268 F.3d 196, the District Court correctly rejected Survey\u2019s constitutional challenge. We therefore affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
