Montford seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s orders denying as successive his petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000), and denying his motion for reconsideration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-28\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (I960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The district court\u2019s order denying Mont-ford\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was filed on October 24, 2002, and entered on the docket on October 25, 2002. The notice of appeal was filed on December 2, 2002.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because Montford failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss this portion of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Turning to Montford\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his motion for reconsideration, we find that the filing the district court construed as a motion for reconsideration would be more appropriately construed as a third \u00a7 2254 petition. So construed, we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s denial of relief given that the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain a third \u00a7 2254 petition without authorization from this court to do so. Accordingly, we dismiss this portion of the appeal on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-12\">. Although Montford did not file a notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for reconsideration, we have jurisdiction over the appeal because his timely filed informal brief is the functional equivalent of a notice of appeal. <em>Smith v.

R.App. P. 4(c); <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
