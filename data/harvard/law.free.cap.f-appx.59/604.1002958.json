We have reviewed the administrative record and the formal briefs on appeal and find Ayele\u2019s challenges to the Board\u2019s use of the streamlined review procedure to be without merit. <em>See Albathani v. INS, </em>318 F.3d 365, 375-79 (1st Cir.2003). We further find that summary affirmance was appropriate in this case under the factors set forth in \u00a7 3.1(a)(7)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-23\">Accordingly, we deny Ayele\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-24\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
