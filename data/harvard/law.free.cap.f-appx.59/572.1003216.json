Israel initially filed his complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000). The district court dismissed without prejudice and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>required that Israel file his claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Because Israel does not seek release from custody, but rather seeks only a determination that he should not have been classified as ineligible for parole, Israel\u2019s claim was properly brought under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Strader v. Troy, </em>571 F.2d 1263, 1269 (4th Cir.1978). The district court, however, properly determined Israel\u2019s claims were without merit because he has the requisite prior felony convictions to be classified as parole ineligible under Virginia law. We therefore affirm substantially on the reasoning of the district court but modify to reflect dismissal under \u00a7 1983 rather than \u00a7 2254. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
