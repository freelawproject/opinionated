The Government\u2019s evidence primarily consisted of the testimony of a paid informant, corroborated by photographs and videotapes. On appeal, Boakye challenges the sufficiency of the evidence underlying his conviction. In a \u201cpro-se supplemental brief\u2019 and a reply brief, Boakye also contends (1) that his two-level sentence enhancement for obstruction of justice, pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 3C1.1, was improper and (2) that his counsel provided ineffective assistance for not having raised this issue in the appellant\u2019s opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">\u201c[A] defendant making an insufficiency claim bears a very heavy burden.\u201d <em>United States v. Desena, </em>287 F.3d 170,177 (2d Cir.2002). We must uphold a jury verdict if \u201c \u2018any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Autuori, </em>212 F.3d 105, 114 (2d Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis omitted)). At trial, the Government\u2019s evidence established that Boakye personally delivered several stolen cars to Oceanlane Shipping\u2019s Bronx shipping yard \u2014 the conspiracy\u2019s base of operations \u2014 and that these cars were then sent to Port Elizabeth, New Jersey, for shipping to West Africa. The cars showed clear damage to the door lock cylinders, and, on one occasion, Boakye refused to deliver a car to Oceanlane without an additional payment of $100 because he was afraid of being stopped by the police. Although Boakye suggests that he \u201cwas credible in his t[e]stimony and the government informant, a convicted international drug supplier[,] was not,\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Opening Brief, at 10) \u201cthe credibility of witnesses is the province of the jury and we simply cannot replace the jury\u2019s credibility determinations with our own.\u201d <em>United States v. Khan, </em>53 F.3d 507, 514 (2d Cir.1995). Thus, there was sufficient evidence to support Boakye\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">Boakye also contends that there was no basis for his two-level sentence adjustment for obstruction of justice and that his counsel provided ineffective assistance for not raising the issue in the appellant\u2019s opening brief. Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 3C1.1 directs a sentencing court to increase a defendant\u2019s offense level by two levels if \u201cthe defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense.\u201d The commentary to this section states that perjury can serve as the basis for an obstruction-of-justice enhancement. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, Appl. Note 4(b). \u201cIn order to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence for obstruction of justice [through perjury at trial], the sentencing court must determine by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant gave false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\u201d <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>147 F.3d 172, 178 (2d Cir.1998) (internal quotations omitted). In reviewing an obstruction-of-justiee enhancement, we give \u201cdue deference to the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts.\u201d <em>United States v. Cassiliano, </em>137 F.3d 742, 745 (2d Cir.1998) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">At trial, Boakye testified that he had never engaged in or discussed with anyone the transportation of stolen cars. Boakye\u2019s testimony was flatly contradicted by the Government informant, as well as by photographic and other evidence. Here, the district court had ample basis to conclude as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Mr. Boakye just said the Court found him guilty. It was the jury that found him guilty. The jury clearly did not believe him. I think the evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict, and I don\u2019t believe that Mr. Boakye was truthful when he testified. And I find by clear and convincing evidence that he gave false testimony concerning material matters with the intent to try and help himself and thereby obstructed] justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Likewise, Boakye\u2019s argument that his counsel provided ineffective assistance because he did not challenge the basis for the obstruction-of-justice sentence enhancement is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
