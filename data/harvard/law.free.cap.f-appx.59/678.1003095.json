Gwin, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b703-12\">SILER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b703-13\">Plaintiff Arlene Virgilio appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Defendant John E. Potter, Postmaster General of the United States (\u201cthe Postmaster General\u201d), on her claims of unlawful retaliation for EEO activity, and discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, and mental disability. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-15\">Virgilio has had numerous bad experiences while working for the Postal Service. Around Christmas 1991, Virgilio, a Jewish woman, complained about the Christian music played over the public address system. The management stopped the music, but Virgilio\u2019s religion became the subject of increased questioning and commentary, some of which she found offensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-19\">In August 1992, fellow postal worker Vanessa Boyd asked Virgilio. \u201cArlene if I buy a gun. can I use you for a target?\u201d Boyd also repeated the threat to a supervisor in front of several co-workers. Vic Wurth, the branch manager, worked with postal inspectors to investigate the situation. concluding that Boyd had used \u201cpoor judgment,\u201d but was not threatening. Virgilio claims that she developed a mental handicap because of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-20\">In May 1993, the post office started an investigation to see if Virgilio was falsifying her quality control records or otherwise sabotaging the new Delivery Point Sequencing program (\u201cDPS\u201d). The investigation ended in November 1993 when the parties agreed that there was no evidence of falsification or DPS sabotage. Virgilio believes that the investigation was a pretext for further discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-21\">In February 1994, Wurth mentioned that employees should not warm up vehicles while on the clock. Virgilio commented to a fellow employee that the new rule was not fair because other employees were allowed to take breaks to go outside to smoke. Overhearing the comment, employee Stan Marone responded by saying \u201cKiss my ass.\u201d Virgilio complained to Wurth; Wurth asked Marone to apologize; Marone refused; and Wurth apologized on Marone\u2019s behalf. On multiple occasions in April 1994, Marone\u2019s bad behavior continued (including sneaking up behind Virgilio, making cackling sounds at Virgilio, staring at Virgilio, and pointing his finger like a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>gun at Virgilio). Virgilio again complained to Wurth, who took no significant action to stop Marone\u2019s behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Virgilio\u2019s other bad experiences include: (1) Wurth refused to cooperate with the Utica Police (Virgilio had requested the police to investigate Boyd), (2) Virgilio was required to submit to a fitness for duty exam and psychological evaluation, and (3) the management improperly wrote \u201cwaived\u201d on Virgilio\u2019s overtime pay form.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">On July 1, 1993, Virgilio sought Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) counseling to address the Boyd incident. She alleged that she had \u201csuffered disparate treatment and continuing harassment from management since the incident.\u201d On April 24, 1994, Virgilio sought EEO counseling to address the Marone incident and the management\u2019s failure to properly respond. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued a decision finding no unlawful retaliation or discrimination. Virgilio then filed suit in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. See Smith v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>167 F.3d 286, 289 (6th Cir.1999). Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Under this standard, the court must determine \u201cwhether reasonable jurors could find by a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 252. In making this determination, \u201c[t]he evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in [her] favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">A. Application of the Forty-five Day Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b704-12\">The right to bring an action under Title VII is predicated upon \u201crigorous administrative exhaustion requirements and time limitations.\u201d <em>Brown v. Gen. Servs. Admin., </em>425 U.S. 820, 833, 96 S.Ct. 1961, 48 L.Ed.2d 402 (1976). Here, the relevant requirement appears at 29 CFR \u00a7 1614: \u201cAn aggrieved person must initiate contact with a Counselor within forty-five days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory.\u201d The district court found that only three incidents fell within the relevant forty-five day periods:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (1) the accusation of sabotaging the DPS program, (2) Marone\u2019s acts of scaring Virgilio by startling her from behind and making cackling sounds, and the management\u2019s subsequent inaction. (3) improperly writing \u201cwaived\u201d on Virgilio\u2019s overtime pay form. The district court dismissed all claims related to other incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">We affirm the district court in dismissing Virgilio\u2019s claims involving discrete events of discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, and mental disability. However, the district court erred in strictly applying the forty-five day periods to limit evidence of cumulative (rather than discrete) forms of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-14\">Specifically, evidence outside the forty-five day periods is relevant for Virgilio\u2019s hostile work environment claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the district court issued its opinion in this case, the Supreme Court decided <em>Nat\u2019l Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>(2002), and we decided <em>McFarland v. Henderson, </em>307 F.3d 402 (6th Cir.2002). These cases establish that \u201cthe existence of [any act that is part of] the hostile work environment within the forty-five day time limit causes the actionable violation to encompass conduct that occurred outside the limit.\u201d <em>McFarland, </em>307 F.3d at 408. In ruling on Virgilio\u2019s hostile work environment claim, the district court should have considered incidents that occurred within the relevant forty-five day periods <em>as well as other acts claimed which are part of the same unlawful employment practice. See Nat\u2019l Railroad, </em>122 S.Ct. at 2077.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">B. Hostile Work Environment Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">In <em>Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993), the Supreme Court stated the standard applicable for hostile work environment claims:</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">When the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim\u2019s employment and create an abusive working environment, Title VII is violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">;\u00a1\u00ed sjs</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">Conduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment \u2014 an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive \u2014 is beyond Title VII\u2019s purview. Likewise, if the victim does not subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive, the conduct has not actually altered the conditions of the victim\u2019s employment, and there is no Title VII violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 21-23 (internal quotes and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">Virgilio has gathered sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that her work environment was both objectively and subjectively hostile. It is clear that her relationships with fellow workers and supervisors were bad. However, her claim fails because on the facts alleged, no reasonable jury could find that her work environment was hostile <em>due to discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, or disability. See Bowman v. Shawnee State Univ., </em>220 F.3d 456, 463 (6th Cir.2000). There is no significant evidence tying the harassment to her status as white, female, or disabled. Virgilio does allege that comments were made regarding her religion, but this \u201chandful of discriminatory comments\u201d does not make out a Title VII violation. <em>See Smith v. Leggett Wire Co., </em>220 F.3d 752, 760-61 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-13\">C. Retaliation Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b705-14\">Finally, Virgilio argues that the district court wrongfully dismissed her retaliation claims. In order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII. Virgilio must prove that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-15\">(1) she engaged in activity protected by Title VII; (2) this exercise of protected rights was known to defendant; (3) defendant thereafter took adverse employment action against the plaintiff, or the plaintiff was subjected to severe or pervasive retaliatory harassment by a supervisor; and (4) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action or harassment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-16\"><em>Morris v. Oldham County Fiscal Court, </em>201 F.3d 784, 792 (6th Cir.2000) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-17\">Here, Virgilio has provided no significant evidence that there was a causal connection between her EEO filings and the alleged harassment. Moreover, the alleged harassment was not the \u201csevere or pervasive harassment\u201d necessary to establish a prima facie case. Because Virgilio has not proven the elements of her prima facie case of Title VII retaliation, the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>trict court was correct in granting the Postmaster General summary judgment. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-8\">. Virgilio initiated EEO counseling on July 1, 1993 and April 21, 1994. Therefore, there are two relevant 45 day periods: May 18, 1993-July 1, 1993 and March 7, 1994-April 21, 1994.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b704-15\">. Virgilio has waived the continuing violation theory, as it was neither presented in the complaint nor in defending summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
