Also at issue is the denial of credit for accepting responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). We wifi affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">Guillermo Munoz-Valencia is a Columbian citizen who was arrested on December 14, 2000 while attempting to board an airplane traveling from St. Thomas, Virgin Islands to New York. Munoz-Valencia\u2019s arrest occurred after authorities discovered he was carrying $90,000 of undeclared currency and using a false resident alien identification card. Upon his arrest, Munoz-Valencia admitted he was an illegal alien and previously used the false identification card to enter the United States through Texas in July 2000. Munoz-Valencia pled guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a) for fraud and misuse of documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-14\">A presentence report revealed Munoz-Valencia was previously ordered deported on October 25, 1998. The immigration court issued a superseding order of voluntary departure, and Munoz-Valencia complied by returning to Columbia on November 17, 1998. On this basis, the presentence report recommended a two level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.2(b)(l) because Munoz-Valencia was \u201can unlawful alien who ha[d] been deported (voluntarily or involuntarily) on one or more occasions prior to the instant offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(l). Munoz-Valencia did not object to the two level enhancement at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-15\">The District Court adopted the recommendation of the presentence report and imposed a two level enhancement for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>prior deportation under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.2(b)(l). The court also found that Munoz-Valencia had not accepted responsibility for the offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). As a result, Munoz-Valencia was sentenced to twelve months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. Munoz-Valencia filed a motion to correct his sentence under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(c), which was denied. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Generally, we exercise plenary review over the interpretation of sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. McKenzie, </em>193 F.3d 740, 742 (3d Cir.1999). But where an appellant does not object, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Cefaratti </em>221 F.3d 502, 512 (3d Cir.2000). Because Munoz-Valencia did not object to application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.2(b)(l), we review for plain error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The defendant bears the burden of showing plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). \u201cFor there to be plain error, there must be an \u2018error\u2019 that is \u2018plain\u2019 and that \u2018affects substantial rights.\u2019 A deviation from a legal rule is \u2018error.\u2019 A \u2018plain\u2019 error is one which is \u2018clear\u2019 or \u2018obvious.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Jake, </em>281 F.3d 123, 132 (3d Cir.2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Russell, </em>134 F.3d 171, 180 (3d Cir.1998)). Munoz-Valencia argues the District Court erred when it ordered a two level enhancement because \u00a7 2L2.2(b)(l) does not apply to aliens who have left the United States under a grant of voluntary departure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L2.2(a) establishes a base offense level of eight for persons found guilty of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546, which proscribes, among other things, the fraudulent misuse of documents authorizing entry into or stay within the United States. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.2(b)(l), a two level enhancement applies \u201c[i]f the defendant is an unlawful alien who has been deported (voluntarily or involuntarily) on one or more occasions prior to the instant offense.\u201d The sentencing guidelines do not define the phrase \u201cdeported (voluntarily or involuntarily).\u201d But we can decipher its definition by giving its words their plain, natural, and commonly understood meaning. <em>See Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Un</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number><em>ion Planters Bank, N.A., </em>530 U.S. 1, 8,120 S.Ct. 1942, 147 L.Ed\u00fcd 1 (2000); <em>United States v. Romo-Romo, </em>246 F.3d 1272,1275 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">An alien may depart the United States at his own expense if the Attorney General so permits after an immigration judge has entered an order granting voluntary departure in lieu of removal and has found that the alien:</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">[H]as been physically present in the United States for a period of at least one year immediately preceding the date the notice to appear was served ... is, and has been, a person of good moral character for at least 5 years immediately preceding the alien\u2019s application for voluntary departure ... is not deportable under section 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) or section 1227(a)(4) of this title ... [and] has established by clear and convincing evidence that the alien has the means to depart the United States and intends to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">An alien who departs this country under a formal deportation order is excludable from the country for five years, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182, and commits a felony if he or she returns without permission. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326; <em>see Cunanan v. I.N.S., </em>856 F.2d 1373, 1374 n. 1 (9th Cir.1988); 1 Bill Ong Hing, <em>Handling Immigration Cases </em>394 (2d ed. 1995). A grant of voluntary departure, on the other hand, is a form of discretionary relief which allows a deportable alien to leave the United States without suffering these consequences. <em>Cunanan, </em>856 F.2d at 1374 n. 1. In other words, an alien who voluntarily departs the United States may apply for immediate re-entry.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But a grant of voluntary departure does not exclude a deportable alien from all consequences of illegal entry or stay within this country. <em>See Mrvica v. Esperdy, </em>376 U.S. 560, 84 S.Ct. 833, 11 L.Ed.2d 911 (1964). Thus, in some situations, a deport-able alien\u2019s voluntary departure may be treated as a deportation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">In <em>Mrvica, </em>a petitioner was under a deportation order when he departed the United States aboard a ship that sailed to Chile in 1942. <em>Id. </em>The ship returned to the United States shortly thereafter, where petitioner remained. <em>Id. </em>New deportation proceedings commenced and petitioner was again found subject to deportation but was granted the privilege of voluntary departure in a final order in 1954. <em>Id. </em>at 561. In 1959, following other proceedings, petitioner was ordered deported to Yugoslavia. <em>Id. </em>at 562. His application for status of a permanent resident under \u00a7 249 of the Immigration and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Nationality Act was denied on the ground that he departed the United States in 1942. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Petitioner conceded he was ordered deported in 1942 and that his departure from the United States to Chile executed the order of deportation. <em>Id. </em>at 568. The Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">There can be no doubt that this ... point is correct. Legislation then applicable provided that \u201c... any alien ordered deported ... who has left the United States shall be considered to have been deported in pursuance of law, irrespective of the source from which the expenses of his transportation were defrayed or of the place to which he departed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-7\"><em>Id. </em>(citing Act of March 4, 1929, \u00a7 1(b), 45 Stat. 1551, 8 U.S.C. (1940 ed.) \u00a7 180(b)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">Any possible doubt of the import of this provision is removed by [legislative history] which explained ... the Department of Labor has, in many cases, after a warrant of deportation has been issued, refrained from executing the warrant and deporting the alien, at the expense of the appropriation, to the country to which he might be deported, upon the condition that the alien voluntarily, at his own expense, leave the United States. Some doubt exists whether an alien so departing has been \u201cdeported.\u201d Subsection (b) of section 3 of the bill [the provision quoted above] therefore removes any possible doubt on this question by providing that in such cases the alien shall be considered to have been deported in pursuance of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">The alien in <em>Mrvica </em>was under a deportation order when he left the United States. 376 U.S. at 561. But the Court made clear that a voluntary departure from the United States may be treated as a deportation. <em>Id. </em>at 563-64; see <em>also United States v. Taofig Olabiyi Blaize, </em>959 F.2d 850, 851 (9th Cir.1992) (\u201cThis case presents a single straightforward issue: If a person who is under a deportation order for which he has appealed voluntarily leaves the United States, has he been deported? We answer this question \u2018yes\u2019 based on statutes, regulations, and case authority.\u201d). Here, as in <em>Mrvica, </em>an order of deportation had previously been entered against the petitioner, and there is no error, let alone plain error, in applying the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.2(b)(l) two level enhancement to an unlawful alien who has been granted voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-15\">Munoz-Valencia contends he \u201caccepted responsibility,\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), which permits a reduction \u201cif the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d Whether a defendant has \u201caccepted responsibility\u201d requires a factual determination that we review for clear error. <em>United States v. DeLeon-Rodriguez, </em>70 F.3d 764, 767 (3d Cir.1995). \u201cThe sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility. For this reason, the determination of the sentencing judge is entitled to great deference on review.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 app. 5 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-16\">A defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a reduction is warranted under this provision. <em>DeLeon-Rodriguez, </em>70 F.3d at 767. At the time of his arrest, Munoz-Valencia admitted possessing the false resident alien card for six months and using it to enter the United States illegally.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He points to no other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>evidence in support of his claim that he sufficiently accepted responsibility to warrant a departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The District Court found MunozValeneia\u2019s admission of possessing and using the false resident alien card insufficient to constitute acceptance of responsibility. Because Munoz-Valencia was found carrying $90,000 in undeclared currency, the District Court concluded he was \u201cinvolved in something else, because [he] did not make any attempt to declare that currency.\u201d Thus, the District Court did not \u201cbelieve that [he] ha[d] accepted appropriate responsibility, and that [his] explanation was truthful.\u201d We see no clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">For these reasons, we will affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-12\">. At the direction of this Court, the parties advised whether Munoz-Valencia's claims are moot in light of the fact that, although he did not complete his three year supervisory release term, Munoz-Valencia served twelve months in jail and seemed to have returned to Columbia. Nonetheless, Munoz-Valencia faces collateral consequences from his conviction which bars mootness. In <em>Steele v. Black-man, </em>236 F.3d 130 (3d Cir.2001), we held an erroneous conviction of an aggravated felony has continuing and serious legal consequences, including a permanent bar to entry into the United States. Thus, in an appeal where, if successful, appellant\u2019s status will change from an aggravated felon to a non-aggravated felon, collateral consequences prevent the issue from being moot. <em>See id. </em>In this case, Munoz-Valencia is an aggravated felon as convicted. If successful on appeal he would be re-sentenced to a non-aggravated felony conviction. Thus, the issues before us are not moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b509-8\">. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). The District Court exercised jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231 and 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1612.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b509-9\">. Munoz-Valencia argues that he called attention to the issue of proper application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.2(b)(l) during the sentencing hearing on August 15, 2001 through his lawyer\u2019s statement: \"We have also ... noticed possible arguments that ... I\u2019ve waived, possibly, the enhancement for a deportation. This defendant was voluntarily deported. I\u2019m not, I couldn\u2019t find authority either way whether or not it should apply or not, but I\u2019m too late on that. I can't raise it.\u201d This \"objection\u201d is insufficient for plenary review. Munoz-Valencia also argues that his Rule 35(c) motion for correction of sentence filed October 10, 2001 was a sufficient objection for plenary review. We disagree. <em>See Jones v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 373, 388, 119 S.Ct. 2090, 144 L.Ed.2d 370 (1999) (stating that a request for a jury instruction prior to the jury retiring does not preserve an objection to the instruction actually given because, to hold otherwise, \"district judges would have to speculate on what sorts of objections might be implemented through a request for an instruction and issue rulings on \u2018implied\u2019 objections that a defendant never intends to raise. Such a rule would contradict Rule 30\u2019s mandate that a party state distinctly his grounds for objection ... our decisions instead have held that an appellate court may conduct a limited review for plain error.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b509-14\">. Absent the two level enhancement, Munoz-Valencia\u2019s guideline offense level would have been eight, meaning he would have received a sentence of no more than six months imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b510-8\">.
