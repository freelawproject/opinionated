We have jurisdiction' pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Gallegos v. City of Los Angeles, </em>308 F.3d 987, 990 (9th Cir.2002), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Arnold\u2019s claims that he was arrested without probable cause and unconstitutionally searched. The evidence submitted showed that police had probable cause to arrest Arnold because they found him collapsed on a laundromat floor, wavering in and out of consciousness, smelling of alcohol, with his van parked haphazardly against the side of a nearby building. <em>See Mackinney v. Nielsen, </em>69 F.3d 1002, 1005 (9th Cir.1995). The police properly searched Arnold, his wallet, and his van pursuant to a valid arrest. <em>See United States v. Passaro, </em>624 F.2d 938, 943-44 (9th Cir.1980). Further, a judge would likely issue a warrant to test Arnold\u2019s blood on the facts surrounding Arnold\u2019s arrest, even without his alleged admission to police that he drank alcohol. <em>See Hervey v. Estes, </em>65 F.3d 784, 789 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-12\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Arnold\u2019s deliberate indifference claim because, even if the examining paramedics discovered Arnold\u2019s blood sugar was high, Arnold did not show that they deliberately intended to withhold that fact from others. <em>See Maddox v. City of Los Angeles, </em>792 F.2d 1408, 1414 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-13\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Arnold\u2019s involuntary medical treatment claim against Oregon Heath Sciences University staff because he did not raise a genuine issue that he was treated after refusing their help. <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248^9,106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-14\">The district court correctly granted summary judgment on Arnold\u2019s conspira<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>cy, privacy, and emotional distress claims because there were no facts in the complaint to support them. <em>See Taylor v. List, </em>880 F.2d 1040, 1045 (9th Cir.1989) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b958-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
