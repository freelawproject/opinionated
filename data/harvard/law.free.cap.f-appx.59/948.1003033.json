Under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), deportation proceedings, such as De Castro\u2019s, initiated prior to April 1, 1997, for which a final order of deportation is issued after October 30, 1996, are subject to the \u201ctransitional rules of judicial review.\u201d <em>Kalaw v.
