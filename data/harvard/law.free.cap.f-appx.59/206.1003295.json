We decline to reach the merits of Homestead\u2019s constitutional claims because there are factual questions that remain unresolved. Accordingly, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s orders of abstention in these actions and REMAND for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-26\">A federal court may not dismiss a damages action or remand it to state court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>based on abstention. <em>Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 </em>U.S. 706, 711, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996). The district court therefore had no discretion to remand Sherman Way\u2019s damages action on grounds of abstention.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The district court also improperly dismissed Homestead\u2019s declaratory judgment action without stating its reasons for abstaining. <em>Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co. v. Dizol, </em>133 F.3d 1220, 1225-26 (9th Cir. 1998) (en banc) (so holding and identifying considerations relevant to abstention). We reverse the dismissal and remand to the district court so that it may reconsider its decision, including taking into account its resolution of the issue of subject matter jurisdiction in the related case of <em>Casden Co. v. Homestead Insurance, </em>D.C. No. CV-02-00623-R. If the Casden damages action is not remanded to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, we can see no reason why the district court should abstain from Homestead\u2019s declaratory judgment action against Sherman Way. <em>See Md. Cas. Co. v. Knight, </em>96 F.3d 1284, 1289 (9th Cir.1996) (noting that \u201c[c]ases ... in which there are no parallel state court proceedings ... he at the outer boundaries of the district court\u2019s discretion under the Declaratory Judgment Act\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). Under such a scenario, the district court would have to reach Homestead\u2019s constitutional claims in any event as defenses to Casden\u2019s and Sherman Way\u2019s damages actions, and thus abstaining from the declaratory judgment action would result in piecemeal litigation. <em>See id. </em>If the district court again decides to abstain, it must \u201crecord its reasoning in a manner sufficient to permit the proper application of the abuse of discretion standard on appellate review.\u201d <em>Dizol, </em>133 F.3d at 1225.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">This panel shall retain jurisdiction over any further appeal in this matter. REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b230-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
