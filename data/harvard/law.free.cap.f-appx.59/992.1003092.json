Hagen contends that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348,147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), renders 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h) unconstitutional be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>cause it authorizes a possible increase in the penalty beyond the statutory maximum based upon judicial findings proved only by a preponderance of the evidence. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the constitutionality of a statute, <em>United States v. Mack, </em>164 F.3d 467, 471 (9th Cir.1999), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">The district court originally sentenced Hagen to 12 months and one day of incarceration, followed by three years of supervised release for bringing illegal aliens into the United States without presentation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(2)(B)(iii). For violating the terms of his supervised release, Hagen was sentenced to an additional 10 months of incarceration followed by an additional 18 months of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">Hagen\u2019s total sentence of 22 months of incarceration and <em>% </em>years of supervised release did not exceed the statutory m\u00e1ximums applicable to his crime. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(2) (B) (iii) (authorizing maximum of ten years\u2019 imprisonment); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b) (authorizing five years of supervised release). Accordingly, neither 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h) nor Hagen\u2019s additional 18-month term of supervised release is unconstitutional. <em>See United States v. Sua, </em>307 F.3d 1150, 1154 (9th Cir.2002) <em>(Apprendi </em>rule is not violated when defendant\u2019s sentence does not exceed the prescribed statutory maximum), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 1327, 154 L.Ed.2d 1078 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1016-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
