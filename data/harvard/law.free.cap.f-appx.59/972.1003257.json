The claims discussed in the petition to the Oregon Supreme Court, read in context of the state court proceedings and petitioner\u2019s briefing therein, were fairly presented. <em>See, e.g., Kelly v. Small, </em>315 F.3d 1063, 1066-68 (9th Cir.2003). The following claims were thus properly exhausted: (1) ineffective assistance, based on: (a) \u201ccounsel\u2019s failure to timely object to the imposition of a wrongful sentence\u201d; (b) \u201cthe statement of petitioner\u2019s attorney to petitioner that he would not represent petitioner unless he waived his right to a jury trial\u201d; (c) \u201c[counsel\u2019s failure] to object to the Court\u2019s failure in not ascertaining whether the jury waiver was voluntarily and intelligently made\u201d; (d) \u201c[counsel\u2019s failure] to properly advise and counsel petitioner regarding the ramifications of his waiver of jury as opposed to proceeding to a jury trial\u201d; (2) \u201cthe judge [unlawfully] stated that if a plea bargain was not entered into then petitioner would be severely punished\u201d; (3) \u201c[t]he Court unlawfully imposed an excessive and improper sentence when it departed from the sentencing guidelines presumptive sentence\u201d; (4) \u201c[t]he Court accepted the waiver of jury without properly determining whether the jury waiver was voluntarily and intelligently made\u201d; and (5) \u201c[t]he Court allowed and admitted the perjured testimony a[sic] witness against petitioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">On remand, the district court shall consider on the merits, if not previously considered, any of the above claims that petitioner raised in his federal habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-9\">2. The state court\u2019s findings that counsel adequately discussed the dangers and consequences of waiving a jury trial are amply supported by the record. Petitioner\u2019s testimony, that his counsel guaranteed a win and wouldn\u2019t represent him unless he waived his jury right, is inconsistent with this finding, but the court\u2019s decision of which evidence to believe is entitled to great deference, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). On the state court\u2019s finding, defendant suffered no ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AVh\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
