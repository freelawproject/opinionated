Meskill, United States Circuit Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b236-5\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Plaintiff-appellant TVN Entertainment, Inc. (TVN) appeals from a district court order granting defendant-appellee General Star Indemnity\u2019s (General Star\u2019s) motion for summary judgment. We agree with the district court and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">General Star issued TVN an employment practices liability insurance policy (Policy) that provided coverage for losses TVN suffered because of \u201cwrongful employment acts\u201d such as discrimination, defamation, harassment and breach of an implied employment contract. The Policy excluded from coverage (1) \u201cdamages determined to be owing under a written or express contract of employment\u201d and (2) losses in the form of \u201ccommissions, bonuses, profit sharing or benefits pursuant to a contract of employment.\u201d While the Policy was in effect, TVN terminated one of its employees, Michael Wex (Wex), who responded by taking TVN to arbitration. In the arbitrator\u2019s final award, he ruled TVN had \u201cmaterially breached the express and implied terms of [Wex\u2019s] Employment Agreement and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing\u201d and concluded that Wex was entitled to $13,218,588.63 in damages \u201cproximately caused by [TVN\u2019s] breach of the Employment Agreement.\u201d When General Star refused to indemnify TVN for Wex\u2019s arbitration award, TVN brought this action alleging, among other things, that General Star had failed to fulfill its obligations under the Policy. In response, General Star filed a counterclaim seeking a determination that it had no duty to indemnify TVN in the underlying arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">On appeal, TVN argues that the Policy\u2019s exclusionary clauses are unclear and inconsistent with coverage provisions found elsewhere in the Policy. It maintains that these ambiguities and inconsistencies should be construed in its favor as the insured. <em>See Cont\u2019l Cas. Co. v. City of Richmond, </em>763 F.2d 1076, 1079 (9th 1985) (noting that exceptions to performance \u201cmust be clearly stated to apprise insured of [their] effect\u201d). General Star counters that TVN\u2019s arguments ignore the objectively reasonable interpretation of the Policy\u2019s plain language. Like the district court, we agree with General Star and find TVN\u2019s contention unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">The Policy expressly states that it does not cover \u201cLoss\u201d in the form of \u201ccommissions, bonuses, profit sharing, or benefits pursuant to a contract of employment.\u201d Where, as here, the policy language \u201cis clear and explicit, it governs.\u201d <em>Bank of the West v. Superior Court, </em>2 Cal.4th 1254, 1264, 10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545 (1992). We conclude that Wex\u2019s stock options, which were granted to Wex through his employment agreement in a paragraph separate from that describing his annual salary, come within the Policy\u2019s exclusionary language. <em>See In re Marriage of Hug, </em>154 Cal.App.3d 780, 785, 201 Cal.Rptr. 676 (1984) (noting that, in certain instances, \u201cstock options fall into the same category as ... fringe benefits ... and profit-sharing arrangements\u201d); <em>Webster\u2019s New World College Dictionary </em>568 (4th ed. 2000) (defining \u201cfringe benefit\u201d as \u201cany form of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>employee compensation provided <em>in addition </em>to wages or base salary, such as a pension, insurance, coverage, vacation time (emphasis added); <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>(4th ed. 2000) (defining \u201cbonus\u201d as \u201c[a] sum of money or an equivalent given to an employee <em>in addition </em>to the employee\u2019s compensation\u201d) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Similarly, the Policy language excluding coverage for \u201cdamages determined to be owing under a written or express contract of employment,\u201d viewed in the context of the policy as a whole, also is unambiguous. <em>See Bank of the West, </em>2 Cal.4th at 1265, 10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545. Although the arbitrator amended his final award (at TVN\u2019s request) to reflect a breach of the covenant of good faith, he did not alter any of his factual findings. In determining the amount of award Wex would receive, the arbitrator ruled that Wex was entitled to \u201cdamages proximately caused by [TVN\u2019s] breach of the Employment Agreement.\u201d The award, consequently, tied Wex\u2019s damages to the different forms of compensation provided for under Wex\u2019s express written contract. As such, the award falls squarely within the Policy\u2019s unambiguous language excluding indemnity for damages \u201cowing under a written or express contract of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b236-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b237-9\">. Because we recognize that the categorization of stock options requires \u201creference to the facts of each particular case [in order] to reveal the features and implications of a particular employee stock option,\" 154 Cal. App.3d at 784, 201 Cal.Rptr. 676; <em>accord Oracle Corp. v. Falotti, </em>187 F.Supp.2d 1184, 1200 (N.D.Cal.2001), <em>offd on different grounds, </em>319 F.3d 1106 (9th Cir.2003), we take no general position on the classification of stock options as benefits versus compensation. We only hold that they were unambiguously excluded from the Policy at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b237-7\">Judge BERZON,</author>\n<p id=\"AUP\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">I respectfully dissent. Although General Star argues that the policy excludes damages caused by any breach of an employment contract, the policy nowhere so states.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">The relevant exclusion states: Inappropriate Employment Decision shall not include damages determined to be owing under a written or express contract of employment or obligation to make payments, including but not limited to severance payments, in the event of the termination of employment, however, this provision does not apply to defense costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">The sentence is ambiguous. First, it is not grammatical: It attempts to delineate certain types of \u201cdecisions\u201d by reference to certain types of \u201cdamages.\u201d More importantly, it is unclear whether the modifying phrase \u201cto make payments ... in the event of the termination of employment\u201d modifies only the term \u201cobligation\u201d or modifies both the term \u201cobligation\u201d and the term \u201ccontract of employment.\u201d If the latter was intended, then the exclusion relating to express contracts is limited to \u201cdamages determined to be owing under a written or express contract of employment ... in the event of the termination of employment.\u201d As such, the exclusion pertains only to contract provisions specifically targeted at payments made \u201cin the event of termination\u201d \u2014 that is, severance pay, liquidated damages, golden parachute payments, and the like. Because the pertinence of the modifying phrase is at least ambiguous, the exception must be construed against General Star. <em>Consol. Am. Ins. Co. v. Mike Soper Marine Servs., </em>951 F.2d 186, 188 (9th Cir.1991) (\u201cWhile a court is prohibited from adopting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>strained or absurd interpretation in order to create an ambiguity, if ambiguity or uncertainty does exist, it must be resolved against the insurer.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">I agree, however, that Wex\u2019s stock options come within the policy\u2019s exclusionary language. Although I do not believe that stock options are properly categorized as \u201cbenefits,\u201d stock options are a form of \u201cprofit sharing\u201d and therefore excluded from the Policy\u2019s definition of \u201cLoss.\u201d I would therefore hold that General Star must indemnify TVN only for that portion of the arbitration award which did not relate to stock options.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
