Eight days later, Lathern was arrested for being a felon in possession of a weapon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Lathern pleaded guilty to violating his probations and to the third state drug charge. A state court revoked Lathern\u2019s two probations, did not grant him probation on the third drug charge, and sentenced him to serve all three state drug sentences concurrently. Lathern was later indicted for the federal weapons violation and he pleaded guilty. The district court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> sentenced Lathern to 57 months in prison and ordered Lathern to serve the sentence for the weapons violation consecutively to the two probation-related state drug sentences and concurrently with the third drug sentence. Lathern appeals his sentence, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-25\">Lathern contends the district court misapplied U.S. Sentencing Guideline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>\u00a7 5G1.3 because his sentence for the weapons violation should run concurrently with-rather than consecutively to-his first two state sentences. We disagree. Having reviewed the district court\u2019s application of this guideline provision de novo, <em>United States v. Smith, </em>282 F.3d 1045, 1046 (8th Cir.2002), we agree with the district court and the parties that Lathern\u2019s sentence is governed by \u00a7 5G1.3(e) rather than \u00a7 5G1.3(a) or (b). We also agree with the district court that its sentencing discretion was clearly narrowed by application note six to \u00a7 5G1.3. As interpreted by this Court, note six obligated the district court to impose a sentence consecutive to Lathern\u2019s undischarged terms of imprisonment for his two state probation revocation sentences. <em>Smith, </em>282 F.3d at 1048; <em>United States v. Goldman, </em>228 F.3d 942, 944 (8th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>160 F.3d 509, 510-11 (8th Cir.1998) (per curiam). Although Lathern concedes this is the law of our circuit, he asks the panel to reconsider the construction given note six by earlier panels that mandates the federal sentence must run consecutively to the terms imposed for the probation violations. This we decline to do because \u201c[o]ne panel may not overrule another.\u201d <em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>116 F.3d 328, 329 (8th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Additionally, Lathern contends that application note five to \u00a7 5G1.3 trumps note six and gives the district court complete sentencing discretion. Again, we disagree. First, our holding in <em>Smith </em>makes clear that the discretionary language of \u00a7 5G1.3(c) and note five does not apply to the prison terms imposed for probation violations. Second, as we have discussed above, Lathern\u2019s federal sentence must run consecutively to the undischarged terms of his state probation revocation sentences. Third, because Lathern\u2019s third state sentence was a straight sentence and not a probation revocation, the district court properly exercised its discretion and ordered that Lathern\u2019s federal sentence run concurrently with his third state sentence. Even if we conducted the review sought by Lathern, though, our result would be the same. In keeping with the underlying purpose of \u00a7 5G1.3, <em>see Witte v. United States, </em>515 U.S. 389, 404, 115 S.Ct. 2199, 132 L.Ed.2d 351 (1995), Lathern\u2019s partially consecutive and partially concurrent sentence \u201capproximate[s] the total penalty that would have been imposed had the sentences ... been imposed at the same time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consistent with our holding in <em>Smith, </em>we believe the district court properly used \u00a7 5G1.3(c)\u2019s flexibility to impose a sentence that, first, achieved a reasonable punishment for the federal offense, second, provided an incremental penalty for Lathern\u2019s state probation violations, and third, avoided duplicative punishment by running the federal sentence concurrently with the state sentence on Lathern\u2019s third drug charge. We thus affirm Lathern\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b191-18\"> The Honorable E.
