We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U. S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s application of the abuse of discretion standard and its conclusion that a plan fiduciary has not abused its discretion. <em>See Lang v. Long-Term Disability Plan of Sponsor Applied Remote Tech., </em>125 F.3d 794, 797 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"AGQ\">Upon review of the record, we conclude that the district court properly determined that defendant did not abuse its discretion by terminating Fields\u2019 benefits, <em>see Atwood v. Newmont Gold Co., Inc., </em>45 F.3d 1317, 1323-25 (9th Cir.1995), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-20\">Fields failed to establish that the administrator operated under a conflict of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>interest because she did not provide \u201cmaterial, probative evidence\u201d that the fiduciary\u2019s self interest caused a breach of the administrator\u2019s fiduciary obligation to the beneficiary. <em>See Lang, </em>125 F.3d at 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">Substantial evidence supports the administrator\u2019s decision to reject the opinions of Fields\u2019 treating physicians based on the contrary determinations of examining physicians and because the treating physicians\u2019 opinions were \u201cbrief [and] eonclusory,\u201d <em>see Thomas v. Barnhart, </em>278 F.3d 947, 957 (9th Cir.2002), and lacked objective clinical findings, <em>see Tonapetyan v. Halter, </em>242 F.3d 1144,1149 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">We deny Fields\u2019 outstanding motion for an extension of time to file additional citations.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">Fields\u2019 remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b970-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
