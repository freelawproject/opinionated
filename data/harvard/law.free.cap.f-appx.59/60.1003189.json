Sargus, Jr., United States District Judge for the Southern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b85-10\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">James Beal appeals his judgment of conviction and sentence. The parties have expressly waived oral argument, and this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">In May 2001, Beal pleaded guilty to four counts of assaulting federal employees in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(a)(1). The district court concluded that Beal\u2019s conduct significantly disrupted a government function (USSG \u00a7 5K2.7) and that his conduct was unusually degrading to his victims (USSG \u00a7 5K2.8), and it departed upward from the recommended guidelines range by one level under each section. The court sentenced Beal to a total of sixteen months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">Beal has filed a timely appeal, arguing that his actions did not warrant an upward departure for \u201cunusually degrading\u201d conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-15\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly concluded that Beal\u2019s actions warranted a departure for unusually degrading conduct. Courts of appeal review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision to depart upward from the applicable sentencing guideline range. <em>See Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 82, 116 S.Ct. 2035,135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996); <em>United States v. Cross, </em>121 F.3d 234, 238 (6th Cir.1997). Section 5K2.8 of the guidelines provides, in pertinent part, that an upward departure may be appropriate if the offense conduct was \u201cunusually heinous, cruel, brutal, or degrading to the victim.... \u201d Examples of such conduct include \u201ctorture of a victim, gratuitous infliction of injury, or prolonging of pain or humiliation.\u201d <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 5K2.8. However, the plain language of \u00a7 5K2.8 makes clear that conduct may be extreme even if it is not a guideline example. <em>See United States v. Paster, </em>173 F.3d 206, 217-18 (3rd Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-16\">Beal\u2019s decision to throw feces on his victims warranted a one-point upward departure for unusually degrading conduct towards his victims. After being fired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>from the Post Office, Beal doused four female employees with a liquid mixture containing animal feces, worms, bacteria, amoeba, and other parasites. The women\u2019s clothes were saturated with the mixture, and it also made contact with their skin. Prior to dousing the women with the mixture, Beal stated, \u201cIf they\u2019re gonna shit on me, I\u2019ll shit on them.\u201d Beal also admitted that he did not view the victims as women, but as \u201curchins\u201d who \u201cdeserved\u201d what he did to them. The district court properly concluded that this conduct is consistent with conduct in other cases upholding upward departures for 'urinating on carjacking victims and verbally badgering and insulting telemarketing agents. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Singleton, </em>49 F.3d 129,133 (5th Cir.1995) (court concluded that urinating on carjacking victims was unusually degrading); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>170 F.3d 617, 623 (6th Cir.1999) (court concluded that verbally badgering and insulting telemarketing agents was unusually degrading).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">The district court\u2019s decision to depart upward is also supported by the victims\u2019 testimony concerning Beal\u2019s attack. One victim (Raz) described Beal\u2019s attack as \u201cvicious\u201d and \u201cdespicable.\u201d She stated that it was horrifying \u201cbeyond description.\u201d Another victim (Lehmann) testified that, after Beal threw feces on the victims, they had to wait for the authorities to arrive without being able to clean themselves or to change their clothing. She stated that the experience was \u201cabsolutely revolting and disgusting,\u201d and that she would be disturbed by the attack for many years to come. These statements clearly reflect the humiliating nature of the attack, and support the district court\u2019s conclusion that Beal\u2019s conduct was unusually degrading towards his victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Nonetheless, even if we were to conclude that the district court erred when it departed upward, the error was harmless because Beal\u2019s sentence would have been the same even without the \u00a7 5K2.8 departure. <em>See Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992). In this case, the district court departed based both on \u00a7 5K2.7 and \u00a7 5K2.8. Reliance upon only the \u00a7 5K2.7 departure would have placed Beal\u2019s offense level at 12, and reliance upon both departures would have placed Beal\u2019s offense level at 13. Beal\u2019s sentence of 16 months falls within the range of both an offense level of 12 (10-16 months) and an offense level of 13 (12-18 months). Moreover, the district court made it clear that based on the nature of the offense and Beal\u2019s clear lack of remorse that it intended to sentence Beal at the high end of his sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
