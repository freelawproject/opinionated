The BIA agreed with the decision of the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), concluding that Berhie \u201chas failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear or clear probability of persecution in Ethiopia based on one of the five protected statutory grounds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">We grant Berhie\u2019s petition for review in part, on the ground that the BIA erroneously denied her claim of past persecution. We conclude \u201cthat the evidence presented was so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could fail to find\u201d past persecution. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). It is significant that the IJ determined that Berhie was credible. Berhie was a victim of violence. In her family\u2019s home, she witnessed her brother\u2019s killing and her sister\u2019s abduction. Based upon this evidence and the remainder of the record, Berhie established that her past persecution was on account of her membership in a particular social group, her family. <em>See Mgoian v. INS, </em>184 F.3d 1029, 1036 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Because we do not reach the other issues raised on appeal, we remand to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this disposition. We observe, however, that the IJ\u2019s assessment of Berhie\u2019s fear of future persecution, stating that, \u201c[it] seems clear that if the former government under Mengustu wanted to harm or persecute [petitioner], they had ample opportunity to do that when they entered the [petitioner\u2019s] home in 1975 and killed her brother,\u201d improperly relies on \u201cpersonal conjecture and speculation, which we have stressed is no \u2018substitute for substantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maini v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 1167, 1173 (9th Cir.2000) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">PETITION GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART, AND REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b249-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
