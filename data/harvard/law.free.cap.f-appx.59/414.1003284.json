(\u201cIVT\u201d) on Corporate Plaza\u2019s breach of contract claim. The District Court held that Corporate Plaza\u2019s claim was barred because its retention of a payment made by IVT after this suit was filed constituted an accord and satisfaction. The court also denied Corporate Plaza\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">We find no error in the District Court\u2019s conclusion that IVT\u2019s tender and Corporate Plaza\u2019s retention of a check marked payment for \u201call of IVT\u2019s debts to Corporate Plaza\u201d was a valid accord and satisfaction under New Jersey law, as the parties manifested an offer and acceptance of a settlement in discharge of Corporate Plaza\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">On appeal, Corporate Plaza argues, for the first time in this litigation, that no valid accord and satisfaction occurred because the amount IVT paid was for a liquidated debt under the parties\u2019 Termination Agreement. We will not ordinarily consider an argument raised for the first time on appeal absent \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d or \u201cwhere the issue is purely legal and there is no need for additional fact-finding.\u201d <em>Coogan v. Smyers, </em>134 F.3d 479, 486-87 (2d Cir.1998). Whether or not a debt is disputed typically entails a factual inquiry. Although the parties acknowledged in the proceedings below that they disputed the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees sought, only on appeal does Corporate Plaza argue that the attorneys\u2019 fees constituted a debt separate from the liquidated amounts owed under the Termination Agreement. Even were we to consider Corporate Plaza\u2019s belated argument, we note that the amounts sought, including interest and attorneys\u2019 fees, were pursuant to provisions contained in the parties\u2019 Termination Agreement, a debt that Corporate Plaza\u2019s complaint treated as one claim. Generally, where a debt is disputed in part, tender of an undisputed portion can constitute sufficient consideration for the discharge of the entire debt. <em>See In re Glickfeld, </em>136 F.Supp. 276, 281 (D.N.J. 1955); <em>see also </em>7 N.J. Pl. <em>&amp; </em>Pr. Forms \u00a7 56:1; <em>Cohen v. Sabin, </em>452 Pa. 447, 307 A.2d 845, 849 (1973) (citing Williston on Contracts \u00a7 129 (3d ed. 1957)); <em>Corpus Juris Secundum, </em>Accord and Satisfaction \u00a7 44 (\u201c[A]n accord and satisfaction is no less valid merely because the amount paid and accepted is only that which the debtor concedes to be due____\u201d). Although there is some case law that indicates to the contrary, <em>see, e.g., Loizeaux Builders Supply Co. v. Donald B. Ludwig Co., </em>144 NJ.Super. 556, 366 A.2d 721, 726 (1976) (distinguishing <em>Glickfeld), </em>the potential applicability of this case law was never presented to the district court. Therefore, we decline to address the merits of this argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-14\">We have examined all of Corporate Plaza\u2019s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit. For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
