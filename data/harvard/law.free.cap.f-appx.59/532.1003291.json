Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Following a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 hearing, the district court accepted Barfield\u2019s guilty plea, entered without a plea agreement, on January 22, 2002. On June 17, 2002, Barfield filed a pro se motion to withdraw his guilty plea, which the district court denied. After considering Barfield\u2019s objections to the drug quantities attributed to him and the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice recommended in the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d), the district court adopted the findings in the PSR and sentenced Barfield to a term of life imprisonment plus sixty months, to be followed by a five-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Barfield contends that his conspiracy conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 was improper because no factual basis existed for his plea to this offense. We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s determination that a factual basis exists for a guilty plea. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>104 F.3d 649, 652 (4th Cir.1997). A reading of the charges in the indictment, along with the defendant\u2019s admission of the acts described, is generally sufficient to provide a factual basis for the plea. <em>United States v. McFadden, </em>238 F.3d 198, 200 (2d Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">Barfield argues that the reading of the indictment was insufficient to provide a factual basis for his guilty plea because the type of conduct and its likely penalty could not be ascertained from the indictment. This argument is without merit. The information in the indictment sufficiently sets out the elements of the offense. The court read the charges from count one of the indictment and explained what the Government would have to prove. Bar-field stated that he understood the charges and the minimum and maximum penalties and admitted that he committed the conspiracy offense. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding a sufficient factual basis for Barfield\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">Barfield next contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Ubakanma, </em>215 F.3d 421, 424 (4th Cir.2000). A defendant does not have an absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991). Rather, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d supports his request to withdraw his plea. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">We have reviewed the record and conclude that Barfield has not met his burden of demonstrating a fair and just reason for withdrawing his guilty plea. The reasons Barfield provides for withdrawing his guilty plea concern sentencing issues and do not relate to whether his plea was knowing and voluntary or whether he was in fact guilty. Barfield never asserted that he was innocent of the of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>fenses charged in the indictment, but instead, merely denied responsibility for some of the drug quantities attributed to him for sentencing purposes. This is insufficient to call into question the validity of the guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Barfield further contends that the district court\u2019s determination of the drug quantities attributable to him as relevant conduct was clearly erroneous. The district court\u2019s determination of the drug quantity attributable to a defendant is a factual finding reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Randall, </em>171 F.3d 195, 210 (4th Cir.1999). In determining drug quantity, a district court must consider whether the government has established drug quantity by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Cook, </em>76 F.3d 596, 604 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Barfield argues that the district court relied on statements by witnesses who were not credible because they were drug users and dealers and that some of the information they provided could not be corroborated. However, the credibility of a witness is a matter within the discretion of the fact finder and is generally not subject to appellate review. <em>United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989); <em>see generally United States v. Rose, </em>12 F.3d 1414, 1425 (7th Cir.1994). Thus, the district court did not err in its determination of the drug quantity involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Finally, Barfield contends that the district court erred in applying a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice. A two-level sentencing enhancement is allowed when a defendant willfully obstructs or impedes the administration of justice during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of an offense. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 (2000). The district court\u2019s factual findings concerning sentencing factors are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. France, </em>164 F.3d 203, 209 (4th Cir.1998). Its legal determinations are reviewed de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">The PSR recommended a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice because Barfield attempted to procure items to escape from custody, sent a threatening letter to a potential witness, and feigned mental illness to prevent prosecution of the charged offenses. Obstruction of justice includes \u201cescaping or attempting to escape from custody before trial or sentencing.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3C1.1, cmt. n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">Barfield maintains that he was not trying to escape but merely trying to get cigarettes and chewing tobacco into the jail. In addition, he claims that he did not write the letter that the PSR described as threatening. Finally, Barfield maintains that he was not feigning mental illness because a prior mental health evaluation conducted in connection with a state charge resulted in a finding of personality disorders similar to personality disorders found by the evaluators during his competency evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">We conclude that the district court did not err in applying a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice. The Government presented three taped telephone conversations and four letters from Barfield to a friend made while Barfield was incarcerated that constituted credible evidence that Barfield was attempting to escape from custody. Because the attempted escape provides a sufficient basis for a finding of obstruction of justice, we find it unnecessary to review Barfield\u2019s arguments regarding threatening a witness and feigning mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">Accordingly, we affirm Barfield\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"AQz\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
