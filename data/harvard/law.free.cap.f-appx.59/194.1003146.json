Leyvas\u2019s hypertension, migraine headaches and dizziness, and his accusations that appointed counsel was conspiring against him, did not give the court reason to doubt his competency, and thus did not require a hearing. <em>See Godinez v. Moran, </em>509 U.S. 389, 401 n. 13, 113 S.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-16\">The court reasonably determined that Leyvas\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel was unequivocal. The court asked Leyvas whether he wanted to represent himself, and he responded, \u201cYeah. I\u2019ll represent myself.\u201d The court then listed the benefits Leyvas was foregoing and asked if he understood, to which he responded, \u201cI most certainly do.\u201d Finally, the court asked whether he thought he could perform as counsel, and he said, \u2018Tes, ma\u2019am, I do.\u201d Leyvas\u2019s subsequent refusal to waive his right to bring ineffective assistance claims does not render his waiver of counsel equivocal. His remark that he did not want to \u201cgive up any of [his] rights\u201d does not render his waiver of counsel equivocal, because it was also consistent with his invocation of the right to self-representation. <em>See Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>The state court did not unreasonably apply Supreme Court law by failing to inform Leyvas of the sentence he faced. No Supreme Court decision requires the court to impart that information. The court must ensure the defendant is aware of the \u201cdangers and disadvantages of self-representation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 835, but this requirement does not clearly extend to information about potential penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Nor did the court unreasonably apply Supreme Court law by failing to inform Leyvas that he would not have the assistance of a competent investigator who could subpoena witnesses for him. Because the court specifically told Leyvas he would have to subpoena witnesses himself, a further warning that an investigator would not do so for him would have been redundant.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b219-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
