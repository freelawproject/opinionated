Garvey, </em>532 U.S. 504, 509, 121 S.Ct. 1724, 149 L.Ed.2d 740 (2001). \u201cCourts are not authorized to review the arbitrator\u2019s decision on the merits despite allegations that the decision rests on factual errors or misinterprets the parties\u2019 agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If an \u201c \u2018arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority,\u2019 the fact that \u2018a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v. United Mine Workers, Dist. 17, </em>531 U.S. 57, 62, 121 S.Ct. 462, 148 L.Ed.2d 354 (2000) (citation omitted). \u201cIt is only when the arbitrator strays from interpretation and application of the agreement and effectively \u2018dispense^] his own brand of industrial justice\u2019 that his decision may be unenforceable.\u201d <em>Garvey, </em>532 U.S. at 509 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-16\">Smurfit\u2019s petition fails because the arbitrator was \u201carguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority.\u201d <em>Eastern Associated Coal Corp., </em>531 U.S. at 62. The arbitrator expressly applied Section 39 of the CBA in awarding benefits. His conclusion that Smurfit\u2019s sale of the Newberg Mill to an unrelated company was a permanent closure of the Mill by Smurfit was a construction and application of the CBA within the scope of the arbitrator\u2019s authority and we have no occasion to decide whether it was correct or erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-17\">Smurfit\u2019s reliance on the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Beer, Soft Drink Local Union No. </em>744, 280 F.3d 1133 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 123 S.Ct. 119, 154 L.Ed.2d 144 (2002), is unpersuasive. Here, unlike <em>Anheuser-Busch, </em>the arbitrator did not disregard an unambiguous provision of the CBA. No language in the CBA prohibits the arbitrator from concluding that Smur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>fit\u2019s sale of the Mill constitutes Smurfit\u2019s permanent closure of the Mill. Smurfit is simply complaining about the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the CBA. Such a complaint is not a valid ground for vacating the arbitrator\u2019s decision. <em>See Garvey, 532 </em>U.S. at 509 (stating that \u201ccourts ... have no business weighing the merits of the grievance [or] considering whether there is equity in a particular claim\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\"><em>Pennsylvania Power Co. v. Local Union No. 272, </em>276 F.3d 174 (3d Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>536 U.S. 959, 122 S.Ct. 2663, 153 L.Ed.2d 838 (2002), is similarly distinguishable. While the arbitrator\u2019s decision in <em>Pennsylvania Power </em>was arguably not based on any provision of the contract, the arbitrator\u2019s decision here was based on his interpretation of a specific provision of the CBA: namely, the provision requiring the payment of severance benefits in the event Smurfit closed the Mill.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b232-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
