We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Carneses<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the claim for negligent misrepresentation. The Zamanis have failed to demonstrate that the Carneses made a \u201cpositive assertion\u201d that there was no asbestos in the building. <em>See Wilson v. Century 21 Great </em>W. <em>Realty, </em>15 CalApp. 4th 298, 306, 18 Cal.Rptr.2d 779 (1993). \u201cAn \u2018implied\u2019 assertion or representation is not enough.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-19\">In <em>Wilson, </em>the California Court of Appeal squarely held that when a seller checks the \u201cno\u201d box on a real estate disclosure form when answering \u201care you aware\u201d questions, the seller has not made a positive assertion about the actual existence of the condition. <em>Id. </em>at 306-07, 18 Cal.Rptr.2d 779. The fact that Gene Carnes answered \u201cUNK\u201d and \u201cN/A,\u201d as well as \u201cno,\u201d in various places on the disclosure form does not lead to a different conclusion than that in <em>Wilson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-20\">2. We also affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the breach of contract claim. The Zamanis point to the provision of the purchase agreement that states that \u201cBuyer requests of Seller to Disclose any information known to him adverse or friendly.\u201d This phrase does not obligate the seller in any way \u2014 it is simply a request from the buyer. Even if it did obligate the seller to disclose any information, the information would have to be \u201cknown\u201d to the seller. Because the Zamanis have presented no evidence that the Carneses knew about the asbestos, there is no breach of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-21\">The Zamanis also contend that the Carneses breached the contract by violating the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. This argument fails because the Zamanis have not shown that the Carneses either knew about the asbestos or negligently misrepresented that they knew there was no asbestos.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-22\">3. Finally, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of declaratory relief to the Carneses. Given the \u201cAs Is\u201d clause, the Carneses are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>not liable for the cost of asbestos remediation on the property. <em>See Loughrin v. Superior Court, </em>15 Cal.App.4th 1188, 1192, 19 Cal.Rptr.2d 161 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b244-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-24\">.
