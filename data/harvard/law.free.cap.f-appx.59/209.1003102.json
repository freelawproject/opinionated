Martinez-Vargas pleaded guilty to illegally re-entering the United States after deportation, a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). At the time of sentencing on the federal charge, Martinez-Vargas was serving a state sentence for violating his state probation on an unrelated charge by illegally re-entering the United States. The district court, relying on United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5G1.3(a), held that it was mandated to impose Martinez-Vargas\u2019s federal sentence consecutively to his state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>282 F.3d 1228, 1230 (9th Cir.2002). The district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to the facts of a case is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Antonakeas, </em>255 F.3d 714, 727 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">The district court erred when it held that \u00a7 5G1.3(a) applies to Martinez-Vargas. Section 5G1.3(a) applies only \u201cIf the instant offense was committed while the defendant was serving a term of imprisonment (including work release, furlough, or escape status).\u201d Martinez-Vargas illegally re-entered the United States while on state probation. Probation does not constitute a \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d under \u00a7 5G1.3(a). <em>See United States v. Bernard, </em>48 F.3d 427, 431 (9th Cir.1995). The government conceded in its brief and at oral argument that \u00a7 5G1.3(a) does not apply to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">The government defends the district court\u2019s analysis by suggesting that\u2014 even though subsection (a) does not apply \u2014 the district court has discretion under subsection (c) to issue consecutive or concurrent sentences and argues that the district court properly exercised that discretion here. Assuming that the district court <em>did </em>have discretion under subsection (c) to impose Martinez-Vargas\u2019s sentence either consecutively or concurrently, then the operative question is whether the district court recognized that it had this discretion. The district court expressly stated that it was <em>without discretion </em>and was required to impose the sentence consecutively. Although this statement concerned subsection (a), the district court obviously erred by assuming that it was without discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">Martinez-Vargas also argues that the district court erred by refusing to apply \u00a7 5G1.3(b). That subsection provides for concurrent sentences if \u201cthe undischarged term of imprisonment resulted from offense(s) that have been fully taken into account in the determination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>offense level.\u201d The district court never considered this argument, basing its analysis on the incorrect view that \u00a7 5G1.3(a) applied to Martinez-Vargas. As such, we remand this case for resentencing and allow the district court a chance to consider whether \u00a7 5G1.3(b) applies, and, if it does not, whether the district court should \u2014 in its discretion \u2014 sentence Martinez-Vargas to consecutive or concurrent terms pursuant to subsection (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Finally, Martinez-Vargas offers an <em>Apprendi-based </em>argument. Our decision in <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 414 (9th Cir.2000) (as amended), <em>cert. denied </em>532 U.S. 966, 121 S.Ct. 1503, 149 L.Ed.2d 388 (2001), forecloses that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">We VACATE Martinez-Vargas\u2019s sentence and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b234-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
