We address two of their appellate claims in a separate opinion published today, and we address the remaining issues in this summary order.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-20\">1. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel: </em>We review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel <em>de novo. See United States v. Finley, </em>245 F.3d 199, 204 (2d Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1144, 122 S.Ct. 1101, 151 L.Ed.2d 997 (2002). A defendant must show that (1) his \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance was deficient\u201d in that it \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe deficient performance prejudiced the defense,\u201d meaning \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>professional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 694,104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Where, as here, \u201cdefense counsel\u2019s failure to litigate a Fourth Amendment claim competently is the principal allegation of ineffectiveness,\u201d the defendant must demonstrate \u201cthat his Fourth Amendment claim is meritorious and that there is a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been different absent the excludable evidence.\u201d <em>Kimmelman v. Morrison, </em>477 U.S. 365, 375, 106 S.Ct. 2574, 91 L.Ed.2d 305 (1986). \u201cFailure to make the required showing of either deficient performance or sufficient prejudice defeats the ineffectiveness claim.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Clinton Cox cannot establish actual prejudice resulting from his counsel\u2019s failure to seek suppression of the drugs seized on October 9, 1999. First, Cox\u2019s claim that the 397 grams of cocaine base increased his sentence is irrelevant. \u201cAbsent a showing that officers obtained evidence expressly to enhance a sentence, a district judge may not refuse to consider relevant evidence at sentencing, even if that evidence has been seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>United States v. Tejada, </em>956 F.2d 1256, 1263 (2d Cir.1992); <em>see also Kimmelman v. Morrison, </em>477 U.S. 365, 375, 106 S.Ct. 2574, 91 L.Ed.2d 305 (1986) (defining actual prejudice as \u201ca reasonable probability that the <em>verdict </em>would have been different absent the excludable evidence\u201d) (emphasis added). Moreover, even without the 397 grams, Cox fell within the highest sentencing category of 1.5 or more kilograms. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(c). <em>(See also </em>Sentencing Tr., dated Sept. 12, 2001, at 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Second, Clinton Cox argues that exclusion of the drugs would have affected the verdict because \u201cthe only other evidence against [him] was in the form of circumstantial evidence.\u201d (Clinton Cox\u2019s Br. at 24.) But circumstantial evidence is as powerful as any other kind. There is no reasonable probability that exclusion of the drugs seized on October 9, 1999 would have resulted in a different verdict on any of the counts of conviction. <em>See Kimmelman, </em>477 U.S. at 375. The government argues that we may rely, among other things, on the testimony of the car\u2019s driver. (Appellee\u2019s Br. at 35.) That testimony generally supports the conviction, but we need not place reliance on it because no count charged Clinton Cox with possession of the drugs seized from the car on that day. <em>(See </em>Superseding Indictment, dated Aug. 2, 2000.) The verdict was supported independently by ample testimony about, and evidence of, his other drug activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Because there is no prejudice, we need not consider the merits of Clinton Cox\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim or the reasonableness of his counsel\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">2. <em>Date Charged in Indictment: </em>As to the motion by Jason Cox for acquittal based on the date charged in the indictment for counts thirteen and fourteen, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Cox possessed cocaine base and used a firearm \u201c[o]n or about June 20, 1998.\u201d \u201cWhere \u2018on or about\u2019 language is used, the government is not required to prove the exact date, if a date reasonably near is established.\u201d <em>United States v. Nersesian, </em>824 F.2d 1294, 1323 (2d Cir.1987). Marazita testified that he gave Cox his gun \u201c[s]ometime in the summer of \u201998\u201d as collateral for the price of the drugs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>(See </em>Tr. of Jury Trial, dated Jan. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>17, 2001, at 90-91; Tr. of Jury Trial, dated Jan. 18, 2001, at 127-28.) The government introduced pawn shop transaction records to show that Marazita possessed the gun on June 19, 1998. Even if the drug transaction took place later that summer, there was no material variance from the indictment. <em>See Nersesian, </em>824 F.2d at 1323 (\u201c[T]he government\u2019s argument that the date of the actual transaction was possibly July or early August was not an improper material variance from the \u2018on or about June 1984\u2019 date charged in the indictment.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Teague, </em>93 F.3d 81, 83 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Moreover, Jason Cox has failed to establish that the asserted variance caused the requisite prejudice. <em>See Nersesian, </em>824 F.2d at 1323. Like the defendant in <em>Nersesian, </em>Cox claimed that the variance prevented him from preparing an adequate defense; however, Cox had the opportunity to cross-examine the relevant witness and present evidence on the time period in question. <em>Id. </em>No argument is made that some different or superior defense would have been mounted if the defendant had been advised more particularly as to the date of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">3. <em>Admissibility and Sufficiency of June 12 Evidence: </em>The district court declined to exclude evidence as a sanction for destruction of the drugs seized on June 12, 1998. <em>See United States v. Patterson, </em>292 F.3d 615, 626 (9th Cir.2002); <em>cf. United States v. Han, </em>230 F.3d 560, 564 (2d Cir.2000) (\u201cDecisions to admit or exclude evidence are reviewed for abuse of discretion and are overturned only where arbitrary or irrational.\u201d). Jason Cox has neither alleged nor established that the government acted in bad faith in failing to preserve the substance. <em>See Arizona v. Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. 51, 58, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281 (1988) (\u201c[UJnless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of law.\u201d). As far as the record shows, state police destroyed the substance at the direction of a state court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>(See </em>Tr. of Jury Trial, dated Jan. 16, 2001, at 127-28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">Jason Cox also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence relating to the June 12 transaction. We view the evidence in its totality in the light most favorable to the government, drawing all inferences in the government\u2019s favor and deferring to the jury\u2019s assessment of credibility and weight. <em>See United States v. LaSpina, </em>299 F.3d 165, 180 (2d Cir.2002). \u201cA defendant may be convicted of narcotics possession if some evidence \u2014 direct, circumstantial, or otherwise \u2014 establishes the defendant\u2019s possession of the illegal substance.\u201d <em>United States v. Bryce, </em>208 F.3d 346, 353 (2d Cir.1999). Here, the government introduced photographs of six baggies containing a \u201cwhitish, rock-like\u201d substance; testimony by experienced undercover officers; and testimony about the result of a field test indicating the substance was in fact crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">4. <em>Double-Counting of Criminal History: </em>Jason Cox is correct that, as to a particular prior arrest, the district court erroneously assigned six criminal history points instead of three. This error was harmless, however, because the court assigned a total of eighteen criminal history points, five more than the thirteen re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>quired to place him in the highest category. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A, Sentencing Table. Subtracting three points for the double-counting of his prior arrest does not change his category. <em>See United States v. Defeo, </em>36 F.3d 272, 277 (2d Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">5. <em>Drug Quantity Calculation: </em>The defendants argue that the attribution to them of more than 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine was clear error. <em>See United States v. McLean, </em>287 F.3d 127, 133 (2d Cir.2002). Where, as here, \u201cthe quantity seized does not reflect the scale of the offense, the Guidelines require the district court to estimate the amount of drugs involved in the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Blount, </em>291 F.3d 201, 215 (2d Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 123 S.Ct. 938, 154 L.Ed.2d 838 (2003). The court has \u201cbroad discretion to consider all relevant information,\u201d <em>id., </em>so long as the quantity is based on \u201cspecific evidence,\u201d such as \u201cdrug records,\u201d \u201cadmissions,\u201d and \u201clive testimony\u201d about the defendant\u2019s transactions. <em>United States v. Shonubi, </em>103 F.3d 1085, 1089-90 (2d Cir.1997). The court made a conservative estimate based on (i) Willie Grant\u2019s testimony that he sold half-gram bags of crack for the defendants at a rate of $1500 per day on weekdays and $1500-$3500 per day on weekends for several months, plus (ii) the quantity seized on October 9, 1999. <em>(See </em>Sentencing Tr., dated May 17, 2001, at 26-28; Tr. of Jury Trial, dated Jan. 18, 2001, at 17-18, 36.) The court could (and did) decide to credit Grant\u2019s testimony, notwithstanding Cox\u2019s argument that Grant was not credible. <em>See Blount, </em>291 F.3d at 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">6. <em>Term of Supervised Release: </em>The district court sentenced defendants to ten years of supervised release. Although (as defendants point out) Section 5D1.2 provides for a term of supervised release of \u201cat least three years but not more than five years for a defendant convicted of a Class A or B felony,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.2(a)(l), \u201cthe term of supervised release imposed shall not be less than any statutorily required term.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.2(b). Under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), a defendant with a final \u201cprior conviction for a felony drug offense\u201d must receive \u201ca term of supervised release of at least 10 years.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). The government states in its brief \u2014 and Jason Cox does not dispute \u2014 that it filed notice of his prior felony drug conviction in accordance with the procedures set forth in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. At oral argument, both the government and defense counsel represented that the same was true for Clinton Cox.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">7. The remaining claims set forth in Jason Cox\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">For the reasons set forth above, as well as those stated in the separate opinion published today, the judgments of the district court are hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b463-6\">. Cox's argument that Marazita's testimony was \"inherently unbelievable,\u201d (Jason Cox\u2019s Br. at 35), is essentially a credibility argument. <em>See United States v. Roman, </em>870 F.2d 65, 71 (2d Cir.1989) (\u201c[W]e will not disturb the jury\u2019s findings with respect to the witnesses\u2019 credibility, for ... the proper place for a challenge to a witness\u2019s credibility is in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>cross-examination and in subsequent argument to the jury, not in an appellate brief.\u201d) (citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b464-8\">. Even if this argument is construed as a claim that Cox's conviction violated his Fifth Amendment due process rights and his Sixth Amendment right to confront the evidence against him, and is therefore reviewed <em>de novo, see Patterson, </em>292 F.3d at 626, it nonetheless fails for the reasons stated above.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
