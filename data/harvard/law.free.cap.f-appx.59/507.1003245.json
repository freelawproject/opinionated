We have jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-20\">Our review is limited to determining whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Fargnoli v. Massanari, </em>247 F.3d 34, 38 (3d Cir.2001). The factual findings of the Commissioner must be accepted as conclusive so long as they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 390, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201c \u2018more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fargnoli, </em>247 F.3d at 38 (quoting <em>Plummer v. Apfel, </em>186 F.3d 422, 427 (3d Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-21\">We have carefully considered Smith\u2019s arguments in this appeal and find that they lack merit. For the reasons substantially stated in the District Court\u2019s well-reasoned and thorough opinion, we find that substantial evidence supported the Commissioner\u2019s determination that Smith retained the residual functional capacity to perform light work and its decision to deny Smith disability insurance benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We therefore affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-16\">. On September 29, 2002, the District Court adopted Magistrate Judge Melinson\u2019s Report and Recommendation, which was filed on September 11, 2002. We therefore consider the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation to be the opinion of the District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
