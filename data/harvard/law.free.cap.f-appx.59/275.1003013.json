Pyeatt brings this 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 <em>pro se </em>appeal challenging the district court\u2019s dismissal of his motion to vacate sentence. Mr. Pyeatt alleges he was denied effective assistance of counsel at sentencing because his attorney was not licensed to practice law in the state in which he was sentenced. The district court, approving and adopting the findings and recommendation of a magistrate judge, dismissed Mr. Pyeatt\u2019s action with prejudice, finding it was untimely under \u00a7 2255. Mr. Pyeatt appeals. In reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Pyeatt\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, we examine the court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. United States v. Wiseman, </em>297 F.3d 975, 978 (10th Cir.2002). We deny Mr. Pyeatt\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability (COA), and dismiss his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-15\">In order to obtain a COA, Mr. Pyeatt must establish that \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-16\">Where a plain procedural bar is present and the district court is correct to invoke it to dispose of the case, a reasonable jurist could not conclude either that the district court erred in dismissing the petition or that the petitioner should be allowed to proceed further. In such a circumstance, no appeal [is] warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"A6v\"><em>Id. </em>Pursuant to <em>Slack, </em>Mr. Pyeatt\u2019s appeal fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-17\">Mr. Pyeatt was sentenced on December 16, 1996, for various drug and gun posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>sion offenses. Judgment imposing the sentence was entered on January 10, 1997. Mr. Pyeatt did not file any direct appeals challenging his sentence or the underlying conviction. However, on November 6, 2000, he filed a motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Actions initiated under \u00a7 2255 are subject to a one-year period of limitation. As relevant here, \u201c[t]he limitation period shall run from ... the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. In <em>United States v. Burch, </em>202 F.3d 1274 (10th Cir.2000), we examined when a judgment of conviction becomes final after a petitioner\u2019s direct appeal. We reasoned that a \u201cdecision of the court of appeals is subject to further review, and therefore not \u2018final\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 2255 until direct review has been completed.\u201d 202 F.3d at 1277 (quoting <em>Kapral v. United States, </em>166 F.3d 565, 571 (3d Cir.1999)). We concluded that \u201ca defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction was not final for purposes of the one-year limitation period in \u00a7 2255 until the time during which she could have filed a petition for writ of certiorari had expired.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Here, Mr. Pyeatt did not seek direct appeal of his sentence. Following our analysis in <em>Burch, </em>Mr. Pyeatt\u2019s judgment of conviction became final when his claim could no longer be subject to appellate review, which occurred on January 20, 1997, the date his opportunity to file a direct appeal expired. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A) (\u201cIn a criminal case, a defendant\u2019s notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within 10 days after the later of: (i) entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed; or (ii) the filing of the government\u2019s notice of appeal.\u201d). <em>See also Kapral, </em>166 F.3d at 577 (\u201cIf a defendant does not pursue a timely direct appeal to the court of appeals, his or her conviction and sentence become final, and the statute of limitation begins to run, on the date on which the time for filing such an appeal expired.\u201d). Pursuant to the one-year limitation period of \u00a7 2255, it is clear the district court correctly determined Mr. Pyeatt\u2019s claim was untimely. Mr. Pyeatt filed his \u00a7 2255 petition on November 6, 2000, nearly four years after his conviction and sentence became final, and well outside the one-year window provided by the statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Finally, based on our close review of the Mr. Pyeatt\u2019s brief and the entire record on appeal, we agree with the district court that Mr. Pyeatt failed to raise any allegations warranting the application of equitable tolling in this case. <em>See Gibson v. Klinger, </em>232 F.3d 799, 808 (10th Cir.2000) (equitable tolling of statute permitted in only rare and exceptional circumstances); <em>United States v. Willis, </em>202 F.3d 1279, 1281 n. 3 (10th Cir.2000) (case must present extraordinary circumstances to warrant equitable tolling of statute of limitations).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">Because reasonable jurists could not conclude the district court erred in dismissing Mr. Pyeatt\u2019s action as untimely, we DENY Mr. Pyeatt\u2019s application for a COA and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b300-13\"> After examining appellant\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, or collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-7\">. We note the magistrate judge calculated Mr. Pyeatt\u2019s action time barred on April 10, 1998 (one year after entry of his sentence, plus ninety days in which he could have filed a certiorari petition). <em>See </em>Sup.Ct. R. 13 (petition for writ of certiorari must be filed within ninety days after entry of judgment). Because Mr. Pyeatt did not directly appeal his sentence, however, the proper calculation of the final judgment date is based on the date on which time for filing a direct appeal expired.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
