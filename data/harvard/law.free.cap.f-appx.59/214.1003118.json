The Petitioners also seek review on the ground that the IJ conducted the hearing in a manner that violated their right to due process. Finally, the Petitioners request attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(b). For the reasons set forth, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Jurisdiction in this case falls under the transitional rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (1996) (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), because (1) immigration proceedings were initiated before IIRIRA\u2019s effective date of April 1, 1997 and (2) the BIA\u2019s final order of deportation was issued after October 30, 1996. <em>See Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Under IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rules, \u201cthere shall be no appeal of any discretionary decision under section 212(c), 212(h), 212(i), 244, or 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act [sections 1182(c), 1182(h), 1182(i), 1254, or 1255 of this title] as in effect as of the date of the enactment of this Act [Sept. 30, 1996].\u201d IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(E), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101 historical and statutory notes (1999) (brackets in original). <em>See also Kalaw, </em>133 F.3d at 1150-51. However, we have jurisdiction to determine whether jurisdiction exists. <em>Luu-Le v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 911, 914 (9th Cir.2000). We also have jurisdiction over due process challenges. <em>Antonio-Cruz v. INS, </em>147 F.3d 1129, 1130 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">The Petitioners sought suspension of deportation under \u00a7 244 of the INA, on the ground that they would suffer \u201cextreme hardship\u201d if returned to Mexico. Such relief is discretionary. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a) (repealed). The IJ exercised his discretion when he determined that deportation would not result in \u201cextreme hardship,\u201d basing his decision on the Petitioners\u2019 ages, health, contributions to the community, length of residence in the United States, and family ties in the United States and Mexico, and also on his finding that while economic opportunities and sanitary systems in the United States are superior to those in Mexico, conditions in Mexico are not so poor as to result in \u201cextreme hardship\u201d if the Petitioners were to return. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction over the discretionary determination of ineligibility for suspension of deportation. <em>Kalaw, </em>133 F.3d at 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">As to the Petitioners\u2019 constitutional argument, over which we do have jurisdiction, there simply was no showing of a due process violation. In <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000), we held that a Board decision violates due process \u201cif the proceeding was \u2018so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.\u2019 \u201d Here, the Petitioners argue that the proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>was unfair because of the IJ\u2019s response to Mr. Castro-Talavera\u2019s assertion that the Mexican government would confiscate his car if he took it across the border. The IJ questioned Mr. Castro-Talavera, counsel on both sides, and two of the Petitioners\u2019 witnesses about that claim. The questioning was a reasonable effort to assess the plausibility of Mr. Castro-Talavera\u2019s assertion, and it did not prevent the Petitioners from reasonably presenting their case. There is no due process prohibition against the IJ asking questions of a petitioner. <em>See Antonio-Cruz, </em>147 F.3d at 1131.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The Petitioners have requested attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(b). Because the Petitioners are not the prevailing party, that request is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b239-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
