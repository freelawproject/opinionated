The BIA found that because the charging document was not filed until after April 1, 1997, they were no longer statutorily eligible for the pre-Ulegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d) remedy of suspension of deportation but instead could only seek cancellation of removal under IIRIRA. Petitioners argue that because they filed their asylum application before April 1, 1997, they had settled expectations of being placed in deportation proceedings rather than removal proceedings. Mr. Carrillo-Maldonado also challenges the denial of voluntary departure (which was based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s finding of dishonest testimony). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">This case is not distinguishable from <em>Jimenez-Angeles v. Ashcroft, </em>291 F.3d 594 (9th Cir.2002). Settled expectations that an INS action will commence upon the denial of an asylum application do not equate to settled expectations as to <em>when </em>it will commence. The BIA correctly held that the INS action commenced upon the filing of the charging document, the NTA. <em>See Jimenez-Angeles, </em>291 F.3d at 600 (comparing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 242.1(a) (1997) (pre-IIRIRA) with 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 239.1(a) (2002) (post-IIRIRA)); <em>see also Cortez-Felipe v. INS, </em>245 F.3d 1054, 1056 (9th Cir.2001) (noting that before IIRIRA, deportation proceedings commenced upon filing of an OSC, and after April 1, 1997, removal proceedings commenced with an NTA). Accordingly, given that the INS did not file the NTA until April 20, 1998, the BIA petitioners could not apply for suspension of deportation since, after April 1, 1997, that relief was no longer available. <em>Cf. Uspango v. Ashcroft, </em>289 F.3d 226, 230 (3d Cir.2002) (rejecting a similar argument by an alien who filed for asylum before April 1, 1997 and claimed settled expectations of being placed in deportation proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">We also reject petitioners\u2019 due process challenge to application of IIRIRA, which essentially recasts the settled expectations argument in due process jargon. Since no settled expectations were frustrated, as discussed above, there is no colorable due process claim. <em>See Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201c[A] petitioner must allege at least a colorable constitutional violation .... To be colorable ... the claim must have some possible validity.\u201d) (citation and quotation marks omitted); <em>Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Finally, we reject Mr. Carrillo-Maldonado\u2019s challenge to denial of voluntary departure. IIRIRA eliminated judicial review of the BIA\u2019s discretionary denials of voluntary departure. <em>See Beltran-Tirado v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Hernandez-Mezquita v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 1161, 1165 (9th Cir.2002) <em>(citing </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">Petitioner contends that since a \u201cdecision by the BIA or an [IJ] that denies due process is not one that involves the exercise of discretion, the prohibition against judicial review ... does not apply ...\u201d <em>Torres-Aguilar, </em>246 F.3d at 1270 <em>(citing Larita-Martinez v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1092, 1095 (9th Cir.2000)). This much is true, but \u201ca petitioner may not create jurisdiction that Congress chose to remove simply by cloaking an abuse of discretion argument in constitutional garb ... Thus, to invoke our jurisdiction, a petitioner must allege at least a colorable constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Torres-Aguilar, </em>246 F.3d at 1271.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">Here, Carrillo-Maldonado takes issue with the admission of an FBI printout which showed that petitioner had been arrested on two occasions; he asserts that it was statutorily inadmissible evidence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(3)(B), and, therefore, he was denied due process because the IJ\u2019s finding of dishonesty was based on this impermissible evidence. But \u00a7 1229a(c)(3)(B) only sets the standard for evidence used to prove <em>convictions </em>used by the government in deportation proceedings, and, as the BIA noted, the FBI printout was only used to impeach by showing that petitioner had been <em>arrested </em>not convicted. Accordingly, since Mr. Carrillo-Maldonado\u2019s evidentiary complaint is meritless, he cannot establish the \u201cpossible validity\u201d required to make out a colorable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>claim. <em>See Torres-Aguilar, </em>246 F.3d at 1271 (petitioner\u2019s due process argument \u201cis nothing more than an argument that the Board abused its discretion, a matter over which we have no jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we DENY the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b210-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
