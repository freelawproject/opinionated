Edmunds, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b822-19\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b822-20\">Willie Woods, Jr., pleaded guilty to witness tampering and conspiracy to possess cocaine base for intended distribution. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b)(3) <em>and </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. On April 5, 2002, he was sentenced to eighty-eight months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. It is from this judgment that Woods now appeals. The parties have waived oral argument, and the panel unanimously agrees that it is not needed in this case. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-21\">Woods argues that his offense level should have been reduced under USSG \u00a7 3B1.2(b), as he was a only minor participant in the offense. It was Woods\u2019s burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he was entitled to a reduction under \u00a7 3B1.2. <em>See United States v. Latouf, </em>132 F.3d 320, 332 (6th Cir.1997). Thus, he was required to show that he was \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant\u201d in the offense. USSG \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3(A)) (2001). A defendant is not entitled to such a reduction if his participation is indispensable to the execution of the offense. <em>See Latouf, </em>132 F.3d at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-22\">The district court reasoned as follows in denying Woods\u2019s request for a \u00a7 3B1.2 reduction: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>[T]he defendant was clearly not a minor or minimal participant. It\u2019s true he had a supplier, but all drug dealers have a supplier. And the fact that someone has more dope than he does and provides it to him doesn\u2019t make this defendant a minimal or a minor participant. He was involved in more than one hand-to-hand transaction. He was also involved in trying to hush up a potential witness against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">We generally review a district court\u2019s refusal to grant a \u00a7 3B1.2 reduction for clear error. <em>See United States v. Tilford, </em>224 F.3d 865, 868 (6th Cir.2000). However, it may be appropriate to review the court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>when the facts are not in dispute. <em>See United States v. Roberts, </em>223 F.3d 377, 379-80 (6th Cir. 2000). Woods\u2019s claim fails under either analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Woods now argues that he should have been considered a minor participant in relation to his co-conspirator, John Geanes. In particular, Woods argues that he only kept a portion of the proceeds from the drug transactions and that Geanes was the supplier of the drugs. These arguments are unavailing in light of Agent Schuler\u2019s testimony at sentencing, which plainly indicates that Woods\u2019s participation was pervasive and essential to the offense. Thus, Woods has not carried his burden of showing that he was substantially less culpable than the average participant in the conspiracy. <em>See Tilford, </em>224 F.3d at 869; <em>Roberts, </em>223 F.3d at 381-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
