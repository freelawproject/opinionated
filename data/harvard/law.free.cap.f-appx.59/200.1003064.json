She did not appear for an August hearing, and the Immigration Judge (IJ) issued an order of removal in absentia. In 2001, petitioner filed a motion to reopen stating that she had failed to appear due to exceptional circumstances under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(l), involving fraud perpetrated by an immigration consultant. The Board of Immigration Appeals denied the motion, in part because it found petitioner\u2019s reliance on the supposed immigration consultant\u2019s misrepresentations unreasonable. We find that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen and therefore deny the petition. As the parties are familiar with the facts, we discuss only those necessary to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-17\">Petitioner\u2019s claim that she falls under the rule announced in <em>Lopez v. INS, </em>184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir.1999), for immigration consultant fraud ignores significant factual differences from that case. The <em>Lopez </em>court considered \u201cLopez\u2019s <em>reasonable reliance on fraudulent legal representation </em>[by a notary public who represented himself as a lawyer].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1100 (emphasis added). The BIA correctly deemed petitioner\u2019s reliance on the immigration consultant, \u201cAmalia,\u201d to be unreasonable. According to petitioner\u2019s later account of \u201cAmalia\u2019s\u201d name and role, \u201cAmalia\u201d told obvious falsehoods to the IJ in petitioner\u2019s presence at the June, 2000 hearing; she lied about her name and her relationship to petitioner. As stated by the BIA, petitioner then \u201cshould have re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>alized that the consultant was not a bona fide representative.\u201d Petitioner at that point had not been threatened by \u201cAmalia\u2019s\u201d staff, as she later claims occurred; allegedly had a desire to \u201ccome clean with the truth\u201d in the wake of an earlier fraud concerning her asylum application (purportedly perpetrated by another immigration consultant); and could have brought \u201cAmalia\u2019s\u201d deception to the authorities\u2019 attention instead of acquiescing in the scheme. The BIA\u2019s conclusion that it was unreasonable for petitioner to rely on \u201cAmalia\u2019s\u201d advice not to attend the August hearing was a sufficient basis for the BIA\u2019s decision. There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Petitioner\u2019s claim that the INS\u2019s failure to oppose her motion to reopen is legally significant is also unavailing. The BIA correctly concluded that this case is unlike <em>Rarogal v. INS, </em>42 F.3d 570 (9th Cir.1994), because there \u201cthe Service conceded that the alien had established rehabilitation, and stated that the Service did not oppose the granting of relief from deportation.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s citation of <em>Konstantinova v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 528, 530 (9th Cir.1999), is inapposite since in that case the INS\u2019s failure to join petitioner\u2019s motion was the <em>sole </em>reason her motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b225-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
