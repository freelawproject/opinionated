Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the record. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b910-8\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">Marilyn Ellman, a school psychologist, sued her employer, Woodstock # 200 School District, raising a variety of claims under Title VII and Illinois law. The essence of these claims was Ellman\u2019s belief that Woodstock was discriminating against her because of her age and gender. The district court granted summary judgment for Woodstock, and the court subsequently granted in part Woodstock\u2019s request for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. Ellman appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment (this is No. 01-1779) and award of costs and fees (this is 01-3777), and in both appeals we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">In February 2000 Ellman filed her third amended complaint in this case. She alleged that Woodstock assigned her to a storage area without windows for an office and to a substandard classroom; required her to work overtime without pay; threatened her with unwarranted discipline and negative performance evaluations; and twice did not inform her when school was canceled due to inclement weather. She raised a number of claims under Illinois law and Title VII, and both parties moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">In ruling on the summary-judgment motions, the district court noted that Ell-man\u2019s filings suffered from a number of deficiencies. With respect to Woodstock\u2019s motion, Ellman failed to respond to Woodstock\u2019s statement of facts, much less respond to each numbered paragraph with citations to the record, as was her obligation under Local Rule 56.1. This was the case even after Woodstock informed her by letter of her failure to comply with Rule 56.1 and she moved for and was given an extension by the court to correct this deficiency. With respect to her own motion for summary judgment, Ellman\u2019s statement of material facts failed to include required citations to the record and was replete with legal arguments and legal conclusions. The affidavit she filed with her motion likewise contained numerous statements that were speculative or not based on personal knowledge. In addition, months after filing her motion and affidavit, she filed without the court\u2019s permission a \u201cSupplementary Affidavit\u201d and \u201cSecond Supplementary Affidavit,\u201d each containing numerous attachments. Based on these deficiencies, the district court accepted Woodstock\u2019s unresponded to statement of facts as true and struck those portions of Ellman\u2019s statement of facts and affidavit that contained legal arguments, conclusions, speculation, or did not have support in the record. The court also struck her untimely supplemental filings as \u201ca complete derogation of the rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">Turning to the merits, the court denied Ellman\u2019s motion based on a \u201ccomplete lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>of evidence.\u201d The court granted Woodstock\u2019s motion, concluding that Ellman (1) was collaterally estopped (issue preclusion) from bringing claims based on overtime pay and previous performance evaluations because she already had litigated unsuccessfully the issues underlying those claims, <em>see Ellman v. Hentges, </em>165 F.3d 31 (7th Cir.1998) (unpublished order); (2) was barred from bringing her claim under the Illinois Human Rights Act for failure to exhaust administrative remedies; and (3) failed to make out a prima facie discrimination case because she had not shown that she suffered an adverse employment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">After Ellman appealed this decision, Woodstock moved for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 54, which the district court granted in part \u2014 awarding costs and fees only for issues that Ellman had litigated previously and therefore should have known were frivolous ($254.70 in costs and $925 in fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">On appeal Ellman challenges an array of procedural rulings, including the district court\u2019s decision to strike portions of her statement of facts and affidavit, to accept Woodstock\u2019s statement of facts after Ellman faded to respond to it, and not to accept her untimely filings. She maintains that these rulings were improperly based on \u201ctechnical non-compliance,\u201d which should have been overlooked because she is a pro se litigant.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">While we do construe pro se filings liberally, even pro se litigants must follow procedural rules and district courts have discretion to enforce those rules. <em>Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Johnson, </em>297 F.3d 558, 562 (7th Cir.2002); <em>Greer v. Bd. of Educ. of Chicago, </em>267 F.3d 723, 727 (7th Cir.2001). The requirements for pro se litigants in responding to summary-judgment motions are \u201cnot onerous,\u201d <em>Waldridge v. Am. Hoechst Corp., </em>24 F.3d 918, 920 (7th Cir. 1994), and we disagree that Ellman\u2019s deficiencies were mere technicalities. Employment-discrimination cases are \u201cextremely fact-intensive\u201d \u2014 the district court was not required to make up for Ellman\u2019s failure to respond to Woodstock\u2019s statement of facts by hunting through her mass of filings to search for disputed factual issues. <em>See Greer, </em>267 F.3d at 727. Moreover, the district court\u2019s decision to strike only the portions of her filings that were conclusory, speculative, or not based on personal knowledge did not prejudice Ell-man because those portions would not have helped her motion for summary judgment anyway. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). Ellman does not explain how her case differs from the many in which we \u201chave consistently and repeatedly upheld a district court\u2019s discretion to require strict compliance with its local rules governing summary judgment.\u201d <em>Bordelon v. Chicago Sch. Reform Bd. of Trs., </em>233 F.3d 524, 527 (7th Cir.2000). Nor do we see any difference. The district court did not abuse its discretion in how it dealt with Ellman\u2019s procedural deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">Ellman also challenges the award of costs and attorneys\u2019 fees on the ground that Woodstock\u2019s motion was untimely. She points out that Federal Rule 54(d)(2)(B) states that a motion for costs \u201cmust be served or filed no later than 14 days after entry of judgment\u201d and Woodstock filed its motion on May 25, 2001 (88 days after the district court\u2019s judgment). The 14-day requirement of Rule 54(d)(2)(B), however, is preceded by a proviso \u2014 namely, that the timing and other listed requirements do not apply if \u201cotherwise provided by statute or order of the court.\u201d Local Rule 54.3 extends the timing requirement to 90 days. We have already determined that local rules are orders of the court for purposes of Federal Rule 54(d)(2)(b), and thus valid modifications of the 14-day requirement. <em>Johnson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number><em>v. Lafayette Fire Fighters Assoc. Local m, </em>51 F.3d 726, 730 (7th Cir.1995). Because Woodstock\u2019s motion was filed within 90 days, it was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">The district court\u2019s judgment and award of costs and fees are AFFIRMED. Woodstock\u2019s motion to strike the new arguments and the documents, which Ellman provides in her reply brief for the second appeal (01-3777), that are not part of the record is GRANTED. We order Ellman to show cause within 14 days why we should not impose sanctions against her for filing these frivolous appeals. Within that time, Woodstock should submit a statement of its costs and fees for these appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
