Hayes argues that the district court erred by applying a two-level enhancement under United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) for making \u201ca threat of death\u201d during the robbery. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>We review for clear error the factual findings made by the district court at sentencing. <em>United States v. Lavender, </em>224 F.3d 939, 941-42 (9th Cir.2000). Hayes does not dispute that the note he handed to the bank teller contained a threat of death. Nor could he. The note stated that \u201cI have a gun! I will kill starting with you!\u201d Hayes argues instead that he was not aware of the contents of the note because one of his accomplices wrote it. We conclude that the district court did not clearly err by finding Hayes knew that the note contained a \u201cthreat of death.\u201d The extensive planning and Hayes\u2019s own statement to the teller that he had a gun, in conjunction with his testimony at the evidentiary hearing that was not credible, raises a legitimate inference that Hayes knew the contents of the note. Moreover, Hayes\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Zelaya, </em>114 F.3d 869, 871 (9th Cir.1997), is misplaced because the appellant in <em>Zelaya </em>did not know (and it was not foreseeable) that his accomplice would threaten the bank teller while he waited in the car. The district court did not err by applying the two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1017-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
