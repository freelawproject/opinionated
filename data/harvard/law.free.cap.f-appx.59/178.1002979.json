Reavley, Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b203-15\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-16\">Whether application of a federal law violates RFRA is a question of statutory construction for the court, not a question of fact for the jury. <em>United States v. Hugs, </em>109 F.3d 1375, 1379 (9th Cir.1997). Antoine\u2019s proposed \u201creligious freedom defense\u201d instruction was therefore erroneous. Nor did the district court abuse its discretion in excluding evidence of Antoine\u2019s religious purpose. Once Antoine\u2019s RFRA challenge was rejected, his religious purpose became irrelevant. <em>Id.; </em>Fed.R.Evid. 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-17\">Any error in excluding evidence that Antoine\u2019s transactions were not sales was harmless. BGEPA prohibits both the sale and the possession of eagle parts, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>a jury finding that Antoine sold eagle parts would necessarily imply, on the evidence presented, that he also possessed those parts. Antoine did not request a separate finding on possession, nor did he seriously contest it. Whether or not the exchanges were sales was therefore immaterial to whether Antoine violated BGEPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Any abuse of discretion in admitting evidence of eagle carcasses that Antoine stored in Canada was harmless. Antoine\u2019s defenses were that he had a religious purpose and that his transactions were potlatch exchanges rather than sales. Antoine did not seriously contest that he imported eagles and possessed them in the United States without a permit, as the indictment charged. As discussed above, his religious purpose was not a jury issue and any misclassification of potlatch exchanges as sales was harmless. With or without the evidence of Antoine\u2019s eagles in Canada, any jury faithfully applying the law would have found him guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The district court\u2019s removal for cause of Juror No. 24 was not an abuse of discretion. The district court did not dismiss the juror \u201cbased solely on [the juror\u2019s] acknowledgment that [he] disagree^] with the state of the law that governs the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Padilla-Mendoza, </em>157 F.3d 730, 733 (9th Cir. 1998). On the contrary, the juror repeatedly stated that he could not be fair to the government and recanted only after questioning by defense counsel. The court reasonably concluded that, notwithstanding this ultimate concession, the juror\u2019s earlier statements raised doubts about his impartiality. The court was not required to question the juror further, because grounds for dismissal were apparent from the responses to counsels\u2019 questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The district court did not err in refusing to adjust Antoine\u2019s sentence for acceptance of responsibility. Unlike the defendant in <em>United States v. McKittrick, </em>142 F.3d 1170,1178 (9th Cir.1998), Antoine contested his factual culpability by arguing that he had engaged in potlatch exchanges rather than sales. This defense had little practical effect because he was also guilty of possession, but he nonetheless contested the \u201csale\u201d element of his crime and so is not entitled to adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">We address Antoine\u2019s RFRA challenge in a separately filed opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b203-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
