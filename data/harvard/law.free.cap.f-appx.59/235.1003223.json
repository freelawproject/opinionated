The Tax Court also properly determined that Barasch failed to raise any genuine issue of material fact. <em>Hansen v. United States, </em>7 F.3d 137, 138 (9th Cir.1993). Accordingly, the Tax Court correctly granted the Commissioner\u2019s summary judgment motion. Finally, the Tax Court did not abuse its discretion in imposing sanctions against Baraseh pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 6673.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b259-33\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
