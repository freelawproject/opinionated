McDonald also appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to alter or amend judgment and for a new trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-21\">We review the district court\u2019s conclusions of law de novo, and its findings of facts for clear error. <em>Minyard Enter., Inc. v. Southeastern Chem. &amp; Solvent Co., </em>184 F.3d 373, 380 (4th Cir.1999); Fed. R.Civ.P. 52(a). We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, the joint appendix, and the supplemental joint appendix and conclude the district court properly entered judgment in favor of Mutual Benefit because Kelly was operating the vehicle while under the influence of alcohol in violation of Multi-Complex policy and therefore was a non-permissive user of the vehicle. <em>See Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth. v. Bullock, </em>68 Md.App. 20, 509 A.2d 1217, 1225 (Md.Ct.Spec.App.1986). Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Mutual Benefit Ins. Co. v. McDonald, </em>No. CA-01-1129-L (D. Md. July 12, 2002 &amp; Sept. 4, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
