Luna appeals the sentence imposed following his guilty plea for importation of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952 and 960. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-21\">Luna contends that the district court erred in applying an upward adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.4 for the use of a minor to commit a crime, without making any specific findings during the sentencing hearing as to its application. We review de novo, <em>United States v. Houston, </em>217 F.3d 1204, 1206 (9th Cir.2000), and we conclude that the district court erred by not making specific findings resolving Luna\u2019s objection to this upward adjust<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>ment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(1) (requiring that the court \u201cmust rule on any unresolved objections to the presentence report ...
