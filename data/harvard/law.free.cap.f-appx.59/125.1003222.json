He appeals his 70-month sentence, arguing that the district court erred by not decreasing his base offense level based on what he claims was his mitigating role in the offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-24\">Seven individuals led by Phuong Vu Nguyen (\u201cVu\u201d) conspired to distribute crack in the Argyle Street area of Chicago from approximately January 1999 until June 19, 2000. Vu obtained most of the crack through Sharon Sawyer, but also had several other suppliers. Vu\u2019s girlfriend, co-conspirator Phuong \u201cJulie\u201d Lam Nguyen, worked closely with Vu and managed the drug distribution when he visited Vietnam in November 1999 and April 2000. In late February 2000 defendant Hua allowed Vu to use his name and address to subscribe for a cellular telephone to facilitate drug transactions. During the final two months of the conspiracy, the government obtained an intercept order for this telephone and recorded both Vu and Julie conducting drug deals.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-25\">On April 23, 2000, Vu traveled to Vietnam and left Julie in charge until his re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>turn on May 18. At Vu\u2019s request, Hua agreed to protect Julie when she made drug sales and replenished her drug supply during Vu\u2019s absence. During that same period, Hua called the cellular phone registered in his name and told Julie during a recorded conversation that she should sell crack valued at $60 to \u201cTuan\u201d for $50. Hua later called Julie to verify that the crack had been sold at a discount to \u201cTuan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">After Hua\u2019s car was stopped and searched by police on May 16, 2000, he called Julie and warned her to \u201chide everything\u201d and to avoid leaving any \u201cstuff in the house or car.\u201d Hua also called Vu when he returned from Vietnam and warned him that he believed the FBI was after Vu.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">In September 2000 the government indicted the seven alleged co-conspirators. Pursuant to a written plea agreement, Hua pleaded guilty to conspiracy (count one of the indictment), stipulating to most guidelines calculations but reserving the right to argue at sentencing that his offense level be decreased by two points because he had a minor role in the offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). The government disagreed, and the probation officer likewise recommended against reducing Hua\u2019s offense level under \u00a7 3B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Over Hua\u2019s objection, the district court determined at sentencing that Hua\u2019s role in the conspiracy was not \u201cminor.\u201d The court agreed with the recommendation in the PSR that Hua played neither an aggravating nor a mitigating role in the offense. In his plea agreement Hua admitted that 127.6 grams was the amount of crack reasonably foreseeable to him, making his base offense level 32. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4). After other adjustments, the district court arrived at a total offense level of 27, making Hua\u2019s range of imprisonment 70-87 months. The district court sentenced Hua to 70. Had the district court granted the requested minor-participant reduction, the resulting imprisonment range would have been 57-71 months. So Hua could have saved himself 14 months (on the other hand, although it is unlikely, his sentence <em>with </em>the requested reduction could have been one month more than he actually received).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Section 3B1.2(b) permits a sentencing court to reduce by two the offense level of a defendant who is \u201cless culpable than most other participants, but whose \u2022 role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.5). The adjustment is appropriate \u201cfor a defendant who plays a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3(A)). The defendant bears the burden of proving his entitlement to the adjustment. <em>United States v. Felix-Felix, </em>275 F.3d 627, 636 (7th Cir. 2001). Further, the sentencing court\u2019s determination as to whether the reduction is warranted \u201cinvolves a determination that is heavily dependent upon the facts of the particular case.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3(C)). We therefore review the district court\u2019s finding only for clear error. <em>United States v. Crowley, </em>285 F.3d 553, 559 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Hua argues that the finding was clearly erroneous for three reasons. First, he says, the court did not properly compare his role with that of his co-conspirators. Second, the court erroneously viewed Hua\u2019s role as integral to the success of the conspiracy. And third, according to Hua, the court ignored the fact that his culpability was overstated by the relevant conduct conceded in his plea agreement \u2014 127.6 grams \u2014 when he was personally involved in only one transaction involving two grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>As to Hua\u2019s first contention, he correctly notes that a minor role adjustment is appropriate when a defendant\u2019s conduct makes him substantially less culpable than other participants; but comparative roles, though important, are not determinative. <em>See id.; United States v. Cea, </em>963 F.2d 1027, 1033 (7th Cir.1992) (sustaining refusal to grant minor role adjustment to \u201cgo-between\u201d based partly on the recognition that individuals may play different but essential roles in drug transactions). In comparing Hua\u2019s role with other members of the conspiracy, the district court concluded that his participation \u201cdid not either exceed or fall below that of other persons involved in the conspiracy.\u201d Hua maintains this conclusion is clearly erroneous because, unlike others, he \u201cdid not negotiate drug transactions, he did not store, package, supply or deliver drugs, he did not carry money, and he never cooked the cocaine into \u2018crack.\u2019\u201d He also relies on this distinction in his reply brief, but the page in the PSR he cites identifies him as one of the defendants who was \u201cresponsible for delivering crack cocaine to the conspiracy\u2019s customers.\u201d The government\u2019s version of the offense appended to the PSR also details that Hua assisted Vu by \u201cdelivering quantities of crack to Vu\u2019s customers and others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Further, Hua maintains that he did not profit from the conspiracy. The government, citing its objections to the PSR for co-defendant Dai Cong Truong, admits that the only defendants who received money were Vu\u2019s source Sharon Sawyer, Vu himself, Julie and Dai Cong Truong. However, the PSR details the government\u2019s conflicting position that with the exception of one defendant (Hoang Tuan Nguyen), all the remaining defendants received either cash, narcotics, or clothing for their services. However, that Hua realized no profit, if he in fact did not, does not compel the conclusion that his role in the conspiracy was minor. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>136 F.3d 1176, 1186 (7th Cir.1998) (\u201cThe fact that [the defendant] did not profit from his illegal actions is not our concern.\u201d); <em>United States v. Brick, </em>905 F.2d 1092, 1095 (7th Cir.1990) (amount of pecuniary gain is not sole factor in determining individual\u2019s role).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The district court did not rely on whether Hua either profited, or packaged, cooked or distributed crack, and it was not required to. Even if the nature of his participation suggests that Hua played a lesser role, the district court was not constrained to award the adjustment. <em>See Crowley, </em>285 F.3d at 560 (fact that another individual played \u201crelatively greater role in the conspiracy\u201d did not make decision to deny downward adjustment clearly erroneous); <em>see also United States v. Castillo, </em>148 F.3d 770, 776 (7th Cir.1998) (greater participation by other co-conspirators may warrant upward adjustment for them, but does not guarantee minor role adjustment for less-involved defendant); <em>United States v. Kerr, </em>13 F.3d 203, 206 (7th Cir.1993) (\u201cthe fact that one plays a much lesser role than another does not mean that one is a minor participant.\u201d). Indeed, the court acknowledged that Hua\u2019s role may have been less involved given that he did not \u201c[make] sales every day or [buy] large quantities.\u201d The court concluded nonetheless that Hua\u2019s participation \u201cput [him] right in the middle\u201d of the conspiracy because his phone was used and he was trusted as a bodyguard to Julie. On this record, this is a reasonable interpretation of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Next, Hua attacks the district court\u2019s determination that his role was \u201cintegral\u201d to the conspiracy. The district court reasoned that Hua provided essential contributions to the conspiracy and fully understood \u201cwhat was going on.\u201d We have upheld the denial of a minor role reduction where a defendant played an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>integral role in a conspiracy by providing critical services. <em>See United States v. Cain, </em>155 F.3d 840, 844 (7th Cir.1998) (upholding refusal to grant mitigating-role adjustment where defendant provided \u201cnecessary services\u201d by renting car, driving co-conspirator, and renting apartment in furtherance of drug conspiracy); <em>Castillo, </em>148 F.3d at 776 (minor role adjustment properly denied where defendant provided \u201cessential\u201d services of transportation and sleeping accommodations); <em>see also United States v. Corral-Ibarra, </em>25 F.3d 430, 439 (7th Cir.1994) (\u201cwe have upheld the denial of a downward adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2 where a less culpable defendant nevertheless played an \u2018integral role\u2019 in the conspiracy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Hua maintains that whether he played an integral role hinges on \u201cwhether drug sales would have occurred, but for [his] individual efforts.\u201d But that argument is misplaced. <em>United States v. Burnett, </em>66 F.3d 137, 140 (7th Cir.1995) (\u201c \u00a7 3B1.2 does not ask how easily [defendant] could have been replaced\u201d); <em>cf. United States v. Redig, </em>27 F.3d 277, 282 (7th Cir.1994) (even if defendant\u2019s drawing of bank floor plan could have been created by anyone who entered the bank, district court \u201cwas within its discretion\u201d to conclude that drawing \u201cwas of real value\u201d to the co-defendant bank robbers and that, consequently, defendant was not minor participant even though he was not present for robbery). The district court acknowledged that other co-conspirators also provided telephones for the venture, a fact that Hua emphasizes on appeal, but concluded that his role in procuring the phone was nonetheless \u201cessential.\u201d Regardless whether others could or did provide cellular telephones, Hua\u2019s complicity in providing <em>his </em>name and address for the subscription supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that he contributed a necessary means of communication to the conspiracy. Hua\u2019s contention that he allowed Vu to use his name to subscribe to the cellular telephone only because Vu had bad credit is irrelevant; even by Hua\u2019s own calculation he knew \u201cfirst-hand that Vu was dealing crack cocaine\u201d in April 1999 and did nothing to prevent the telephone subscribed to him from being used to further the drug dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The court also determined that Hua\u2019s role was not minor in light of the fact that he was trusted to act as a bodyguard for Julie, \u201cthe principal organizer and manager\u201d in the conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Stephenson, </em>53 F.3d 836, 850 (7th Cir. 1995) (no adjustment warranted for defendant who sold drugs and acted as bodyguard for co-conspirator); <em>cf. United States v. Tolson, </em>988 F.2d 1494, 1504 (7th Cir.1993) (noting unlikelihood that drug dealer would invite along someone on a drug deal who did not have dealer\u2019s complete confidence and trust). Hua attempts to downplay his bodyguard role by claiming on appeal that he \u201cunwittingly accompanied Julie\u201d when she delivered drugs, but this contention is frivolous given Hua\u2019s plea agreement stipulation that he accompanied Julie \u201cfor her protection during crack deliveries knowing that she was selling crack cocaine for Vu.\u201d These facts sufficiently indicate that Hua was a trusted, and critical (not because he <em>could not </em>be replaced, but because he <em>was not </em>replaced), member of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Lastly, Hua contends that the district court erroneously failed to consider that the 127.6 grams of crack he took responsibility for in his plea agreement led to a base offense level that overrepresented his role. A \u201cminor role\u201d adjustment may be appropriate where a defendant, through the relevant-conduct provisions of the guidelines, is held accountable for the acts of others. <em>Burnett, </em>66 F.3d at 140. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>government argues that the 127.6 grams represents only the amount of cocaine in which Hua had personal involvement. Because the plea agreement limited the drugs attributable to Hua to the period from April 10, 2000 to June 19, 2000, he was held accountable only for drug transactions discovered through the wire tap on the telephone subscribed to him and transactions where he personally accompanied Julie. Hua responds that he was personally involved only in the one transaction for 2 grams where he instructed Julie to give a customer a discount rate. However, Hua himself admits that Vu, Julie, and the supplier Sharon Sawyer were held responsible for distributing 609.5 grams of cocaine. He also admits that he was held responsible for 127.6 grams \u201cbased only on [his] presence when Julie delivered the crack.\u201d His presence, especially considering his role as protection for Julie, sufficiently demonstrates his personal involvement in distributing the 127.6 grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Although not indisputable, the conclusion that Hua was not a \u201cminor participant\u201d is not clearly erroneous. <em>See Burnett, </em>66 F.3d at 141; <em>see also CorralIbarra, </em>25 F.3d at 439 (decision to deny minor role adjustment was not inevitable but was reasonable). The district judge explained the reasons for his belief that Hua\u2019s participation in the conspiracy was not so limited as to call for a \u00a7 3B1.2(b) reduction, and those reasons correspond to the facts and the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The judgment of the district court is, therefore, AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
