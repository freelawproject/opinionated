He stipulated to a base offense level of 37. Amparo was credited with a three level reduction because of his acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b). He further received a two point reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 when the Sentencing Judge found that he had not played a significant supervisory role in the offense. The Sentencing Judge also decided to grant a government motion for a downward departure, based on Amparo\u2019s cooperation with the government pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. Amparo was sentenced to 60 months imprisonment, which is substantially below the otherwise applicable guideline. He was further sentenced to 60 months of supervised release pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 860, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Finally, the judge imposed a mandatory special assessment of $100, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3013. The judgment of conviction was entered on April 26, 2002. Amparo filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">Amparo\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Under <em>Anders, </em>if counsel is convinced after conscientious investigation that the appeal is frivolous, counsel may properly ask to withdraw. <em>Id. </em>at 741, 87 S.Ct. 1396 (citation omitted). <em>Anders </em>also requires that counsel\u2019s brief cite any matters that may be arguably appealable. <em>Id. </em>at 741, 87 S.Ct. 1396; <em>United States v. Tannis, </em>942 F.2d 196,197 (3rd Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">In this case, the arguably appealable issues include whether the District Court had jurisdiction to accept Amparo\u2019s guilty plea, whether the plea was valid in light of controlling constitutional and statutory standards, whether the District Court imposed a legal sentence, and whether the extent of the District Court\u2019s downward departure is subject to appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-13\">Amparo received a copy of his defense counsel\u2019s brief, and was given time to raise any non-frivolous arguments in a <em>pro se </em>brief. <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396; 3rd Cir. LAR 109.2(a) (2000). However, Amparo has not filed a <em>pro se </em>brief in support of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-14\">The District Court patently has jurisdiction over the federal crimes with which Amparo was charged and had the authority to accept Amparo\u2019s guilty plea. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Amparo\u2019s plea was valid in light of controlling constitutional and statutory standards. Pursuant to <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274, the District Court conducted a detailed colloquy, through an interpreter, before accepting the guilty plea. Amparo was questioned about his ability to understand the proceedings. The record of the plea hearing shows that the District Court, with the assistance of an interpreter, fully and adequately informed Amparo of his right to a jury trial, the charges against him, and the maximum sentence for his offenses. Furthermore, he was advised of his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to confront his accusers. With this knowledge, Amparo agreed with the government\u2019s factual report, stated his satisfaction with his counsel, and then voluntarily entered a plea of guilty to the charges in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">From our review of the record, we conclude that Amparo knowingly and voluntarily pled guilty. Moreover, we find no non-frivolous issue for appeal in the sentencing discussed above. We have no jurisdiction to entertain any contention by Amparo related to the extent of the District Court\u2019s downward departure. Whether to depart at all was subject to the District Court\u2019s discretion, and we have held that we have \u201c[no] jurisdiction to hear an appeal by the defendant where there has been some departure.\u201d <em>United States v. Gaskill, </em>991 F.2d 82, 84 (3d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">For the reasons set forth, we will affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
