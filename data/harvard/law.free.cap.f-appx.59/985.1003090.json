Porter, Sr., a California state prisoner, appeals pro se the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging that Lincoln City and several media companies violated his due process rights and the Ex Post Facto Clause. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo dismissals for failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>State a claim under the screening provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, <em>Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">The district court properly dismissed Porter\u2019s due process claims because the California statute granting the public the right to submit information to the Board of Prison Terms for consideration in making parole decisions does not create a liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See </em>Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 3043.5(b) (requiring the parole board to consider information submitted by the public but giving the board discretion to determine whether the prisoner \u201cwould pose a threat to the public safety if released on parole\u201d); <em>Baumann v. </em>Ariz. <em>Dept. of Corr., </em>754 F.2d 841, 844 (9th Cir.1985) (only state regulatory measures that impose \u201csubstantive limitations on the exercise of official discretion\u201d may create a liberty interest). Nor does Porter have a constitutional right to receive parole. <em>See Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal &amp; Corr. Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 7, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">There is no legal basis for Porter\u2019s claim that the Lincoln City resolution violates the Ex Post Facto Clause because the resolution does not \u201calter the definition of crimes or increase the punishment for criminal acts.\u201d <em>See Souch v. Schaivo, </em>289 F.3d 616, 620 (9th Cir.) (internal quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 231, 154 L.Ed.2d 98 (2002). Similarly, because the resolution does not legislatively determine guilt or inflict punishment, it does not constitute a bill of attainder. <em>See Nixon v. Adm\u2019r of Gen. Servs., </em>433 U.S. 425, 468, 97 S.Ct. 2777, 53 L.Ed.2d 867 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-9\">Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Porter\u2019s pendent state law claims for fraud, misrepresentation, libel, slander, and violations of the California Constitution. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c); <em>Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Co-hill, </em>484 U.S. 343, 350 n. 7, 108 S.Ct. 614, 98 L.Ed.2d 720 (1988) (\u201cif the federal claims are dismissed before trial ... the state claims should be dismissed as well\u201d) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1009-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
