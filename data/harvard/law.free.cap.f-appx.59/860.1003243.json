Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the record. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b885-8\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">In December 2001, Matthew and Felicia Norville, acting pro se, filed a complaint in the Northern District of Illinois, alleging that in January 1996 the defendants\u2014 which include their former landlord Dell Corporation, Kane County, the City of Batavia, and members of the Kane County Sheriffs Department \u2014 illegally evicted them from their home, where they lived pursuant to a Department of Housing and Urban Development lease. In the course of the eviction, the defendants and their agents broke through a door and threatened that the Norvilles\u2019 children would be taken away if the Norvilles did not vacate the premises. Sheriffs Deputy Rick McKiness then allegedly struck Mr. Nor-ville in the face, cutting him. The Norvilles\u2019 complaint seeks monetary damages and an order allowing them to repossess their former home.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">After an exchange of motions \u2014 during which the Norvilles proffered a copy of the state court judgment authorizing their eviction \u2014 the district court construed the Norvilles\u2019 complaint as alleging civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and possible claims for discriminatory housing practices under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613. Noting that almost six years had passed since the described events, the district court then granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss on statute of limitations grounds. After unsuccessfully seeking leave to amend their already-dismissed complaint, the Norvilles appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">There are several reasons why this appeal fails. First, to the extent that the Norvilles ask us to review the legality of the state court order resulting in their eviction, the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine prevents us from doing so; only the United States Supreme Court can directly review state court judgments. <em>See District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 486, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 416, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923). Second, to the extent that the Norvilles\u2019 complaint alleges that McKiness used excessive force against Mr. Norville, that claim is barred, as the district court held, by the applicable two-year statute of limitations for civil rights claims in Illinois. <em>See Licari v. City of Chicago, </em>298 F.3d 664, 667-68 (7th Cir.2002). Third, the Norvilles neither alleged that the eviction had a discriminatory motive nor filed their complaint within the applicable two-year statute-of-limitations period for claims under \u00a7 3613, which provides a civil remedy for discriminatory housing practices. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-13\">None of the Norvilles\u2019 appellate arguments rebuts the dispositive effect of these issues. The Norvilles first contend that we lack jurisdiction to hear this case because the district court\u2019s dismissal order was not final and appealable \u2014 a contention attempting, we presume, to preserve the possibility of their amending the complaint. The Norvilles note discrepancies between the district court\u2019s order, which \u201cterminated] the case,\u201d and the judgment entered pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58, which noted only that \u201cthe complaint\u201d had been dismissed. Appeals may, however, be taken from final orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>even in the absence of Rule 58 judgments, <em>see Otis v. City of Chicago, </em>29 F.3d 1159, 1165-66 (7th Cir.1994) (en banc), and we have held that an order is final and appeal-able \u2014 not withstanding language regarding whether a dismissal is \u201cwith\u201d or \u201cwithout\u201d prejudice \u2014 if it is plain from the case\u2019s posture and the district court\u2019s reasoning that the case\u2019s trek through the district court is over. <em>See, e.g., Strong v. David, </em>297 F.3d 646, 648 (7th Cir.2002). Here, it is obvious both from the district court\u2019s order \u201cterminating the case\u201d and from its statute-of-limitations ruling that the Norvilles\u2019 case was ripe for appeal. <em>See LeBlang Motors Ltd. v. Subaru of America, </em>148 F.3d 680, 690 (7th Cir.1998) (\u201c[I]f it is clear that the plaintiff may not start over again with a properly drawn complaint, because of limitations problems or otherwise, the action is treated as final and the order is appealable.\u201d) (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Next, the Norvilles attack the district court\u2019s ruling that the statute of limitations has run on any \u00a7 3613 claims they might have had. Although their arguments are somewhat hard to follow, they first seem to assert that the statute of limitations has not run because the eviction order obtained by Dell is the invalid product of collusion between Dell\u2019s lawyers and the judge who issued the order, and they cite to the Illinois rule that the statute of limitations on actions fraudulently concealed does not expire until five years after the action is discovered. <em>See </em>735 ILCS 5/13\u2014 215. Alternatively, they suggest that the statute has not run because Dell continues to violate \u00a7 3613 by refusing to let them re-occupy their former home.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Regarding the Norvilles\u2019 first argument, the Illinois fraudulent concealment statute does not apply to this case because \u00a7 3613 is a federal statute containing an explicit two-year statute of limitations, and the federal courts borrow</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">state statute-of-hmitation rules only where a federal statute is silent on that issue. <em>See Beck v. Caterpillar Inc., </em>50 F.3d 405, 406-07 (7th Cir.1995). Furthermore, even if we generously construe the Norvilles\u2019 collusion argument as a claim that Dell should be equitably estopped from asserting the statute-of-limitations defense, the argument still must fail. Plaintiffs cannot equitably estop defendants from raising such a defense if, despite bad conduct on the part of the defendant, the plaintiff could still have obtained the information necessary to file their complaint within the applicable time limit. <em>See Jackson v. Rockford Hous. Auth., </em>213 F.3d 389, 394 (7th Cir.2000). Here, the Norvilles claim to have known all along of the alleged collusion between Dell\u2019s lawyers and the issuing judge; that is why they say they twice appealed the eviction order in the Illinois courts and sought a temporary restraining order against Dell in 1996. There was thus no reason why the Norvilles could not have brought their discrimination claim \u2014 assuming they have one-within the applicable two-year limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">With respect to the Norvilles\u2019 alternative argument \u2014 that Dell continues to violate \u00a7 3613 by refusing to let them reoccupy their former home \u2014 the complaint quite clearly focuses on the allegedly illegal eviction in January 1996. That eviction was a discrete and specific act for which the Norvilles could have sued immediately; lingering harm does not transform it into a continuing violation. \u201cA violation is called \u2018continuing... when it would be unreasonable to require or even permit [a plaintiff] to sue separately over every incident of the defendant\u2019s unlawful conduct____ When a single event gives rise to continuing injuries ... the plaintiff can bring a single suit based on an estimation of his total injuries....\u201d. <em>Heard v. Sheahan, </em>253 F.3d 316, 319 (7th Cir.2001). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>There is thus no support for the position that the continuing injuries the Norvilles allegedly suffered after the eviction transformed it and its consequences into a continuing violation. The district court was therefore correct to rule that the statute of limitations has run on any \u00a7 3613 claims dating back to the eviction in 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">The Norvilles\u2019 final arguments challenge the district court\u2019s refusal to allow them to amend their complaint after it had been dismissed to include the allegations of fraudulent concealment discussed above. Although district courts may allow a complaint to be amended after judgment, the decision whether to do so is left to district courts\u2019 discretion. <em>See Rodriguez v. United States, </em>286 F.3d 972, 980 (7th Cir.2002). \u201c[I]n this circuit, the presumption in favor of liberality in granting motions to amend [under Rule 15(a)] is reversed after judgment has been entered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citations omitted). Courts can justifiably refuse to allow amendments to a complaint where the proposed amendments would not cure a statute-of-limitations problem. <em>Id. </em>The Norvilles\u2019 proposed amended complaint does not cure the statute-of-limitations problems elucidated here, and thus the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to accept it. The Norvilles\u2019 contentions to the contrary are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
