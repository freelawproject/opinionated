We affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we need not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-24\">Montes-Garcia\u2019s argument that his indictment was legally insufficient is precluded by circuit law. <em>United States v. Parga-Rosas, </em>238 F.3d 1209 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 942, 122 S.Ct. 319, 151 L.Ed.2d 238 (2001). Nothing in <em>Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number><em>ed States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc), alters the controlling effect of <em>Parga-Rosas </em>here. The indictment also adequately alleged the necessary <em>mens rea </em>for the charged offense. <em>Pena-Cabanillas v. United States, </em>394 F.2d 785, 788-90 (9th Cir.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the warrant and order of deportation into evidence. <em>United States v. Hernandez-Herrera, </em>273 F.3d 1213, 1217-18 (9th Cir.2001) (citing <em>United States v. Contreras, </em>63 F.3d 852, 857 (9th Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The district court did not err in treating Montes-Garcia\u2019s prior armed robbery conviction under California Penal Code \u00a7 211 as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for the purposes of increasing Montes-Garcia\u2019s sentence level by 16 levels.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). We have found robbery under \u00a7 211 to be a crime of violence before, <em>see United States v. David H., </em>29 F.3d 489, 494 (9th Cir.1994), basing our decision on language relevant to the Sentencing Guideline at issue here, and we have applied this understanding of robbery in California in related Sentencing Guidelines decisions. <em>See United States v. McDougherty, </em>920 F.2d 569, 573-74 (9th Cir.1990). Thus, the district court did not err to increase Montes-Garcia\u2019s sentence level 16-levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Montes-Garcia\u2019s argument that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), is precluded by <em>United States v. Packeco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 414 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 966, 121 S.Ct. 1503,149 L.Ed.2d 388 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b241-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-7\">. The district court mistakenly referred to the \"crime of violence\u201d as an \"aggravated felony\u201d at sentencing. Such a designation would carry a limitation of an 8 level increase. However, it is quite clear from the record that this was merely a mistaken reference. The briefs and arguments focused on the requirements for a \"crime of violence.\u201d In context, the true meaning of the district court\u2019s statement is readily apparent and not contested by the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
