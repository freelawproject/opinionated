Nutri-cology, Inc., </em>982 F.2d 394, 397 (9th Cir.1992), we conclude that the district court did not err by denying reconsideration of Petrus\u2019s Rule 41(e) motion on the grounds that he faded to present any new evidence that his property was in the possession of the federal government. <em>See United States v. Huffhines, </em>986 F.2d 306, 308 (9th Cir.1993) (recognizing that the district court does not have jurisdiction to order the United States government to return property independently seized and possessed by state law enforcement).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b965-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b965-18\">. Although Petrus timely appealed the denial of his <em>motion to </em>reconsider, he did <em>not </em>timely appeal the underlying rule 41(e) motion. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 4(b)(3); <em>United States v. Barragan-Mendoza, </em>174 F.3d 1024, 1026 (9th Cir. 1999) (stating that a timely motion for reconsideration of an order in a criminal case delays the running of the 10-day filing period). Accordingly, we only have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of Petrus's motion to reconsider.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
