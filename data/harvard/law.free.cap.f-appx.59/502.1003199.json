Oaks (\u201cOaks\u201d) appeals from the order granting summary judgment in favor of the City of Philadelphia (\u201cCity\u201d) and the denial of his motion for reconsideration. Oaks brought this action against the City pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983. He alleged that his termination following his arrest for assaulting his estranged girlfriend was the result of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>City\u2019s discriminatory policies or customs against African-American police officers that allowed similarly situated white officers arrested for domestic abuse to avoid termination. We conclude that the district court did not err in granting the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment because Oaks failed to present facts showing that the alleged discriminatory treatment was the result of the City\u2019s policies or customs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Oaks contends \u201cthat under color of law the City of Philadelphia [] violated his rights to make and enforce contracts under \u00a7 1981.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He prayed for damages pursuant to \u00a7 1988. Oaks argues that the City has a custom of conducting racially discriminatory disciplinary proceedings that is acquiesced in by City policymakers. He maintains that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because it failed to analyze his claim pursuant to <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), and <em>Jett v. Dallas Independent School District, </em>491 U.S. 701, 109 S.Ct. 2702,105 L.Ed.2d 598 (1989).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">As the Supreme Court did in <em>Jett, </em>we will subject Oaks\u2019s claim to a <em>Monell </em>analysis without first determining whether an actual \u00a7 1981 claim could be sustained by Oaks. <em>See Jett, </em>491 U.S. at 711 (\u201cwe assume for purposes of these cases, without deciding, that petitioner\u2019s rights under \u00a7 1981 have been violated\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">The Court has ruled \u201cthat the express action at law provided by \u00a7 1983 for the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, provides the exclusive federal damages remedy for the violation of the rights guaranteed by \u00a7 1981 when the claim is pressed against a state actor.\u201d <em>Jett, </em>491 U.S. at 735 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThus to prevail in his claim for damages [against a state actor], [a claimant] must show that the violation of his right to make contracts protected by \u00a7 1981 was caused by a custom or policy within the meaning of <em>Monell </em>and subsequent cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 735-36 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">In <em>Monell, </em>the Supreme Court instructed</p>\n<p id=\"b527-14\">that a local government may not be sued under \u00a7 1983 for an injury inflicted solely by its employees or agents. Instead, it is when execution of a government\u2019s policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the injury that the government as an entity is responsible under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-15\"><em>Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 694. The Court has determined that \u201conly those municipal officials who have final policymaking authority may by their actions subject the government to \u00a7 1983 liability.\u201d <em>St. Louis v. Praprotnik, </em>485 U.S. 112, 123, 108 S.Ct. 915, 99 L.Ed.2d 107 (1988) (citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-16\">A discriminatory policy need not be caused by an affirmative act, but may occur \u201cby acquiescence in a longstanding practice or custom which constitutes the \u2018standard operating procedure\u2019 of the local government entity.\u201d <em>Jett, </em>491 U.S. at 737 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>(quoting <em>Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, </em>475 U.S. 469, 485, 106 S.Ct. 1292, 89 L.Ed.2d 452 (1986) (White, J. concurring)). This court has held \u201c \u2018[a] course of conduct to be a \u201ccustom\u201d when, though not authorized by law, such practices ... are so permanent and well-settled as to virtually constitute law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Robinson v. City of Pittsburgh, </em>120 F.3d 1286, 1296 (3d Cir. 1997) (quoting <em>Andrews v. City of Philadelphia, </em>895 F.2d 1469,1480 (3d Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The City moved for summary judgment arguing that \u201c[t]he Police Department\u2019s termination of plaintiff was based <em>entirely </em>on the Department\u2019s non-discriminatory policy of terminating all officers who are arrested and criminally charged, regardless of the outcome of the eventual criminal proceeding.\u201d It is undisputed that the City has such a \u201clongstanding\u201d policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The City contended that \u201c[t]his rule is applied uniformly irrespective of race.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In opposing the motion, Oaks presented a report prepared by the Mayor\u2019s Task Force on Police Discipline (\u201cTask Force\u201d). The Task Force\u2019s report states that it was \u201cunable to locate any statistical evidence that would conclusively prove or disprove\u201d the existence of a \u201ccustom\u201d of discriminatory activity to which the City might have acquiesced. Oaks also offered the deposition of Ellen H. Ceisler (\u201cCeisler\u201d), the Director of the Integrity and Accountability Office of the Philadelphia Police Department. Ms. Ceisler testified that there was a perception among some police officers that \u201crace has a bearing on personnel decisions.\u201d She testified, however, that she had conducted \u201ca ten year study of officers who had been fired from the department\u201d and determined that \u201c[t]here was nothing significant in terms of greater percentages\u201d of departmental dismissals attributable to an officer\u2019s race. She also alleged that the City did not have custom of disparate treatment towards arrested officers. She stated that \u201c[i]f you\u2019re arrested for a criminal charge, you\u2019re automatically dismissed\u201d from the Philadelphia Police Department. Ms. Ceisler further asserted that, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen an exception\u201d to this rule.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">Oaks failed to present any evidence showing that a City official with \u201cfinal policy making authority\u201d authorized or acquiesced in a policy or custom in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983. This court has previously ruled that \u201c[w]here, as here, the non-moving party bears the burden of proof at trial, summary judgment is appropriate if ' the non-movant[ ] fail[s] to \u2018make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to [his or her] case.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re TMI, </em>89 F.3d 1106, 1116 (3d Cir. 1996) (quoting <em>Nebraska v. Wyoming, </em>507 U.S. 584, 590, 113 S.Ct. 1689, 123 L.Ed.2d 317 (1993)). Because Oaks has failed to demonstrate that the City had a policy or custom of discrimination against African-American police officers who are arrested for domestic abuse, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the City.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">Oaks asserts that the district court erred in denying his motion for reconsider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>ation of the order granting summary judgment in favor of the City. He contends that the court\u2019s erroneous overturning of its previous order merging his \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983 claims, and its failure to apply <em>Monell, </em>were clear errors of law or manifest injustice. We have independently reviewed Oaks\u2019s \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983 claims pursuant to <em>Monell. </em>\u201cWe may affirm a judgment on any ground apparent from the record, even if the district court did not reach it.\u201d <em>Kabakjian v. United States, </em>267 F.3d 208, 213 (3d Cir.2001). Because Oaks failed to demonstrate that there is a genuine issue of material fact in dispute, or that he is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 56(c), the district court did not err as a matter of law nor did its order constitute manifest injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-9\">. The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1334.

Section 1981 provides in pertinent part: \"All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State or Territory to make and enforce contracts ... as is enjoyed by white citizens....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981(a) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b527-18\">.

Oaks also submitted: newspapers and articles regarding accusations of discriminatory police disciplinary procedures; affidavits and depositions regarding his job performance arte! the circumstances of his arrest; and police directives regarding civil suits, release of information, and domestic abuse. None of these items demonstrates that the City had policies or customs that discriminated against African-American police officers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b528-13\">.

Oaks has failed to demonstrate that a white police officer would have retained his employment under similar circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
