We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Walker has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1039-40, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). In addition, because extraordinary circumstances are not present in this case, we decline to consider claims raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-21\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
