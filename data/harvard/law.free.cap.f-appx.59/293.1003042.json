In order for this court to grant a certificate of appealability (COA), Mr. Price must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Where the district court has denied a claim on the merits, he must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted). Where the district court has denied a claim on procedural grounds, he must demonstrate \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">The magistrate judge first recommended that the petition be denied and dismissed as time barred under \u00a7 2244(d)(1). Relying upon <em>Carey v. Saffold, </em>536 U.S. 214,122 S.Ct. 2134, 2141,153 L.Ed.2d 260 (2002), the magistrate judge reasoned that a successive Colo. R.Crim. P. 35(c) motion ultimately resolved on the merits by the Colorado Court of Appeals was not \u201cproperly filed\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2244(d)(2) because the motion was not presented within three years of the date of conviction as required by Colo.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 16-5-402(1). <em>See Artuz v. Bennett, </em>531 U.S. 4, 8, 121 S.Ct. 361, 148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000) (court may consider time limits upon delivery in determining whether an application is \u201cproperly filed\u201d). Here, the Colorado Court of Appeals declined to address the timeliness issue regarding (what it considered to be) Mr. Price\u2019s fourth Rule 35(c) motion, instead reaching the merits of his state-law procedural competency claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I R. Doc. 33, Ex. T at 3-7. The federal magistrate judge reasoned in part that because the state contested timeliness, this Rule 35(c) motion was untimely and could not toll the federal one-year limitation period. We could not accept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>this conclusion at this point because the magistrate judge did not consider whether under Colorado law a showing of \u201cjustifiable excuse or excusable neglect\u201d rendered this Rule 35(c) motion timely. <em>See </em>Colo. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 16-5-402(2)(d); <em>People v. Wiedemer, </em>852 P.2d 424, 441-42 (Colo. 1993); <em>see also Drew v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>297 F.3d 1278, 1284-1285 (11th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 123 S.Ct. 1364, 155 L.Ed.2d 205 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Be that as it may, we are in agreement with the magistrate judge and the district court that, to the extent they raise federal claims, Mr. Price\u2019s unexhausted claims are procedurally barred, and that he has not demonstrated cause and prejudice, or a fundamental miscarriage of justice to excuse that procedural default. I R. Doc. 40 at 28-32. We also agree that resolution of Mr. Price\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim by the Colorado courts does not constitute an unreasonable application of federal law. I R. Doc. 40 at 32-37. For substantially those reasons,</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">We DENY a COA, DENY IFP status as moot, and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b318-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b318-13\">. It should be noted that in ruling on Mr. Price\u2019s first Rule 35(c) motion, filed outside the three-year period in Colo.Rev.Stat 16-5-402(1), the Colorado Court of Appeals reached the merits of Mr. Price\u2019s ineffectiveness claim and also declined to address whether the motion was timely.
