Geiger, an Ohio resident proceeding pro se and in forma pauperis, appeals the district court order dismissing his action filed pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692, et seq. This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-23\">Seeking monetary relief, Geiger sued Creditors Interchange, Inc. (Creditors), a collections agency. Geiger alleged that Creditors violated the FDCPA by: (1) communicating with him without identifying itself as a debt collector; and (2) continuing to communicate with him after he told Creditors to cease and desist. The magistrate judge granted Geiger in forma pauperis status, screened the complaint, and recommended dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>recommendation over Geiger\u2019s objections and dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">In his timely appeal, Geiger argues that: (1) the debt collector warning language of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(ll) must be incorporated into every communication between a debt collector and a consumer; (2) Creditors violated the FDCPA by contacting him directly after he instructed them to only communicate through Creditors\u2019 attorney; and (3) he was entitled to a default judgment because Creditors did not file an answer to his complaint within the time provided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). <em>McGore v. Wrigglesworth, </em>114 F.3d 601, 604 (6th Cir.1997). In reviewing a dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim, this court must accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true. <em>See Lewis v. ACB Bus. Servs., Inc., </em>135 F.3d 389, 405 (6th Cir.1998). \u201c[A] complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Mayer v. Mylod, </em>988 F.2d 635, 638 (6th Cir.1993) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Geiger\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim. Geiger alleged that Creditors contacted him by letter on April 11, 2002, demanding money in collection of an alleged debt. Geiger responded with a letter disputing the debt and requesting that Creditors cease and desist from contacting him. Creditors sent a second letter on May 7, 2002, which Geiger attached to his complaint. The letter was marked in reference to a \u201cPotential Violation of FDCPA,\u201d informed Geiger that Creditors had requested verification of the debt as Geiger had requested, and denied his claim for damages because Creditors\u2019 review of its collection notes found that its initial demand notice and disclosure were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">Geiger\u2019s allegations did not amount to a violation of the FDCPA. Geiger did not allege that Creditors\u2019 initial communication of April 11, 2002, violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(ll). Under the current version of the statute, any later communication only had to disclose that the communication was from a debt collector. <em>See id. </em>The district court properly held that Creditors\u2019 May 7, 2002, letter complied with the statute because the letterhead and the body of the letter communicated clearly that Creditors is a debt collector. Moreover, because Creditors\u2019 letter was sent in response to Geiger\u2019s charge that Creditors had violated the FDCPA, it was not a communication conveying information regarding a debt and did not even require the notification language from \u00a7 1692e(ll). <em>See Chaudhry v. Gallerizzo, </em>174 F.3d 394, 410 (4th Cir.1999). Geiger\u2019s argument that the debt collector warning language of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(ll) must be incorporated into every communication between a debt collector and a consumer is without merit. Congress amended the statute in 1996 and eliminated that requirement. Thus, the cases Geiger relies on have been superceded.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">The district court also properly held that Creditors did not violate \u00a7 1692c(c) by contacting Geiger after he instructed the company to do so only through its attorney. Although the FDCPA prohibits a debt collector from communicating directly with a consumer if the debt collector knows that the consumer is represented by an attorney, <em>see </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692c(c)(2), there is no requirement that the debt collector must use its attorney to communicate with a consumer. Geiger\u2019s attempt to impose this require-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>merit unilaterally did not make Creditors\u2019s May 7, 2002, communication unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Finally, Geiger\u2019s argument that he was entitled to a default judgment is without merit. Geiger did not move for entry of default under Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(a) or for a default judgment under Rule 55(b). Quite simply, he was not entitled to relief that he did not request.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Accepting all of Geiger\u2019s allegations as true, he can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief. <em>See Lems, </em>135 F.3d at 405; <em>Mayer, </em>988 F.2d at 638. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
