Love was sentenced to 323 months incarceration and 10 years of supervised release, under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), 846 (2000). Love timely appealed. His appeal, through counsel and pro se, raises several issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-25\">First, Love argues he was subjected to an involuntary waiver of counsel when he was questioned directly by the sentencing court. This claim is meritless. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>The record reveals Love was represented by his counsel throughout his proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Second, Love argues his trial counsel was ineffective. The record does not conclusively establish Love\u2019s counsel was ineffective, and consequently, Love\u2019s claim cannot be raised on direct appeal, and must be asserted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1096, 120 S.Ct. 837, 145 L.Ed.2d 704 (2000); <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Third, Love challenges the validity of his indictment, and his 323 month sentence, and the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (2000), under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We review these claims for plain error. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770,123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. Dinnall, </em>269 F.3d 418, 424 (4th Cir.2001). These claims are meritless. Love cannot establish his indictment or sentence is flawed, or that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (2000) is unconstitutional. <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785-86, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002); <em>United States v. Promise, </em>255 F.3d 150, 152 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Fourth, Love argues he entered his guilty plea unknowingly and that consequently, his guilty plea is invalid. We review this claim de novo. <em>United States v. Damon, </em>191 F.3d 561, 564 n. 2 (4th Cir.1999). This claim is meritless. Love\u2019s statements at the plea hearing reveal he entered into his guilty plea knowingly and voluntarily. <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114,119 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Fifth, Love relies on 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 903 (2000) to assert he was not subject to federal jurisdiction for drug activity proscribed under state law, and on 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000) to assert the Government erred by failing to file an information as a prerequisite to sentencing him as a career offender. Love has waived these claims by failing to raise them in district court. <em>Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993). Additionally, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 903 does not deprive the federal government from criminalizing drug crimes proscribed by states, and Love\u2019s claim is therefore meritless. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 903 (2000). Furthermore, as Love\u2019s sentence was not enhanced under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) based on his prior convictions, his challenge to his sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 is meritless. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000); <em>United States v. Foster, </em>68 F.3d 86, 89 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Accordingly, we grant Love\u2019s pro se motions to file supplemental informal briefs, and we affirm Love\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not significantly aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
