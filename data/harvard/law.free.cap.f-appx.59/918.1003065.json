We affirm because we conclude that the Government proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Whitecloud violated the terms of his supervised release. The parties are familiar with the facts; thus, the facts are not restated herein except as necessary to explain our judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">To revoke supervised release, a district court must find by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated the terms of his supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2003). This court reviews a district court\u2019s decision to revoke supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>312 F.3d 1137, 1142 (9th Cir.2002). Because the issues presented in this appeal are questions of law, this court\u2019s review is <em>de novo. Id. See Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996) (noting that a district court necessarily abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">The district court found that Whitecloud violated the terms of his supervised release by (1) failing to accurately reflect on his August 2001 monthly supervision report receipt of Social Security benefits; (2) submitting a fraudulent Department of Motor Vehicles (\u201cDMV\u201d) application; and (3) stalking his dentist, Dr. Misako Hirota (\u201cHirota\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-13\">Whitecloud presents three arguments in this appeal. First, with regard to the failure to report his Social Security benefits, Whitecloud argues that by requiring him to correct the omission on his August 2001 monthly report, his probation officer\u2019s conduct \u201camounted to an election of remedies akin to the doctrine of \u2018estoppel by entrapment.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Appellant at 17. Whitecloud\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-14\">Election of remedies and estoppel by entrapment are discrete concepts. The doctrine of election of remedies \u201crefers to situations where an individual pursues remedies that are legally or factually inconsistent.\u201d <em>Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., </em>415 U.S. 36, 49, 94 S.Ct. 1011, 39 L.Ed.2d 147 (1974). \u201cThe entrapment-byestoppel-defense applies when an authorized government official tells the defendant that certain conduct is legal and the defendant believes the official.\u201d <em>United States v. Hancock, </em>231 F.3d 557, 567 (9th Cir.2000). There is no coherent argument, in law or fact, to support the proposition that either of these doctrines apply to the probation officer\u2019s September 2001 instruction that Whitecloud write in the correct information regarding his Social Security benefits for July 2001 on his August 2001 monthly report or to Whitecloud\u2019s subsequent compliance with that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>By indicating in his initial August 2001 monthly report that he had no income for the month of July, Whitecloud violated the condition of his supervised release requiring him to submit a complete and truthful report to his probation officer within the first five days of the month.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Second, with regard to his DMV application, Whitecloud argues that the Government failed to establish a violation of California Penal Code section 118,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which proscribes perjury, because there was no evidence that his false negative response to the question of whether he had ever applied for a California identification card under any other name was material. Whitecloud argues that because his legal name is Russell Whitecloud, he would have been issued the identification card even if he had answered the question truthfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">The test for materiality under section 118, generally, is whether the false statement <em>might have affected </em>the outcome of the proceeding. <em>People v. Feinberg, </em>51 Cal.App.4th 1566, 60 Cal.Rptr.2d 323, 329 (1997). It is clear that, had Whitecloud answered the application truthfully by indicating that he had applied before under many different names, he might not have been issued an identification card. Whether an individual previously has applied for DMV identifications under different names is particularly material to the DMV application because issuance of a State identification card gives credence to an individual\u2019s representation of who he or she is.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-13\">The Government demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that Whitecloud\u2019s false answer on the DMV application, which he certified as true under penalty of perjury, amounted to perjury in violation of the condition of his supervised release that he not commit another crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-14\">Third, with regard to the stalking of Dr. Hirota, Whitecloud maintains that his delivery of the December 2001 letter to Dr. Hirota did not violate California Penal Code section 646.9.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, Whitec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>loud argues that his conduct failed to amount to a \u201ccredible threat,\u201d as required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">Whitecloud\u2019s argument misses the mark. The combination of Whitecloud\u2019s pattern of conduct and -written statements amounted to a credible threat: his attempts to see Dr. Hirota at her office, including one successful attempt when he barged past the receptionist and into the sterilization area to find Dr. Hirota; his December 2001 sexually explicit letter, which indicated that he \u201cmust\u201d perform the described sexual acts \u201csoon\u201d; and his Christmas card referring back to the sexually explicit letter. It is clear that Whitecloud demonstrated his refusal to respect proper boundaries of conduct and that his December 2001 letter, in combination with his conduct, gave Dr. Hirota reason to fear that Whitecloud would move beyond fantasy to physical assault of a sexual nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">The Government proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the combination of Whitecloud\u2019s conduct and written statements amounted to an implied credible threat, and ultimately that Whitecloud stalked Dr. Hirota in violation of section 646.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s revocation of Whitecloud\u2019s supervised release and subsequent imposition of the twenty-four-month sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">Whitecloud\u2019s motion for reconsideration of his motions to file supplemental pro se briefs is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b943-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b943-11\">. Whitecloud was charged as Thomas Russel. Whitecloud offered evidence before the district court indicating that his legal name is Russel Whitecloud. Whitecloud\u2019s aliases include Ricardo Millar Lessur, Ricardo Lessur Millar, Walter Levinge, Thomas Roessler, Thomas Whitecloud, and Thomas John Russel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b944-6\">. Section 118 provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">[e]very person who, having taken an oath that he or she will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly before any competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any of the cases in which the oath may by law of the State of California be administered, willfully and contrary to the oath, states as true any material matter which he or she knows to be false, and every person who testifies, declares, deposes, or certifies under penalty of perjury in any of the cases in which the testimony, declarations, depositions, or certification is permitted by law of the State of California under penalty of perjury and willfully states as true any material matter which he or she knows to be false, is guilty of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 118 (West 2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b944-9\">.
