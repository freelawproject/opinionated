His conviction was affirmed on appeal, and the Colorado Supreme Court denied his petition for writ of certiorari. In this federal habeas action, Mr. MaePhaie claimed that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated and that he was denied due process. The district court granted his petition on the Sixth Amendment assertion, but denied the due process claim. In granting Mr. MacPhale\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim, the district court held he was entitled to resentencing. Mr. MaePhaie has since been resentenced and that sentence has been stayed pending the outcome of this appeal. On appeal, Mr. MaePhaie contends his due process rights were violated because insufficient evidence existed to convict him of being a motor vehicle dealer. Because Mr. MaePhaie does not make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), we deny his request for a Certificate of Appealability (COA) and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">A writ of habeas corpus will not be issued on a state claim adjudicated on the merits unless the claim \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), or was \u201can unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 2254(d)(2). \u201c[A] determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). Tenth Circuit authority is divided as to \u201cwhether, under AEDPA, we review a sufficieney-ofthe-evidence issue as a legal determination under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) or a factual finding under \u00a7 2254(d)(2) and (e)(1).\u201d <em>Romano v. Gibson, </em>239 F.3d 1156, 1164 n. 2 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1045, 122 S.Ct. 624, 151 L.Ed.2d 545 (2001) (fisting cases). Under either standard, Mr. MacPhale\u2019s claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">In examining Mr. MacPhale\u2019s sufficiency of the evidence claim, the appropriate inquiry is \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the fight most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). In rejecting Mr. MacPhale\u2019s claim, the state court did not rely on the <em>Jackson </em>standard but instead noted</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">[t]he issue before the trial judge is whether the relevant evidence both direct and circumstantial, when viewed as a whole and in the fight most favorable to the prosecution, is substantial and sufficient to support a conclusion by a reasonable mind that the defendant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>guilty of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Aplt. Appx., doc. 4 at 5 (citing <em>People v. Bennett, </em>183 Colo. 125, 515 P.2d 466, 469 (1973)). The Colorado Supreme Court has determined that <em>Bennett </em>is in accord with <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>sufficiency of the evidence due process standard. <em>See People v. Gonzales, </em>666 P.2d 123, 127 (Colo.1983). In accordance with the deference required by \u00a7 2254(d), we hold the state court\u2019s denial of Mr. MacPhale\u2019s habeas petition was not contrary to nor an unreasonable application of <em>Jackson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Mr. MacPhale was found guilty of acting as a motor vehicle dealer without a licence under Colorado Revised Statute \u00a7 12-6-120(2). The statute dictates \u201c[i]t is unlawful for any person to act as a motor vehicle dealer ... [or a] used motor vehicle dealer ... unless such person has been duly licensed under the provisions of this part 1____\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 12-6-120(2). A motor vehicle dealer is one \u201cwho is engaged wholly or in part in the business of selling new or new and used motor vehicles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 12-6-102(13). Likewise, the</p>\n<p id=\"Avq\">sale of three or more new or new and used motor vehicles or the offering for sale of more than three new or new and used motor vehicles at same address or telephone number in any one calendar year shall be prima facie evidence that a person is engaged in the business of selling new or new and used motor vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\"><em>Id. </em>Mr. MacPhale argues there was insufficient evidence to find him guilty of acting as a motor vehicle dealer without a licence because he did not sell any new vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">In rejecting Mr. MacPhale\u2019s claim, the state court pointed out that \u201c[t]he definition of Motor Vehicle Dealer refers to \u2018new or new and used motor vehicle[s]\u2019 [and] ... it also speaks of \u2018in whole or in part.\u2019 \u201d Aplt. Appx., doc. 4 at 3. It is undisputed that the jury heard evidence that Mr. MacPhale offered or attempted to sell more than three used vehicles from his home over a period of a year. Both the state court and the federal district court agreed it would have been preferable to instruct the jury on the definition of a used motor vehicle dealer, <em>see </em>Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 12-6-102(17) (\u201cThe sale of three or more used motor vehicles or the offering for sale of more than three used motor vehicles at the same address or telephone number in any one calendar year shall be prima facie evidence that a person is engaged in the business of selling used motor vehicles.\u201d). However, we also concur with their assessment that the absence of such an instruction did not violate Mr. MacPhale\u2019s constitutional right to due process. The statute under which Mr. MacPhale was convicted clearly includes within its scope \u201cused motor vehicle dealers.\u201d <em>See </em>Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 12-6-120(2). Therefore, the state court correctly determined that a rational trier of fact, when considering the undisputed evidence in favor of the prosecution, would have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">Because Mr. MacPhale\u2019s claim fails to make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), his request for a COA is DENIED and his appeal DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b339-10\"> After examining appellant\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, or collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
