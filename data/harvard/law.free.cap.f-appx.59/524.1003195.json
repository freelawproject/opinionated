It is undisputed that the accident occurred when plaintiff Pedro Arroyo lost control of the 1996 Ford Windstar that he was operating and the vehicle rolled over. As a consequence, one occupant of the vehicle was killed and the others were injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">Plaintiffs brought this diversity of citizenship action against Ford on negligence, strict liability and breach of warranty bases, contending that the tract bar of the vehicle separated causing Pedro Arroyo to lose control of the vehicle. The tract bar is a lateral support in the rear undercarriage of a vehicle controlling its suspension\u2019s side to side movement relative to the body of the vehicle. Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of the case was supported by Dr. Charles Benedict\u2019s expert testimony to the end that the welding holding the tract bar in place failed by reason of fatigue and thus ruptured. While Ford acknowledged that when the vehicle was examined after the accident the tract bar was found to be detached, it attributed the detachment to the force of the accident. Consequently, the issue for the jury was whether the detachment of the tract bar was the cause of or was brought about by the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">Prior to the trial Ford filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude certain of plaintiffs\u2019 proposed testimony. After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the district court entered an order denying Ford\u2019s motion seeking to preclude Benedict from giving his opinion as to the cause of the accident. The court, however, excluded plaintiffs\u2019 evidence of vehicle testing on a different vehicle demonstrating the effect on the operation of a vehicle of a detached tract bar. In making this ruling it applied Fed.R.Evid. 702 and <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993). It also relied on this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Gladhill v. General Motors Corp., </em>743 F.2d 1049, 1052 (4th Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">The district court in excluding the testing testimony rendered a comprehensive opinion in which it explained that the testing \u201cfailed to include any runs wherein the tract bar became dislodged while the vehicle was in motion. The ... testing consisted exclusively of test runs with the tract bar attached or ... detached.\u201d Moreover, the court held that steering inputs Benedict used to simulate what would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>happen when the tract bar failed were not shown to represent fairly Pedro Arroyo\u2019s actual driving. As plaintiffs explain in their brief, the \u201cdistrict court\u2019s ruling excluding the testing evidence is the focus of this appeal.\u201d Brief at 3. We review the district court\u2019s order on an abuse of discretion basis. <em>See General Elec. Co. v. Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136, 141, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997); <em>United States v. Bavrile, </em>286 F.3d 749, 753 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">We affirm. Surely, in view of the deviation of the testing conditions from those at the time of the accident, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in excluding the testing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
