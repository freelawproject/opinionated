Cruse appeals from his conviction on crack cocaine charges, as well as his sentence. Defendant claims the following: 1) his written statement to police should have been suppressed; 2) a witness\u2019 statement about another charge against Defendant unfairly prejudiced his right to a fair trial; 3) the district court\u2019s exclusion of a defense witness violated Defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment Compulsory Process Clause rights; and 4) the district court\u2019s failure to insure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>that Defendant and his attorney had discussed the presentence investigation report before the sentencing constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">For the following reasons, we AFFIRM Defendant\u2019s conviction but VACATE Defendant\u2019s sentence and REMAND the case to the district court for a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\n<em>Arrest and Interrogation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">In November 1999, Demetrius Blake-more became a paid informant for the Jackson Police Department in Tennessee. As part of his services, Blakemore allowed the police to wire his telephone. He then had a taped telephone conversation with Defendant, during which they discussed a crack cocaine purchase. The police provided Blakemore with money, and on February 16, 2000 and March 2, 2000, Blakemore purchased, respectively, 70.7 and 23.2 grams of cocaine base from Defendant while the police personally monitored and made audio and videotapes of the transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">On April 25, 2000, Defendant\u2019s vehicle was pulled over on suspicion of a robbery. During this stop, the police searched Defendant\u2019s car, discovered marijuana, and arrested him. At the police station, he was interrogated by Sergeant Leslee Hallenback, a thirteen-year veteran of the Jackson Police Department, about the two controlled drug buys with Blakemore. During the course of this interrogation, Defendant signed a form waiving his rights pursuant to <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), and he signed a separate statement confessing to selling crack cocaine. On August 21, 2000, a federal grand jury in the Western District of Tennessee indicted Defendant on two counts of distributing cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and aiding and abetting the same, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Defendant pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"A2\">\n<em>The Suppression Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">Defendant moved to suppress the statement he gave while in custody, arguing that it was obtained through coercive measures in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights. The district court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the motion. At the hearing, Sergeant Hallenback testified on direct examination that she read Defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that he signed a waiver form, which Hallenback and Lieutenant Patrick Willis signed as witnesses. Defendant also placed a check-mark next to each provision in the waiver form as it was read aloud to him by Hallenback. She further testified that Defendant never invoked his rights to silence or counsel and that he was very cooperative and appeared coherent. Hallenback denied threatening Defendant with life imprisonment or promising any sort of benefits to Defendant for his cooperation. On cross examination, Hallenback acknowledged telling Defendant that she anticipated bringing him into federal court but denied telling him that he could receive a sentence of ten years to life in prison. She also acknowledged informing Defendant about the possibility of a downward departure motion, lowering his sentence if he cooperated, pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5K1.1 (\u201c5K1.1 motion\u201d), but that she told him such a motion was at the United States Attorney\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">Defendant testified that after he was arrested and placed into a jail cell, he was summoned into a small room with Sergeant Hallenback and Lieutenant Willis, where Hallenback told him, \u201cMe and [Lieutenant Willis] work for the feds now, and we\u2019ve got you on a large crack cocaine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>sale. You\u2019re facing life in prison. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m here to help you, Jimmy.\u201d (J.A. at 69.) She also stated, \u201cYou\u2019re facing life in prison with your past record, and the Jackson Narcotics cannot help you. You\u2019re in the federal system. This is my world. I decide what happens here.\u201d (J.A. at 70.) According to Defendant, she requested his cooperation. Defendant requested an attorney, and she replied, \u201cA lawyer cannot help you. You\u2019re in my world. You\u2019re in federal court. I will decide what goes and what doesn\u2019t.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>He explained that he signed the waiver form because Hallenback told him the government \u201cwould prosecute me to the fullest unless I signed everything that everything [sic] she said----\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Defendant also told her he just had a baby, and she replied. \u201cWell, it\u2019s too bad about your child. Life in the federal system means you die there.\u201d (J.A. at 71.) Defendant testified that he became ill and that Lieutenant Willis escorted him to the bathroom several times. On cross examination Defendant denied having been read his rights; he only recalled hearing that he was facing life imprisonment and would never see his child again, and \u201ceverything went blank\u201d after that. Defendant acknowledged that the statement of confession was his and that the signature and initials on the pages were written by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">At the close of the hearing the district court denied Defendant\u2019s motion. In doing so, the court credited Hallenback\u2019s testimony that she did not threaten life imprisonment, over Defendant\u2019s testimony that she did. The court further pointed out that Defendant signed the waiver form clearly stating his rights to silence and an attorney, and that it did not believe Defendant, an \u201castute\u201d individual, failed to read the form or understand what he was signing. The court concluded, \u201cIt appears what happened was that Mr. Cruse was concerned about the predicament he was in, and at the time it seemed like a good idea to cooperate. He has since discovered that he wished he hadn\u2019t done that, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the cooperation was coerced or it was extorted or it was a result of any undue influence.\u201d (J.A. at 81-82.)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">At trial, Blakemore testified for the government about the controlled drug buys, as did several police officers who listened in on the telephone calls and personally monitored the transactions. The audiotapes and videotapes relating to the drug buys were also played for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">Sergeant Hallenback also testified for the government about her role in the controlled drug buys. During cross examination the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">Q: Before you started [your interrogation of Defendant], you and Lieutenant Willie were in there; correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">A: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-13\">Q: And you told [Defendant] or Lieutenant Willie told him, I believe, that he was going to end up dead or with life in prison if he didn\u2019t cooperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-14\">A: No, we did not tell him that. We sat down to the interview, and he started talking, and he was talking about he just got picked up on that other charge. [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I\u2019m going to object to any of that. THE COURT: Yes, sir. Any other charges aren\u2019t related to this. Ladies and gentlemen, you\u2019ll disregard any reference to any other charges. We\u2019ve got a charge here that you\u2019re trying, and that\u2019s the only one that matters in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-15\">(J.A. at 262-68.)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-16\">After defense counsel\u2019s cross examination concluded, the government rested its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>case. When asked about possible defense witnesses, defense counsel advised the court that he had issued a subpoena to a person named Cecily Odom but that she was ill in the hospital. He then stated his intent not to present any evidence. While the court was asking Defendant questions to insure that he was fully informed about his right to testify, Defendant stated his wish that Odom testify, saying that she would be available the following week. The court asked defense counsel for a proffer of the anticipated testimony. Counsel informed the court that Odom told him she had seen Blakemore on various occasions begging Defendant for drugs, trying to give Defendant cocaine powder, and smoking marijuana with Defendant. However, Odom later stated that she did not want to testify. The court asked defense counsel about the proffered testimony\u2019s relevance, to which counsel stated it was \u201cremotely relevant\u201d in that it provided some impeachment evidence of a government witness\u2019 character. Defense counsel added, \u201cNow, as far as being a defense, a legal defense to the case here, I really don\u2019t see that it is. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d be allowed to introduce the majority of it even if we had her here, so I don\u2019t know.\u201d (J.A. at 272.) The court concluded that the evidence was not relevant and refused to grant Defendant leave to produce Odom. Defendant did not testify, and the defense did not introduce any evidence or present any witnesses. The jury convicted Defendant on all charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">\n<em>The Sentencing Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Subsequently a presentence investigation report (PSI) was prepared. The PSI noted that Defendant was twenty-seven years old at the time, he had two years of college education, and he reported no mental or emotional illnesses. Based on the drug weight and a criminal history category of III, the PSI calculated a guideline range of 132 to 168 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court asked Defendant if he had read the PSI. Defendant said that he had, but that he did not understand much of it. The court replied, \u201cOkay. Well, there\u2019s a lot of it that a lot of people don\u2019t understand, but you\u2019ve had an opportunity to look at it and talk to Mr. Mayo.\u201d The Defendant replied, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d (J.A. at 278.) The court said, \u2018You\u2019ve not talked to Mr. Mayo about it.\u201d Defendant again replied, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d The district court then mentioned a <em>pro se </em>motion of dismissal Defendant recently had filed, remarking, \u201cI sense that you\u2019re becoming somewhat of a jailhouse lawyer,\u201d and informing Defendant that it would not rule on Defendant\u2019s \u201chomemade motions that aren\u2019t appropriate.\u201d (J.A. at 279.) Defendant replied that he understood but was only trying to obtain evidence from his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Defense counsel then told the court that he was not hiding anything from Defendant and that Defendant had become increasingly difficult, as he only wanted to discuss issues of guilt, not sentencing. Defendant again explained that he had been trying to obtain some evidence from his attorney and to get him to subpoena various police officers for the sentencing hearing. Defense counsel insisted that he did not have the information Defendant requested and that he \u201cha[d] never had as much difficulty trying to speak with a defendant or a client as [he] had with [Defendant] after this trial.\u201d (J.A. at 282-83.)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Apparently aggravated with Defendant\u2019s behavior, the court decided to proceed with sentencing Defendant. No further discussions occurred to ascertain that Defendant and his counsel had discussed the PSI. The court sentenced him to 144 months imprisonment, followed by five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>years of supervised release. Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\n<em>1. Defendant\u2019s Statements During Police Interrogation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\"><em>\u201cWe </em>review the district court\u2019s factual findings with respect to a motion to suppress for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Denton, </em>246 F.3d 784, 787 (6th Cir.2001) (citing <em>United States v. Roark, </em>36 F.3d 14,16 (6th Cir.1994)). In other words, we accept the district court\u2019s factual findings unless we have a \u201c \u2018definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>301 F.3d 666, 668 (6th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948)). Moreover, because the district court is best positioned to determine credibility, we do not disturb its credibility findings. <em>United States v. Hill, </em>195 F.3d 258, 264-65 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Defendant argues that his written statement to the police should have been suppressed because the statement was made involuntarily. Specifically, he contends that Sergeant Hallenback\u2019s statements that she had a case on him, that he was facing a life imprisonment sentence, and that a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion meant that cooperation could help him amounted to a combination of pressure and false promises that frightened him into signing the waiver form and confession statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution deems inadmissible confessions obtained through coercive means. <em>See United States v. Murphy, </em>763 F.2d 202, 205 (6th Cir.1985), <em>cert denied, </em>474 U.S. 1063, 106 S.Ct. 812, 88 L.Ed.2d 786 (1986). When a defendant asserts that a confession was coerced, the government bears the burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant\u2019s confession was voluntary. <em>Lego v. Twomey, </em>404 U.S. 477, 489, 92 S.Ct. 619, 30 L.Ed.2d 618 (1972). A determination regarding voluntariness must consider the totality of the circumstances and takes into account the following factors:</p>\n<p id=\"A2t\">the age of the accused, his level of education and intelligence, his physical condition and emotional state at the time of the confession, his expressed fears of violent reprisals, actual physical punishment, the proximity of the coerciveness of the confession as given, and the inherent coerciveness of the confession as given.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\"><em>United States v. Wrice, </em>954 F.2d 406, 411 (6th Cir.1992) (citing <em>Murphy, </em>763 F.2d at 205). Other relevant elements include \u201cthe length of the interrogation, its location, [and] its continuity.\u201d <em>Withrow v. Williams, </em>507 U.S. 680, 693, 113 S.Ct. 1745, 123 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">In this case, Defendant\u2019s testimony that he was not read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, that he was denied access to an attorney upon request, and that Sergeant Hallenback told him that he was facing life imprisonment, conflicted with that of Sergeant Hallenback, which the district court expressly credited over that of Defendant. While Defendant claims that he neither read nor understood the waiver form before signing it, the district court chose not to believe this testimony, deeming him an \u201castute\u201d person who knew his rights and would not sign a statement without having first read it and understood it. This finding was not clearly erroneous, given Defendant\u2019s college background and his prior involvements with the criminal justice system (as reflected in the PSI\u2019s assignment to him of a Criminal History Category III).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Therefore, the only undisputed evidence of alleged coercion consists of Sergeant Hallenback\u2019s statements that Defendant would be brought into federal court and that the 5K1.1 motion was a possibility upon his cooperation with the government. Although \u201ca promise of leniency is relevant to determining whether a confession was involuntary and, depending on the totality of the circumstances, may render a confession coerced,\u201d <em>Clanton v. Cooper, </em>129 F.3d 1147, 1159 (10th Cir.1997) (citing <em>Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 286-87, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991)). a statement about possible leniency upon cooperation is not generally impermissible.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Williams v. Withrow, </em>944 F.2d 284, 289 (6th Cir.1991) (acknowledging that some degree of \u201ccarrot-and-stick approach to eliciting information from an uncooperative suspect\u201d is acceptable), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>507 U.S. 680, 113 S.Ct. 1745, 123 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Sergeant Hallenback\u2019s statements do not amount to coercion as a matter of law. Defendant does not allege that he was threatened in any physical manner or that the agents physically mistreated him. Indeed, he acknowledged in his testimony that he was permitted to use the bathroom upon request. Moreover, Defendant\u2019s age, level of education and intelligence, and emotional state do not suggest coercion. Defendant was twenty-seven years old at the time, he had two years of college education, and he had no mental or emotional illnesses. Therefore, we find that the record does not support a finding that Sergeant Hallenback\u2019s interrogation was coercive.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\n<em>2. Statement at Trial About Another Charge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Defendant argues that Sergeant Hallenback\u2019s statement during her testimony that Defendant had \u201cjust got picked up on that other charge\u201d unfairly prejudiced his right to a fair trial. In this case, however, defense counsel immediately objected, and the court sustained the objection, instructing the jury to disregard the statement. Defendant did not request a mistrial, but he implicitly argues on appeal that the statement was so prejudicial the district court should have declared a mistrial <em>sua sponte. </em>We will reverse a district court\u2019s decision not to declare a mistrial based on improper testimony only if it abused its discretion. <em>See United States v. Yang, </em>281 F.3d 534, 549 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">\u201c[Wjhere deliberately injected testimony concerning unrelated offenses prejudices the defendant, we will not hesitate to reverse verdicts that may have been reached because of the potential influence of such statements.\u201d <em>United States v. Forrest, </em>17 F.3d 916, 921 (6th Cir.1994). However, we have held that where a trial judge strikes the statement from the record and provides a curative instruction, and ample evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt exists, the statement is not unfairly prejudicial. <em>See id. </em>(holding that despite intentionally \u201cblurted\u201d statement, mistrial was not required because of \u201cclear admonition by the judge\u201d and \u201cample other evidence of guilt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">It appears likely that Sergeant Hallenback intentionally blurted the information about the \u201cother charge\u201d pending against Defendant. Defense counsel asked Sergeant Hallenback a narrow question about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>whether she and the other interrogating officer told Defendant he would end up dead or a with a life sentence if he did not cooperate. Hallenback denied making that statement, then proceeded to supply the unnecessary sentence about \u201cthat other charge.\u201d (J.A. at 262.) Sergeant Hallenback, a thirteen-year veteran of the Jackson Police Department, knew better. <em>See United States v. Ortiz, </em>507 F.2d 1224, 1226 (6th Cir.1974) (finding a similar \u201cblurted\u201d statement of an FBI agent to have been deliberately made, based on his \u201ctraining and experience that records of arrests not resulting in conviction are not generally admissible in evidence and that reference to such on the witness stand usually would be prejudicial and reversible error\u201d), <em>quoted with approval in United States v. Andrea, </em>538 F.2d 1255, 1256 (6th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Nevertheless, the error was harmless. Sergeant Hallenback\u2019s statement was immediately objected to and sustained with a curative instruction. Moreover, ample evidence existed supporting Defendant\u2019s guilt, not the least of which included his written confession, the testimony of informant Blakemore and several law enforcement officers, taped conversations between Blakemore and Defendant regarding the drug buys, and the audio and videotapes of the two drug transactions. In light of the weighty evidence supporting guilt, Defendant did not suffer unfair prejudice regarding Sergeant Hallenback\u2019s statement, and we will not reverse his conviction on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\n<em>3. District Court\u2019s Exclusion of a Defense Witness at Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Defendant argues that the district court\u2019s decision not to permit testimony from his proposed witness, Cecily Odom, violated his constitutional rights pursuant to the Compulsory Process Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which required the district court to permit Odom\u2019s testimony. The government argues that the district court ruled correctly because the proffered testimony was not properly admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary determinations for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Hawkins, </em>969 F.2d 169, 174 (6th Cir.1992). However, when the evidentiary ruling involves an alleged violation of Sixth Amendment rights, the constitutional issue is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Hamilton, </em>128 F.3d 996, 999 (6th Cir.1997) (citing <em>United States v. Lloyd, </em>10 F.3d 1197, 1216 (6th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">The Sixth Amendment\u2019s Compulsory Process Clause provides to a defendant \u201cthe right to call witnesses that are \u2018material and favorable to his defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wong v. Money, </em>142 F.3d 313, 325 (6th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal, </em>458 U.S. 858, 867, 102 S.Ct. 3440, 73 L.Ed.2d 1193 (1982)). However, \u201c[this right] is not unlimited, but rather is subject to reasonable restrictions.\u201d <em>United States v. Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. 303, 308, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 140 L.Ed.2d 413 (1998). Generally, \u201c[f]or denial of a defendant\u2019s proffered testimony to constitute reversible error, the testimony must establish a reasonable doubt about guilt in light of the record in the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Reifsteck, </em>841 F.2d 701, 705 (6th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">Moreover, the defendant \u201cmust comply with established rules of procedure and evidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence.\u201d <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 302, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973). The Supreme Court has held that \u201c[s]uch rules do not abridge an accused\u2019s right to present a defense so long as they are not \u2018arbitrary\u2019 or \u2018disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve.\u2019 \u201d <em>Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>308 (quoting <em>Rock v. Arkansas, </em>483 U.S. 44, 56, 107 S.Ct. 2704, 97 L.Ed.2d 37 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">In this case, the proffered testimony was not admissible. At trial, defense counsel stated that it hoped to impeach government witness Blakemore through specific instances of conduct. Such impeachment evidence must comply with Rule 608(b), which provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Specific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness\u2019 credibility, other than conviction of crime as provided in rule 609, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. They may, however, in the discretion of the court, if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness, be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness (1) concerning the witness\u2019 character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, or (2) concerning the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of another witness as to which character the witness being cross-examined has testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Fed.R.Evid. 608(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The Rule 608(b) prohibition applies squarely to the present case, where Defendant sought to introduce Odom\u2019s testimony for the purpose of attacking a witness\u2019 credibility. Because such rule is \u201cnot \u2018arbitrary\u2019 or \u2018disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve,\u2019 \u201d <em>Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. at 308, exclusion of the testimony did not offend the Compulsory Process Clause. Moreover, admission of the testimony would have done little to \u201cestablish a reasonable doubt about guilt,\u201d <em>Reifsteck, </em>841 F.2d at 705, given the surveillance evidence of Defendant\u2019s distribution of cocaine base to Blakemore.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">\n<em>4. Adherence to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(e)(3)(A) at the Sentencing Hearing.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">Defendant contends that during the sentencing hearing, the district court failed to determine adequately whether he and defense counsel had read and discussed the PSI pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(c)(3)(A), and thus resentencing is required. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">\u201cBefore imposing sentence, the [district court] must: (A) verify that the defendant and defendant\u2019s counsel have read and discussed the presentence report made available under subdivision (b)(6)(A).\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the district court need not explicitly ask a defendant whether he and his attorney have read and discussed the report, the court must <em>\u201csomehow </em>determine that defendant and counsel have had an opportunity to read and discuss\u201d it. <em>United States v. Stevens, </em>851 F.2d 140, 143 (6th Cir.1988) (emphasis in original). Furthermore, \u201cthe fact that a defendant and his counsel may have discussed issues contained in the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>port is insufficient \u2014 there must be evidence on the record that the defendant and his counsel have read and discussed the report.\u201d <em>United States v. Osborne, </em>291 F.3d 908, 910 (6th Cir.2002). Failure to comply with Rule 32(c)(3)(A) requires a remand for resentencing. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Mitchell, </em>243 F.3d 953, 955 (6th Cir .2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">In this case, the district court asked Defendant if he and his attorney had discussed the PSI, and Defendant said no. Defense counsel provided no assurance that discussions had taken place, but instead stated that Defendant had become difficult. After Defendant repeatedly referred to trial issues, the district court decided to proceed with the sentencing. The district court apparently grew frustrated with Defendant\u2019s attempts to act as a \u201cjailhouse lawyer\u201d and to file \u201chomemade motions that [were not] appropriate.\u201d (J.A. at 279.) Nevertheless, frustration with a less-than-cooperative defendant does not justify proceeding with sentencing in violation of Rule 32(e)(3)(A)\u2019s requirements. Therefore, we vacate Defendant\u2019s sentence and remand the case for a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Defendant\u2019s conviction, VACATE his sentence, and REMAND the case to the district court for a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-5\">. Although Defendant argues on appeal that he was promised leniency, the district court specifically credited Sergeant Hallenback\u2019s testimony that she made no promises of leniency, and such a credibility determination should not be disturbed now. Moreover, Defendant\u2019s testimony does not support his contention; it alleged only that Sergeant Hallenback implied that the government could reward his full cooperation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b104-8\">. Defendant argues for the first time on appeal that the district court misunderstood the reason he wanted to present Odom's testimony, and that the actual purpose was to mount a possible entrapment defense. A review of the record, however, reflects that the district court specifically inquired about the relevancy of the proffered testimony, and that defense counsel replied that it was \"remotely relevant\u201d to Blakemore's \"bad character.\u201d (J.A. at 272.) Not only did defense counsel not even intimate that it wished to mount an entrapment defense, he expressly added that he did not believe the evidence would provide any sort of legal defense. We do not believe that the district court misunderstood Defendant's intentions as to Odom\u2019s testimony, and will not entertain an entrapment theory now.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b104-15\">. We note that, pursuant to an amendment effective December 1, 2002, this requirement is now found at Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(l)(A). However, because Defendant was sentenced prior to this effective date, we will refer to Rule 32(c)(3)(A) here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
