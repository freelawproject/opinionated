We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Rodriguez has not demonstrated that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of his constitutional claims, or the court\u2019s procedural rulings, debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1039, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>see also Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss these appeals. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
