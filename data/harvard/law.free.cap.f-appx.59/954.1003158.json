The government was thus obligated to honor its side of the bargain. Because the court below heard evidence the government should not have presented, we vacate defendant\u2019s sentence and remand for re-sentencing before another district judge. <em>See United States v. Mondragon, </em>228 F.3d 978, 981 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201c[T]his is in no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>sense to question the fairness of the sentencing judge; the fault here rests on the prosecutor .... \u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). At resentencing, the government shall perform its obligations under the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b978-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
