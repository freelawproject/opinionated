R.Civ.P. 56(c), on the grounds that no material issues of fact requiring a trial exist and defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Jacobson v. Deutsche Bank, A.G., </em>206 F.Supp.2d 590 (S.D.N.Y. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-21\">Plaintiff, a former employee of Deutsche Bank, A.G. (\u201cDeutsche Bank\u201d), brought an action for defamation against Rolf Breuer, Chief Executive Officer of Deutsche Bank, Edson Mitchell, his former supervisor,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Deutsche Bank. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants holding that \u201cJacobson is unable to prove the most fundamental element of his case \u2014 that Breuer actually uttered the allegedly defamatory statements at issue. Because we find that the Federal Rules of Evidence mandate exclusion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>the single piece of evidence offered by plaintiff to satisfy his burden on this element, we grant defendants\u2019 motion and dismiss the suit with prejudice.\u201d <em>See Jacobson v. Deutsche Bank AG., </em>206 F.Supp.2d 590 (S.D.N.Y.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Plaintiff alleged that Breuer made defamatory statements to Wolfgang Reuter, a reporter for the Bloomberg News Service (\u201cBloomberg\u201d), in German, after a speech by Breuer to the Frankfurt Law Society in Frankfurt, Germany on March 3,1998. The following day, March 4, 1998, Bloomberg issued a news report at 12:48 p.m. (\u201cArticle One\u201d), and a second, revised news report at 4:32 p.m. (\u201cArticle Two\u201d) that attributes certain quotations to Breuer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Jacobson\u2019s complaint claims that Breuer\u2019s statements defamed him by, <em>inter alia, </em>falsely blaming him for bond trading losses, falsely stating that he was \u201cdismissed\u201d from Deutsche Bank, and implying that he was a \u201closer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Breuer denies having made the statements attributed to him in Article One and denies even uttering Jacobson\u2019s name during the March 3, 1998 interview. <em>Jacobson, </em>206 F.Supp.2d at 591-92 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). Hartwig, the other Deutsche Bank employee present during the interview, also denies that Breuer made the allegedly defamatory statements at issue. <em>Id. </em>Reuter, the reporter for Bloomberg, invoked the journalist\u2019s privilege available under German law and refused to answer any questions regarding the interview. Jacobson exhausted all appeals of the Frankfurt District Court\u2019s order upholding Reuter\u2019s assertion of privilege to no avail. <em>Id. </em>at 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. See Fujitsu Ltd. v. Fed. Express Corp., </em>247 F.3d 423, 428 (2d Cir. 2001). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to Jacobson, drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor and determine whether there is indeed no issue of material fact in dispute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-13\">We review a District Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Burt Rigid Box, Inc. v. Travelers Prop. Cas. Corp., </em>302 F.3d 83, 92 (2d Cir.2002) (holding that \u201c[w]e reverse an evidentiary ruling by the District Court only if it is \u2018manifestly erroneous\u2019 such that the admission constitutes an abuse of discretion\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Schering Corp. v. Pfizer, Inc., </em>189 F.3d 218, 224 (2d Cir.1999) (same). \u201cAn evidentiary ruling that is an abuse of discretion is, however, only re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>versible if it also affects a party\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>Sobering Corp., </em>189 F.3d at 224 (citing Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)). The exclusion of a party\u2019s evidence in support of a material fact, and the concomitant failure by the party to prove that fact (as a result of the exclusion) defeats that party\u2019s claim, would affect plaintiffs substantial rights. <em>See O\u2019Neal v. Esty, </em>637 F.2d 846, 848 (2d Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">On appeal plaintiff argues that the two Bloomberg articles which allegedly quote Breuer are: (1) admissible as adoptive admissions which are not hearsay, pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(b);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) alternatively, if the two articles are hearsay, they are admissible under the residual or catchall exception to the hearsay rule; and (3) that the District Court improperly failed to consider whether the second article was defamatory by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">We have considered all of plaintiffs claims on appeal and, substantially for the reasons stated by the District Court in its Memorandum and Order dated June 14, 2002, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-13\">.
