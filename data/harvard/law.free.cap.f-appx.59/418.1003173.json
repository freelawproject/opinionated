Because he had two prior state felony convictions, he faced a mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment. After cooperating with the government, Soto received a sentence of only thirty-six months imprisonment followed by five years of supervised release. Soto was unable to participate in a substance abuse treatment program during this incarceration for reasons beyond his control. Upon his release from prison, Soto again began using drugs. Soto admitted he had violated the terms of his supervised release and was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment and four years supervised release. The district court recommended that Soto be involved in an intensive substance abuse treatment program known as the 500-hour program. Soto applied for the program and began participation but was unable to finish the program because, fearing for his safety, he asked to be placed in administrative segregation. Soto again relapsed almost as soon as he was released. This time the district court sentenced him to nine months imprisonment followed by thirty-three months supervised release. After release, Soto again used narcotics and failed to participate in required drug treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">After this third violation, the probation department requested revocation of Soto\u2019s supervised release. In its report to the court, the department stated incorrectly that application of the policy statements contained in Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines would result in a term of imprisonment of between three and nine months. The applicable guideline actually was eight to fourteen months. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4. The probation department also reminded the judge that the policy statements were not binding. Based on Soto\u2019s multiple violations and the clear link between those violations and his drug addiction, the probation department recommended that the court impose a sentence of thirty-six months imprisonment. The department also recommended that Soto participate in the 500-hour program and noted that \u201c[i]n order ... to be eligible for this program he must receive a minimum thirty-six month sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">At sentencing, the court noted that it had received and reviewed the Probation Department\u2019s report and that it contained a discussion of the Guidelines\u2019 policy statements. The government initially stated, incorrectly, that a thirty-three-month sentence was required because there is \u201ca 24 month waiting period to get into it.\u201d However, the government later explained that it was recommending thirty-six months because (1) Soto already had served two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>months, which would be applied against his sentence; (2) a certain additional period would be required for Soto to be designated to a facility that had the 500-hour program; (3) Soto would serve six months in a halfway house after completing the program; and (4) after completion of the program, Soto would be eligible for a reduction of up to a year in his sentence. The government stated that \u201c36 months is safe. It makes sure that he would be able to complete the 500-hour program.\u201d Defense counsel vigorously contested the factual underpinnings of the government\u2019s recommendation. She noted that not everyone was sent to a halfway house; Soto previously had been admitted to a drug treatment program when sentenced to twelve months imprisonment; and any reduction in Soto\u2019s sentence might be less than twelve months. The court imposed a sentence of thirty-six months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">On appeal, Soto argues that the sentence must be vacated and remanded because the court failed to consider the applicable policy statements, imposed a sentence that was plainly unreasonable in light of the court\u2019s goal of ensuring Soto\u2019s participation in substance abuse treatment, and relied on misinformation, thus denying Soto due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The policy statements concerning revocation of supervised release are not binding on the district court. <em>United States v. Kingdom (U.S.A.), Inc., </em>157 F.3d 133, 136 (2d Cir.1998). However, the court must consider those statements, and we will vacate and remand for resentencing where it appears that the district court intended to apply a policy statement but misinterpreted it. <em>Id. </em>The record in this case clearly reflects the court\u2019s knowledge of the guideline range set forth in the probation department\u2019s report. Although this range was lower than the actually applicable range, the district court\u2019s decision to impose a sentence well in excess of the actual range demonstrates that there is no risk the court would have imposed a lower sentence had it known the correct range. <em>Cf. id. </em>(vacating and remanding because district court\u2019s remarks made it appear the court intended to impose a sentence within the guidelines range contained in the policy statement but misinterpreted the policy statement).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Nor was Soto\u2019s sentence either plainly unreasonable or based on misinformation. The only factual error in the government\u2019s argument to the district court was its statement that there was a twenty-four-month waiting period for admission into the 500-hour program. The government later clarified that its calculation of thirty-three to thirty-six months for the completion of the program was based on several factors including the two months Soto had already been incarcerated, the time necessary for Soto to be designated to a facility that offered the program, the time necessary for Soto to complete the program as well as a subsequent half-way house assignment, and a potential reduction of up to twelve months in his sentence for completion of the program. Contrary to Soto\u2019s position, the government did not claim that Soto would necessarily receive a twelve-month reduction in his sentence. It is clear from the record as a whole that the government explained how it arrived at its conclusions concerning the appropriate sentence and that, in major part, it offered estimates not firm figures. Thus, the sentence does not rest on misinformation.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">The sentence is also reasonable. Although Soto may be able to complete the 500-hour program in less time than the district court calculated, the court reasonably chose to impose the sentence that would give this seriously addicted individual and repeat violator of supervised release the best possibility of completing the program and defeating his addiction. There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>fore, the sentence cannot be seen as plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Sweeney, </em>90 F.3d 55, 57 (2d Cir.1996) (stating that we review district court\u2019s sentence for violation of supervised release to determine whether it is \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">We previously have granted appellant\u2019s motion to file his reply brief nunc pro tunc. We also have directed that the government\u2019s supplemental appendix be filed and kept under seal. Defendant\u2019s motions are otherwise denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
