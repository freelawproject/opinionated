We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>Rodriguez-Sanchez lacks standing to challenge the district court\u2019s calculation of his sentence because he has completed serving his sentence. <em>See United States v. Palomba, </em>182 F.3d 1121, 1123 (9th Cir. 1999); see <em>also United States v. Johnson, </em>529 U.S. 53, 54, 120 S.Ct. 1114, 146 L.Ed.2d 39 (2000) (holding that time served in excess of prison sentence is not credited to the supervised release term).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Rodriguez-Sanchez\u2019s contention that sections 952 and 960 are facially unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), is foreclosed by our decisions in <em>United States v.

United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002), overruled the decisions in <em>Varela-Rivera </em>and <em>Mendoza-Paz </em>is foreclosed by <em>United States v.
