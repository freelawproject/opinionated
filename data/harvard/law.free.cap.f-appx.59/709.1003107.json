Kowalski argues that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in reopening Romano\u2019s bankruptcy case thirteen years after it was closed and erred in finding that her claim was discharged in the bankruptcy. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Romano filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings in May 1982. Kowalski was not listed as a creditor on Romano\u2019s schedules. A discharge order was entered in October 1982. The case was originally noticed as a no asset case, and creditors were not required to file proofs of claim. On August 29, 1984, however, a notice to file claims was issued stating that the trustee had identified funds for distribution. Creditors were ordered to file proofs of claim by November 29, 1984. The bankruptcy estate was distributed in 1986, and the case was closed in 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Romano\u2019s late husband, Thomas H. Glenn, was a licensed physician who operated the Glenn Clinic. On November 27, 1984, Kowalski brought a malpractice action in a Michigan state court against Romano, in her individual capacity and as representative of Dr. Glenn\u2019s estate, and against Robert I. Lubin, a licensed physician who was brought in to operate the Glenn Clinic after Dr. Glenn\u2019s death. Specifically, Kowalski claimed that (1) Dr. Glenn severed tendons in her foot dining a bunion removal procedure, (2) Romano assisted Dr. Glenn as a nurse and operated the clinic without a license for a period of time after her husband\u2019s death, and (3) Dr. Lupin further injured Kowalski while trying to repair the severed tendons. The alleged acts of Romano occurred between 1971 and 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">A default was entered against Romano in 1985. It appears that Kowalski had knowledge of the pending bankruptcy at that time based on affidavits and orders for substituted service which referenced the bankruptcy court file and Romano\u2019s bankruptcy attorney.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In October 1988, Kowalski obtained a default judgment against Romano for $300,000, plus interest and costs, after reaching a settlement with Dr. Lubin.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-11\">Romano had moved to Florida in 1982 and allegedly did not learn of the judgment until Kowalski tried to enforce it in Florida in October 1993. Romano sought to set aside the default judgment through the state appellate courts. When those efforts failed, she filed a motion in 1995 to reopen her bankruptcy case, list Kowalski as a creditor, and discharge the default judgment. The bankruptcy court granted the motion to reopen the bankruptcy case. After a second hearing, the bankruptcy court granted the motion to list Kowalski as a creditor, but denied the motion to discharge the judgment. The bankruptcy court ordered \u201c[t]he issue of discharge-ability shall be determined by adversary proceedings, as stated on the record.\u201d Kowalski\u2019s appeal to the district court was denied because the order reopening the bankruptcy was not a final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>Kowalski then filed an adversary complaint alleging that the default judgment was not dischargeable under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 528(a)(2), (3), (4), and (6). The bankruptcy court dismissed the adversary complaint for lack of progress. On appeal, the district court affirmed the reopening of the bankruptcy case but reversed the dismissal of the adversary complaint for lack of progress.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Kowalski and Romano testified at the trial on remand. The bankruptcy court found that Kowalski\u2019s claim was discharge-able because (1) there were no fraudulent misrepresentations made by Romano to Kowalski under \u00a7 523(a)(2); (2) there was no fiduciary relationship between Romano and Kowalski under \u00a7 523(a)(4); and (3) Romano did not willfully and maliciously cause Kowalski\u2019s injury under \u00a7 523(a)(6). Kowalski also argued that the judgment was not dischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(3) because she was an unscheduled creditor and did not receive notice to permit timely filing of a proof of claim and request for determination of dischargeability. The bankruptcy judge rejected this argument because he felt it had previously been addressed in the order reopening the case. The bankruptcy court then dismissed the adversary complaint, and Kowalski appealed to district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Kowalski again challenged the reopening of the bankruptcy case, as well as the finding that her judgment was discharged. The district court refused to reconsider the reopening argument because it was not included in the notice of appeal. The district court found that the bankruptcy court should not have made specific findings regarding Romano\u2019s actions in determining dischargeability under \u00a7 523(a)(6), but was bound by the default judgment under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Nonetheless, the district court found that because the allegations in the complaint were based in negligence and not willful and malicious conduct, the judgment was dischargeable. The district court also affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings under \u00a7 523(a)(4) because there were no allegations of fraud in the state court complaint and no fiduciary relationship between Kowalski and Romano. In the appeal to the district court, Kowalski\u2019s argument under \u00a7 523(a)(3) was referenced in a few sentences in the \u201cPrayer for Relief\u201d section of the brief. Presumably, the argument was overlooked because of its placement in the brief, and the district court did not address it. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">In an appeal from the decision of a district court on appeal from the bankruptcy court, this court independently reviews the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision, applying the clearly erroneous standard to findings of fact and <em>de novo </em>review to conclusions of law. <em>In re Madaj, </em>149 F.3d 467, 468 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">A. Motion to Reopen</p>\n<p id=\"b735-12\">The district court refused to review the reopening of the bankruptcy case because Kowalski\u2019s notice of appeal referenced only the order dismissing the adversary complaint. This court, however, has construed notices of appeal liberally to include previous judgments, even when they were not specified in the notice of appeal. <em>See Cattin v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>955 F.2d 416, 428 (6th Cir.1992). As a result, we will consider Kowalski\u2019s argument regarding the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to reopen the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-13\">A bankruptcy case may be reopened to \u201cadminister assets, to accord relief to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>debtor, or for other cause.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 350(b). We review a bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Rosinski, </em>759 F.2d 539, 541 (6th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Kowalski argues that the doctrine of <em>laches </em>bars the reopening of this case because she was prejudiced by her inability to receive any part of the distribution made in 1986. As will be discussed fully below, this argument goes to the separate issue of the dischargeability of her claim under \u00a7 523(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">A complaint to determine the dischargeability of a debt under \u00a7 523(a)(3) may be brought at any time by either the creditor or the debtor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4007(b). This court rule also provides that a bankruptcy case can be reopened for purposes of determining dischargeability without the payment of an additional filing fee. <em>Id. </em>Neither reopening the case nor adding a creditor to the schedule upon reopening affects the dischargeability of the creditor\u2019s debt. <em>See Madaj, </em>149 F.3d at 470. The better practice is to resolve the issues surrounding dischargeability in the underlying litigation on the adversary complaint. <em>See In re Staffer, </em>306 F.3d 967, 972 (9th Cir.2002) (bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion reopening a bankruptcy case six years after creditor learned of bankruptcy to permit adversary complaint to be filed to determine discharge-ability; issue of prejudice should be considered at trial on adversary complaint). The bankruptcy court correctly reopened the case and allowed Kowalski to file her adversary complaint in order to determine the dischargeability of the judgment as a separate matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">Even if prejudice should be considered as a bar to reopening a bankruptcy case, any prejudice Kowalski suffered was a result of her own inaction. It is undisputed that Kowalski had actual knowledge of the bankruptcy in 1985. The order for distribution of Romano\u2019s bankruptcy estate was not issued until November 12, 1986. Kowalski could have participated in the distribution by \u201ctardily\u201d filing a proof of claim pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 726(a)(2)(C). Under these circumstances, we find that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in reopening the bankruptcy case to determine the dischargeability of the default judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">B. Adversary Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">Kowalski\u2019s argument under \u00a7 523(a)(3) is relegated to the conclusion section of her appellate brief. The argument was not identified in the statement of issues or the summary of the arguments as required by Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(5) and (8). We could decline to consider the argument as not developed or supported by legal authority. <em>See United States v. Elder, </em>90 F.3d 1110, 1118 (6th Cir.1996) (\u201c[I]t is a \u2018settled appellate rule that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)). The bankruptcy court erred, however, in not addressing this argument below due to a misunderstanding of the scope of the order reopening the case. A review of that order shows that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>had not ruled on the dischargeability of Kowalski\u2019s claim under \u00a7 523(a)(3). In addition, Kowalski presented arguments regarding prejudice applicable to \u00a7 523(a)(3) in the portion of her brief challenging the decision to reopen the case. Finally, the only way for Kowalski to obtain a determination of dischargeability under \u00a7 523(a)(4) and (6) is through \u00a7 523(a)(3)(B).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The parties have been struggling with the state court judgment and the bankruptcy proceedings for over a decade. We will, therefore, address Kowalski\u2019s arguments under \u00a7 523(a)(3) to bring closure and to serve the interests of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">It is undisputed that Kowalski\u2019s claim was not listed on the bankruptcy schedules. Under the Bankruptcy Code, there is no requirement that a claim be scheduled in order to be discharged. <em>Madaj, </em>149 F.3d at 472. In addition, all claims that arise before the date of the discharge order are discharged whether or not a proof of claim is filed. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(b). The only limitation on discharge under \u00a7 727(b) is \u00a7 523, which contains the exceptions to discharge. In the context of faffing to schedule a creditor, nondischargeability can arise only under \u00a7 523(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Subsection 523(a)(3)(A) deals with unscheduled claims other than those specified in \u00a7 523(a)(2), (4), or (6). An unscheduled claim is not discharged under subsection (A) if the creditor does not have notice or actual knowledge of the bankruptcy to permit timely filing of a proof of claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Under \u00a7 523(a)(3)(B), a claim is nondischargeable if it is not listed or scheduled in time to permit:</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">(b) if such debt is of a kind specified in paragraph (2), (4), or (6) of this subsection, timely filing of a proof of claim and timely request for a determination of dischargeability of such debt under one of such paragraphs, unless such creditor had notice or actual knowledge of the case in time for such timely filing and request!.]</p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">In other words, a creditor\u2019s debt is exempt from discharge if she can show that her claim falls under \u00a7 523(a)(2), (4) or (6), and that she could not file a timely proof of claim or a timely request for a determination of dischargeability under \u00a7 523(a)(2), (4), or (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-12\">Under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502, a proof of claim may be disallowed if it is not timely filed. The time for filing proofs of claim is set forth in Fed. R. Bankr.P. 3002(b). In Chapter 7 cases, however, unlike Chapter 11, 12, and 13 cases, some untimely filed proofs of claim are allowed. Section 502(b)(9) provides that an untimely claim should be disallowed \u201cexcept to the extent tardily filed as permitted under subsection (1), (2) or (3) of \u00a7 726(a).\u201d In Chapter 7 cases, \u00a7 726(a)(2)(C) allows payments to unsecured creditors who submit \u201ctardily filed\u201d proofs of claim if the creditor had no notice or actual knowledge of the bankruptcy case to permit a timely filing. The tardy claim must be filed in time to permit payment, <em>i.e., </em>before the distribution of the bankruptcy estate. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 726(a)(2)(C)(ii). These payments are allowed the same priority as timely filed claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-13\">On its face, \u00a7 523(a)(3) does not differentiate between timely filed claims and tardily filed claims that share equally in the distribution of the bankruptcy estate. We know of no appellate decisions examining the interaction of \u00a7 523(a)(3) and \u00a7 726(a)(2)(C). Some bankruptcy courts have held that a debt must be excepted from discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(3) even if the creditor had knowledge in time to file a tardy proof of claim and fully participate in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>the distribution under \u00a7 726(a)(2)(C). They say to hold otherwise would render the \u201ctimely\u201d language in \u00a7 523(a)(3) meaningless. <em>See In re IIauge, </em>232 B.R. 141 (Bankr.D.Minn.1999); <em>In re Bosse, </em>122 B.R. 410 (Bankr.C.D.Cal.1990). Other courts have held, as we do today, that in Chapter 7 cases \u00a7 523(a)(3) must be read in conjunction with \u00a7 726(a)(2)(C). <em>See In re Ricks, </em>253 B.R. 734 (Bankr.M.D.La. 2000); <em>In re Ruhr, </em>132 B.R. 421, 424 (Bankr.E.D.Cal.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">The central purpose of the Bankruptcy Code is to allow the debtor to reorder her affairs and enjoy a fresh start. As a general matter, the exceptions to discharge in \u00a7 523(a) must be narrowly construed to promote this central purpose. <em>In re Meyers, </em>196 F.3d 622, 624 (6th Cir.1999). A creditor who has timely knowledge of a bankruptcy has many rights, including the right to question the debtor in the creditors\u2019 meeting. Section 523(a)(3), however, is only concerned with the ability to file a proof of claim. This must have deeper significance than the mere right to file a piece of paper in the bankruptcy court. The end result of filing a proof of claim is the right to receive a payment upon the distribution of the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy estate. Thus, the purpose of \u00a7 523(a)(3) must be the protection of the unscheduled creditor\u2019s right to share in the distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">If this is the purpose of \u00a7 523(a)(3), the determinative factor on timeliness must be whether the creditor filed a proof of claim in time to share in the distribution. In Chapter 11, 12, and 13 cases, there is only one date when this can occur. In Chapter 7 cases, however, creditors who file their proof of claim by the date specified in Rule 3002 share equally in the distribution with creditors who file by the date specified in \u00a7 726(a)(2)(C). Determining timeliness to include claims filed pursuant to \u00a7 726(a)(2)(C) is consistent with the policy in favor of discharge and a fresh start for the debtor. At the same time, it also serves the purpose of protecting the unscheduled creditor\u2019s right to share in the distribution of the bankruptcy estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Kowalski had knowledge of the bankruptcy in 1985 and could have tardily filed a proof of claim and fully participated as an unsecured creditor in the distribution in 1986. Thus, if Kowalski\u2019s claim is not of the kind specified in \u00a7 523(a)(2), (4) or (6), her debt is not exempt from discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">Kowalski alleges, however, that her claim is of the kind specified in \u00a7 523(a)(4) and (6) and, therefore, nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(3)(B). The time for filing a complaint to determine dischargeability in this Chapter 7 case under \u00a7 523(a)(4) or (6) was within 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4007(c). The first date set for the creditors meeting was in 1982, and there is no evidence that Kowalski had knowledge of the bankruptcy before 1985. Thus, although she could have tardily filed a proof of claim, she could not have filed a timely complaint to determine discharge-ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">We must then determine whether Kowalski\u2019s claim is of the kind specified in \u00a7 523(a)(4) or (6). Courts disagree on the degree of proof the creditor must offer under \u00a7 523(a)(3)(B) to show that her claim is of the kind specified in \u00a7 523(a)(4) or (6). Some hold that a creditor must prove the merits of her claim under \u00a7 523(a)(4) or (6) for it to be nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(3)(B). Others require the creditor to show only that she holds a viable \u00a7 523(a)(4) or (6) claim. Kowalski cannot meet either burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">Kowalski argues that her claim is the kind specified in \u00a7 523(a)(4) because while Romano was the fiduciary (the personal representative) of Dr. Glenn\u2019s estate, she fraudulently held herself out to be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>licensed physician, collected fees from patients of the Glenn Clinic, and kept the money for herself. Section 523(a)(4) excepts from discharge a claim for \u201cfraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity, embezzlement, or larceny.\u201d The claim must result from the fraud of the debtor acting as a fiduciary to the creditor. <em>See In re Garver, </em>116 F.3d 176, 179 (6th Cir.1997). Kowalski\u2019s default judgment against Romano in her individual capacity was not based on acts taken by Romano as the personal representative on behalf of Dr. Glenn\u2019s estate. Moreover, Kowalski did not assert that there was a fiduciary relationship between herself and Romano. Thus, the default judgment is not of the kind specified in \u00a7 523(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">With respect to Kowalski\u2019s claim under \u00a7 523(a)(6), the district court concluded that the default judgment should be given collateral estoppel effect in this subsequent bankruptcy proceeding. It is not necessary for us to determine whether Michigan law requires preclusive effect be given to default judgments. <em>See In re Calvert, </em>105 F.3d 315, 315 (6th Cir.1997) (Full Faith and Credit Statute directs federal court to refer to the preclusion law of the state in which the judgment was rendered). Even if we assume the default judgment should be given collateral estoppel effect, Kowalski cannot make a claim of nondisehargeability under \u00a7 523(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Section 523(a)(6) excepts from discharge any debt \u201cfor willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity.\u201d The Sixth Circuit has interpreted this to mean that the debtor must have desired to cause the consequences of her act, or believed that the consequences are substantially certain to result from it. <em>In re Markowitz, </em>190 F.3d 455, 464 (6th Cir.1999). A review of the state court complaint shows that Romano\u2019s alleged conduct sounds in negligence and medical malpractice. Paragraph 2 states that Romano treated Kowalski even though she was not licensed as a physician or nurse. Paragraph 6 states that Romano and Dr. Glenn recommended surgery to Kowalski. Paragraphs 7 and 8 state that Romano assisted Dr. Glenn in the surgery, and that both were \u201cnegligent and careless\u201d in the performance of the surgery. Paragraphs 9 and 10 state that Romano and other members of the clinic provided follow-up care that was \u201cnegligent and not in accordance with the standards of practice.\u201d Paragraphs 12 and 13 summarize all the acts and damages and characterize the acts of the defendants, including Romano, as \u201cnegligence\u201d and \u201cmalpractice.\u201d This alleged conduct, which is deemed admitted under Michigan law through the default judgment, does not constitute the willful and malicious conduct required by \u00a7 523(a)(6). There were no allegations that Romano desired or intended to injure Kowalski, or that Romano believed that Kowalski\u2019s injuries were substantially certain to result from Romano\u2019s actions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Kowalski\u2019s claim, therefore, is not of the kind specified in \u00a7 523(a)(6) and her judgment was properly discharged in the bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b734-8\">. The bankruptcy court found that Kowalski apparently knew about the bankruptcy at the time her state court complaint was initially filed on November 27, 1984. This would have been before the deadline for filing a proof of claim on November 29, 1984. A review of the pleadings and the testimony, however, reveals no evidence that Kowalski learned of the bankruptcy until after that date when the process server could not obtain service over Romano.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b735-7\">. Although Kowalski did not list the reopening of the bankruptcy proceedings as error in the notice of appeal, the district court nonetheless chose to address the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b736-6\">. A complaint to determine dischargeability under \u00a7 523(a)(2), (4), and (6) in a Chapter 7 case must be brought within 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of the creditors. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4007(c). An unscheduled creditor who did not have knowledge of the bankruptcy allowing her to timely file a complaint under \u00a7 523(a)(2), (4), or (6), however, is saved by \u00a7 523(a)(3)(B). A complaint under \u00a7 523(a)(3)(A) and (B) can be brought at any time. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(c)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b736-13\">. The decision to reopen is not challenged on the grounds of fraud or intentional design so we need not address them. <em>See Rosinski, </em>759 F.2d at 541.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b737-9\">.

The fact that Romano allegedly practiced nursing or medicine without a license and that this constitutes a felony under Michigan law is not relevant to the issue of willful and malicious conduct. An intentional or deliberate act alone does not constitute willful and malicious conduct under \u00a7 523(a)(6). There were no allegations that Romano intended to harm Kowalski by practicing medicine without a license or that she believed that Kowalski\u2019s injuries were substantially certain to result from that act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
