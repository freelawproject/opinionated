In 1992, a jury convicted petitioner of second degree murder and of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. After his motion for relief from the judgment was denied by the Michigan courts, petitioner brought this petition for a writ of habeas corpus. While denying the petition on all grounds, the district court issued a certificate of appealability on three grounds. Having considered petitioner\u2019s arguments on these three grounds, the district court\u2019s decision denying the writ of habeas corpus is AFFIRMED for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-19\">In 1992, petitioner was convicted of the murder of Sonya Davis (\u201cSonya\u201d). At petitioner\u2019s trial, Sonya\u2019s twin sister, Tanya Davis (\u201cTanya\u201d), was the prosecution\u2019s main witness. In her testimony, Tanya indicated that she had known petitioner for approximately ten years, that petitioner\u2019s nickname was \u201cJun,\u201d and that she did not like petitioner. While petitioner and Sonya had been dating, Sonya told Tanya on December 6, 1991, that Sonya had broken up with petitioner. The trial court admitted Sonya\u2019s statement that she and petitioner had broken up only for the non-hearsay purpose of showing why Tanya thought that Sonya and petitioner had broken up. Additionally, to make this limited purpose clear to the jury, the trial court instructed: \u201cI will let it in for this reason just to show why [Tanya] though [Sonya and petitioner] had broken up but it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>evidence. You may not consider it as evidence that [Sonya] and [petitioner] had broken up. Do you understand that? Only why [Tanya] thought they had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">On the afternoon of December 6, 1991, petitioner visited the sisters\u2019 apartment in Detroit. Tanya saw Sonya and petitioner come out of a bedroom in the apartment and noticed that Sonya seemed nervous. Later that evening around 10 o\u2019clock, Sonya answered the phone in the apartment. After hanging up the phone, Sonya told Tanya \u201cThat was Jim. He\u2019s on his way over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">About 20 minutes later, Tanya heard a car horn honk outside and identified the car horn honk with petitioner, as she had heard this honk every night petitioner picked up Sonya. Additionally, Sonya said \u201cthat\u2019s Jun\u201d and went downstairs. About two minutes later, Tanya heard a loud noise from outside. When she looked out the window, Tanya saw Sonya lying on the floor. She also observed petitioner limping away. As he limped away, Tanya noticed that petitioner placed an object in his pocket. Although it was dark outside, Tanya indicated that she was only 20 or 25 feet from petitioner, that the building lighted the area, and that her view was unobstructed. Furthermore, she emphasized that having known petitioner for 10 years, she was able to identify him by his car and his limp.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">On cross-examination, petitioner\u2019s counsel impeached Tanya\u2019s testimony by showing that in an earlier statement, Tanya had identified petitioner\u2019s car as a Cadillac. At trial, Tanya acknowledged that petitioner\u2019s car was a Buick Riviera. Tanya was also impeached concerning the lighting conditions. Originally, she indicated that it was just dark outside, but at trial, she stated that there was light coming from the apartment building. Petitioner also admitted on cross-examination that she could not tell whether the person was a man or a woman. Nonetheless, Tanya identified petitioner as the person that she saw outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">After petitioner\u2019s counsel concluded cross-examination, a juror submitted a question to the judge to ask Tanya. Based on this submission, the judge asked Tanya whether she had seen petitioner and Sonya fighting. Tanya answered the initial question and a series of follow up questions about fights between petitioner and Sonya. Petitioner\u2019s counsel again cross-examined Tanya. Through all of this questioning, Tanya indicated that she had seen some fights between petitioner and Sonya, that recently, she had just seen marks on Sonya and rips in Sonya\u2019s clothes but not the actual fighting, and that during the summer, petitioner had broken down Sonya\u2019s door.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">For his defense, petitioner argued that he did not murder Sonya and that he was at a friend\u2019s house drinking beer and talking all night. To support this defense, petitioner presented the testimony of his friend Russell Perkins (\u201cMr.Perkins\u201d) and testified in his own defense. Mr. Perkins testified that petitioner arrived at his home in Inkster around 9 o\u2019clock and that petitioner and Mr. Perkins were drinking beer and talking until they went to bed around midnight. Consistent with Mr. Perkins\u2019 testimony, petitioner testified that on December 6, 1991, he arrived at Mr. perkins\u2019 home in Inkster around 9 o\u2019clock in the evening and that he stayed overnight at Mr. Perkins\u2019 home. Additionally, petitioner stated that Sonya was his girlfriend, that he and Sonya got along well, and that he and Sonya did not physically fight. Petitioner also told the jury that he did not limp, and petitioner showed the jury how he walked to demonstrate that he did not limp. Finally, petitioner denied shooting Sonya. After deliberating, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>jury convicted petitioner of second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Although petitioner never filed a direct appeal with the Michigan courts, he filed a motion for relief from judgment. This motion was denied by the Detroit Recorder\u2019s Court on December 4,1996, and the Michigan Court of Appeals and the Michigan Supreme Court denied petitioner leave to appeal the denial of the motion. On November 17, 1998, petitioner filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus and asserted six grounds for relief. The district court denied petitioner\u2019s motion but granted a certificate of appealability on three of the six grounds. These three grounds are: (1) whether petitioner\u2019s constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him was violated by the admission of Sonya\u2019s hearsay statements to Tanya; (2) whether petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights to due process and an impartial jury were violated by the testimony concerning petitioner\u2019s prior bad acts elicited by the trial judge in response to questions proposed by a juror; (3) whether petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial were violated by the admission of a photograph depicting a large amount of blood on the floor of the stairway where Sonya was shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Although this court reviews the district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error, <em>Scott v. Elo, </em>302 F.3d 598, 602 (6th Cir.2002), this court reviews the state court proceedings consistent with its authority under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. An individual in state custody may only apply for a federal writ of habeas corpus on the basis that \u201che is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)(3) (\u201cThe writ of habeas corpus shall not extend to a prisoner unless... (3) He is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">In 1996, Congress amended \u00a7 2254 in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). The AEDPA applies to all habeas petitions filed after April 24, 1996. <em>See Penry v. Johnson, </em>532 U.S. 782, 792, 121 S.Ct. 1910, 150 L.Ed.2d 9 (2001); <em>Lindh v. Murphy, </em>521 U.S. 320, 336, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997); <em>Miller v. Francis, </em>269 F.3d 609, 613 (6th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1011, 122 S.Ct. 1592, 152 L.Ed.2d 509 (2002). The AEDPA standards apply to this 1998 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">Pursuant to the AEDPA, an application for writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person who is incarcerated pursuant to a state conviction cannot be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the adjudication:</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based upon an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-12\">Under the AEDPA, the source of law for a federal court reviewing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus is limited to cases decided by the United States Supreme Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). This provision marks a \u201csignificant change\u201d and prevents the federal courts from looking to lower federal court decisions in determining whether the state decision is contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>ly established federal law. <em>Harris v. Stovall, </em>212 F.3d 940, 943-14 (6th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 947, 121 S.Ct. 1415, 149 L.Ed.2d 356 (2001); <em>Herbert v. Billy, </em>160 F.3d 1131, 1134 (6th Cir.1998). To justify a grant of habeas corpus relief under this provision of the AEDPA, a federal court must find a violation of law \u201cclearly established\u201d by holdings of the Supreme Court, as opposed to its dicta, as of the time of the relevant state court decision. <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495,146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The AEDPA requires [this court] to review the [state] court\u2019s decision based on clearly established Supreme Court precedent at the time [the petitioner\u2019s] conviction became final. [This court is] not permitted to rely on Supreme Court cases decided after the court\u2019s decision, nor [is the court] permitted to rely on <em>any </em>decision by any court other than the Supreme Court in evaluating the [state] court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\"><em>Williams v. Coyle, </em>260 F.3d 684, 703 (6th Cir.2001). Subsequent Supreme Court decisions and references to federal circuit court decisions are \u201clargely irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 703; <em>see Bailey v. Mitchell, </em>271 F.3d 652, 655 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Recently, the Supreme Court held that a decision of the state court is \u201ccontrary to\u201d such clearly established federal law \u201cif the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by this Court on a question of law or if the state court decides a cases differently than this Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 412-13; <em>see Penry, </em>532 U.S. at 792. A state-court decision will be deemed an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law \u201cif the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this Court\u2019s decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">case.\u201d 529 U.S. at 413; <em>see Penry, </em>532 U.S. at 792. A federal habeas court may not find a state adjudication to be \u201cunreasonable\u201d \u201csimply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant state-court decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.\u201d 529 U.S. at 411. Rather, the application must also be \u201cunreasonable.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Miller v. Francis, </em>258 F.3d at 614; <em>Magana v. Hofbauer, </em>263 F.3d 542, 546 (6th Cir.2001). Further, the habeas court should not transform the inquiry into a subjective one by inquiring whether all reasonable jurists would agree that the application by the state court was unreasonable. 529 U.S. at 410 (disavowing <em>Drinkard v. Johnson, </em>97 F.3d 751, 769 (5th Cir.1996)). Rather, the issue is whether the state court\u2019s application of clearly established federal law is \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d 529 U.S. at 409; <em>Miller v. Francis, </em>269 F.3d at 614. The Supreme Court\u2019s recent <em>Penny </em>decision summarized the \u201cunreasonable application\u201d inquiry as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">A federal habeas court making the \u201cunreasonable application\u201d inquiry should ask whether the state court\u2019s application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable. Distinguishing between an unreasonable and an incorrect application of federal law, we clarified that even if the federal habeas court concludes that the state court decision applied clearly established federal law incorrectly, relief is appropriate only if that application is also objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">532 U.S. at 793 (citations omitted); <em>see Williams v. Coyle, </em>260 F.3d at 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">Accordingly, the focus in determining whether to grant a writ of habeas corpus is the reasonableness of the state court\u2019s resolution of federal issues. In this case, it is not possible to focus on the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>court\u2019s resolution of federal issues because the record on appeal does not indicate what issues were presented to the state courts. As a result, this petition must be reviewed as if the state court did not explain the reasons for its decision. \u201cWhere the state court has failed to articulate its reasoning for its decision, \u2018federal courts are obligated to conduct an independent review of the record and applicable law to determine whether the state court decision is contrary to federal law, unreasonably applies clearly established law, or is based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.\u2019 \u201d <em>Palazzolo v. Gorcyca, </em>244 F.3d 512, 516 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 828, 122 S.Ct. 68, 151 L.Ed.2d 35 (2001) (quoting <em>Harris v. Stovall, </em>212 F.3d 940, 943 (6th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 947, 121 S.Ct. 1415, 149 L.Ed.2d 356 (2001)). \u201c \u2018That independent review, however, is not a full, <em>de novo, </em>review of the claims, but remains deferential because the court cannot grant relief unless the state court\u2019s result is not in keeping with the strictures of the AEDPA.\u2019 \u201d <em>Onifer v. Tyszkiewicz, </em>255 F.3d 313, 316 (6th Cir.) (quoting <em>Harris v. Stovall, </em>212 F.3d at 943), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 930, 122 S.Ct. 292, 151 L.Ed.2d 216 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">A. Hearsay Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The district court granted a certificate of appealability on whether petitioner was denied his right to confront witnesses against him. Specifically, the trial court permitted Tanya to testify that Sonya told Tanya that Sonya and petitioner had broken up, that after hanging up the phone, Sonya said: \u201cThat was Jun. He\u2019s on his way over,\u201d and that before leaving the apartment, Sonya said: \u201cThat\u2019s Jun.\u201d In his brief, petitioner contends that the trial court erred in admitting these statements because the statements are inadmissible under Michigan\u2019s present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule. Petitioner\u2019s argument that the trial court erroneously applied Michigan law is not cognizable on federal habeas review. Federal courts may not grant a writ of habeas corpus based on an error in state law. <em>Mabry v. Johnson, </em>467 U.S. 504, 507, 104 S.Ct. 2543, 81 L.Ed.2d 437 (1984) (\u201cRespondent can obtain federal habeas corpus relief only if his custody is in violation of the Federal Constitution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Petitioner also argues that the admission of the statements deprived him of his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him. U.S. Const, amend. VI. \u201cThe nonhearsay aspect of [an out of court statement] ... raises no Confrontation Clause concerns.\u201d <em>Tennessee v. Street, </em>471 U.S. 409, 414, 105 S.Ct. 2078, 85 L.Ed.2d 425 (1985); <em>see also United States v. Martin, </em>897 F.2d 1368, 1372 (6th Cir. 1990) (\u201cThe assertions in this case were not offered for their content; therefore, there was no need to test the credibility of the out of court declarant as to their substance.\u201d). In <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 814-15, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990), the Supreme Court explained that a hearsay statement does not violate the Confrontation Clause, if the declarant is unavailable and \u201cif [the statement] bears adequate \u2018indicia of reliability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 814-15 (internal quotation omitted). To demonstrate reliability, the prosecution may show either that the hearsay statement \u201cfalls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception\u201d or that the hearsay statement has \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 815. \u201cThe \u2018particularized guarantees\u2019 are determined based upon the totality of circumstances, restricted to those that surround the making of the statement and render the declarant particularly worthy of belief.\u201d <em>An</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number><em>thony v. DeWitt, </em>295 F.3d 554, 562 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Applying this standard to Sonya\u2019s statements, petitioner\u2019s Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause rights were not violated. Sonya\u2019s statement that she and petitioner had broken up was offered for a nonhearsay purpose, and the jury was specifically instructed only to consider this statement for the nonhearsay purpose. Hence, admission of this statement did not violate petitioner\u2019s rights under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Although Sonya\u2019s other statements, \u201cThat was Jun. He\u2019s on his way over\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s Jun,\u201d were hearsay, their admission did not violate petitioner\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights. Sonya, the declarant, was an unavailable witness as she had died, and the statements bear adequate indicia of reliability. In this case, Sonya\u2019s statements had adequate indicia of reliability because there were particularized guarantees of trustworthiness associated with the statements. Sonya personally experienced the events, and her statements were based on her personal knowledge. The statements also were made immediately after Sonya\u2019s perception of the events. Because the statements were close in time to Sonya experiencing the events, she would not have had difficulty recalling the events. Finally, nothing about the statements suggests that Sonya was lying. Consequently, Petitioner\u2019s Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause rights were not violated by the admission of these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Even assuming that petitioner\u2019s Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause rights were violated, petitioner is not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus unless the alleged error had a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993); <em>see also Ford v. Curtis, </em>277 F.3d 806, 810-11 (6th Cir.2002) (applying <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson </em>to an alleged Confrontation Clause violation in the context of a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254). Having reviewed the record, Sonya\u2019s statements did not have a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s conviction was based on the eyewitness testimony of Tanya. After she heard the shot, Tanya saw petitioner limping away from where Sonya was shot. Hence, even if petitioner\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were violated, he is not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">B. Evidence of Prior Bad Acts and Juror\u2019s Question</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">The district court also issued a certificate of appealability as to whether petitioner\u2019s rights to due process and a fair trial were violated by the trial judge\u2019s eliciting testimony about petitioner\u2019s prior bad acts in response to a juror\u2019s question. Based on this issue, petitioner presents two separate arguments. First, petitioner contends that the testimony concerning his prior bad acts was inadmissible under Michigan\u2019s evidentiary rules. Second, he claims that his Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury and his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process were violated by the juror\u2019s question and by the trial judge\u2019s follow-up questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">Petitioner\u2019s first argument is without merit because petitioner\u2019s allegation that Michigan courts erred in their application of Michigan law does not entitle petitioner to a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Mabry v. Johnson, </em>467 U.S. 504, 507, 104 S.Ct. 2543, 81 L.Ed.2d 437 (1984). Even assuming that petitioner is contending that the admission of his prior bad acts violated the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, he is still not entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>relief. \u201c[0]nly in extraordinary cases will an error in the application of state rules of evidence rise to the level of a due process violation in a federal habeas proceeding.\u201d <em>Schoenberger v. Russell, </em>290 F.3d 831, 836 (6th Cir.2002); <em>Coleman v. Mitchell, </em>244 F.3d 533, 542 (6th Cir.2001) (\u201cA state court ruling will be reviewed by a federal habeas court only if it were so fundamentally unfair as to violate the petitioner\u2019s due process rights.\u201d). This case is not an extraordinary case, and the admission of testimony concerning petitioner\u2019s prior bad acts was not fundamentally unfair. Hence, petitioner\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Similarly, petitioner\u2019s second argument is without merit. Although federal courts discourage questions by jurors in federal criminal trials, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Collins, </em>226 F.3d 457, 461 (6th Cir.2000), petitioner has cited no cases indicating that questions by jurors implicate a specific constitutional guarantee. Accordingly, the juror\u2019s question and the trial court\u2019s follow up questions are reviewed for a violation of due process. The trial court\u2019s decision to ask these questions did not result in petitioner receiving a fundamentally unfair trial. Thus, petitioner is not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus based on the admission of evidence of his prior bad acts or on the judge\u2019s decision to ask a juror\u2019s question and to follow up the juror\u2019s question with additional questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">C. Photographic Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Finally, a certificate of appealability was issued as to whether petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial were violated by the admission of a photograph depicting a large amount of blood on the floor of the stairway where Sonya was shot. The trial court admitted the photograph despite petitioner\u2019s objection that the photograph was not relevant and was prejudicial because the trial court found that the photograph was \u201cprobative and it show[ed] better than anything else of where the body pictorially was found.\u201d Habeas relief is unavailable for alleged errors in state law evidentiary rulings. In fact, a federal court considering a petition for writ of habeas corpus does not consider state law errors. The question on habeas corpus review is whether the state court\u2019s ruling was \u201cso fundamentally unfair as to violate the petitioner\u2019s due process rights.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Mitchell, </em>244 F.3d 533, 542 (6th Cir.2001). In this case, the admission of the photograph was not fundamentally unfair and did not violate petitioner\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">As explained, the district court\u2019s decision denying the writ of habeas corpus is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
