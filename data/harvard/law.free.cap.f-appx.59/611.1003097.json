This court previously affirmed Bandy\u2019s convictions \u201cfor armed robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113, using and carrying a firearm in the commission of a bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), and aiding and abetting, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\u201d, but vacated his sentence for using and carrying a firearm in the commission of a bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), and remanded for resentencing. <em>United States v. Bandy, </em>239 F.3d 802, 807-OS (6th Cir.2001) <em>(\u201cBandy I\u201d). </em>We instructed the district court that, at resentencing, \u201cthe short-barreled shotgun may not be used to impose a mandatory ten-year sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(B)\u00ae, but may be considered for any other authorized purpose under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-13\">Bandy was resentenced in June 2001 and now appeals raising three arguments:</p>\n<p id=\"b636-14\">(1) the district court exceeded the scope of remand issued by this Court in <em>Bandy I;</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-15\">(2) the district court imposed a sentence that violated the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause of Art. I, Section 9, of the United States Constitution; and (3) the district court incorrectly applied United States Sentencing Guideline (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 2K2.4. For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-16\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b636-17\">A detailed discussion of the facts leading to Bandy\u2019s conviction and sentencing for armed robbery, using and carrying a firearm in the commission of a bank robbery, and aiding and abetting can be found in <em>Bandy I. </em>We discuss here the procedural history relevant to Bandy\u2019s current appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-18\">In July of 1998, Bandy was tried by a jury and convicted on both counts of a two-count indictment charging him with armed robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113, and aiding and abetting, in violation of 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (Count One), and using and carrying a firearm in the commission of a bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), and aiding and abetting, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (Count Two). The type of firearm used in the bank robbery, a short-barreled shotgun, was not specified in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Bandy was sentenced in February of 1999. The district court sentenced him to consecutive terms of 78 months of imprisonment on Count One and 120 months of imprisonment on Count Two, for a combined sentence of 198 months. As to the sentence for the \u00a7 924(c) conviction, the district court \u201cdetermined that the shotgun was a short-barreled shotgun under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(6) and sentenced [Bandy] under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(B)\u00ae, which imposes a ten-year statutory minimum.\u201d <em>Bandy I, </em>239 F.3d at 805. Bandy appealed, raising challenges to his conviction and sentence on Count Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">As to his conviction, Bandy argued that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of using and carrying a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) because it had not been established that the short-barreled shotgun used in the bank robbery was operable. This court rejected that argument and held that Bandy \u201cpossessed a gun for purposes of \u00a7 924(e).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">As to his sentence for violating \u00a7 924(c), Bandy argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the district court erred when it sentenced him because it relied on its factual finding, made under a preponderance of the evidence standard, that the firearm used in the robbery was a short-barreled shotgun. <em>See id. </em>This court reversed Bandy\u2019s mandatory minimum ten-year sentence imposed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(B)\u00ae. We concluded that \u201cthe district court\u2019s finding was legally insufficient for sentencing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(B)\u00ae because the jury did not find [the fact that the firearm used in the robbery was a short-barreled shotgun] beyond a reasonable doubt during the liability phase of the trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We observed that \u201c[b]ecause the particular type of weapon ... increases the maximum sentence, it is an element of the crime and must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt before the trier of fact, and not by merely a preponderance of the evidence before a judge at sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 807. We remanded the matter back to the district court for resentencing with instructions that \u201cthe short-barreled shotgun may not be used to impose a mandatory ten-year sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(B)\u00ae, but may be considered for any other authorized purpose under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">On remand, the district court granted in part the government\u2019s motion for an upward departure, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, Application Note 2, and in June of 2001, sentenced Bandy to 102 months of imprisonment on Count One (\u00a7 2113 offense) and to the mandatory 60 months of imprisonment on Count Two (\u00a7 924(c) offense), for a combined sentence of 162 months. To arrive at Bandy\u2019s 162 months of imprisonment, the district court reevaluated Bandy\u2019s sentence under both Counts One and Two of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">Bandy filed a timely appeal raising three arguments: (1) the district court exceeded the scope of remand issued by this Court in <em>Bandy I; </em>(2) the district court imposed a sentence that violates the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause of Art. I, Section 9, of the United States Constitution; and (3) the district court incorrectly applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">A. Scope of Remand in <em>Bandy I</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">Bandy argues that the district court exceeded the scope of our remand in <em>Bandy I </em>and thus violated the mandate rule when it reevaluated his sentence in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>entirety, granted a one-level upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, and increased the sentence originally imposed in connection with his bank robbery conviction. Bandy contends that the <em>Bandy I </em>remand order was limited in scope, constrained the district court\u2019s resentencing authority, and allowed it only to reduce the mandatory consecutive sentence for his \u00a7 924(c) firearm offense from ten years to five years. The government, on the other hand, argues that the remand was general in nature because it expressly provided that, although \u201cthe short-barreled shotgun may not be used to impose a mandatory ten-year sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(B)\u00ae,\u201d it \u201cmay be considered for any other authorized purpose under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>Bandy I, </em>239 F.3d at 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">In <em>Bandy I, </em>our remand order read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">[W]e REVERSE Defendant\u2019s sentence for using and carrying a firearm in the commission of a bank robbery and REMAND to the district court for sentencing consistent with this opinion. Specifically, we observe that the short-barreled shotgun may not be used to impose a mandatory ten-year sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(B)\u00ae, but may be considered for any other authorized purpose under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>This court must determine whether this is a limited or general remand. This issue presents a legal question and our review is <em>de novo. United States v. Moore, 131 F.3d 595, 598 </em>(6th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The mandate rule provides that \u201ca district court is bound to the scope of the remand issued by the court of appeals.\u201d <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>168 F.3d 263, 265 (6th Cir.1999). To determine whether the scope of a remand has been exceeded, we must first determine whether the remand is general or limited in nature. \u201cLimited remands explicitly outline the issues to be addressed by the district court and create a narrow framework within which the district court must operate.... General remands, in contrast, give district courts authority to address all matters as long as remaining consistent with the remand.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">It is well-established in this Circuit that \u201c[i]n the absence of an explicit limitation, the remand order is presumptively a general one.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>131 F.3d at 598. A limited remand \u201cmust sufficiently outline the procedure the district court is to follow.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>168 F.3d at 268. Appellate courts are to \u201cleave no doubt in the district judge\u2019s or parties\u2019 minds as to the scope of the remand. The language used to limit the remand should be, in effect, unmistakeable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The policy favoring a presumption of <em>de novo </em>resentencing \u201cis to give the district judge discretion to consider and balance all of the competing elements of the sentencing calculus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">Applying the above principles here, we conclude that <em>Bandy I </em>was a general remand accompanied by a specific instruction not to impose a mandatory ten-year sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). If the remand order in <em>Bandy I </em>was intended to limit the district court\u2019s sentencing authority as Bandy contends, it would have made that limitation evident and would not have included language inviting the district court to consider the short-barreled shotgun \u201cfor any other authorized purpose under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>See Bandy I, </em>239 F.3d at 808. We hold that the district court did not exceed the scope of the <em>Bandy I </em>remand order when it reevaluated Bandy\u2019s entire sentence, and further hold that the sentence imposed by the district court on resentencing is consistent with our decision in <em>Bandy I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">Bandy\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Moore </em>is misplaced. In contrast to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>remand order here, the remand order at issue in <em>Moore </em>was narrowly drawn and limited the district court\u2019s review to consideration of the defendant\u2019s conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) and specifically to the issue whether the defendant \u201cused or carried a firearm during and in relation to his drug trafficking offense.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>131 F.3d at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">B. <em>Ex Post Facto Clause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Bandy\u2019s second argument, that the district court violated the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause of Art. 1, Section 9 of the United States Constitution when it resentenced him in June of 2001, is without merit. We review Bandy\u2019s constitutional challenge <em>de novo. United States v. Jackson, </em>181 F.3d 740, 743 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The district court, on remand, imposed a 102-month sentence for Bandy\u2019s Count One violations (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2) and a 60-month sentence for Bandy\u2019s Count Two violations (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2). The sentence imposed does not violate the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause because it \u201c \u2018does not punish as a crime an act previously committed, which was innocent when done; nor make more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after its commission: nor deprive one charged with crime of any defense available according to law at the time when the act was committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lyons v. Ohio Adult Parole Authority, </em>105 F.3d 1063, 1074 (6th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>Collins v. Youngblood, </em>497 U.S. 37, 52, 110 S.Ct. 2715, 111 L.Ed.2d 30 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Bandy\u2019s argument challenges the sentence the district court imposed on remand for his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) conviction. As Bandy concedes, on November 28, 1997, the date the offense for which he was ultimately convicted took place, the punishment for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) was a mandatory consecutive sentence of five years. At his resentencing, the district court imposed a mandatory consecutive sentence of five years (60 months). There is no support for Bandy\u2019s argument that the district court relied on a 1998 amendment to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) when resentencing him in June of 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">Moreover, Bandy cannot argue that the district court violated the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause when it construed and applied the exception contained in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, Application Note 2, at his resentencing because that exception existed both at the time of his February 1999 sentencing and his June 2002 resentencing. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 2K2.4, comment, (n.2) (Nov. 1998); United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 2K2.4, comment. (n.2) (Nov.2000). <em>See also United States v. Clark, </em>110 F.3d 15, 18 (6th Cir. 1997) (observing that \u201c[t]he courts should apply the guidelines that are in effect at the time of sentencing or resentencing, if doing so would not violate the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause of the Constitution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">C. Interpretation of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, Application Note 2</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">Finally, Bandy argues that the district corut misinterpreted U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4 and thus erred when it applied the specific offense characteristics of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and made an upward departure when reevaluating the sentence imposed for his bank robbery conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113. This court\u2019s review of a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines presents a ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>tion of law and is thus subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>196 F.3d 676, 679 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Bandy contends that the district court misinterpreted U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, Application Note 2, because it expressly prohibits application of any specific offense characteristics, such as those provided in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C), when imposing a sentence for an underlying robbery offense as well as a sentence for a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 2K2.4, comment, (n.2) (Nov. 2000). The reason for this prohibition, Bandy asserts, is set forth in the Background commentary. \u201cTo avoid double counting, when a sentence under this section is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, any specific offense characteristic for explosive or firearm discharge, use, brandishing, or possession is not applied in respect to such underlying offense.\u201d United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 2K2.4, comment, (backg\u2019d) (Nov.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">We conclude that the district court properly interpreted and applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4. Bandy\u2019s argument observes the general rule set forth in \u00a7 2K2.4, Application Note 2. However, it ignores the exception to the general rule that is also expressly set forth in Application Note 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMu\">In a few cases, the offense level for the underlying offense determined under the preceding paragraphs may result in a guideline range that, when combined with the mandatory consecutive sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ... 924(c) ... produces a total maximum penalty that is less than the maximum of the guideline range that would have resulted had there not been a count of conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ... 924(c) ... <em>(i.e., </em>the guideline range that would have resulted if the enhancements for possession, use, or discharge of a firearm had been applied). In such a case, an upward departure may be warranted so that the conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ... 924(c) ... does not result in a decrease of the total punishment. An upward departure under this paragraph shall not exceed the maximum of the guideline range that would have resulted had there not been a count of conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ... 924(c)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">United States Sentencing Commission. <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 2K2.4, comment. (n.2) (Nov.2000). This exception recognizes that, in some circumstances, application of the general rule set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4 may result in a decrease in a defendant\u2019s total punishment. To avoid that unintended result, this paragraph of Application Note 2 provides that an upward departure may be warranted and sets out the steps the district court must follow to determine whether the exception applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">The district court must first calculate the guidelines range for an underlying offense, such as Bandy\u2019s bank robbery offense, with and without enhancements for possession, use, or discharge of a firearm. Next, the district court must compare: (a) the guideline range for the underlying offense <em>without </em>the enhancing factors combined with the mandatory consecutive sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c); and (b) the guideline range for the underlying offense <em>with </em>the enhancing factors. If the total maximum penalty under calculation (a) is less than the calculation under (b), then Application Note 2 instructs an upward departure may be warranted so that the conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) does not result in a decrease in the total punishment. As a further caution, Application Note 2 instructs that in no event can an upward departure exceed the maximum of the guideline range calculated for the underlying offense considering the enhancing factors for possession, use, or discharge of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>The district court properly applied this exception when resentencing Bandy. The guideline range for Bandy\u2019s underlying robbery offense without the enhancing factors was 78-97 months.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When Bandy\u2019s mandatory five-year consecutive sentence for the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) conviction was added, the guideline range became 138-157 months. The guideline range for the bank robbery with the enhancing factors was 135-168 months. Because the total maximum penalty which is derived under the general rule of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4 (157 months) is less than the maximum of the guideline range that would have resulted without consideration of an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) violation (168 months), the exception comes into play and an upward departure is allowed. Moreover, the sentence imposed by the district court (102 months) does not exceed the maximum of the guideline range calculated for the underlying offense considering the enhancing factors for possession, use, or discharge of a firearm (168 months).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Contrary to Bandy\u2019s arguments here, the district court\u2019s careful application of the exception to the general rule as provided in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, Appbcation Note 2, does not constitute the impermissible double counting \u00a7 2K2.4 is designed to prevent. Bandy\u2019s rebanee on <em>United States v. Smith, </em>196 F.3d 676 (6th Cir.1999), and <em>United States v. Le, </em>256 F.3d 1229 (11th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1145, 122 S.Ct. 1103, 151 L.Ed.2d 999 (2002), is misplaced. Those decisions are readily distinguishable because neither one addresses the issue presented here; i.e., whether the district court misinterpreted U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, Appbcation Note 2, when it construed and appbed an exception to the general rule set forth in Appbcation Note 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Bandy is also mistaken when he argues that the district court misapplied \u00a7 2K2.4 because Bandy\u2019s co-defendant possessed a firearm different from the one for which Bandy was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). In <em>Bandy I, </em>this court affirmed Bandy\u2019s conviction for using and carrying a firearm in the commission of a bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), and aiding and abetting, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, holding that \u201cthere was sufficient evidence that any jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that [Bandy] possessed a gun for purposes of \u00a7 924(c).\u201d <em>Bandy I, </em>239 F.3d at 805-06. The firearm at issue with regard to Bandy\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) conviction was the same short-barreled shotgun used by his co-defendant. As observed in <em>Bandy I, </em>\u201ca defendant is bable as an aider and abettor for use of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence when his accomplice uses a firearm in relation to jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-9\">. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) provides that for robberies, the base offense level is 20, but when the specific offense characteristic of brandishing or possessing a firearm is applied, the base offense level is increased by 5 levels. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) (Nov.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b641-6\">. In calculating the sentencing range, the district court began with the prior calculations that were not in dispute. It determined that the bank robbery offense begins with an offense level of 20 under U.S.S.G \u00a7 2B3.1; two additional points are added under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(1) because the robbery involved property of a financial institution; another two additional points are added under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(7)(C) because the amount of the loss was greater than $50,000; and another two additional points are added under \u00a7 3B 1.1(c) because Bandy was found to be a leader and organizer, thus resulting in an offense level of 26. The district court further observed that it was undisputed that Bandy was in Criminal History Category III and therefore the guideline range for sentencing on Count One was determined to be 78 to 97 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
