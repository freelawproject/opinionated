Because we conclude that Kirby\u2019s waiver of his appellate rights was knowing and voluntary, we dismiss his appeal. <em>See United States v. Attar, </em>38 F.3d 727, 731 (4th Cir.1994). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-20\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
