These habeas proceedings follow Carter\u2019s Ohio jury trial, conviction and sentence for three counts of felonious assault in violation of R.C. \u00a7 2903.11(A)(2) and one count of aggravated murder in violation of R.C. \u00a7 2903.01(A). Carter received a life sentence with the possibility of parole in seventy-six years. Respondent Harold E. Carter is Warden of the Lebanon Correctional Institution in Lebanon, Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-14\">We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b129-16\">On August 10, 1996, after Tony Reynolds and Stacy Carter\u2019s brother, Damon Carter, participated in a heated argument, Reynolds fled the scene and traveled to his mother\u2019s home, where he discussed with various friends and family members what to do. Reynolds and several others took three cars and headed out to locate Damon Carter. Reynolds himself drove a red Buick. Damon Carter drove a green Chevrolet Lumina with Stacy Carter riding in the back seat on the passenger\u2019s side. A third brother, Michael Carter, also rode in the Lumina.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-17\">A ten-minute chase ensued in which the Lumina followed the Buick through downtown Toledo, Ohio. During the course of their pursuit, Stacy Carter fired shots at the Buick and at another vehicle in Reynolds\u2019 party driven by Tony Durhart. The red Buick eventually slid into a concrete abutment, and the Lumina drove in front of it to prevent the car from leaving. When Reynolds abandoned his vehicle, Stacy Carter shot him in the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-18\">On September 16,1996, a Lucas County, Ohio grand jury indicted Stacy Carter along with Damon and Michael Carter. Stacy Carter was included on all five counts of the indictment, including four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>counts of felonious assault in violation of R.C. \u00a7 2903.11(A)(2) and one count of aggravated murder in violation of R.C. \u00a7 2903.01(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Each count included two separate specifications. The first, a Firearm Specification under R.C. \u00a7 2941.145 charged that Stacy Carter displayed, brandished, indicated possession or used a firearm. The second, Using a Firearm from a Motor Vehicle Specification under R.C. \u00a7 2941.146, charged that Stacy Carter caused or attempted to cause harm or death by using a firearm from a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">On April 11, 1997, after a jury convicted him of aggravated murder and three of the four counts of felonious assault, Stacy Carter received an eight-year sentence on each count of felonious assault with multiple three-year terms for the Firearm Specification and multiple five-year terms for the Motor Vehicle Specification. Stacy Carter also received a life sentence with parole eligibility after twenty years for the aggravated murder, along with two additional penalties of three and five years for the specifications associated with the murder. The court ordered Stacy Carter to serve his sentences consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">After exhausting all possible avenues of state post-conviction relief, Stacy Carter filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for habeas relief on September 6, 2000. Stacy Carter\u2019s current counsel filed an appearance on September 22, 2000. On April 18, 2001, the district court denied Stacy Carter\u2019s petition and declined to grant a certificate of appealability. On April 27, 2001, Stacy Carter filed a Motion for a New Trial or to Alter and Amend Judgment. The district court denied that motion on May 15, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Stacy Carter filed a Notice of Appeal on June 11, 2001. We issued an order deeming Stacy Carter\u2019s Notice of Appeal to be an application for a certificate of appealability. We then certified the issue of whether the multiple sentences imposed for the firearms specifications violated the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (1996), governs federal habeas review of state court decisions. Under AEDPA, with respect to legal questions, we must determine whether the Ohio Supreme Court unreasonably applied federal law as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 407-08, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). We will not grant relief if we conclude that the Ohio courts applied federal law erroneously or incorrectly; rather, the Ohio courts must have applied federal law in an objectively unreasonable manner. <em>Id. </em>at 409. In <em>Herbert v. Billy, </em>160 F.3d 1131, 1135 (6th Cir.1998), we recognized that AEDPA intended to place \u201creasonable state court judgments beyond the scope of federal review.\u201d AEDPA does not empower a federal court to grant habeas relief \u201cmerely because it disagrees with the state court\u2019s decision or because, left to its own devices, it would have reached a different result.\u201d <em>Nevers v. Killinger, </em>169 F.3d 352, 361 (6th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>O\u2019Brien v. Dubois, </em>145 F.3d 16, 25 n. 10 (1st Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">The Ohio judiciary reasonably concluded that the multiple sentences imposed for the firearms specifications did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. \u201c \u2018The Fifth Amendment prohibition against double jeopardy protects against three harms: second prosecution for an offense after initial acquittal, second prosecution for an offense after an initial conviction, and multiple punishments for the same offense.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number><em>United States v. Davis, </em>306 F.3d 398, 417 (6th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Gibbons, </em>994 F.2d 299, 301 (6th Cir.1993) (citation omitted)); <em>see also North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969) (listing the same three protections).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">When two different statutory provisions authorize separate, cumulative punishments for the same act, this Court begins by determining \u201cwhether the legislature intended to punish cumulatively the same conduct which violates two statutes.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>22 F.3d 106, 107-08 (6th Cir.1994); <em>see also Jeffers v. United States, </em>432 U.S. 137, 155, 97 S.Ct. 2207, 53 L.Ed.2d 168 (1977) (explaining that the first step in this type of double-jeopardy analysis is to determine \u201cwhether Congress intended to punish each statutory violation separately\u201d); <em>Pandelli v. United States, </em>635 F.2d 533, 536 (6th Cir.1980)(quoting <em>Jeffers, </em>432 U.S. at 155).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">This Court next applies the formula enunciated in <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932). In <em>Blockburger, </em>the Supreme Court announced the following test for determining whether two convictions are barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause: \u201cwhere the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not.\u201d 284 U.S. at 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">This Court does not use the <em>Blockburger </em>test, however, where the legislature intended to impose multiple punishments for the same offense. <em>Missouri v. Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 368-69, 103 S.Ct. 673, 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983) (\u2018Where, as here, a legislature specifically authorizes cumulative punishment under two statutes, regardless of whether those two statutes proscribe the \u2018same\u2019 conduct under <em>Block-burger, </em>a court\u2019s task of statutory construction is at an end and the prosecutor may seek and the trial court or jury may impose cumulative punishment under such statutes in a single trial.\u201d); <em>Albernaz v. United States, </em>450 U.S. 333, 340, 101 S.Ct. 1137, 67 L.Ed.2d 275 (1981) (explaining that the <em>Blockburger </em>analysis is controlling only where there is no indication of contrary legislative intent); <em>Whalen v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 684, 688, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980) (\u201c[T]he question whether punishments imposed by a court after a defendant\u2019s conviction upon criminal charges are unconstitutionally multiple cannot be resolved without determining what punishments the Legislative Branch has authorized.\u201d); <em>Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 165, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977) (\u201cWhere consecutive sentences are imposed at a single criminal trial, the role of the constitutional guarantee is limited to assuring that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d). Thus, \u201c[t]he Court reaches the <em>Blockburger </em>test only when those prior techniques of construction have failed to resolve the question of whether the legislature intends to allow cumulative punishments for violations of two statutes.\u201d <em>Pandelli, </em>635 F.2d at 536; <em>see also United States v. Cantrell, </em>278 F.3d 543, 547-48 (6th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Hebeka, </em>89 F.3d 279, 282 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\"><em>Blockburger </em>is inapplicable here because the legislative intent is obvious. Stacy Carter argues that the Ohio courts erred by not reversing the trial court\u2019s decision to impose separate consecutive sentences for the two firearm-related specifications. As it appeared when Stacy Carter received his sentence, R.C. \u00a7 2929.14(D)(1)(a)\u00ae stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"AY\">if an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a felony also is convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>of or pleads guilty to a specification of the type described in section 2941.144 [2941.14.4] of the Revised Code that charges the offender with having a firearm that is an automatic firearm or that was equipped with a firearm muffler or silencer on or about the offender\u2019s person or under the offender\u2019s control while committing the felony, a specification of the type described in section 2941.145 [2941.14.5] of the Revised Code that charges the offender with having a firearm, brandishing the firearm, indicating that the offender possessed the firearm, or using it to facilitate the offense, or a specification of the type described in section 2941.141 [2941.14.1] of the Revised Code that charges the offender with having a firearm on or about the offender\u2019s person or under the offender\u2019s control while committing the felony, the court, after imposing a prison term on the offender for the felony under division (A), (D)(2), or (D)(3) of this section, shall impose an additional prison term, determined pursuant to this section .... If the specification is of the type described in section 2941.145 [2941.14.5] of the Revised Code, the additional prison term shall be three years.... A court shall not impose more than one additional prison term on an offender under this division for felonies committed as part of the same act or transaction. <em>If a court imposes an additional prison term under division (D)(l)(a)(ii) of this section, the court is not precluded from imposing an additional prison term under this division.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">(emphasis added.) R.C. \u00a7 2929.14(D)(l)(a)(ii) read, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">if an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a ... felony that includes, as an essential element, purposely or knowingly causing or attempting to cause the death of or physical harm to another, also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a specification of the type described in section 2941.146 [2941.14.6] of the Revised Code that charges the offender with committing the offense by discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle ... the court, after imposing a prison term on the offender for ... the other felony offense under division (A), D(2), or D(3) of this section, shall impose an additional prison term of five years upon the offender.... A court shall not impose more than one additional prison term on an offender under this division for felonies committed as part of the same act or transaction. <em>If a court imposes an additional prison term on an offender under this division relative to an offense, the court shall impose an additional prison term under division (D)(l)(a)(i) of this section relative to the same offense, </em>provided the criteria specified in that division are satisfied relative to the offender and the offense, (emphasis added). Thus, if an Ohio court imposes a motor vehicle specification, it must impose one of the additional specifications listed in R.C. 2929.14(D)(l)(a)(i).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">The Ohio statutes thus indicate clear legislative intent to <em>require </em>Ohio courts to impose cumulative penalties for different specifications. R.C. \u00a7 2929.14(D)(l)(a)(ii) expressly states that \u201c[i]f a court imposes an additional prison term on an offender under [the motor vehicle specification] the court also shall impose a prison term under division (D)(1)(a)\u00ae.\u201d R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>\u00a7 2929.14(D)(l)(a)(i) includes the specification Stacy Carter received for brandishing a weapon. When Stacy Carter received his sentence, R.C. \u00a7 2941.145 provided for an additional penalty when \u201cthe offender had a firearm on or about the offender\u2019s person or under the offender\u2019s control while committing the offense and displayed the firearm, brandished the firearm, indicated that the offender possessed the firearm, or used it to facilitate the offense.\u201d As mandated by Ohio law, the trial court used R.C. \u00a7 2941.146 to impose an additional penalty for \u201cpurposely or knowingly causing or attempting to cause the death of or physical harm to another and that was committed by discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle.\u201d If the \u201clegislature specifically authorizes cumulative punishment under two statutes ... a court\u2019s task of statutory construction is at an end and the prosecutor may seek and the trial court or jury may impose cumulative punishment under such statutes in a single trial.\u201d <em>Missouri v. Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 368-69, 103 S.Ct. 673, 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983); <em>see also Simpson v. United States, </em>435 U.S. 6, 11, 98 S.Ct. 909, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978) (concluding in a case involving multiple punishments that the Court \u201cneed not reach the [Blockburger] issue.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Since legislative intent is clear, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b132-10\">. This matches the interpretation of these provisions offered by the Ohio Court of Appeals. <em>See State v. Stacy Carter, </em>Nos. L-97-1162, L-97-1163, L-97-1169, 1999 Ohio.App. LEXIS 2261, *41-46, 1999 WL 316855 (6th Cir. May 21, 1999). Federal courts accept as valid a state court's interpretation of state law. <em>Duffel v. Dutton, </em>785 F.2d 131, 133 (6th Cir. 1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b133-8\">. Even assuming <em>Blockburger </em>did apply, it would not help Stacy Carter. Under <em>Block-burger, </em>penalties imposed under two separate statutes do not constitute double jeopardy if \"each provision requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not.\" 284 U.S. at 304. Here, the first specification, \u00a7 2941.145, requires that the government prove the offender somehow brandished or displayed her weapon so as to let the victim know she had a gun. The second specification, \u00a7 2941.146, has no such requirement. The second specification, in turn, requires the government to prove the defendant discharged his firearm from a motor vehicle. The first specification has no similar prerequisite.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
