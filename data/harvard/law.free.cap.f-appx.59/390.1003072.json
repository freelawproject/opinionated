Harper was sentenced to 168 months of imprisonment. He did not appeal his conviction or sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-17\">In April 2001, Harper filed a \u00a7 3582(c) motion to reduce his sentence, seeking retroactive application of Amendment 599 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines and arguing that the District Court engaged in impermissible double-counting by punishing him twice for the same conduct because his sentence for armed bank robbery was enhanced for brandishing a firearm, even though he was also sentenced for use of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence. The District Court denied the motion as without merit, and Harper filed this timely appeal, reasserting his position below.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-18\">Upon review, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Harper\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion. Harper\u2019s sentence was enhanced by five levels, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2), for brandishing a firearm only with respect to the bank robberies charged in counts 4, 6 and 8. Harper did not receive such an enhancement for brandishing a firearm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>with respect to the bank robbery charged in count 2. Rather, the bank robbery charged in count 2 served as the basis for Harper\u2019s conviction for using a firearm during a crime of violence (count 3). As such, there was no double-counting and Harper\u2019s sentence was in compliance with Amendment 599, which provides that \u201cif a defendant was convicted of two armed bank robberies, but is convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) in connection with only one of the robberies, a weapon enhancement would apply to the bank robbery which was not the basis for the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) conviction.\u201d Accordingly, the order of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
