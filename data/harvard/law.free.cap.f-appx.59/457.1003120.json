We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-20\">The District Court sentenced Mayo to 276 months imprisonment after he pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Mayo appeals from the sentence on two grounds. First, Mayo asks that his sentence be vacated and the matter be remanded to allow him to make objections to the pre-sentence report. Second, Mayo claims the District Court erroneously concluded that his criminal history category did not adequately reflect his past criminal conduct under United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 4A1.3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-21\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-22\">The pre-sentence report delineated the potential grounds for adjustment in Mayo\u2019s sentence, yet no objections were raised. Nor did Mayo make any objections at the sentencing hearing. Therefore, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Knobloch, </em>131 F.3d 366, 370 (3d Cir.1997) (providing that issues not raised before the district court are reviewed only for plain error) (citations omitted). Reversal for plain error requires us to find: 1) an error; 2) that is plain; 3) that affects Mayo\u2019s substantial rights and 4) that \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number><em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 782, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The transcript of the sentencing hearing reflects that the District Court twice asked Mayo if he had any objections to the presentence report. Following the first inquiry, the Court granted Mayo a half hour recess to confer with his attorney. After Mayo and his attorney returned, the District Court again asked if there were any objections. Neither Mayo nor his attorney objected. On appeal Mayo does not indicate what objections he would like to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Mayo argues the District Court failed to determine that his criminal history score significantly under-represented his past criminal conduct. The District Court expressly stated, however, that Mayo\u2019s \u201ccriminal history category of six significantly under-represents the seriousness of defendant\u2019s criminal history.\u201d The District Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">The defendant has a history of violent offenses and has been undeterred by previous terms of incarceration. There is a strong likelihood of recidivism. Defendant has four prior convictions that were not assigned criminal history points for various reasons. He had two juvenile matters for which he admitted guilt but did not receive criminal history points.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a) provides that \u201csentences not used in computing the criminal history\u201d may constitute \u201crehable information\u201d that the defendant\u2019s criminal history under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal past. <em>Id. </em>The juvenile offenses excluded from the computation of Mayo\u2019s criminal history points were \u201cfor conduct similar to the instant offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>961 F.2d 1110, 1116 (3d Cir.1992) (citation omitted). Accordingly, they provided an appropriate basis for an upward departure. <em>Id. </em>The Commentary provides that the likelihood of recidivism should guide a court\u2019s decision to make an upward departure. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, cmt. Each of the reasons upon which the District Court relied was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of sentence will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-14\">. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 provides, \"[i]f reliable information indicates that the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, the court may consider imposing a sentence departing from the otherwise applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
