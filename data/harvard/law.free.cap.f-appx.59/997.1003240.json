Because the transitional rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d) apply, <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1149-50 (9th Cir.1997), we have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-22\">We review for substantial evidence the BIA\u2019s determination that Alvarado-Gomez has not established eligibility for asylum, and must uphold the BIA\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>Cruz-Navarro v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1024, 1028 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-23\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that any past persecution Alvarado-Gomez experienced was due solely to his employment in the Civil Patrol, which is not a basis for asylum. <em>Cruz-Navarro, </em>232 F.3d at 1029 (\u201cPersecution occurring because a person is a current member of a police force or military ... is not <em>on account of </em>one of the grounds enumerated in the Act.\u201d) (quotations omitted); <em>Chanco v. INS, </em>82 F.3d 298, 302-03 (9th Cir.1996) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-24\">Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Alvarado-Gomez did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of an enumerated ground. Although reprisals against Alvardo-Gomez because of his past membership in the Civil Patrol could provide a basis for granting asylum, Alvarado-Gomez failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>show that he may be singled out for attack because of his experience in the Civil Patrol. <em>Chanco, </em>82 F.3d at 303. Moreover, Alvarado-Gomez\u2019s testimony that he is afraid of returning to Guatemala because \u201cno one is secure\u201d there does not provide a basis for asylum. <em>Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 967 (9th Cir.1998) (holding that \u201c[m]ere generalized lawlessness and violence\u201d is insufficient.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">In failing to qualify for asylum, Alvarado-Gomez necessarily failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation. <em>Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1021-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
