We have reviewed the administrative record and the immigration judge\u2019s decision, which was designated by the Board as the final agency determination, and find that substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that Zadi failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution as required to qualify for relief from deportation. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) (1994);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Zadi\u2019s application for withholding of deportation. The standard for withholding of deportation is more stringent than that for granting asylum. <em>See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430-32,107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). To qualify for withholding of deportation, an applicant must demonstrate a \u201cclear probability of persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430. Because Zadi fails to show that she is eligible for asylum, she cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Finally, we find Zadi\u2019s due process challenges to the Board\u2019s use of the streamlined review procedure set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(a)(7) (2002) to be without merit. <em>See Albathani v. INS, </em>318 F.3d 365, 375-79 (1st Cir.2003). We further find that summary affirmance was appropriate in this case under the factors set forth in \u00a7 3.1(a)(7)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Accordingly, we deny Zadi\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-8\">. We note that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) was repealed by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-128, 110 Stat. 3009, effective April 1, 1997. Because this case was in transition at the time the IIRIRA was passed, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) is still applicable under the terms of the transitional rules contained in \u00a7 309(c) of the IIRIRA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
