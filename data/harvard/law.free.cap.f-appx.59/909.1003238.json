On appeal, counsel moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Nungaray-Beltran filed a pro se supplemental brief arguing the district court erred in applying a firearm enhancement and in denying him safety-valve relief. He also argues: (1) the government failed to prove whether the drugs underlying his offense were 1 or d-methamphetamine, or whether they were methamphetamine at all; (2) the Attorney General improperly reclassified methamphetamine in powder form from a Schedule III to a Schedule II controlled substance; and (3) counsel was ineffective at sentencing. After careful review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-24\">We reject Nungaray-Beltran\u2019s arguments for reversal. The firearm enhance-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>merit was proper, as firearms were found with drug-packaging materials both at Nungaray-Beltran\u2019s residence and at his rental house. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 3; <em>United States v. Cave, </em>293 F.3d 1077, 1079 (8th Cir.2002) (standard of review); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>195 F.3d 379, 383-84 (8th Cir.1999). As a result, safety-valve relief was preempted. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Further, section 841(b) does not differentiate between 1 and d-methamphetamine, <em>see United States v. Maza, </em>93 F.3d 1390, 1400 n. 4 (8th Cir.1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1138, 117 S.Ct. 1008, 136 L.Ed.2d 886 (1997); Nungaray-Beltran acknowledged in his plea agreement he was pleading guilty to a charge involving 500 grams or more of \u201cmethamphetamine\u201d; and laboratory reports introduced at sentencing reflected the substance in question was methamphetamine, <em>see United States v. Hyatt, </em>207 F.3d 1036, 1037-38 (8th Cir. 2000). Finally, Congress has given the Attorney General authority to transfer drugs from one schedule to another regardless of the drug\u2019s initial placement, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 811(a)(1) and 812(c), and the ineffective-assistance claim is not properly before us, <em>see United States v. Martin, </em>59 F.3d 767, 771 (8th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b933-17\">.
