Platt, Judge) in favor of defendants. Plaintiffs, landowners in Suffolk County, New York, brought this action to challenge the constitutionality of the Long Island Pine Barrens Maritime Reserve Act, N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law \u00a7 57-0101 <em>et seq. </em>(McKinney 1997) (the \u201cAct\u201d). The Act\u2019s stated purpose is \u201cto allow the state and local governments to protect, preserve and properly manage the unique natural resources of the Pine Barrens-Peconic Bay system.\u201d N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law \u00a7 57-0105. The District Court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 substantive due process claim pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on their equal protection claim, and granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the equal protection claim. To the extent that plaintiffs argue in support of any claims other than their facial substantive due process and equal protection challenges, such claims have been either waived or abandoned, and we do not consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The District Court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 substantive due process claim because plaintiffs had not alleged that they had a property interest in the continued pre-Act zoning of their land. Plaintiffs do not challenge this particular conclusion on appeal, and we agree with the District Court that plaintiffs have failed to allege anything more than a unilateral expectation in the continued zoning of their land. <em>See, e.g., Ellentuck v. Klein, </em>570 F.2d 414, 429 (2d Cir.1978) (\u201cUnder New York law, ... a landowner has no vested interest in the existing classification of his property.\u201d). We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 substantive due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">We also note that, even if plaintiffs could allege a protected property interest, the Act would still survive a substantive due process challenge. The Act is subject to rational basis review because it neither infringes fundamental rights nor affects a suspect class. <em>See Vance v. Bradley, </em>440 U.S. 93, 96-97, 99 S.Ct. 939, 59 L.Ed.2d 171 (1979). Under this deferential standard, plaintiffs\u2019 due process claim will fail if the Act is rationally related to any legitimate state interest. <em>See Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., </em>449 U.S. 456, 461-63, 101 S.Ct. 715, 66 L.Ed.2d 659 (1981). It is clear that the Act is rationally related to several legitimate state interests. <em>See Dittmer v. County of Suffolk, </em>188 F.Supp.2d 286, 289 (E.D.N.Y.2002) (listing the Act\u2019s goals as, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cprotecting] the largest natural drinking water source in New York\u201d and \u201cpreserv[ing] the Pine Barrens\u2019 unique and partially endangered ecosystem\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection claim likewise cannot survive rational basis review. As the District Court noted, the Act will survive an equal protection challenge \u201cif there is any \u2018plausible\u2019 justification for the distinctions [it] draw[s].\u201d <em>Dittmer, </em>188 F.Supp.2d at 293 (quoting <em>Weinstein v. Albright, </em>261 F.3d 127, 140 (2d Cir.2001)). Plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection claim appears to be founded on the argument that the Act irrationally designates the plaintiffs\u2019 land as part of the Pine Barrens\u2019 \u201ccore preservation area,\u201d while designating the Calverton Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant as part of the less restrictive \u201ccompatible growth area.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 contention is not even factually correct. While the developed portions of the Calverton Plant (e.g., jet runways, access roads, and airplane hangars) are located within the compatible growth area, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>undeveloped portions of the Calverton Plant are \u2014 like the plaintiffs\u2019 undeveloped land \u2014 located within the core preservation area. The Act\u2019s distinction between developed and undeveloped land is rationally related to the legitimate interests that the Act was designed to serve: protecting the Pine Barrens\u2019 aquifer and preserving its unique and endangered ecosystem. Thus, the District Court properly denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, and granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, on the equal protection claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">We have considered plaintiffs\u2019 remaining contentions and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
