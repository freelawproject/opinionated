In Appeal No. 02-4386, he appeals from the district court\u2019s order partially denying his motion for provision of documents at government expense. Kalita\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Kalita has filed a pro se supplemental brief challenging the validity of his guilty plea and his sentence, and asserting claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. We affirm in both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-16\">Kalita\u2019s Judgment and Commitment order was entered on January 5, 2002; Kali-ta dated his notice of appeal March 16, 2002. The district court determined that the notice of appeal was untimely filed and that Kalita failed to show excusable neglect or good cause to warrant an extension of the appeal period. We find no abuse of discretion in this determination. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A); <em>United States v. Raynor, </em>939 F.2d 191, 197 (4th Cir.1991). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Kalita\u2019s motion to file an untimely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-17\">In the second appeal, Kalita challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a copy of the government\u2019s sentencing motion at government expense. Finding that Kalita failed make a sufficient showing of his need for this document in relation to his appeal, the district court denied the motion. We find no abuse of discretion in this determination, and therefore affirm. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f) (2000); <em>Jones v. Superintendent, Va. State Farm, </em>460 F.2d 150,152-53 (4th Cir.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-18\">In his pro se supplemental brief, Kalita raises challenges to the validity of his guilty plea and his sentence. Because Kalita failed to note a timely appeal from his criminal judgment, those issues are not properly before this court. <em>See Raynor, </em>939 F.2d at 197. Kalita also asserts that counsel was ineffective with respect to his plea, his sentencing, and the failure to file a timely notice of appeal. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are not cognizable on direct appeal unless counsel\u2019s deficient performance plainly appears on the face of the record. <em>See United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number><em>King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 120-21 (4th Cir.1991). Because the record does not plainly evidence that Kalita\u2019s counsel rendered ineffective assistance, these claims must be raised, if at all, in a motion filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>See United States v. Hoyle, </em>33 F.3d 415, 418 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s orders denying Kalita\u2019s motion to file an untimely appeal, and denying, in part, his motion for copies of documents at government expense. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
