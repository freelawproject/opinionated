Trujillo-Campos entered into a plea agreement in which he waived his right to appeal or collaterally attack his conviction and sentence. Trujillo-Campos contends that it would be unfair to enforce his appellate waiver, because the district judge erred in finding that the plea was intelligently made and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>that there should be no departure for special factors outside the Sentencing Guidelines heartland. There is no evidence that Trujillo-Campos\u2019s plea was not intelligently made, and he was sentenced consistent with the terms of the plea agreement. Because we conclude that he knowingly waived his appellate rights, we enforce Trujillo-Campos\u2019s waiver and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>United States v.
