See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b245-16\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-17\">Eric Ayran Umali asserts that a California state court misstated and incorrectly applied the state law definition of insanity when it found him legally sane at the time he committed attempted murder and willful injury of a child. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 and affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Umali\u2019s habeas petition. We recount only the facts relevant to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-21\">A federal court may grant a state prisoner\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus only if the state court\u2019s adjudication of the petitioner\u2019s claims was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Supreme Court law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-22\">The applicable legal standard for sanity is defined by California state law. Federal habeas courts do not re-examine state court determinations of state law questions; rather, the petitioner must show that the proceedings were so fundamentally unfair that the defendant was denied due process. <em>See Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 71-73, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991); <em>Hicks v. Oklahoma, </em>447 U.S. 343, 346, 100 S.Ct. 2227, 65 L.Ed.2d 175 (1980); <em>Sandstrom v. Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 524, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 61 L.Ed.2d 39 (1979). The term about which Mr. Umali complains, \u201cappreciate,\u201d is a close synonym for \u201cknow and understand.\u201d The court\u2019s articulation of state law was not so indefensible that it violated Mr. Umali\u2019s federal due process rights. The district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Umali\u2019s habeas petition is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b245-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
