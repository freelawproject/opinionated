Call appeals pro se the Tax Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, finding the Commissioner could proceed with his action to collect Call\u2019s 1997 federal income tax and imposing sanctions against Call.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-22\">The Tax Court properly concluded that because Call received a statutory notice of deficiency, he was precluded from challenging his underlying tax liability during his Collection Due Process hearing. 28 U. S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6320; 6330(c)(2)(B). Because Call failed to raise any genuine issue of material fact, the Tax Court properly granted the Commissioner\u2019s summary judgment motion. <em>Hansen v. United States, </em>7 F.3d 137, 138 (9th Cir.1993). The Tax Court did not abuse its discretion in imposing sanctions against Call pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 6673 on the ground that he instituted the action primarily for purposes of delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b258-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
