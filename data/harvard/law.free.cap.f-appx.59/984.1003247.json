R.App. P. 34(a)(2). Accordingly, appellants\u2019 request for oral argument is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b1008-18\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-19\">Emilia Navarro de Velazquez and her four adult children appeal pro se the district court\u2019s dismissal of their Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d) action and their related action alleging that defendants improperly handled the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) file of Jacinto Velazquez, the husband of Emilia Navarro de Velazquez and father of the other appellants. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6), <em>Arrington v. Wong, </em>237 F.3d 1066, 1069 (9th Cir.2001), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-20\">Because appellants received all of the documents that they sought from the INS shortly after they filed suit, the district court correctly determined that their FOIA action was moot. <em>See Carter v. Veterans Admin., </em>780 F.2d 1479, 1481 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-21\">The district court also properly dismissed on the basis of res judicata appellants\u2019 action alleging that the INS mishandled the file of Jacinto Velazquez and wrongfully denied them lawful permanent resident status. These claims had previously been adjudicated against appellants in two prior cases. <em>See Clark v. Bear Stearns &amp; Co., </em>966 F.2d 1318, 1320 (9th Cir.1992) (res judicata bars a party from relitigating claims that were decided in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>prior action between the same parties).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">The district court properly denied appellants\u2019 motion for disqualification pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144 because the affidavit in support of the motion was based primarily on Judge Jenkins\u2019s judicial rulings. <em>See United States v. Studley, </em>783 F.2d 934, 939 (9th Cir.1986) (a judge\u2019s prior adverse rulings are not sufficient cause for disqualification). Appellants\u2019 wholly unsubstantiated allegations that Judge Jenkins harbored anti-immigrant sentiments or was biased against Latinos are not legally sufficient grounds for recusal. <em>See Yagman v. Republic Ins., </em>987 F.2d 622, 626-27 (9th Cir.1993) (speculative assertions of invidious motive are insufficient to show judicial bias).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">Finally, we cannot consider appellants\u2019 contention that they are entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in their FOIA action because they did not file a motion for fees and costs in the district court as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d) and N.D. Cal. Civ. Local R. 54-4 &amp; 54-5. <em>See Dodd v. Hood River County, </em>59 F.3d 852, 863 (9th Cir.1995) (generally \u201ca federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed upon below\u201d) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"Aq5\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1009-9\">. Appellants\u2019 claim that they are entitled to relief under the Family Sponsor Immigration Act of 2002 is not cognizable in this action and must be presented to the INS as required in that Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
