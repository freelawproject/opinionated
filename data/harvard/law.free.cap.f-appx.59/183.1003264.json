We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">Archer first argues that the Government\u2019s failure to turn over the report of a Drug Enforcement Administration interview with Paul Robinson (the \u201cRobinson Report\u201d), in which he admitted selling methamphetamine to Ronald A. Stevens, constituted a violation of Archer\u2019s due process rights as prescribed by <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Archer asserts that if the Robinson Report had been available at trial it could have been used to establish a source other than Archer for the drugs sold by Stevens to government informant Neal McGregor. He further asserts that the ability to present evidence of another source of the drugs sold by Stevens gives rise to the \u201creasonable probability of a different result\u201d at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-15\">The Government presented overwhelming evidence of Archer\u2019s guilt, including extensive transcripts of the telephone calls between Archer and Stevens, in which prices and deliveries are discussed, and the calls between Stevens and customers waiting for Stevens to have drugs to sell. Testimony showing that a drug delivery was made to Stevens at Archer\u2019s request was produced at trial. Additionally, the Robinson Report made it clear that Stevens had at least one other source for drugs besides Robinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-16\">Archer maintains that the Robinson Report would have been supported by trial testimony from Stevens and Robinson. Archer\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s testimony at the \u00a7 2255 hearing, however, contradicted Stevens\u2019 allegation that he would have testified as a defense witness at Archer\u2019s trial. Moreover, even nine years after the trial, Robinson refused to testify at the \u00a7 2255 hearing for fear of self-incrimination. The Robinson Report, although exculpatory, does not establish \u201cthat there is a <em>reasonable probability </em>that the result of the trial would have been different if the suppressed documents had been disclosed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>the defense.\u201d <em>Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 289, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999) (quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Next, Archer contends he was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to effective representation because his trial counsel failed to call Stevens as a witness. Archer argues that both prongs of the standard for ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), are satisfied by his trial counsel\u2019s failure to call Stevens as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">At the \u00a7 2255 hearing, Stevens testified that he had told Archer\u2019s trial counsel that he was willing to testify at Archer\u2019s trial that he never purchased drugs from Archer. Archer\u2019s trial counsel, however, testified that Stevens had told his investigator that he would help in Archer\u2019s defense, but would <em>not </em>testify at trial. In reviewing an appeal, we must weigh the facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>Larez v. City of Los Angeles, </em>946 F.2d 630, 634 (9th Cir.1991). We must assume, therefore, that the district court found Archer\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s testimony credible. Archer has not produced sufficient evidence to rebut the \u201c \u2018strong presumption\u2019 \u201d that counsel provided \u201c \u2018reasonable professional assistance\u2019 \u201d at trial nor that he was \u201cprejudiced\u201d by his trial counsel\u2019s performance. <em>Mancuso v. Olivarez, </em>292 F.3d 939, 954 (9th Cir.2002) (quoting and citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687-89, 104 S.Ct. 2052).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Finally, Archer contends that the representation of his trial counsel and his first appellate counsel was ineffective because they failed to argue that the conspiracy charge under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 was a lesser included offense of the Continuing Criminal Enterprise charge under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848. Archer contends that \u201cthe imposition of concurrent sentences, at the original sentencing, as well as the imposition of administrative fees on all [five] Counts constituted double jeopardy violations\u201d under <em>Rutledge v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 292, 301-03, 116 S.Ct. 1241, 134 L.Ed.2d 419 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">Archer has already litigated this issue in regard to trial counsel in his second visit to this court in <em>United States v. Archer, </em>156 F.3d 1239 (9th Cir.1998) (unpublished table opinion). In that matter we determined that Archer forfeited this claim by not raising it in his first appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">Archer could have raised his claim of ineffective assistance of his first appellate counsel on his second appeal to this court. Because he failed to do so, he has forfeited that claim. <em>Kesselring v. F/T Arctic Hero, </em>95 F.3d 23, 24 (9th Cir.1996) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b208-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
