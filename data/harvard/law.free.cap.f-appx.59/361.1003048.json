On appeal, Chang claims that the District Court (1) abused its discretion by failing to hold a <em>Fatico </em>hearing pursuant to <em>United States v. Fatico, </em>579 F.2d 707 (2d Cir.1978), (2) erred in failing to apply the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard, instead of the \u201cpreponderance\u201d standard, to its evaluation of the Government\u2019s evidence presented at sentencing, and (3) erred in increasing Chang\u2019s sentencing level based on the death of a hostage where the Government had not shown that Chang had acted with premeditation, which counsel argues is required under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">Chang\u2019s claims fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\"><em>1. The </em>Fatico <em>Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">The District Court did not abuse its discretion in fading to hold a <em>Fatico </em>or other evidentiary hearing because Chang\u2019s challenges to the Court\u2019s sentence are limited to legal issues disputing (i) the Court\u2019s ability to rely on the statements of confidential informants and of two co-conspirators contained in the Pre-Sentence Report and proffered by the Government, and (ii) the Court\u2019s calculation of Chang\u2019s sentencing level under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d). While Chang\u2019s brief is rife with speculation on the motives to he of the confidential informants and co-conspirators, Chang never actually disputed the factual content of their statements-namely, that a hostage was beaten to death while Chang stood guard, that Chang defaced and dumped the body, and that Chang abandoned the vehicle that he used to dump the body. Absent Chang\u2019s denial of these facts, there were no disputed issues of fact about which the District Court could (or should) have held a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">\n<em>2. The Evidentiary Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">The District Court did not err in evaluating the Government\u2019s evidence at sentencing under a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard. A sentencing court is not bound by the rules of evidence that would pertain at trial and is not limited to \u201cadmissible evidence\u201d in making its sentencing determination. <em>United States v. Brinkworth, </em>68 F.3d 633, 641 (2d Cir.1995). Instead, the court may consider any \u201creliable\u201d proof. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3, cmt. A sentencing court thus may rely on \u201chearsay statements, evidence of uncharged crimes, dropped counts of an indictment and criminal activity resulting in acquittal,\u201d <em>United States v. Reese, </em>33 F.3d 166, 174 (2d Cir.1994), and even may choose to rely the hearsay statements of an absent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>informant, <em>United States v. Streich, </em>987 F.2d 104, 107 (2d Cir.1993) <em>(per curiam).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Under this standard, the District Court\u2019s reliance on the statements of confidential informants and of Chang\u2019s co-conspirators that were contained in the Pre-Senteneing Report was not error. Each of these parties may have had an incentive to provide useful information to investigators in return for some consideration. The fact that the statements were not made by disinterested parties, however, does not, standing alone, deprive the statements of probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The statements at issue are rendered more rehable by the fact that Chang never denied that a hostage was killed. The District Court offered Chang several opportunities to make statements during his sentencing. Chang first replied to the Court only that he believed his sentence was too severe. The Court explained that the sentence was significantly more severe that it would have been for hostage-taking alone because a hostage was killed during the course of the crime, and then again invited Chang to make a statement. Chang again only stated that he felt that the sentence was too severe, and neither stated to the Court that a hostage was <em>not </em>killed nor denied the confidential informants\u2019 and co-conspirators\u2019 statements that he had defaced and dumped the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\n<em>3. The Application of the Murder Guideline, U.S.S.G. 2A1.1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Appellant argues that the District Court erred in increasing his sentencing under the Sentencing Guideline for murder, U.S.S.G. 2A.1, where the Government did not show, or even argue, premeditation. Rather, he claims even if a hostage was killed, that the Court should have applied a lower increase in sentencing level pursuant to the Sentencing Guideline for manslaughter. Contrary to Chang\u2019s claim, application of the murder guideline was correct irrespective of whether the hostage\u2019s killing was premeditated. In light of Chang\u2019s conviction for hostage -taking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1203, Chang was sentenced pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A4.1 (Kidnaping, Abduction, Unlawful Restraint). Section 2A4.1 cross-references the Sentencing Guideline for First Degree Murder, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A1.1, in cases where \u201cthe victim was lolled under circumstances that would constitute murder under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111.\u201d Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111(a), for its part, defines the crime of murder punishable under the statute as (i) any killing committed with premeditation (or \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d), and (ii) any killing committed in the course of a felony, specifically including \u201ckidnaping.\u201d In other words, \u00a7 1111 contains a felony-murder rule, which dispenses of the requirement of premeditation. Therefore, because Chang was eligible to be sentenced, pursuant to his plea, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A4.1, and that section incorporates by cross-reference the felony-murder rule of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111, and further because reliable proof showed that a hostage was killed \u201cunder circumstances that would constitute murder under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111,\u201d the District Court was required to increase his sentence to account for the hostage\u2019s death. The Government was not required to show premeditation-or even direct participation-by Chang because the felony-murder rule embodied in \u00a7 1111 contains no such requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">Appellant raises several other claims on appeal. Having reviewed all of the Appellant\u2019s other claims, and finding in them no merit, the judgment of conviction and sentence entered by the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
