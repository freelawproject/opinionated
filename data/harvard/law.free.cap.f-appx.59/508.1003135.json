The district court determined that his total offense level was 34 which with his criminal history category of VII yielded a sentencing range of 262 to 327 months. The court sentenced him to a 262-month custodial term to be followed by a five-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-19\">Cruz appeals, contending that \u201cthe [district] court erred in denying [his] downward departure motion for over-statement of criminal history because it failed to employ the applicable analytical framework, instead relying upon a skewed view of plea agreement stipulations and its assignment to [him] of responsibility for the sins of his son.\u201d Br. at 11. His son is a co-defendant in this case. The government answers that we lack jurisdiction because the district court explicitly recognized that it had the authority to depart but declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-20\">We agree with the government and thus conclude that we do not have jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. McQuilkin, </em>97 F.3d 723, 729-30 (3d Cir.1996). Consequently, we will dismiss this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
