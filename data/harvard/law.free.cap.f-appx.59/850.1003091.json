Glover, proceeding pro se, brought this action against PremierBank, alleging that it has unlawfully gained control of funds from his great-grandfather\u2019s estate. The district court granted the bank\u2019s motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) because Glover failed to establish diversity jurisdiction. Specifically, the court concluded that he failed to demonstrate that more than $75,000 was in controversy, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, and the court could see no other basis for federal jurisdiction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Glover\u2019s great-grandfather, Arthur \u201cA.J.\u201d Glover, died in 1949. According to the terms of his will and its two codicils, most of the estate went into a trust for AJ.\u2019s wife that terminated when she died in 1966. At that time the trust residue was divided to benefit three of A.J.\u2019s children and the wife of a fourth. Two of the children, Wilbur Glover (plaintiffs grandfather) and Myra Bostwick, received cash. The remainder funded separate trusts established by the two codicils, one benefit-ting son Robert B. Glover and the other daughter-in-law Fay Glenn Glover, the wife of Arthur Glover, Jr. The 1966 value of the Robert B. Glover Trust assets was $23,924, and the trust assets in the Fay Glenn Glover Trust at that time totaled $11,424. By the time of Robert\u2019s death in 1984, First National Bank, PremierBank\u2019s predecessor, had been appointed trustee for the two trusts. Robert\u2019s trust terminated with his death, and after its assets were liquidated the cash was distributed equally \u2014 $6,710 each \u2014 among Wilbur, Myra and the Fay Glenn Glover Trust. Fay is still alive, and PremierBank remains trustee of the trust created for her benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">As best we can tell from his complaint, Glover alleges that PremierBank has no right to retain the assets of the Fay Glenn Glover Trust; later submissions clarify that he also alleges misconduct in the 1984 distribution of the assets of the Robert B. Glover Trust. Characterizing himself as the \u201csurvivor\u201d of A.J.\u2019s estate, Glover maintains that he is entitled to the assets administered by PremierBank.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">PremierBank supported its Rule 12(b)(1) motion with an affidavit from a bank trust officer and accompanying exhibits detailing the history of A.J.\u2019s estate and the Fay Glenn Glover Trust. The trust officer, who oversees the Fay Glenn Glover Trust, valued its assets at $24,949 on December 21, 2001, and reported total distributions of $20,516 to Fay Glenn Glover over the lifetime of the trust. PremierBank later submitted the trust officer\u2019s supplemental affidavit with receipts and releases demonstrating that Glover\u2019s grandfather had received his share of the Robert B. Glover Trust residue in 1984. Glover responded with a 1949 inventory that he reads as valuing the entirety of his great-grandfather\u2019s property at over $113,000. He also asserted federal-question jurisdiction under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 687f(b), which imposes liability for breaches of fiduciary duty by persons involved in the management of a small business investment company. And he filed a \u201ccomplaint for conversion\u201d alleging that in 1950 PremierBank (or its chairman James Schafer, who was named in the complaint but never made part of the caption or served with the complaint and summons) wrongfully converted to its own use savings bonds, stocks and Holstein cows then worth over $65,000 (as valued in copies from the inventory of A.J.\u2019s property). The district court concluded that Glover had no claim to his great-grandfather\u2019s entire estate and that his \u201ccomplaint for conversion\u201d was \u201cinadequate on its face\u201d because any applicable statute of limitations would have expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>On appeal Glover maintains that his suit was improperly dismissed both because more than $75,000 is in controversy and because his complaint presents a federal question. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1332. Although Glover never established that he and PremierBank were citizens of different states (Glover explained only that he \u201cresides\u201d in New York), PremierBank (a Wisconsin corporation with its principal place of business in Wisconsin) assumed complete diversity existed and challenged only the amount in controversy. In response to PremierBank\u2019s Rule 12(b)(1) motion, Glover was required to establish the amount in controversy with competent proof \u2014 i.e., \u201cproof to a reasonable probability that jurisdiction exists.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Middle Tenn. News Co. v. Charnel of Cincinnati, Inc., </em>250 F.3d 1077, 1081 (7th Cir.2001) (citation and internal quotations omitted). We review the district court\u2019s resolution of factual issues pertaining to jurisdiction only for abuse of discretion. <em>Sapperstein v. Hager, </em>188 F.3d 852, 856 (7th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Glover advances several theories in an attempt to support diversity jurisdiction. He points to the inventory of his great-grandfather\u2019s estate in 1949, and he maintains that his complaint challenges both the bank\u2019s handling of the Fay Glenn Glover Trust, and its 1984 distribution of the Robert B. Glover Trust. He also now claims punitive damages for what he calls \u201cbreach of trust,\u201d and points to the value of the assets allegedly converted by PremierBank in 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">The 1949 inventory of A.J.\u2019s property is inadequate because Glover submitted nothing suggesting he might somehow be entitled to <em>all </em>of his great-grandfather\u2019s property. PremierBank currently administers only the Fay Glenn Glover Trust, which holds $24,949. And as the bank points out without contradiction, even if the distributions throughout the lifetime of the trust are added to that amount, the total is still only $45,465.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">Nor does Glover\u2019s challenge to the distribution of the residue of the Robert B. Glover Trust get him close to the $75,000 threshold. He provided nothing that calls into question the bank\u2019s assertion (supported by court documents and signed releases) that Wilbur, Myra, and the Fay Glenn Glover Trust received only $6,710 each. Even if Glover could somehow claim an interest in his grandfather Wilbur\u2019s share, adding that amount to all of the money that could possibly be at issue from the Fay Glenn Glover trust would not total even $53,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">Similarly, Glover\u2019s claim for punitive damages adds nothing because he has demonstrated no basis for his entitlement to such an award. When available, punitive damages must be considered in the amount-in-controversy calculation. <em>See Bell v. Preferred Life Assurance Soc\u2019y, </em>320 U.S. 238, 240, 64 S.Ct. 5, 88 L.Ed. 15 (1943). When a plaintiff relies on punitive damages to satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement, we first ask if punitive damages are recoverable under state law. If so, subject matter jurisdiction exists unless it appears beyond a legal certainty that the plaintiff could not recover the jurisdictional amount. <em>Del Vecchio v. Conseco, Inc., </em>230 F.3d 974, 978 (7th Cir.2000). Wisconsin law authorizes punitive damages when a defendant acts \u201cmaliciously\u201d or \u201cin an intentional disregard\u201d of a plaintiffs rights. <em>See </em>Wis. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 895.85(3). But even if we assume Glover has some claim for what he is calling \u201cbreach of trust\u201d (leaving aside our curiosity about what duty owed to Glover PremierBank could possibly have breached), he provided no factual basis even remotely suggesting malicious intent, so his purported claim to punitive damages is unavailing. <em>See Anthony v. Sec. Pac. Fin. Servs., Inc., </em>75 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>F.3d 311, 316 (7th Cir.1996) (when subject matter jurisdiction is challenged, plaintiff relying on punitive damages must present \u201cfacts sufficient to satisfy the legal standard for punitive damages\u201d). And any additional amount PremierBank allegedly \u201cconverted\u201d in 1950 does not increase the amount in controversy because a complaint for \u201cconversion\u201d that occurred over 50 years ago is untimely and frivolous on its face. <em>See </em>Wis. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 893.51(1) (six-year statute of limitations for conversion); <em>see also Martin-Trigona v. Champion Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>892 F.2d 575, 577 (7th Cir.1989); <em>cf. Walker v. Thompson, </em>288 F.3d 1005,1010 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Finally, Glover\u2019s purported bases of federal question jurisdiction (for instance, that a breach of trust \u201cby definition\u201d violates federal law and that the State of Wisconsin violated the Contracts Clause of the Constitution) are patently frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
