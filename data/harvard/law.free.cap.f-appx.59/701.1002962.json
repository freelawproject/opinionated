Gwin, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b725-23\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b725-24\">Defendant Robbins Lee Mitchell appeals his sentence of 18 months imprisonment following his guilty plea to making threats against a member of the immediate family of Vice President Albert Gore, Jr., in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 879(a)(2). Mitchell has already served his sentence of incarceration and is currently on the final six weeks of his remaining supervised release. For reasons stated herein, we affirm the sentence of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-25\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b725-26\">After the November 2000 presidential election. Vice President Albert Gore, Jr. challenged the results of the election in Florida, which had declared George W. Bush the winner by a small margin. Against this backdrop, Mitchell placed four phone calls between November 9-14, 2002, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>to retired Judge Whit LaFon, an uncle of Gore. The calls were all recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">The only issue on appeal is whether the court should have enhanced Mitchell\u2019s sentence pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(2) because the instant offense involved more than two threats. At sentencing, the district court set the base offense level at 12, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2A6.1, the level assigned for making a threatening or harassing communication. The court increased the offense level by three pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3A1.2 because the victim was a family member of a government officer and the offense of conviction was motivated by such status. The court also reduced the offense level by three for acceptance of responsibility. The resulting total offense level was 14. With a criminal history category of I, Mitchell faced a sentence of 15-21 months and received a sentence of 18 months. Without the two-level enhancement for making more than two threats, Mitchell\u2019s sentencing range would have been between 10-16 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">A district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the application of the sentencing guidelines are reviewed <em>de novo, </em>and its factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Newell, </em>309 F.3d 396, 400 (6th Cir.2002). The determination that a defendant made more than two threats is a factual finding subject to the clear error standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">A \u201ccommunication containing a threat\u201d is one where \u201ca reasonable person (1) would take the statement as a serious expression of an intention to inflict bodily harm (the mens rea), and (2) would perceive such expression as being communicated to effect some change or achieve some goal through intimidation (the actus reus).\u201d <em>United States v. Alkhabaz, </em>104 F.3d 1492,1495 (6th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">Mitchell admits that the first call made to LaFon was threatening, but he denies that any of the remaining calls was threatening. Without relating herein the language of the last three threatening calls, we find that the district court correctly decided that at least three of the calls were threatening. In the application notes following this guideline provision, the Sentencing Commission related that \u201cthis offense includes a particularly wide range of conduct and ... it is not possible to include all of the potentially relevant circumstances in the offense level,\u201d and \u201cin determining whether subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) apply, the court shall consider conduct that occurred prior to the offense and conduct that occurred during the offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2A6.1, comment, (n.l <em>&amp; </em>n.3). The district court properly considered the cumulative impact the successive communications had on the victim. It had the full benefit of being able to listen to the recordings and consider the tone of voice used by Mitchell in his calls. The district court did not commit clear error when it found that the multiple messages Mitchell left on the answering machine of Judge LaFon involved more than two threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
