He filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 seeking declaratory and injunctive relief \u201cvacating the opinion of the Florida Supreme Court ordering the three month suspension of plaintiff\u201d and for a judgment against the judges of the panel which disciplined him \u201cin the amount of $2,070.23 to reimburse plaintiff for the amount he was ordered to pay as costs of the disciplinary proceedings.\u201d The district court dismissed for want of jurisdiction and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-20\">Among the several answers to plaintiff\u2019s claim, a basic and dispositive one is that we hold no warrant to review final judgments of the Florida Supreme Court. That power is reserved to the Supreme Court of the United States. Complaining of constitutional violations, Mr. Sawyer has cast his complaint in the form of a civil rights suit. What he seeks, however, is simply reversal of the state court judgment. We have scrutinized the state proceedings and find them to be manifestly judicial ones. They could have been reviewed in the Supreme Court. <em>In re Summers, </em>325 U.S. 561, 65 S.Ct. 1307, 89 L.Ed. 1795 (1945). Mr. Sawyer has boarded the wrong flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
