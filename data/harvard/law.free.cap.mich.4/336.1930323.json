As to the authority of the clerk to give the order in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>favor of Nolan, upon which, the goods were sold, the testimony was conflicting, and it was sought to establish such authority by showing the custom among merchants in that particular.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-5\">The defendants in error, prior to the suit, presented their account, including the bill sold Nolan, to the plaintiff in error for payment, but he denied his liabilityjffor the goods sold Nolan, and offered to pay the rest of the account. The account was withdrawn, and another, without the disputed items, presented, paid, and receipted by \u201ccash in full to date.\u201d It was in testimony, that the claim for goods sold Nolan was abandoned, but that the receipt was designed to show what the parties intended. On this point the jury found against the plaintiff in error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-6\">The cause had been three times tried before a jury. A juror was on the pannel the last time who had served on a former trial. None of the parties or their counsel knew the fact until the jury on the last trial had retired to consult on their verdict, when the fact became known. The attorney for the plaintiff in error informed the Court at once of the fact. No objection was made to the verdict on that ground, or to the juror who had before served. The plaintiff in error asked the Court to charge that the receipted account was <em>prima faoie </em>evidence of an adjustment of all accounts between the parties between the dates of the first and last items, though subject to be rebutted by other evidence in the case. Also, that the custom of merchants set up by the defendants in error was unreasonable and void. The Court refused so to chai^ge. After verdict, the plaintiff' in error filed affidavits, showing that the juror aforesaid had sat on a former trial, and moved to set aside the verdict on that ground. The Court denied the motion, and upon these several rulings plaintiff sued out this writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-7\"><em>Wilcox do Gray, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbJN\">cited upon the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>error assigned: 1 Jones, R., 418; 14 U.

While, it is true, as a general proposition, that settlement of accounts between parties is, <em>prima </em>facie, a settlement of <em>all </em>accounts, yet, as there was evidence in this case'tending to show that the demand for which this action is brought was expressly excluded from the settlement of the 14th of February, 1854, the Circuit Judge very properly left it to the jury to determine what was settled, and whether the facts attending the settlement showed a relinquishment of the demand in question by the defendants in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">The Court, also, properly refused to charge, that the custom sought to be established was unreasonable. This was a pure question of law, with which-the jury had nothing to do. User is the evidence of custom, and this is a matter for the jury, which the Court will submit or not, according as it shall find the custom sought to be established reasonable, and not illegal, or otherwise. Whether a general custom can establish a liability upon the part of a master for the contracts of his servant \u2014 a merchant for those of his clerk, is, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>my mind, extremely questionable; the general rule being, that, in such cases, liability depends upon direct authority, or special or individual custom. But, as this question is not presented, the Court expresses no opinion upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Nor was there error in refusing to set aside the verdict, and grant a new trial upon the reason assigned. It appears that the feet, that one of the jurors had sat in a former trial, was known to the counsel for the plaintiff in error before the verdict was rendered. It became the duty of the counsel to ask the interposition of the Court, as soon as that fact was ascertained by him. By neglecting to do this, and electing to risk a verdict, the party was bound by such verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">This, moreover, is a question addressed to the sound discretion of the Court below, and cannot be ground of exception under our system of practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b339-8\">Present, Martin, Wing, Pratt, Copeland, Johnson, and Bacon, J., J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b339-9\">Green, J., did not sit in this case.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b339-10\">Douglass, J., did not participate, having, decided the cause in the Court below.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
