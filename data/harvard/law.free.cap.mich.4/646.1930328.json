After breach of condition of assignment, C., with E.\u2019s consent, assigned the securities in like manner to I. B., who, after condition broken of assignment to him, sold the sccurties to J. By the latter they were sold to G. B., who procured a conveyance of the mortgaged premises from mortgagor and wife, and canceled the bond. E., the obligee and mortgagee, after he assigned to C., and before C. assigned to E. B., becoming insolvent, was prosecuted by creditors\u2019 till in New York; and, by order of the Court of Chancery, assigned all his estate to a Receiver, and the assignment was duly recorded in the county where the mortgaged premises were; but of this, I. B., the second assignee, was ignorant until after he acquired the securities, when he applied to the Receiver to redeem them by paying the debt, for security of'which he held; but the Receiver declined. After said conveyance by the mortgagor and wife to said last assignee, and the cancelation of the bond, the defendants, R. and E. C., became purchasers of the last assignee\u2019s title, in good faith and ignorant of the assignment by E. to the Receiver; and, on bill filed by the latter, to redeem the bond and mortgage. <em>Held,</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b646-6\">First.

Church, held the title in fee, through a foreclosure of a mortgage given by one Bolles to <em>~W. </em>McCamus ; complainant did hot claim this mortgage to remain open, but asserted that Bolles himself had a mere mortgage interest, and it was <em>this </em>which complainant claimed the right to redeem. Said defendants, R. and E. Church, only appeared and defended.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-6\">The history of the case was this: George' Ketchum, owning the fee of the land, gave a bond and mortgage to George Fetterman, in May, 1836 : March 12, 1838, George Fetter-man assigned this bond and mortgage to Robert G. Cruttenden, in the usual form, but with a proviso that if he should pay. Cruttenden a sum due to him, and such further advances as Cruttenden might make, then the assignment should be void ; and Cruttenden, if he had received the amount of it, should account accordingly. After breach of this condition, and with Fetterman\u2019s assent, Cruttenden assigned and delivered the bond and mortgage to Isaac <em>W. </em>Bishop in the same manner, to secure a note on which Fetterman was liable with Cruttenden. Bishop, after condition broken, sold the securities to one Jones, who sold them to Bolles. Bolles took from Ketchum a deed of the land and cancelled the bond. After-wards he made the mortgage on the land above referred to, to W. McCamus, wdio foreclosed it, and the defendants R. and E. Church purchased on the foreclosure, and therefore held through Bolles\u2019 title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-7\">Graydon, after Cruttenden\u2019s claim had become absolute, and before Bishop purchased, was made Receiver of Fetter-man in a creditor\u2019s bill in New York, and Fetterman assigned to him under the statute, and pursuant to an order of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>Court of Chancery of that State. Of this, Bishop had no knowledge,when he purchased. Having afterwards learned of it, Bishop, desiring to dispose of the securities, applied to Graydon to have him redeem by paying him the amount of his debt, but Graydon declined \u2014 refused to undertake it, because he did not believe anything could be realized, and authorized Bishop to dispose of them in his discretion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-5\">The case came on to be argued at the December term, 1856, of said Court, and after argument, the following questions were reserved by the Circuit Judge, for the opinion of this Court: \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-6\">1. Whether the Receiver of Eetterman, by the assignment to him under the statute of New York, took any interest in the said bond and mortgage from Ketchum and wife to Eetterman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-7\">2. Whether a Receiver appointed in the State of New York, can, as such Receive!\u2019, institute a suit in this Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-8\">3. Whether the conveyance from Ketchum to Bolles operated as a merger of said mortgage, which he then held, so as to make the title in him complete.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-9\">4. Whether said mortgage in the hands of Bolles, was subject to any claim of the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-10\">5. Whether the land in the hands of Bolles, was subject to any claim of the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-11\">6. Whether the parties holding the land under Bolles, held the same subject to any prior equity of the complainant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b648-12\"><em>Hovey K. </em>Olarhe, for complainant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b648-13\">Comity, to sister States, requires that Receivers, appointed in such States, should be allowed to collect their effects, wherever they may find them. <em>(Story Confl.

(4 <em>Bouvier Inst., </em>250; 2 <em>Sjpenc. Eg.

At the time of the assignment by Fetterman, the bond was in his possession at Albany.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-6\">The assignment of a mortgage of real estate as a security, is a mortgage of the mortgage, and it confers upon the assignee all the powers, and charges him with all the obligations of a mortgage of real estate. <em>(Slee </em>vs. <em>Manhattan Co., </em>1 <em>Paige, </em>48; <em>Clark </em>vs. <em>Henry, </em>7 <em>J.

(1 <em>Hill on Mor\u00eds., </em>244; <em>Story Eg. Jur., </em>\u00a7 1023; 1 <em>Pow. on Mort., </em>119,122'; <em>lb., </em>360, 363; <em>Hart </em>vs. <em>Ten Eyck, </em>2 <em>J. C.

Juris., </em>\u00a7 1016; 1 <em>Pow. on Mort., p. </em>109 <em>and notes; Willis on Trustees, p. </em>68, 10 <em>Bow Lib.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>If by foreclosure, or by any mode which operates as a discharge of the mortgage, the assignee takes the title to the land, he will hold it as trustee, and will be decreed to convey it to the original mortgagee, on payment of the debt which it was first assigned to secure. <em>(Story Eq. Juris., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 976, 1258,1260; 1 <em>Eow. on Mori., go. </em>109; 2 <em>Lead Eq. Ga., jyp. </em>97, 98.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b650-5\"><em>D. D. Hughes, </em>with whom was <em>J. Van Arman </em>and <em>J. VOanvpbell, </em>for the defendants, R. and E. Church.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-6\">The title of the defendants Church is a perfect record title to the land, and cannot be touched by the complainant\u2019s equities, if he had them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-7\">When they bought, they took a title which had become in Bolles a perfect legal title. In that title, the equity of redemption, which was conveyed to Bolles by Ketchum, Graydon confessedly had no interest. His interest, if any (and even then we submit he had none), was a secret interest in the securities then owned by Bolles. He had an interest in the bond, but not in the land. \"When Bolles, holding the mortgage, purchased the equity of redemption, the effect of that purchase was to invest him with the full and unencumbered legal title to the land. Any one buying from him could only be required to look thus far. The registry laws are made for the express purpose of saving purchasers from outstanding claims to which they have nothing to call their attention. Graydon\u2019s claim nowhere appeared. Bolles, having the bond through a series of assignments, had the right to receive, all the money upon it, or to convert it. If any one had the right to any share of the funds, it was but as <em>cestui que trust </em>of him as trustee. He might be liable to \u00e1ccount, but no one dealing with Mm could be compelled to see that he appropriated the money rightly. It cannot be doubted, that even if the title had been in him expressly as trustee under such papers as he had, it would be with full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>power to convey. The doctrine that' the union of the legal and equitable estates produces a merger, is subject to no exception, except the interest of the mortgagee. If he desires to permit a merger, and there are good and proper reasons for keeping the estates separate, then they may be ; as, for instance, where there is a subsequent mortgage which, by the merger, would become prior to his right, he has a right to set up his mortgage as a separate thing. But this is only an apparent exception, because he does not get the <em>whole </em>title, if there be such a mortgage. <em>(Forbes </em>vs. <em>Moffat, </em>18 <em>Ves., </em>384, 389.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-5\">The exceptions are all made for the benefit of the mortgagee ; and if he consents, there can be no doubt of the merger. (4 <em>Kents Com., </em>102, 103; <em>Walker </em>vs. <em>Baxter, </em>26 <em>Vt., </em>760; <em>Gardner </em>vs. <em>Astor, </em>3 <em>J. C. R., </em>55; <em>James </em>vs. <em>Johnson &amp; Morey, </em>6 <em>J. C. R., </em>417; <em>Gibson </em>vs. <em>Crehore, </em>2 <em>Cow., </em>246; <em>Jerome </em>vs. <em>Seymour, Harr. Ch. R., </em>357; <em>Mills </em>vs. <em>Comstock, </em>5 <em>J. C. R., </em>214; <em>Starr </em>vs. <em>Ellis, </em>6 <em>J. C. R., </em>393; <em>Freeman vs. Paul, </em>3 <em>Greenl., </em>260; <em>Campbell </em>vs. <em>Knights, </em>11 <em>Shep., </em>332.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-6\">In this case, there can be no doubt of the intention of the parties; for when he took the conveyance of the equity of redemption from Ketchum, Bolles cancelled the bond, which operated as a discharge of the mortgage, upon the principle that the bond <em>is </em>the mortgage to all intents and purposes \u2014 \u25a0 the security upon the land constituting a mere incident to the debt. <em>(Lessee of Jennings </em>vs. <em>Wood, </em>20 <em>Ohio R., </em>261.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-7\">McCamus, then, in taking a mortgage from Bolles, took a security which was strictly legal in all respects. He found the record clear, and unless actually notified that Graydon had an interest in the land, could not have been held liable in any sense. But neither Bishop, Jones nor Bolles could be held subject to the Graydon claim. An assignee takes subject not to equities attaching between his assignor and other parties, but equities attaching against the instrument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>itself. <em>(Cicotte </em>vs. Gagnier, 3 <em>Mich. R. </em>131; <em>James </em>vs. <em>Morey, </em>2 <em>Cow., </em>247).</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-5\">And one who deals with a mortgagee in whom the estate has become absolute, is not to be affected by any such claims. <em>(Mills </em>vs. <em>Comstock, </em>5 <em>J. C. R., </em>214; <em>and above cases).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-6\">The case o\u00ed Slee <em>vs. </em>The Manhattan Company (1 <em>Paige R., </em>324), is the only case to be found in which the right of redemption has been held to attach under any circumstances, to <em>land </em>purchased in by a partial assignee of a mortgage. But that case decides no such absolute doctrine. There had been no intermediate assignments. The Corporation that purchased the land had but a partial interest in the security, and expressly agreed to pay Slee any surplus that might arise upon a sale of the land. That case is analogous to the ordinary one of a trustee jrarchasing in the trust estate upon a mortgage. He may be held liable in an action for money had and received; because, having destroyed the security, it is all one as if he had collected it. Or, when a special trust exists, the <em>cestui gue trust </em>may elect to take the trust estate; in which case, however, the authorities are uniform that the election must be exercised speedily.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-7\">That case would have been more, analogous to this, if there had been intermediate assignees, and if the Company had sold the property to an innocent purchaser, and Slee had then sought to reach the land in his hand. The case negatives completely any such right as this would have been. And here, too, Graydon has stood by and allowed years to pass while Bolles was acting and encumbering the property, without act of warning. It would be aiding him in a direct fraud to allow an intervention now, even if he had once had a right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-8\">And not only so, but by his express declarations he has shown that he intended and expected to claim nothing, and expressly told Bishop to do what he thought best with the securities. See Bishop\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>The authority of a Receiver is confined to the forum of his appointment. <em>(Booth </em>vs. Clark, 17 <em>How. R., </em>322.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-5\">The difficulties suggested in that case, occur here with great force. He claims, by this bill, a right to the possession and control of real estate within this State. According to the theory of the complaint, the defendants are tenants of the New York Court of Chancery. Though the medium of an assignment, which, if ever so valid, conveyed no <em>legal </em>interest in any thing, he now claims the legal title to this real estate, and the rents and profits</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-6\">The assignment to the Receiver contains no description of any bond or mortgage, and there was no delivery of them, and no notice by Graydon of any such assignment. The possession of the instruments, though not, perhaps, strictly essential to pass the title, is nevertheless so essential that the rights of innocent parties will always be protected, under it. <em>(B. S. of 1838,p. </em>331, \u00a7 6; <em>B. 8. of 1846,p. </em>327, \u00a7 7; <em>Stoddard </em>vs. Butler, 20 <em>Wend., </em>507; 1 <em>Powell on </em>Mort., 23 <em>a.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-7\">The bond is the principal, and the mortgage is merely the incident. The bond is a mere chattel interest, and so is a mortgage. <em>(Wilson v</em>s. <em>Troup, </em>2 <em>Cow., </em>195; <em>Dougherty vs. Randall, </em>3 <em>Mich. R., </em>1; <em>Jackson vs. Willard, </em>4 <em>J. R., </em>43; <em>Jackson </em>vs. <em>Blodget, </em>5 <em>Cow., </em>202; <em>Johnson </em>vs. Hart, 3 <em>Johns.

H., </em>484.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-8\">And upon failure to pay according to condition, the title vests absolutely. <em>(Ackley </em>vs. <em>Finch, </em>7 <em>Cow., </em>90; <em>Tannahill </em>vs. <em>Tuttle, 3 Mich. R., </em>10; <em>Brown </em>vs. Bement, 8 <em>J. R., </em>96; <em>Langdon </em>vs. <em>Buel, </em>9 <em>Wend. R., </em>80.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-9\">There is no right to redeem a mortgage chattel when it has been disposed of, after forfeiture. The quality of being subject to redemption is the main thing which distinguishes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>pledges from chattel mortgages. And in the case of the latter, the cases do not maintain any such general right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-4\">Tucker <em>vs. </em>Wilson (1 <em>P.
