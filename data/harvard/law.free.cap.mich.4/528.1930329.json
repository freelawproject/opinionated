It is evident, then, that the instructions to the jury, given below, cannot be examined here on certiorari. (2 <em>Burr.

That, granting the proceedings in their inception were summary, yet, after \u00a1their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>arrival in the Circuit, they were according to the course of the common law, and that, as <em>certiorari </em>only brings up the. question of jurisdiction, in the Court below, error is the only method of reviewing the charge of the Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The motion was overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
