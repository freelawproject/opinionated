The defendant offered to prove the assessments against the real estate of Wilson; warrants issued to the collector; that the piano was found on the premises of Wilson and claimed by him, long after the expiration of the lease; that under the warrants the piano, &amp;c., were sold to Nicholson, who sold them to the defendant: to be followed by proof that Wilson asserted whilst the piano, &amp;e., were in his possession, that he had paid for them in full and that Wilson a short time before the sale had claimed them under an execution against him; that they were set apart to him and afterwards sold for the taxes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-9\">The plaintiffs objected to the evidence; it was rejected by the court, and a bill of exceptions sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-10\">Both parties then gave evidence as to the value of the piano, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-11\">The court charged that under the evidence the plaintiffs were entitled to recover; the only question was as to damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-12\">The verdict was for the plaintiffs for $420.50.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-13\">The defendant took a writ of error and assigned for error the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>rejection o\u00ed his offer of evidence and the instruction of the court to the. jury.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b292-6\"><em>Bigham Blalcely, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOn\">cited Davis <em>v. </em>Bigler, 12 P.

No offer was made to show that the lease had been terminated and the piano suffered to remain in the hands of Wilson, the lessee, as his property. His declarations of property, or the acts of other parties in attempting to treat the piano as his, could not, therefore, affect his lessors. The property remained in bailment and consequently was not liable to a sale for payment of his debts, or for taxes. Possession under a mere bailment for hire is not a constructive fraud; otherwise much of the business of men would be ended, and the poorer the bailee the less would be his ability to hire the use of property needful to him. We see no error in rejecting the defendant\u2019s offer. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
