A lease of an hotel stipulated that the landlord would raise the house, add a new story, and make other alterations; the tenant alleging that the alterations had been negligently done, so that his furniture had been injured and he had lost the use of rooms in different stories, &amp;e., refused to pay the rent on the ground that he suffered greater damage than its amount. The landlord distrained. In replevin, <em>Held </em>the evidence by the tenant of the rental value per day of the rooms of which he was deprived was inadmissible, because the offer was too vague, as not designating the story.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b462-11\">2.

The lease further provided that the lessor might take forcible possession of the premises if the rent was not paid when due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-12\">The plaintiff testified, that upon complaint to the lessor, he agreed to make the repairs immediately. About May 1st they commenced to patch up the old porches, put in new floors, &amp;c.; the repairs were much delayed and done in a defective manner; the snow and rain came in, and made ice on the floor; the boards were upright and nailed to the old porch railing; the porch was the entrance to the four best rooms in the house on the second and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>third stories ; lessor took a portion of the roof off, and let the chimney down, doing considerable damage; plaintiff was deprived of three rooms wholly, and three partially, from the middle of May to the last of August; the work could have been done in three weeks; for three months plaintiff was deprived of eleven rooms; for all the year, of five rooms; the house was worth $5 per day less than if it had been repaired. He testified much in detail as to the damage suffered by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-6\">The plaintiff offered to show the rental value per day of the rooms of which he was deprived, by the fault of the defendant.

The. plaintiff objected; the evidence was admitted and a bill of exceptions sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-10\">A witness, who had conducted the National Hotel, testified that the bar would rent for three-fourths of the entire rent of the hotel; that the rooms on the fourth story were of small account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-11\">A number of other witnesses testified to about the same effect. They testified generally, also, that the proposed improvements would add very little to the rental value of the house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-12\">The defendant having rested, the plaintiff offered <em>\u201cto </em>rebut the foregoing evidence by showing that he had engaged permanent boarders for the five rooms on the fourth story as soon as they should be finished.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-13\">This was objected to by the defendant, rejected by the court, and a bill of exceptions sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-14\">The plaintiff\u2019s second point and its answer were :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-15\">As the consideration of the lease given in evidence in this case is single, the contract is entire; that part of the covenants of defendant, Otterstatter, is to erect a fourth story over the building leased, with rooms, and to take down the old porches, and convert them into proper hall-ways ; and if said defendant has refused or neglected to perform these covenants, he cannot recover any rent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-16\">Answer. \u201c There are no circumstances given in evidence in this case that would justify us in affirming-the above point.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-17\">The verdict was for the defendant in each of the cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-18\">The plaintiff sued out writs of error in all of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-19\">He assigned for error : \u2014 \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-20\">1.

The bill of exceptions has dwarfed the proportions of these cases into an outline so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>meagre as to make a resort to the general evidence indispensable to an intelligent view of the questions raised and tried. It appears from this evidence that the defendant undertoook to make the improvements which the terms of the lease required. It was alleged as ground of defence, and several witnesses testified, that the additional story stipulated for was added to the hotel building, operations having been commenced in May 1873, and continued at least until some time in June. It was claimed that the carpenter and mason work had been completed, and that the roof had been tinned as promptly as possible. The five rooms into which the additional story was divided had not been finished, but there was evidence that the plaintiff had interfered to prevent access to them by the workmen. It would seem, therefore, that the question presented to the jury was one of perfect or defective execution of a contract, and not one of its performance or non-performance. The general charge is not in the record. All that is properly here for review is the request of the plaintiff for instructions .that if the plaintiff had refused or neglected- to perform his covenants he could not recover rent, and the answer of the court that there were no circumstances given in evidence to justify an affirmance of the point. Upon the real issue tried, it is to be assumed that the cases were properly submitted. The principles of law which control the rights and duties of parties to contracts where questions of perfect, substantial, defective or deficient performance arise, or where performance by one party is prevented by the fault of the other, are well settled by a class of authorities to which Harris <em>v. </em>Liggett, 1 W. &amp; S. 301; Martin <em>v. </em>Schoenberger, 8 Id. 367; Bryant <em>v. </em>Stilwell, 12 Harris 314; Snodgrass <em>v. </em>Gavit, 4 Casey 221; and Miller <em>v. </em>Phillips, 7 Id. 218, belong. In the absence of complaint on this subject, it can only be taken for granted that these principles were justly applied. Defined within this limit as the issue apparently was, there was no room for, the application to it of the principles decided in McClurg <em>v. </em>Price, 9 P. F. Smith 420, where there had been no pretence of the performance of bis covenants by the lessor; and the effect of that decision on Obermeveru. Nichols, 6 Binney 159, and Fairman <em>v. </em>Fluck, 5 Watts 516, it is not now requisite to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The second error is assigned to the rejection of the offer of the plaintiff to prove the daily rental value of the rooms of which he was deprived by the fault of the defendant. This offer was too vague. It may have had reference to the rooms in the fourth story which the plaintiff had covenanted to build. In that case it was incompetent, for it would have introduced into the trial an element too partial and inadequate to meet the exigencies of the issue. In every case of this kind, the proper measure of damages is the difference between the value of the premises in the state in which the tenant takes them, and their value with the covenanted improve-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>merits made. But evidence had been given to show that the plaintiff had been deprived of the use of rooms in the lower part of the house in consequence of the falling of a chimney, alleged to have been caused by the defendant\u2019s workmen. Proof of the fact of the accident was apparently admitted without objection. Whether defence to the extent of the injury caused by it could be set up in these actions of replevin, need not be now discussed. The offer was ambiguous, for it could refer \u25a0 to either of two sets of rooms. Even if it referred to the lower rooms, it presented the defence in an objectionable form. For both reasons it was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The third and fourth assignments may be considered together. On the trial, the court admitted, under exception, evidence on the part of the defendant of the rental value of the bar-room, with a license, separate from the. rest of the house. To rebut that evidence the pl\u00e1intiff offered to show that be had engaged permanent boarders for the five rooms on the fourth story as soon as they should be finished, and this offer the court rejected. If evidence of the rental value of the bar-room was rightly received, the principle is not apparent that would warrant the rejection of evidence of the rental value of the rooms in the fourth story. But in each instance the evidence was incompetent. If the contract between the parties had been complied with substantially by the defendant, and such defects of performance only had been shown as could be compensated by damages to be found by a jury, those damages were to be assessed in each of these suits for the respective period for which the rent in each was claimed to the extent of the loss to which, for that period, the plaintiff was subjected. Proof of the rental value of the bar could not elucidate the issue, for to that source of profit the lease had given the plaintiff an unquestioned right. And even if it had been relevant, it violated the rule for the ascertainment of damages in cases of this kind. It was an item of detail selected from the body of the property, and the effect of the proof was to afford the jury the means of making a fresh contract between the parties in lieu of that which they had made for themselves. In fixing values of property, and in ascertaining damages for breaches of contracts like this, the extent of the injury suffered is to be established by general evidence of such values and a general estimate of such damages. The rule of this court, stated in The Schuylkill Navigation Company <em>v. </em>Thoburn, 7 S. &amp; R. 411, has been uniformly followed and enforced. Fairman <em>v. </em>Fluck, <em>supra, </em>was an action of replevin for goods distrained for rent. The lessor had covenanted to improve the yard of the tavern leased, and had failed to do so. Tn the opinion of. the court, Sergeant, J., stated the measure of damages to be the difference between the amount the property would have rented for with the improvements made, and the amount it would rent for without them. The judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>added : \u201c Not only are remote or speculative damages, such as the profits the lessee might possibly have made, to be rejected, but even the proof of a direct loss of business, by showing that a customer went away in consequence of the condition of the yard.\u201d Evidence of merely illustrative individual acts to settle a question of value or a question of damages would be equally inconvenient and unsafe. The value of a tract of land could not be fixed by proof of the price paid for a similar tract, and the rental value of a single room in a hotel could not be fixed by proof of the rent a particular lessee may have offered for it. One party may have been governed by considerations of convenience or necessity, and the other may have acted on some peculiar personal motive, founded on sentiment, caprice or whim. And as the particular circumstances of each transaction would be open to inquiry, litigation under a rule recognising the competency of such evidence, would be most unprofitably and almost indefinitely prolonged. The plaintiff\u2019s offer could not properly have been admitted except as rebutting testimony, and these causes must go back for re-trial in consequence of the reception of the evidence to which the third assignment of error relates, and which it was the object of the rebutting evidence to meet. In reply to the suggestion of the defendant\u2019s counsel that the evidence complained of in the third error was objected to after it was given by the witness, it is enough to say that the court below treated the objection as having been made in proper time, and recognised the right of the plaintiff to an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Judgments reversed, and <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded in each case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
