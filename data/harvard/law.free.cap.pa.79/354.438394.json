Because the plea set up the judgment in New York and its payment to the plaintiffs on the attachment, without tendering issue on the allegation in the declaration, that the debt due from Snow et al. had been assigned for a valuable consideration by The Thompson Company to Brown, Marshall and Walker by assignment bond, fide before the issuing of the attachment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-11\">2.

Because the plea set up the proceedings, judgment, &amp;c., in New York, without alleging service of process on The Thompson Company, or their appearance in the suit in New York, or that The Thompson Company was, at the time of the issuing of the writ, owner of the debt due by Snow et al., and because the plea did not deny the matters alleged in the declaration that the debt attached was at the date of the attachment divested from said Thompson Company and vested in the use plaintiffs in this suit, and if the facts alleged in the plea are a rightful payment, the plea is but the general issue and should have been so pleaded; and no material fact is traversed nor alleged which avoids the allegation in the declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-13\">4. Because the plea set up a judgment without alleging that the plaintiffs were either parties or privies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-14\">5. Because the plea did not deny the only fact on which a material issue could be taken, to wit: whether the assignments had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>been make bond. fide before issuing the attachment; nor did the plea allege service of process upon The Thompson Company or appearance by them or service of summons or appearance by the assignees in the Supreme Court of. New York, but had tendered issue by their plea the fact that the garnishees gave a casual notice to The Thompson Company on or about February 1st 1868, and the fact that Snow et al. had no notice prior to the issuing of the attachment of the assignment of the claim and did not receive notice before February 23d 1868, each of these averments being immaterial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-6\">6. Because the plea set up the judgment, &amp;e., averring that in the proceedings in the Supreme Court in New York, it was determined as matter of law that the assignments afforded no bar to a recovery by the plaintiffs in the attachment, without averring that the assignees, the use plaintiffs, were either parties or privies to the suit in New York or were legally before the Supreme Court there when such determination was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-7\">7. Because the plea pleads a judgment in the Supreme Court in New York, in a foreign attachment by The Woods &amp; Wright Company against The Thompson Company to attach a debt due from Snow et al., summoned as garnishees, averring that by the attachment The Woods &amp; Wright Company obtained a lien on the debt, without averring that on the day of the attachment the debt was the property of The Thompson Company, or denying that the debt was, at the date of the attachment and before and since, the property of Conrad Brown et ah, by assignments from The Thompson Company, thus argumentatively averring, as a legitimate conseqence of the attachment, that the plaintiffs in the attachment could acquire a lien in foreign attachment against The Thompson Company, by attaching property which at the date of the attachment belonged to the use plaintiffs in this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-8\">8. The plea is informal, uncertain, defective and insufficient, in that it avers that the defendants, the garnishees, in the New York suit became liable to the plaintiffs in the attachment for the amount of their debt to The Thompson Company, and subject to have execution against them, and execution was issued against them on the judgment and levied on the debt due by them to The Thompson Company, which averments were unfounded in fact, as appeared by the New York record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-9\">9.

It was entered into on the suing out of a writ of error to a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Erie county. That judgment was affirmed by this court. After it was recovered in the court below, and before it was affirmed here, it was assigned to Brown <em>et al., </em>the use parties of defendant in error. About two months after that assignment, the defendants in the judgment were attached in the state of New York, as garnishees of the original plaintiff in the judgment. The plaintiffs in error pleaded the judgment in that attachment suit against the garnishees and their payment thereof, in bar of a recovery on the recognisance. The defendants in error demurred to the plea, and the court entered judgment in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The first assignment of error is to the court ordering the production of the record averred in the plea. It is now conceded that oyer of th\u00e9 record is not demandable: 1 Tr. &amp; Haley\u2019s Prac. 421: but it does not appear that any exception was taken to the action of the court at the time, nor that the plaintiffs in error were injured by its production. About a month after a copy of the record was filed, in pursuance of the order of court, the parties by written agreement filed, waived informality in the certificate of record. The next day thereafter, on leave granted, the plaintiffs in error filed a supplemental record. Having thus voluntarily exhibited the record, the complaint of its former production cannot now be regarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">The second assignment is to the entry of judgment in favor of the defendants in error, on the demurrer. This involves a consideration of the effect of the assignment of the judgment to the defendants in error, and also of the effect of the attachment and proceedings thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">First. The Thompson Oil Company was a corporation formed under the laws of this Commonwealth and doing business therein. The assignees were citizens and residents of Pennsylvania. The judgment assigned was of record in a court of this state. When the assignment was made, the assignor, the assignees, and the property assigned, were all within this Commonwealth and governed by its laws. That the assignment was for a full consideration and in good faith are unquestioned. It was a purchase, by persons having a right to buy from a party having a right to sell, of property, of which no rule or policy of law forbids the sale. It was not fraudulent, either in law or fact. It was not a statutory transfer of the judgment, but a voluntary sale and assignment of it. It was then beyond all doubt a valid transfer here. Being a valid assignment when and where made, it is valid everywhere: Story on Conflict of Laws, \u00a7\u00a7 398, 399 ; Speed <em>v. </em>May, 5 Harris 91: Kelly <em>v. </em>Craft <em>et al., </em>45 N. Y. 86. It is true the assignees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>took the judgment subject to tbe equities existing between tbe parties thereto at the time of the assignment, and they also held it subject to any payments that might be made by the defendants therein to the \u2019assignor before notice of .the assignment. By this transfer the whole property of the Thompson Oil Company in the judgment passed to the assignees. Thenceforth the oil company had no attachable interest in the judgment, but held it as a mere naked legal trustee of their assignees. The defendants in that judgment no longer owed or were indebted to the original plaintiff therein, but they owed it to the assignees.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Secondly. It is contended that insomuch as the foreign attachment was served on the garnishees before they had notice of the assignment, the claim of the assignees is postponed to that of the attaching creditors. This conclusion is not sustained by the authorities in this country; among others may be cited: Wakefield <em>v. </em>Marvin, 3 Mass. 558; Dix <em>v. </em>Cobb, 4 Id. 512; Van Buskirk <em>v. </em>Warren, 24 Barb. 457; United States <em>v. </em>Vaughan <em>et al., </em>3 Binn. 394; Stevens <em>v. </em>Stevens, 1 Ash. 190; Pellman <em>et al. v. </em>Hart <em>et al., </em>1 Barr 263; Patton <em>v. </em>Wilson, 10 Casey 229; Speed <em>v. </em>May, 5 Harris 91; 5 Wallace 307. The reason on which these authorities rest, is that the plaintiff in a foreign attachment stands on no better footing as to the thing attached than his debtor, the defendant, whose property is sought to be seized. All that can be seized by virtue of the attachment, is the property of the debtor. The original plaintiff in this judgment having disposed of it in good faith and for a valuable consideration to the defendants in error, no creditor of the assignor could set aside the assignment by proceedings in foreign attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">It is argued, however, that as the effect of the attachment on the assignment has been otherwise decided by the court in New York, and the garnishees have paid the debt to the attaching creditors, it establishes a good defence here for the plaintiffs in error. Art. iv, sect. 1, of the Constitution of the United States, declares \u201cfull faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state, and Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts, records and proceedings shall be proved and the effect thereof.\u201d By the Act of 26th May 1790, 2 Purd. Dig. 1484, pi. 1, Congress prescribed the manner of authentication, and further declared \u201cthe said records and judicial proceedings authenticated as aforesaid, shall have such faith and credit given to them in every court within the United States as they have by law or usages in the courts of the state from whence the said records are or shall be taken.\u201d The judgment of the court of another state is thus put on the same footing as a domestic judgment, with this qualification, that it does not prevent an inquiry into the jurisdiction of the court in which the judgment was given to pronounce it, or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>right of the state itself to exercise authority over the persons or subject-matter: Story\u2019s Com. 483 and 1307; Bissell <em>v. </em>Briggs, 9 Mass. 462; Shumway <em>v. </em>Stittman, 4 Cowen 292; Borden <em>v. </em>Fitch, 16 Johns. 121 ; Benton <em>v. </em>Burgot, 10 S. &amp; R. 240; Steel <em>v. </em>Smith, 7 W. &amp; S. 447; Campbell <em>v. </em>Steele, 1 Jones 394; Baxley <em>v. </em>Linab, 4 Harris 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">We have already showed that the judgment as well as the parties to the assignment were within this state at the time of the transaction. They so continued at the time of the issuing of the writ of foreign attachment, and during the pendency of all the proceedings thereon. Neither the defendants in error, nor the judgment which they purchased, was within the state of New York. The court then had no jurisdiction of the persons or property of the defendants in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The writ of foreign attachment rests on the assumption that the debtor is beyond the limits of the state, but his property is within the reach of process. A judgment <em>in personam </em>is invalid unless procured after service of summons or after appearance. Without one of these the court would have no jurisdiction of the person. So if the judgment be in a proceeding <em>in rem </em>it is void if the court has no jurisdiction of the property : Pennsylvania Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Pennock, 1 P. F. Smith 244. Nor does the fact that the garnishees in the attachment after judgment has been recovered against the assignor, notified the assignor and the assignee, by letter, of the pendency of the'proceedings, change the result. The notice was insufficient in substance and unreasonable in time: Erie Bank <em>v. </em>Gibson, 1 Watts 143; Paul <em>v. </em>Witman, 3 W. &amp; S. 409; Shinier <em>et al. v. </em>Jones <em>et al., </em>11 Wright 268. The assignees were not bound to appear on such a notice and contest the case. If they had done so, and had been admitted as parties to the suit, the case of Moore <em>v. </em>Spackman, 12 S. &amp; R. 287, would bind them to acquiescence in the judgment. On the contrary, they waived none of their rights. They were neither parties nor privies to the suit. We give full effect to the Constitution of the United States and to the law of Congress enforcing the same. We assent to the conclusiveness of the judgment of a court of a sister state, when that court has jurisdiction, yet we cannot concede that a person resident within this state, and owning property situated therein, shall involuntarily and by such a proceeding be constructively brought within the jurisdiction of the court of another state, so as to divest his rights in that property.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">The law requires us to give such faith and credit only to this record as it has by law or usage in the courts of the state of New York. As we understand the laws of that state, the judgment, so far as it is attempted to affect the defendants in error, is void there. Yoorhees U. S. Code, 10th ed., page 114, sect. 122, declares, \u201cthe court may determine any controversy between the parties before it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>when it can be done without prejudice to the rights of others, or by saving their rights; but when a complete determination of the controversy cannot be had without the presence of other parties the court must cause them to be brought in.\u201d It further declares, \u201c when it appears that any person not a party to the action claims the same debt or property in controversy, such claimant shall he substituted of record.\u201d ' \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"Aq6V\">This case presented the precise facts suited to the application of the code. It was the duty of the garnishees to invoke its protection. If he chose to waive this privilege, which the law gave him for his protection, he cannot thereby throw the loss an an innocent assignee: McMahon <em>v. </em>Allen, 2 How. 39. If the garnishees had properly averred the claim of the assignees, which the record shows was known to them, the plaintiffs in the attachment would have been compelled to amend their summons and complaint so as to have made the assignees a party to the action. Nor is it a valid objection to such a course that the assignees are residents of another state: 17 How. 571. The rights of third persons can be brought into litigation only in a regular way by suit: Rodman <em>v. </em>Henry, 17 N. Y. 482. If not brought in upon\u2019service of process the court will not permit the trial to proceed to affect them: 2 Duer 663; 5 Id. 666. The judgment pleaded shows on its face that it was obtained in disregard of the laws of New York and of the rights of the assignees. No property was seized. No appearance of the defendants in error was procured. No effort was made to bring them in on process. They were not substituted of record. They were not in any sense a party to the action. Their rights as assignees were, therefore, not affected: Roy <em>v. </em>Baracus, 43 Barb. 310. The judgment rendered against one not a party to the action, before it is pronounced, does not bind him, nor is it any evidence against him: Shuver <em>v. </em>Blaidard <em>et al., </em>29 Barb. 25. Want of jurisdiction may always be set up against a judgment when sought to be enforced, or when any benefit is claimed under it. The want of jurisdiction makes it utterly void and unavailable for any purpose: Borden <em>v. </em>Fitch, 15 Johns. 121; Page <em>v. </em>Hill, 43 Barb. 44; Bank <em>v. </em>Judson, 4 Selden 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The assumed hardship of paying the debt twice might readily have been avoided. The code gave the garnishees clear and specific directions for their full protection. They studiously avoided following them. They agreed to submit the cause and all the issues therein to a referee. To his finding they filed no exceptions. This manner prevented the numerous errors in the case from being, presented to the consideration of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Our great respect for the learning of the judges of that court impresses us with the conviction that it was under these circumstances they permitted this judgment to be recovered-, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>they would hold it of no effect against the assignees, whenever properly presented for their consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Hence we hold that the judgment in the attachment suit did not divest the right of property acquired by the defendants in error to the judgment in this state. That it must be so held in the state in which the judgment on the attachment was recovered as well as in this state where it was pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">It follows, therefore, the learned judge was correct in entering judgment in favor of the defendant in error on the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
