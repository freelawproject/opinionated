That said note was given <em>tenter alia) </em>in part payment of the purchase-money of certain property, situated in Mahoning county, Ohio, sold to the deponent and others by William Dilworth, Jr. (payee of said note), and others, and said note was secured by a mortgage on said property. That suit for the foreclosure of said mortgage has lately been instituted in the Court of Common Pleas of Mahoning county, Ohio, wherein it appears, by the pleadings and by an affidavit filed on behalf of William Dilworth, Jr., that' s\u00e1id William Dilworth, Jr., claims to be the owner of the note sued on in this case. And deponent says that said note was procured by false and fraudulent representations, in the first instance, in reference to the value of the property, in part payment of which said note was given ; and that the defendants have a full, just and legal defence to the payment of said note and to the foreclosure of the mortgage aforesaid, in this, that the consideration therefor has failed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-14\">The plaintiff took a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, which was made absolute April 21st 1875, and judgment entered against Reamer and Wilson for $9382.05.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-15\">The defendants took a writ of error, and assigned for error the entering of judgment against them for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-16\"><em>I).

The copy of the note filed by the plaintiff below goes to sustain the denial of his title contained in the affidavit referred to. It is endorsed \u201c William Dilworth, Jr.; pay R. McCurdy, Cash.\u201d This is a special endorsement, and upon its face conveys no title to the plaintiff below. The further allegation that the note in controversy was procured by false and fraudulent representations, and that the consideration thereof has failed, coupled with the denial of said plaintiff\u2019s title, was sufficient to <em>pnt </em>the latter upon proof that he is a bon\u00e1 fide holder.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Judgment reversed and a procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
