Turnpike Co. <em>v. </em>McCullough, 1 Casey 303. Where some covenants are in the affirmative and some in the negative, a plea of the performance of all is bad: 5 Bac. Abr. 410; Crosswell <em>v. </em>Peachy, Croke\u2019s Eliz. 691; Ellis <em>v. </em>Box, Aleyn 72; Heister <em>v. </em>Evans, 3 Dyer 372, pl. 11. If any of the covenants are in the disjunctive, defendant must show which he has performed: 2 Stephen\u2019s Nisi Prius 1164; 1 Selwyn\u2019s Nisi Prius 547; 6 Comyn\u2019s Digest 129; Stephens on Pleading 365, 366; Laughwell <em>v. </em>Palmer, 1 Sid. 87, quoted in Selwyn\u2019s Nisi Prius 1164. Covenants for non-performance and others for performance ; party should plead to the one \u2014 that he has not done; to the other \u2014 that he has done generally ; and if the negative ones are against him, he may say generally that he has done all: Norton <em>v. </em>Syms, Sir F. Moore 856 ; Rangler <em>v. </em>Morton, 4 Watts 265. By his plea, defendant took on himself the affirmative of the case and the burden of proof was on him: Norris <em>v. </em>The P. &amp; D. Insurance Co. of N. A., 3 Yeates 84 ; 2 Greenl. Evid., sec. 247 ; Scott <em>v. </em>Hull, 8 Conn. 296 ; Soward <em>v. </em>Leggatt, 7 C. &amp; P. 613 ; Harrison <em>v. </em>Park, 1 J. J.

The plaintiffs, having gone to trial upon the pleadings, could not allege that the plea of \u201c covenants performed,\u201d was a nullity : Brubaker <em>v. </em>Taylor, 26 P. F. Smith 83. The plea of \u201c covenants performed,\u201d was proper: Neave <em>v. </em>Jenkins, 2 Yeates 107. The defence in this case was not an <em>equitable </em>one, and, therefore, the plea of covenants performed did not put the onus upon him, but made it incumbent on the plaintiffs to prove all the material allegations in his declaration, except the execution of the agreement: Evans <em>v. </em>Dravo, 12 Harris 64. The plea of \u201c covenants performed,\u201d <em>absque hoe, </em>would have put the onus upon the plaintiffs. Yet the addition of <em>absque hoe </em>would merely have put in issue performance by the \"plaintiffs : 2 Troubat &amp; Haly 33; Martin <em>v. </em>Hammon, 8 Barr 270; Zents <em>v. </em>Legnard, 20 P. F. Smith 192; 1 Greenl. Evid., \u00a7 51.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Judgment was entered in the Supreme Court, October 25th 1875,</p>\n<author id=\"b339-7\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Ael\">The defendant\u2019s covenant not to engage in busi-\" ness within prescribed limits, and the covenant, if he should do so, that he would pay $10,000 liquidated damages, are not alternative; the latter being merely the agreed consequence of a <em>breach </em>of the former. If covenants be alternative and either be performed there is no breach. An election is given to the covenantor to perform either. But here a breach of the former covenant is necessary to give effect to the latter. Hence there is no election in such case, except that which arises from a determination to suffer the consequence of a breach. Here them the former covenant is broken, and its breach must be shown to entitle the plaintiff to resort to the secondary covenant to pay the damages. Hence the plea of \u201c covenants performed\u201d applied only to the breach alleged in the declaration, to wit, of the covenant not to engage in business. Here the affirmative plea is pregnant with a negative, and casts the proof of the breach on the plaintiff. The words <em>absque hoe, </em>when added to the plea of covenants performed, apply to those covenants of the plaintiff which he must prove as a preliminary to a recovery. We discover no error in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
