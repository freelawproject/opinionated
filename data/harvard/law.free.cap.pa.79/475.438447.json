The defence was that the plaintiff had, contrary to the stipulations in the policy, effected an additional insurance on his goods in the Armenia Insurance Company, without the consent of the defendants endorsed on his policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-6\">The cas\u00e9 was tried, May 4th 1875, before Lowrie, P.

And further, that at the time of effecting the second policy the witness called the attention of the agent to the fact that the notice of the second ought to be endorsed on the first policy, and notice .thereof given to the Lancaster company, and that when the agent returned the policy to the witness the agent told him that the proper endorsement had been made on the Lancaster policy, he having both policies in his possession, and the witness relied on this because he could not read English; neither could Mentz read English. This for the purpose of excusing the want of such notice and endorsement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-13\">The offer was objected to, because the policy requires that the fact'ought to be assented to by the first company and endorsed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-14\">The court rejected the offer and sealed a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>The plaintiff having closed his case, defendants moved for a non-suit.

There was no evidence tending to show that their powers were special. It must be assumed then that they were authorized to act as the general agents of the companies in all matters relating to the effecting of insurance on their behalf. It may be conceded that as such general agents they would have no power to waive any express condition in the policy. But the question was not of their power to do this, but whether their declaration of a fact, namely, that the condition had been actually complied with, would not estop the company from controverting that fact. The evidence offered and rejected was that the agent had told the assured that the proper endorsement had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>been made on the policy. Now, such a declaration made by a duly authorized agent or officer would clearly operate as an estoppel. It lulled the party <em>to </em>sleep by the assurance that the conditions of the policy had been complied with and that his indemnity was secured.' In point of fact, these local agents are held out as acting for the companies they represent in all respects except as to the actual issuing of the policies. The companies will assuredly lose all public confidence if they shelter themselves behind the special character of the powers of such agents, when parties have relied upon their declarations.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">The case of The Worcester Bank <em>v. </em>The Hartford Fire Insurance Co., 11 Cush. 265, is not in point. There the party insuring was told by the agent that it would make no difference that the second insurance was not endorsed on the policy; that he would make a memorandum of the fact upon his book, which would answer every purpose. The question there was whether the agent could waive performance of the condition, which is a very different question from that presented on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">Judgment reversed and <em>procedendo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
