F. Smith 352; Dodson <em>v. </em>Ball, 10 Id. 492; Megargee <em>v. </em>Naglee, 14 Id. 216. A <em>feme covert </em>is, in respect to her separate estate, to be deemed a <em>feme sole </em>only to the extent of the power clearly given by the instrument by which the estate is settled, and has no right of disposition beyond it: Lancaster <em>v. </em>Dolan, 1 Rawle 231; Stahl <em>v. </em>Cronse, 1 Barr 111; Thomas <em>v. </em>Folwell, 2 Whart. 11; Wallace <em>v. </em>Coston, 9 Watts 137. The execution of a power must he in the form prescribed by the instrument creating it: Sugden on Powers 250, 319, in note; Dorrance <em>v. </em>Scott, 3 Whart. 309.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b474-14\"><em>Douglass </em>and McQoy, for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Axg\">These deeds, under the power in the trust deed, passed the fee simple to the grantors: Steacy <em>v. </em>Rice, 3 Casey 75; Koenig\u2019s Appeal, 7 P. F. Smith 352; Dodson <em>v. </em>Ball, 10 Id. 492; Megargee <em>v. </em>Nagle, 14 Id. 216. The rule in equity is to regard whatever ought to be done as being done. And this is to be adopted as a universal maxim : Slifer <em>v. </em>Beates, 9 S. &amp; R. 178. The power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>is well executed by the two deeds executed by Mrs. McFadden and her husband : Lancaster <em>v. </em>Dolan, 1 Rawle 231. And this is so, although no reference be made to the power in the conveyance: Lancaster <em>v. </em>Dolan, <em>supra ; </em>Drusadow <em>v. </em>Wilde, 13 P. F. Smith 170; Allison <em>v. </em>Kurtz, 2 Watts 185; Coryell <em>v. </em>Dunton, 7 Barr 530; Hoover <em>v. </em>Samaritan Society, 4 Whart. 445; Zane <em>v. </em>Kennedy, 23 P. F.

He had, however, no discretion, but was bound to make such sale and conveyance to any person or persons, and for such sum or sums of money, as the wife, by writing under her hand and seal and duly acknowledged at any time during her natural life, should direct and appoint. The words \u201cdirect and appoint\u201d preclude the construction contended for by the plaintiff in error. The deed of the husband and wife \u2014 under her hand and seal and duly acknowledged \u2014 was a valid appointment under the power, in strict conformity to its provisions. It follows that her appointee, the grantee in the deed,' could have compelled, by a bill in equity, the trustee to convey to him the legal estate, and it follows also, that the defendants had a perfectly good equitable title, under which in Pennsylvania they could defend their possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
