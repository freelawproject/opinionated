Stranahan, against the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, for the burning of the barn of the plaintiff by sparks thrown from one of defendants\u2019 locomotives.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-13\">The plaintiff owned a farm about twenty-three miles from the city of Erie, through which the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad, operated by the defendants, is constructed. On the 6th of November 1867, the barn of the plaintiff was burned, as he alleged, by sparks from one of defendants\u2019 engines.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-14\">The evidence was that between two and three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, the plaintiff\u2019s barn was discovered to be on fire; two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>trains, had passed about noon; the barn was about one hundred and fifty feet from the railroad. The fire appeared to have commenced at the fence on the road, and burned over the field to the barn. The sparks falling set fire in many places along the road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-6\">The plaintiff proposed to show by a witness that he lived four miles from the court house, on the line of the railroad, and also to show by him the extent to which the locomotives on the road, going east on or about the 9th of November 1867, threw sparks from the smoke-stacks of same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-7\">Objected to by defendant for the reason that the location of the witness and his knowledge of the facts is too remote from the place where the injury is said to have occurred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-8\">The court (Wetmore, P. J.) admitted the evidence and sealed a bill of exceptions for defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-9\">The witness said \u201c it is a common occurrence for the engines to throw sparks\u2019 and set fire for rods from the railroad track. They were from a pea to a walnut in size. It appeared worse sometimes than others. They were usually freight trains. Sometimes passenger trains. It is heavy grade past my place.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-10\">There was other evidence that there were fires in many \u201cplaces\u201d on the day the barn was burned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-11\">The verdict was for the plaintiff for $1392.40.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-12\">The defendants took a writ of error and assigned for error the admission of the evidence objected to.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-13\"><em>J.

It, therefore, became necessary to establish the fact by such proof as rendered the belief a certain fact. This could be done, not by the proof that a certain engine emitted sparks incessantly, for <em>non constat </em>that this particular engine had passed the plaintiff\u2019s premises on that day. Hence it was necessary to permit the party to show that the emitting of coals and sparks in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>unusual' quantities was frequent and permitted to be done by a number of engines. Tbe range of the evidence in this respect of necessity carried it to a greater range as to locality also. We cannot say that the court below committed any error in the admission of the evidence assigned for error.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
