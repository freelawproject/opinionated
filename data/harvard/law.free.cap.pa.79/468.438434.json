The engagement was then to guarantee the payment of the bond \u201c when due.\u201d It was determined by this court in Campbell <em>v. </em>Baker, 10 Wright 243, that a guaranty of the payment of a note \u201c when due \u201d is broken by nonpayment at maturity ; and the guarantor is then liable upon his contract to the creditor, who is not bound either to pursue the principal or to show his insolvency. Other cases might be cited sustaining the same principle. The affidavit of defence was therefore clearly insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Judgment affirmed..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
