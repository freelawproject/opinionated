The circuit court sustained Erie's demurrer to the claim for equitable contribution. On appeal, Nationwide now contends that the circuit court erred as a matter of law and that the court should have denied Erie's demurrer to the claim for equitable contribution based upon the coverage allocation that we had determined in\n   <em>\n    Nationwide I\n   </em>\n   . Agreeing with this view, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    Nationwide I\n   </em>\n   began as a declaratory judgment action in the circuit court. Both Nationwide and Erie had issued insurance policies allegedly covering a defendant sued in a wrongful death action arising out of an automobile accident. Nationwide had issued three policies: a commercial general liability policy with a $1 million coverage limit; a business automobile policy with a $1 million coverage limit; and a commercial umbrella liability policy with a $1 million coverage limit. Erie had issued two policies: a commercial automobile policy with a $1 million coverage limit and a business catastrophe policy with a $5 million coverage limit. In the original declaratory judgment action, the insurers disputed the policy coverages and priorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The circuit court in\n   <em>\n    Nationwide I\n   </em>\n   held that Nationwide had primary coverage for the first $3 million in liability and that Erie's policies provided excess coverage beyond that amount. Shortly after this ruling, the tort claimant's counsel in the wrongful death action offered to settle the claim with Nationwide for $2.9 million. The tort claimant's counsel warned that if Nationwide were to refuse the settlement, he would seek $10 million in damages at trial. Nationwide requested that Erie contribute toward the $2.9 million settlement. After Erie had refused to do so, Nationwide paid the settlement in full and secured a full release of liability for its insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Thereafter, we granted an appeal to Nationwide and reversed the circuit court's declaratory judgment holding. We held that Nationwide's commercial general liability policy provided no coverage, that Erie's commercial automobile policy provided primary coverage for up to $1 million, that Nationwide's business automobile policy provided excess coverage for up to $1 million, and that Nationwide's commercial umbrella policy and Erie's business catastrophe policy provided excess coverage on a pro rata basis after that.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nationwide I,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=293%20Va.%20331\">\n    293 Va. at 340-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12647521\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/798/170/\">\n    798 S.E.2d 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although we were aware of the underlying settlement of the tort claim at the time of our decision, we offered no opinion regarding whether Erie had any obligation to reimburse Nationwide for any part of the $2.9 million settlement given our reversal of the circuit court's coverage determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Nationwide then filed suit against Erie and sought equitable contribution of $1.75 million for Erie's alleged share of the $2.9 million settlement, which was calculated based upon our reordering of the coverages on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Erie demurred, arguing that it had no common obligation with Nationwide to pay the settlement because Nationwide had made a unilateral and voluntary settlement payment and because a condition precedent to Erie's obligation to pay under its insurance policies, namely, the existence of a judgment or Erie's consent to settle, had not been satisfied. The circuit court sustained Erie's demurrer and dismissed Nationwide's complaint with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The circuit court held that \"Nationwide did not establish that it and Erie had a common obligation,\" J.A. at 339, for two reasons. First, Nationwide did not assert that its $2.9 million payment had been \"forced upon it\"; indeed, the court reasoned, Nationwide had \"made the unilateral and voluntary decision to accept\" the $2.9 million settlement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12647521\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/798/170/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, Nationwide's complaint did not assert that either of the conditions precedent to Erie's obligation to pay a claim (a judgment or Erie's consent to settle) had been satisfied. Erie, moreover, \"did not waive its consent-to-settlement provisions\" because \"[r]efusal to consent to a settlement by a co-insurer is not the same as denial of coverage overall to the [insured tortfeasor].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 339-40.

We find it inapplicable. In that case, the primary insurer had paid its policy limits to settle a tort claim and later sought equitable contribution from an excess insurer. Both insurers had accepted coverage for the insureds' liability for an automobile accident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=452%20S.E.2d%20859\">\n    452 S.E.2d 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We held that these conditions precedent to payment of the policy proceeds - which had not been met in that case - would have been enforceable against the insured, and thus, they were equally enforceable against the primary insurer seeking equitable contribution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=452%20S.E.2d%20859\">\n    452 S.E.2d 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The claim for equitable contribution, therefore, did not arise out of a \"common obligation\" because at the time of the settlement, the excess insurer had a right under its policy to deny payment to the insured on the covered claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=452%20S.E.2d%20859\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The present case is quite different. Here, Erie refused to contribute toward the settlement because, armed with a circuit court order confirming its view, it took the position that Nationwide was exclusively responsible for the first $3 million in coverage. The settlement amount, $2.9 million, was within that amount of Nationwide's exclusive coverage, and thus, Erie was not responsible to contribute anything toward the settlement. For this reason, Erie effectively denied any obligation to cover claims under $3 million. Erie's refusal to contribute toward a settlement under $3 million had nothing to do with Erie's right to agree to the settlement but was instead based upon Erie's then-existing right to refuse to pay anything toward a settlement exclusively within Nationwide's, not Erie's, coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Under settled principles, an insurer that denies coverage waives any contractual right to participate in a settlement of the claim and cannot later refuse to pay a covered claim on this basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3 Irvin E.

A judgment on appeal is the law of the case unless and until it is either stayed or suspended or, if neither, overruled by the higher court. Until then, the final judgment binds the litigants with the force of law - thereby creating legal rights and defenses that can be exercised at any time up until that judgment is set aside.

That case has nothing to do with equitable contribution.\n     <em>\n      Williams\n     </em>\n     addresses the situation where a party alleging negligence sought indemnity for an\n     <em>\n      illegitimate\n     </em>\n     payment made under a\n     <em>\n      mistake\n     </em>\n     of law. Our case, however, involves equitable contribution, which necessarily presupposes a\n     <em>\n      legitimate\n     </em>\n     payment made by one\n     <em>\n      unmistakably\n     </em>\n     legally liable to make the payment. Moreover,\n     <em>\n      Williams\n     </em>\n     says that a voluntary payor operating under a mistake of law cannot obtain relief without proving a \"wholly inequitable result,\" a narrow exception supported by \"decidedly few\" Virginia cases.\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2102947\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/237/608/#p614\">\n      237 Va. at 614\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=379%20S.E.2d%20333\">\n      379 S.E.2d 333\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (citation omitted). Yet, even a cursory comparison of those \"decidedly few\" cases applying the wholly inequitable exception (\n     <em>\n      Williams\n     </em>\n     not being one of them) shows that Nationwide - a sophisticated insurance carrier represented by experienced legal counsel - can hardly claim that its decision to end the tort case with a purely voluntary settlement resulted in a wholly inequitable result. What possibly could be wholly inequitable (or, for that matter, inequitable at all) about an insurance company settling a case within its policy limits after being adjudicated to have sole coverage and having to pay the agreed-upon settlement amount?\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
