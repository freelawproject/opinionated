This ease comes to us following the district court\u2019s grant of the manufacturer\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, dismissing the injured employee\u2019s suit after the court found the manufacturer to be a statutory employer. We conclude that the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s recent announcement of a major change in the law that governs the principal issue here on appeal makes prudent a vacatur of the district court\u2019s summary judgment and a remand for reconsideration in light of that law change.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Plaintiff-Appellant Dalton Vicknair (Dalton) was employed by Regeant Chemical Co. as a truck driver and was injured while delivering hydrochloric acid from a third-party vendor to the Baton Rouge plant of Defendant-Appellant, Formosa Plasties Corporation (Formosa). Dalton and his wife (collectively, plaintiffs) filed suit in state court against Formosa and one of Formosa\u2019s employees, Defendant-Appellant Harold Dem-mer (collectively, defendants), alleging negligence and strict liability. The defendants removed the suit to federal court on the basis of diversity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsequent to removal, the Louisiana Workers\u2019 Compensation Corporation intervened, seeking to recover benefits paid on behalf of Regeant to and for Dalton. Formosa also filed a third party demand against Regeant.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">Defendants eventually filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, claiming that Formosa was Dalton\u2019s \u201cprincipal\u201d or \u201cstatutory employer\u201d at the time of his accident and was therefore immune from tort liability under Louisiana\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation laws.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finding that Dalton\u2019s work for Regeant\u2014 transporting chemicals from a third-party vendor and delivering them to Formosa\u2014 was an integral part of Formosa\u2019s chemical and plastics manufacturing business and concluding that Formosa was therefore Dalton\u2019s statutory employer, the district court granted defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment and dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 suit. As seen in its Order and Reasons for granting the motion, the district court employed the liberal \u201cintegral relationship\u201d test for determining statutory employer status, a test originally developed by the Louisiana Supreme Court in <em>Thibodaux v. Sun Oil </em>Co.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and interpreted by this court in <em>Thompson v. Georgia Pacific Corp.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Salsbury v. Hood Indus., Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In so doing, the district court expressly declined plaintiffs\u2019 invitation to depart from the \u201cintegral relationship\u201d test and apply the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d approach recently employed by the Louisiana Second Circuit Court of Appeal in <em>Kirkland v. Riverwood Int\u2019l USA, Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b940-14\">Plaintiffs timely appealed the district court\u2019s summary judgment. After being advised by plaintiffs that the Louisiana Supreme Court had granted writs to review the intermediate appellate court\u2019s decision in <em>Kirkland, </em>we elected to hold this appeal in abeyance pending completion of the state supreme court\u2019s review.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-16\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b940-17\">On September 13, 1996, the Louisiana Supreme Court announced its decision in <em>Kirkland, </em>affirming the state\u2019s Second Circuit by explicitly adopting the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d approach to determining statutory employer status.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In reaching its decision, the court analyzed the effect of the Louisiana legislature\u2019s 1989 amendments to La.Rev. StatAnn. 23:1061 on prior statutory employer jurisprudence and expressly rejected the interpretation previously given to those amendments by some Louisiana intermediate appellate courts and by this court in cases such as <em>Thompson </em>and Salsbury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>doing, the Louisiana Supreme Court cautioned that \u201c[a] totality of the circumstances inquiry is frequently difficult to accomplish on motion for summary judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In sum, the highest court of the state established in <em>Kirkland </em>a significantly different methodology<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and standard<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> than had been used here by the district court in determining that Formosa was Dalton\u2019s statutory employer.</p>\n<p id=\"AFcu\">Given this supervening jurisprudential \u201csea change\u201d regarding Louisiana\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law, we elect to vacate the district court\u2019s summary judgment and remand the ease to that court so that it may reexamine its ruling in light of <em>Kirkland. We </em>emphasize, however, that this vacatur and remand does not reflect a determination on our part that the district court erred in its statutory employer analysis; neither does it imply a determination whether the result originally reached by the district court will or will not have to be changed as a result of <em>Kirkland</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>s new law rule. To the contrary, the district court analyzed the issue under what was, until <em>Kirkland, </em>clearly governing law,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and we have attempted no de novo analysis of the summary judgment evidence under the <em>Kirkland </em>methodology. Our vaca-tur and remand here is purely prudential, to afford the trial court the first opportunity to test Formosa\u2019s asserted statutory employer status under the new <em>Kirkland </em>methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"A9QV\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s grant of defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment, dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 suit, is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"AaBx\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b940-7\">.

In <em>Thompson, </em>this court, interpreting the effect of the 1989 amendments on La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 1061, observed that the so called <em>\"Berry </em>factors,\u201d derived from <em>Berry v. Holston Well Serv., Inc., </em>488 So.2d 934 (La.1986), \"cannot be used at all \u2014 either by themselves or in combination with other factors. The only appropriate test is the integral relation test.\u201d 993 F.2d at 1168-69 (citing <em>Salsbury, </em>982 F.2d at 916). This understanding was unambiguously rejected as erroneous in <em>Kirkland </em>in which the court held that the 1989 amendments to La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 23:1061 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>only partially, and to a very limited extent, overruled <em>Berry. See Kirkland, </em>681 So.2d at 335-36.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"AsM\">. <em>Id. </em>681 So.2d at 336-37.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"Aatb\">.

The court held that \"the appropriate standard ... is for the court to consider <em>dll pertinent factors </em>under the totality of the circumstances.\" <em>Id. </em>681 So.2d at 336. (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"AHO\">. We recognize the possibility that the district court\u2019s partial reliance on <em>Bowens v. General Motors Corp., </em>608 So.2d 999, 1002 (La.1992) (contractor\u2019s interstate transportation of GM parts was part of GM's trade, business or occupation) might survive <em>Kirkland, </em>given that <em>Bow-ens </em>was decided under a stricter \"Berry\u201d-type test. Yet we also acknowledge that even though <em>Bowens </em>was factually somewhat similar to this case in that it involved an independent contractor's interstate transportation of auto parts from a manufacturing plant to an assembly plant, some potentially distinguishing facts were present in this case, principally that (1) Regeant was transporting a chemical component from an outside source to Formosa but the <em>Bowens </em>transporter was hauling GM parts from one GM plant to another; and (2) this contract represented only a small fraction of Regeant's business and Dalton's work, but the <em>Bowens </em>transporter apparently did much of its work for GM. To say the least, <em>Bowens </em>applicability is clouded by <em>Kirkland\u2019s </em>new \"totality of the circumstances\u201d approach.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
