Otherwise, a formal answer was required. 2 <em>Wooley, Delaware Practice, Sec. </em>1636; <em>Banks v. Banks, </em>6 <em>Penn. </em>442, 67 <em>A. </em>835; <em>Bancroft v. Bancroft, </em>4 <em>Boyce </em>9, 85 <em>A. </em>561; <em>Palese v. Palese, 6 Boyce </em>584, 101 <em>A. </em>438. In our opinion, Rule; 104 has changed this practice and requires the filing of an answer in every case where defendant desires to defend and this is so whether the defense consists of a general denial or contains matter sounding in confession and avoidance, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">However, in view of the fact that this is the first interpretation of Rule 104 by this court, we think that defendant should be permitted to file an answer and be let into trial subject, nevertheless, to plaintiff\u2019s right to move for a continuance should the answer raise a defense or defenses which he may be unprepared to meet. This ruling is clearly within the court\u2019s discretionary power. Rule 6(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
