Reid, who ordered Hill removed from the United States. <em>In re David Abashie Hill, </em>No. A046 634 748 (B.I.A. Apr. 23, 2010), <em>aff'g </em>No. A046 634 748 (Immig. Ct. Batavia, N.Y. Feb. 9, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Under the circumstances of this case, we consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decisions. <em>See Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009). Although federal courts generally lack jurisdiction to review final orders of removal as to an alien deemed removable based on a prior conviction for an aggravated felony, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or questions of law, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). However, because Hill does not directly challenge the agency\u2019s conclusion that his conviction was an aggravated felony or that he was not eligible for relief from removal, we do not address those issues. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Hill argues that the IJ abused his discretion by denying Hill\u2019s motion for a continuance of his removal proceedings so that he could seek to hire counsel. We have jurisdiction to address this argument because an alien\u2019s access to counsel raises due process concerns. <em>See Picca v. Mukasey, </em>512 F.3d 75, 78 (2d Cir.2008). IJs have \u201cwide latitude in calendar management,\u201d and we review their denial of continuances \u201cunder a highly deferential standard of abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Morgan v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 549, 550 (2d Cir.2006). The IJ here had already granted Hill three prior continuances so that he might hire counsel. Nothing in the record, therefore, suggests that the IJ\u2019s decision to deny a fourth continuance was an abuse of discretion. <em>See Sanusi v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 193, 200 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">Hill also challenges the validity of his 2006 state robbery conviction\u2014which rendered him removable\u2014on the ground that his attorney failed to advise him of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea. Assuming this is true, Hill raises a plausible constitutional claim. <em>See Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010). We have made it clear, however, that such a claim may not be asserted in the first instance in a petition of review of a BIA decision. <em>See Lanferman v. BIA </em>576 F.3d 84, 88 (2d Cir.2009) (\u201cCollateral attacks [on a guilty plea] are not available in a ... petition challenging the BIA\u2019s removal decision.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the agency did not err by finding Hill removable based on his criminal conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-14\">Finally, assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the IJ had an affirmative obligation to inform Hill of his eligibility for relief from removal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the IJ correctly advised Hill that he was not eligible for any form of relief. Hill was not eligible for cancellation of removal under Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 212(c) because his criminal conviction occurred after 1997, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(h)(8); <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001); he was not eligible for adjustment of status because no visa was available to him, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a); and he was not eligible for a waiver of removal under INA \u00a7 212(h), cancellation of removal under \u00a7 240A, or voluntary departure because he was an aggravated felon, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1182(h), 1229b(a); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.56. Finally, with respect to eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the Convention Against Torture, Hill\u2019s allegation that he has no family in Jamaica fails to demonstrate that he would be persecuted or tortured if returned to that country. <em>See Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178, 184 (2d Cir.2004). Hill has not identified any other form of relief for which he might be eligible. In sum, the agency did not abuse its discretion by denying Hill\u2019s request for a continuance, by finding him removable, or by finding that he was ineligible for relief from removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">The petition for review is therefore DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in connection with this petition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b47-8\">. Additionally, that Hill may have an arguable basis upon which to attack his guilty plea does not alter the finality of his criminal conviction insofar as it may affect his immigration status. <em>See Paredes </em>v. <em>Att'y Gen. of the U.S., </em>528 F.3d 196, 198-99 (3d Cir.2008) (holding that the pendency of a post-conviction motion or other form of collateral attack on a criminal conviction does not negate the finality of that conviction for immigration removal purposes); <em>accord Jimenez-Guzman v. Holder, </em>642 F.3d 1294, 1297 (10th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Garcia-Echaverria, </em>374 F.3d 440, 445-46 (6th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b47-16\">. We express no opinion as to the merits of any challenge Hill could bring to his state conviction under <em>Padilla, </em>130 S.Ct. 1473, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>whether as a habeas action, a writ of <em>audita querela, </em>a writ of <em>error coram nobis, or on </em>some other ground. We note only that it is an open question in this circuit whether the rule articulated in <em>Padilla </em>applies retroactively and that our sister circuits have reached divergent conclusions on this issue. <em>Compare United States v. Orocio, </em>645 F.3d 630, 640-42 (3d Cir.2011) (holding that <em>Padilla </em>is retroactively applicable on collateral review), <em>with Chaidez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>655 F.3d 684, 687-94 (7th Cir.2011) (holding that <em>Padilla </em>announced a \"new rule\u201d under <em>Teague </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989), and, as such, does not apply retroactively).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
