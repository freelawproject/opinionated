We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">We review the decision of a district court (or, where, as here, the parties have consented, the decision of a Magistrate Judge) denying benefits <em>de novo. </em>We must independently determine whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is (1) free of legal error and (2) supported by substantial evidence. <em>Smolen v. </em>Chater; 80 F.3d 1273, 1279 (9th Cir.1996) (citing <em>Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 601 (9th Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">The ALJ\u2019s finding that Galindo could perform light work with restrictions was not erroneous and is supported by substantial evidence. The finding appropriately accounted for Galindo\u2019s physical and mental conditions. The ALJ considered work restrictions determined by Galindo\u2019s examining and treating physicians, and the ALJ\u2019s residual functional capacity finding is consistent with the medical evidence. When the ALJ discredited a medical opinion from a treating physician or discounted portions of Claimant\u2019s testimony, the ALJ provided specific and legitimate reasons for doing so. <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830 (9th Cir.1995) (citing <em>Murray v. Heckler, </em>722 F.2d 499, 502 (9th Cir.1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b599-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
