Allison now invokes the right to appeal that he reserved in his plea agreement, challenging the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denial in part of his motion to suppress evidence. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Allison and his girlfriend, Amber Shipp, were traveling in the back of a taxi when law enforcement officers stopped the taxi because they identified Shipp\u2014for whom arrest warrants were outstanding\u2014as an occupant of the taxi. After the officers arrested Shipp and placed her in a patrol car, Deputy United States Marshal Mark Shepherd removed Allison from the taxi. Allison was handcuffed and surrounded by three law enforcement officers when Polk County Sheriffs Deputy Jake Hedgecock removed a zippered gym bag from the back seat of the taxi. Deputy Hedgecock inspected the bag within four minutes of Shipp\u2019s arrest and observed a glass \u201ccrack or crank\u201d pipe in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">When officers later learned that a warrant was outstanding for Allison, they arrested him as well. A subsequent search of the bag at a police station revealed approximately $7,000 in cash, digital scales, the glass pipe, and fourteen plastic bags containing about twenty-nine grams of methamphetamine each. Allison sought to suppress both the evidence found in the gym bag and statements he made after being detained. The district court denied Allison\u2019s motion to suppress the contents of the gym bag, but granted the motion to suppress his statements. Allison now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence found in the gym bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">\u201cIn considering the denial of a motion to suppress, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Kelley, </em>652 F.3d 915, 917 (8th Cir.2011). The district court determined that the evidence contained in the bag should not be suppressed because its discovery resulted from a search conducted in reasonable reliance upon this court\u2019s pre-Gant<footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>precedent governing searches incident to arrest. Allison argues that the district court erred by failing to apply <em>Gant </em>retroactively to suppress the evidence in this case. In the time between Allison\u2019s briefing of this case and this decision, however, the Supreme Court held that it was unnecessary to suppress evidence under <em>Gant </em>where the search occurred prior to <em>Gant, </em>stating that \u201csearches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent are not subject to the exclusionary rule.\u201d <em>Davis v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2419, 2423-24, 180 L.Ed.2d 285 (2011). Assuming, without deciding, that the search of the bag was unconstitutional under <em>Gant, </em>we conclude that the incriminating evidence discovered should not be suppressed in light of <em>Davis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">This court\u2019s precedent at the time the officers stopped Allison in 2008 allowed for a search of the passenger compartment of a vehicle \u201cas \u2018a contemporaneous incident\u2019 of\u2019 the \u201carrest of an \u2018occupant\u2019 or \u2018recent occupant,\u2019 \u201d even when \u201cthe arrestee has exited the vehicle and has been handcuffed and placed in a police officer\u2019s patrol car....\u201d <em>United States v. Hrasky, </em>453 F.3d 1099, 1101 (8th Cir.2006) (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number><em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 460, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981)). Because the search of the gym bag was permissible under binding pre-Gcmi precedent as part of a search of the passenger compartment of the taxi incident to arresting Shipp, the exclusionary rule is not applicable even if the search was illegal under <em>Gant. See Davis, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2423-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Allison also suggests that the search-incident-to-arrest exception to the warrant requirement does not apply to the search of his bag because Shipp, not Allison, was under arrest at the time of the initial search. We reject this argument. Even assuming that Deputy Hedgecock knew the gym bag belonged to Allison prior to touching it, knowledge that a container in an automobile belongs to someone other than the arrestee does not preclude a search of the container in the course of a search incident to arrest. <em>See Wyoming v. Houghton, </em>526 U.S. 295, 305, 307, 119 S.Ct. 1297, 143 L.Ed.2d 408 (1999) (noting that \u201c[a] criminal might be able to hide contraband in a passenger\u2019s belongings as readily as in other containers in the car\u201d and holding that \u201cpolice officers with probable cause to search a car may inspect passengers\u2019 belongings found in the car that are capable of concealing the object of the search\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">For these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s partial denial of Allison\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-8\">.
