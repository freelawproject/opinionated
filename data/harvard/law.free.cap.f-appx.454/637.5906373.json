Cabe appealed the Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of her motion to terminate proceedings, and denial of her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(A). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">First, Cabe argues that she is a United States citizen. Cabe was born in Thailand on August 25, 1966. Cabe\u2019s mother, who was a Thai citizen, listed an American member of the armed forces as Cabe\u2019s father on the birth certificate. Cabe\u2019s father left Thailand before her birth, and since then neither Cabe nor any member of her family has ever contacted him. Cabe\u2019s mother later married a different American serviceman. Cabe\u2019s step-father adopted Cabe and her siblings, and in 1972 he brought her into the United States as a lawful permanent resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Cabe\u2019s primary argument on appeal is that she automatically acquired citizenship through her step-father. Cabe argues that under these facts she meets the statutory requirements for automatic citizenship under the Child Citizenship Act of 2000 (\u201cCCA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481. In <em>Hughes v. Ashcroft, </em>255 F.3d 752, 760 (9th Cir.2001), however, we held that \u201cthe CCA granted automatic citizenship only to those children who were under the age of 18, and who met the other criteria, on February 27, 2001,\u201d the effective date of the CCA. Cabe was 34 years old when the CCA became effective. Cabe attempts to avoid this limitation on the reach of the CCA by arguing that <em>Hughes </em>was wrongly decided and that Congress intended the CCA to apply retroactively. But we are bound by the earlier precedential decision of this court. Because Cabe was 34 years old on February 27, 2001, she cannot derive citizenship under the CCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">We also reject Cabe\u2019s arguments that she is eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under CAT. Cabe\u2019s conviction for an aggravated felony bars her from asylum relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2). And while she suffers from bipolar disease, suffers seizures as a result of domestic violence, and her entire family is located in the United States, Cabe has presented no evidence that compels the conclusion that she would be subject to persecution or torture in Thailand on the basis of her Amer-Asian ethnicity or her medical issues. <em>See Bromfield v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 1071, 1076, 1079 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b659-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
