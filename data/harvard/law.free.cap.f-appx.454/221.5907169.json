John Roosevelt Baccus seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order adopting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and denying relief on his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2006) petition. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-25\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). \u201c[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-28\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on May 16, 2007. The notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>of appeal was filed on August 11, 2011. Because Baccus failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We further note that the appeal is duplicative because Baccus has previously appealed the district court\u2019s order denying his \u00a7 2254 petition. We deny Baccus\u2019s motions for a grand jury transcript, to appoint counsel, for bail or release pending appeal, for \u201cthe very purpose of habeas corpus,\u201d and to compel the return of his legal materials. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
