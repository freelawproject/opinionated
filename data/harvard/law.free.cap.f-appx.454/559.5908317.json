Because the parties are familiar with the history of the case, we need not recount it here. We grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">An asylum applicant is not entitled to relief if he can avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of his country of nationality. <em>Afriyie v. Holder, </em>613 F.3d 924, 934 (9th Cir.2010). The government has the burden to prove that PereiraBorges can reasonably relocate within Brazil because the BIA determined that Pereira-Borges had demonstrated past persecution and was presumed to have a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Melkonian v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 1061, 1070 (9th Cir.2003). Additionally, the BIA must presume that Pereira-Borges faces a nationwide threat of persecution and that internal relocation is unreasonable because he was persecuted by police officers. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-14\">In this case, the BIA determined that Pereira-Borges could reasonably relocate within Brazil. After it issued its order, we issued our decision in <em>Afriyie, </em>which clarified relocation analysis. Under <em>Afriyie:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AG5F\">[Adjudicators should consider, but are not limited to considering, whether the applicant would face other serious harm in the place of suggested relocation; any ongoing civil strife within the country; administrative, economic, or judicial infrastructure; geographical limitations; and social and cultural constraints, such as age, gender, health, and social and familial ties. These factors may, or may not, be relevant, depending on all the circumstances of the case, and are not necessarily determinative of whether it would be reasonable for the applicant to relocate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>613 F.3d at 934 (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3)). The BIA must \u201cevaluate! ] the relocation issue in accord with the proper burden of proof\u2019 and it must \u201cconsider!] the requisite regulatory factors pertinent to the reasonableness analysis\u201d outlined in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3). <em>Id. </em>at 935.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">While the BIA cited 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b) in Pereira-Borges\u2019 case, it did not explicitly consider the regulatory factors that it was \u201cbound to take into account.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Under <em>Afriyie, </em>if it is unclear whether the BIA considered the reasonableness factors, the case must be \u201cremand[ed] for clarification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Even if the BIA relied on the IJ\u2019s findings here, it is also unclear whether the IJ explicitly considered the 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3) factors in his analysis. <em>See Boer-Sedano v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 1082, 1090 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201c[T]he relevant regulation <em>requires </em>the IJ to consider the [8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3) ] factors, to decide whether any of them made relocation unreasonable.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Therefore, in light of our subsequent decision in <em>Afriyie, </em>we grant the petition for review and remand the case to the BIA to (1) reevaluate the relocation evidence in light of the government\u2019s burden of proof with the presumption that internal relocation is unreasonable and (2) to explicitly determine whether relocation would be reasonable under the factors described in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b582-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
