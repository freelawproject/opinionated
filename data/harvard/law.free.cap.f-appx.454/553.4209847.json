Schwan\u2019s appeals the district court\u2019s denial of its motion for directed verdict and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) motion for an altered or amended judgment and/or new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-19\">This Court reviews the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for directed verdict <em>de novo. See Oglesby v. S. Pac. Transp. Co., </em>6 F.3d 603, 605 (9th Cir.1993). We review the district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 59(e) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>See Sch. Dist. No. 1J, Multnomah Cnty. v. ACandS, Inc., </em>5 F.3d 1255, 1262 (9th Cir.1993). We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Under the WDEA, a discharge is wrongful if it \u201cwas not for good cause and the employee had completed the employer\u2019s probationary period of employment.\u201d Mont.Code Ann. \u00a7 39\u20142\u2014904(l)(b). The WDEA further defines \u201cgood cause\u201d as \u201creasonable job-related grounds for dismissal based on a failure to satisfactorily perform job duties, disruption of the employer\u2019s operation, or <em>other legitimate business reason.\u201d Id. </em>\u00a7 39-2-903(5) (emphasis added). A \u201clegitimate business reason,\u201d in turn, is one that is not \u201cfalse, whimsical, arbitrary or capricious, and ... ha[s] some logical relationship to the needs of the business.\u201d <em>Kestell v. Heritage Health Care Corp., </em>259 Mont. 518, 858 P.2d 3, 7 (1993); <em>cf. Marcy v. Delta Airlines, </em>166 F.3d 1279, 1282 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201cThis court must interpret and apply Montana law as it believes the Montana Supreme Court would apply it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Schwan\u2019s contends that the district court should have directed a verdict for Schwan\u2019s without sending the issue of \u201cgood cause\u201d to the jury. Schwan\u2019s argues that Blair admitted to hiring a \u201clumper\u201d\u2014 a non-employee paid in cash to help unload a truck\u2014and thus admitted to engaging in the conduct for which he was terminated. Blair, however, submitted evidence that Schwan\u2019s decision to terminate him for using a lumper was \u201carbitrary or capricious,\u201d rather than justified by good cause. Blair claimed that his supervisor had emailed written approval of his use of a lumper and that hiring lumpers was a longstanding, common, and condoned practice among Schwan\u2019s employees. Evidence existed that, when construed in the light most favorable to Blair, could lead a rational jury to believe that Schwan\u2019s acted arbitrarily in terminating Blair. <em>See Johnson v. Costco Wholesale, </em>336 Mont. 105, 152 P.3d 727, 734 (2007) (years of repeated violations and evidence that other employees violated the policy \u201cmay lead a jury to believe that Costco did not have good cause to discharge Johnson because it applied its employment policy in an arbitrary and capricious manner\u201d). Because a directed verdict is only \u201cproper when the evidence permits only one reasonable conclusion,\u201d the district court did not err in denying Schwan\u2019s motion and submitting the issue to the jury for its ultimate resolution. <em>Amarel v. Connell, </em>102 F.3d 1494, 1517 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Schwan\u2019s further contends that, once the jury delivered its verdict for Blair, the district court should have granted Schwan\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion for an altered or amended judgment and/or new trial. A Rule 59(e) motion, however, \u201cshould not be granted, absent highly unusual circumstances, unless the district court is presented with newly discovered evidence, committed clear error, or if there is an intervening change in the controlling law.\u201d <em>389 Orange Street Partners v. Arnold, </em>179 F.3d 656, 665 (9th Cir.1999). In denying the motion, the district court again reasoned that there was evidence in the record that, while contested by Schwan\u2019s, supported the jury\u2019s verdict that, under the totality of the circumstances, Schwan\u2019s lacked good cause for terminating Blair. For example, Blair\u2019s supervisor, Oliver Cornett, testified that he had emailed Blair instructions to keep an individual named Matt Halstead \u201clumping until we get him through the system.\u201d Schwan\u2019s Human Resources Manager for the region, Roger Evert, acknowledged that there had been incidents of lumping within the company in the past. Blair himself testified that he had learned the practice of hiring lumpers in 2001 from a Sehwan\u2019s facility supervisor in Belgrade, Montana, who paid lumpers $35 or $40 cash to unload trucks on numerous occasions. Blair further reported that a material handler at the depot in Billings, Mon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>tana, taught him how to pay a lumper and account for the cash payment on Schwan\u2019s hand-held computer system. In light of that evidence, the district court committed no abuse of discretion in determining that there had been no \u201cclear error\u201d or manifest injustice in the proceedings warranting Rule 59(e)\u2019s extraordinary relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Schwan\u2019s motion for directed verr diet and Rule 59(e) motion for an altered or amended judgment and/or new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b576-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
