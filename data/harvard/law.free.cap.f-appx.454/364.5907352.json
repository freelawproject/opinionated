She first claims that the BIA erred by concluding that her prior Texas conviction for wholesale promotion of obscene material is a crime involving moral turpitude (CIMT) which renders her ineligible for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">We use a two-part test to analyze the issue whether a given offense is a CIMT. <em>Hyder v. Keisler, </em>506 F.3d 388, 390 (5th Cir.2007). This test demands that we give significant deference to the BIA\u2019s \u201cdefinition of the phrase \u2018moral turpitude\u2019 \u201d while we engage in a de novo review of the question whether the elements of the disputed offense align with the definition of CIMT used by the BIA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-16\">Our application of this standard to the facts and law of the instant case shows no error in connection with the BIA\u2019s decision. The Texas offense of wholesale promotion of obscene materials necessarily involves conduct that the average person would deem to appeal \u201cto the prurient interest in sex,\u201d to have no artistic value, and involving \u201cpatently offensive representations or descriptions of\u2019 sexual acts. Tex. Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 43.21, 43.23. This aligns with the BIA\u2019s description of moral turpitude as \u201cconduct that shocks the public conscience as being inherently base, vile, or depraved, and contrary to the accepted rules of morality.\u201d <em>See Hyder, </em>506 F.3d at 391. The cases on which Ere relies are materially distinguishable as they involve other statutes. She has not shown that the BIA erred in concluding that her prior offense was a CIMT.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-17\">Likewise unavailing is Ere\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s conclusion that her false claim of United States citizenship on a voter registration application also rendered her inadmissible. Ere does not deny making such false claim. Rather, without citation to authority, she urges that it should not be held against her because she did not actually vote and because the application did not contain a statement that voting was limited to citizens. These arguments pertain to matters that are irrelevant under the pertinent statute and thus are unavailing. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-18\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b387-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
