We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-12\">\u201cWhere the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA.\u201d <em>Santoso v. Holder, </em>580 F.3d 110, 111 (2d Cir.2009). We review legal issues and the application of law to fact de novo. <em>See, e.g., Castro v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 93, 99 (2d Cir.2010). We review findings of fact under the substantial evidence standard, and we defer to the agency\u2019s findings \u201cunless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Jin Jin Long v. Holder, </em>620 F.3d 162, 166 (2d Cir.2010) (quoting INA \u00a7 242(b)(4)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B)). Substantial evidence, however, \u201crequires a certain minimum level of analysis from the IJ and BIA, as well as some indication that the IJ considered material evidence supporting a petitioner\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167 (quoting <em>Castro, </em>597 F.3d at 99). In particular, \u201cUs and the BIA have a duty to explicitly consider any country conditions evidence submitted by an applicant that materially bears on his claim.\u201d <em>Poradisova v. Gonzales, 420 </em>F.3d 70, 81 (2d Cir.2005). Indeed, \u201c[t]his Court will <em>vacate </em>BIA conclusions, as to the existence or likelihood of persecution, that a perfectly reasonable fact-finder <em>could </em>have settled upon, insofar as the BIA either has not applied the law correctly, or has not supported its findings with record evidence.\u201d <em>Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-14\">To establish persecution on account of political opinion, an applicant must show \u201cthat the persecution arises from his or her own actual or imputed political opinion.\u201d <em>Koudriachova v. Gonzales, </em>490 F.3d 255, 263 (2d Cir.2007). \u201cThe applicant must also show, through direct or circumstantial evidence, that the persecutor\u2019s motive to persecute arises from the applicant\u2019s political belief.\u201d <em>Castro, </em>597 F.3d at 100 (quoting <em>Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 (2d Cir.2005) (citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number><em>I.N.S. v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992))).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">As to the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Xiong Jin could not establish the requisite nexus between his beliefs and his arrest because he had been arrested for a crime of general applicability, we addressed this issue in <em>Jin Jin Long. See Jin Jin Long, </em>620 F.3d at 166 (\u201cIn what circumstances\u2014if any\u2014 may the enforcement of a law of general applicability (here, the apparent prohibition of assistance to North Korean refugees) constitute persecution on account of political opinion?\u201d). Here, the BIA erred by failing adequately to consider the issues raised in <em>Jin Jin Long, </em>specifically: (1) whether there was evidence based on Xiong Jin\u2019s treatment and the political context for his arrest that the arrest was pretextual, and (2) whether there was in fact a law prohibiting aid to North Korean refugees.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Although the BIA was correct in recognizing that \u201cthe enforcement of generally applicable law cannot be said to be on account of the offender\u2019s political opinion, even if the offender objects to the law,\u201d the BIA failed to recognize that \u201cprosecution that is pretext for political persecution is not on account of law enforcement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Xun Li v. Holder, </em>559 F.3d 1096, 1108-10 (9th Cir.2009)). \u201cThus, someone who has been singled out for enforcement or harsh punishment because of his political opinion can show eligibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In conducting such an analysis, the BIA must \u201ccarefully sift[]\u201d the facts in context \u201cto ascertain whether there is a sufficient political element to the alleged persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Applying these principles in <em>Jin Jin Long, </em>we remanded Long\u2019s case to the BIA because the \u201cBIA failed to consider a number of facts that may support an inference that his arrest and detention were pretextual,\u201d particularly that: (1) he credibly testified that the allegations of refugee-smuggling that underlay his arrest were fabricated; (2) he was never formally charged or brought before a judge; (3) he was subjected to eleven days of detention and repeated physical abuse, though never charged with a crime; (4) State Department country reports \u201csuggest that the North Korean refugee issue is politically charged;\u201d and (5) the Chinese government has arrested many \u201cactivists, missionaries, and others\u201d for assisting North Koreans, a fact which may \u201csuggest an active resistance to China\u2019s North Korean immigration policies, and an attempt at suppression,\u201d and \u201cJin [Jin Longj\u2019s actions may have been viewed by the Chinese authorities as part of this resistance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">In this case, the BIA erred both by failing to acknowledge that \u201cprosecution that is pretext for political persecution is not on account of law enforcement,\u201d <em>Jin Jin Long, </em>620 F.3d at 167, and by failing to \u201csift[ ] [the facts] in context,\u201d id.\u2014that is, to consider the political context of Xiong Jin\u2019s arrest. Like the petitioner in <em>Jin Jin Long, </em>Xiong Jin credibly testified that he was detained for several days and beaten, released only after a family member paid a bribe, and never formally charged with any crime. Also before the agency was a 2007 Congressional Research Service Report (\u201cCRS Report\u201d), entitled <em>North Korean Refugees in China and Human Rights Issues; International Response and U.S. Policy Options, </em>that Jin submitted as evidence that the issue of North Korean refugees in China is politically charged. The BIA failed to consider whether such cumulative facts \u201cmay support an inference that his arrest and detention were pretextual.\u201d <em>Jin Jin Long, </em>620 F.3d at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">As to the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Xiong Jin did not provide evidence that he held a political opinion, \u201ca claim of political perse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>cution cannot be evaluated in a vacuum, ... without reference to the relevant circumstances in which the claim arises.\u201d <em>Castro, </em>597 F.3d at 106. \u201cWe have repeatedly emphasized the fallacy of this approach and have on several occasions remanded cases in which the agency denied an application for asylum based on its failure to properly engage in the \u2018complex and contextual factual inquiry\u2019 that such claims often require.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Vumi v. Gonzales, </em>502 F.3d 150, 157 (2d Cir.2007); <em>Osorio v. INS, </em>18 F.3d 1017, 1030 (2d Cir.1994); <em>Yueqing Zhang, </em>426 F.3d at 546).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">The BIA and the IJ in this case \u201cembraced an \u2018impoverished view of what political opinions are, especially in a country ... where certain democratic rights have only a tenuous hold,\u2019 by rejecting [the petitioner]'s claim without any coherent examination of the surrounding political environment.\u201d <em>Castro, </em>597 F.3d at 106 (quoting <em>Yueqing Zhang, </em>426 F.3d at 546) (citations omitted) (omission in original). The IJ concluded that \u201cthe main reason that [Xiong Jin] was helping this particular individual was because he felt that the people in North Korea were less fortunate than others because the lack of food and the poor conditions that these individuals are facing in North Korea. No evidence was provided that [Xiong Jin] himself was against the government of China in any way or form.\u201d In reaching this conclusion, however, the IJ failed to make the inquiry described in <em>Castro </em>and in <em>Jin Jin Long, </em>and ignored the CRS Report, which provided evidence of the political context for Xiong Jin\u2019s actions and his arrest. According to the report, North Koreans are crossing the border to China based on \u201cdeteriorating humanitarian conditions\u2014 mainly due to food shortages\u2014and human rights violations,\u201d but, even though China is a party to the Refugee Convention and Protocol, it has not allowed United Nations agencies to have access to North Koreans in China \u201cbecause it views these individuals as economic migrants (rather than political refugees) who cross the border illegally, primarily in search of food.\u201d Further, the report states that China generally does not allow North Koreans to apply for political asylum and \u201cChina\u2019s deportations [of North Koreans] raise the question of a violation of international law,\u201d because China is obligated under the Refugee Convention, under the principle of non-refoulement, not to deport people who qualify as refugees to a country where they will be persecuted. In 2006, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees raised these issues with the Chinese Foreign Ministry.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">The evidence in the CRS Report is material to analyzing Xiong Jin\u2019s testimony. For example, Xiong Jin testified that he sheltered Chende \u201c[b]ecause he was a Korean refugee, because [Xiong Jin] [felt] very sympathy and ... wanted to help him.\u201d Considered in light of the evidence of the political context in China, Xiong Jin\u2019s description of his relative as a \u201crefugee\u201d and expression of sympathy for the plight of \u201cNorth Korean refugees\u201d as a group arguably expresses a political opinion, because China refuses to acknowledge refugees; that Xiong Jin viewed Chende as a refugee implies that he believed Chende had a right to remain in China notwithstanding China\u2019s policies. Further, Xiong Jin stated that he did not feel he committed a crime, and that it was China that committed a crime. Viewed in light of the political context of China\u2019s policies toward North Korean refugees, Xiong Jin may have been expressing the belief that China\u2019s policy toward North Korean refugees was wrong, even if Xiong Jin did not describe this view as a \u201cpolitical\u201d opinion. Similarly, when asked if he was assisting Chende in committing a crime by helping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>him to stay in China, Xiong Jin said he was not, because they \u201cdid not even have sufficient food in North Korea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">There is nothing in either the IJ\u2019s or the BIA\u2019s opinion that would allow us to conclude that they considered the circumstances of Xiong Jin\u2019s arrest, detention, and treatment in light of the situation of North Korean refugees in China when denying Xiong Jin\u2019s asylum claim. Indeed, neither the IJ nor BIA explicitly referred to the CRS Report in discussing Xiong Jin\u2019s claim of persecution based on his political opinion, even though \u201cUs and the BIA have a duty to explicitly consider any country conditions evidence submitted by an applicant that materially bears on his claim.\u201d <em>Poradisova, </em>420 F.3d at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">We therefore remand to the BIA for reconsideration of Xiong Jin\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief in light of this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED and the proceedings REMANDED to the BIA for further consideration consistent with this order. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
