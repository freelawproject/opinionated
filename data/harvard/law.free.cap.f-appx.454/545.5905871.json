Albritton, III, Senior District Judge for the U.S. District Court for Middle Alabama, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b568-8\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Defendant Ezra Hallock was convicted of receipt of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2) and one count of possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B). Hallock appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds and alleges four other errors: (1) prosecutorial misconduct; (2) admission of suppressed evidence; (3) ineffective assistance of counsel; and (4) improper admission of expert testimony as lay opinion testimony. Because the history and facts of the case are familiar to the parties, we need not recount them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Hallock\u2019s speedy trial motion. Contrary to Hallock\u2019s argument, scheduling matters, including the need for a continuance, are an attorney\u2019s prerogative and may be decided without client approval. <em>Gonzalez v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 242, 249, 128 S.Ct. 1765, 170 L.Ed.2d 616 (2008); <em>New York v. Hill, </em>528 U.S. 110, 115, 120 S.Ct. 659, 145 L.Ed.2d 560 (2000). Additionally, the Speedy Trial Act (\u201cSTA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161, permits a court to grant a continuance \u201cat the request of the defendant <em>or </em>his counsel,\u201d suggesting the defendant\u2019s express consent is not required before one can be granted. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3161(h)(7)(A) (emphasis added). Finally, Hallock did not voice any contemporaneous objection to the continuances about which he now complains. <em>See United States v. Lloyd, </em>125 F.3d 1263, 1271 (9th Cir.1997). Because Hallock\u2019s STA rights were not violated, we presume that his trial complied with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s speedy trial requirements, <em>United States v. Baker, </em>63 F.3d 1478, 1497 (9th Cir.1995), and Hallock has not rebutted that presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-13\">Hallock also argues that the Government committed prosecutorial misconduct during its closing argument by mentioning suppressed statements testified to by Agent Hodgdon during defense cross-examination. Where, as here, the \u201cdefendant fails to object to alleged prosecutorial misconduct, the court reviews for plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>641 F.3d 1110, 1120 (9th Cir.2011). \u201cTo obtain a reversal based on prosecutorial misconduct, [a defendant] must establish both misconduct and prejudice.\u201d <em>United States v. Wright, </em>625 F.3d 583, 609-10 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Hallock has failed to establish misconduct. The district court neither struck Agent Hodgdon\u2019s disputed testimony from the record nor admonished the Government concerning its use. Accordingly, during its closing argument, the Government did nothing more than refer to evidence in the record, which is not misconduct. <em>Tucker, </em>641 F.3d at 1120 (\u201cProsecutors can argue reasonable inferences based on the record and have considerable leeway to strike hard blows based on the evidence and all reasonable inferences from the evidence.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">We also reject Hallock\u2019s claim that the district court erred by admitting Agent Hodgdon\u2019s testimony into evidence. Because Hallock did not object at trial, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Sioux, </em>362 F.3d 1241, 1244 n. 5 (9th Cir.2004). The admission of Agent Hodgdon\u2019s testimony was not plainly erroneous because defense counsel asked questions that Agent Hodgdon could not truthfully answer without referring to Hallock\u2019s suppressed statements. <em>See United States v. Beltran-Rios, </em>878 F.2d 1208, 1212 (9th Cir.1989) (\u201cWe previously have allowed the Government to introduce otherwise excludable testimony when the defendant \u2018opens the door\u2019 by introducing potentially misleading testimony.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Hallock further argues that attorney Donald Green provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to timely file a motion to suppress the search warrant issued for Hallock\u2019s home. To prevail on an ineffective assistance claim, a defendant must show deficient performance and resulting prejudice. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). \u201cIneffective assistance claims ... are ordinarily left for collateral habeas proceedings due to the lack of a sufficient evidentiary record as to what counsel did, why it was done, and what, if any, prejudice resulted.\u201d <em>United States v. Sager, </em>227 F.3d 1138, 1149 (9th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). We find that Hallock\u2019s claim is best left for collateral review, as the record is not sufficiently developed to permit determination of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Finally, Hallock contends that the district court erred by admitting Agent Bujdoso\u2019s testimony as lay, rather than expert, opinion testimony. Even if we assume that the district court erred, that error was harmless because we can \u201cdiscern from the record that [Agent Bujdoso] could have been qualified as an expert under Federal Rule of Evidence 702.\u201d <em>United States v. Mendoza, </em>244 F.3d 1037, 1046 (9th Cir.2001). Agent Bujdoso spent thousands of hours studying Google Hello and became intimately familiar the program\u2019s workings and investigatory uses. He also taught other law enforcement officials how to use Google Hello, and Google would even refer other investigators with questions about Google Hello to Agent Bujdoso.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">The district court\u2019s denial of Hal-lock\u2019s speedy trial motion and Hallock\u2019s conviction are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b568-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
