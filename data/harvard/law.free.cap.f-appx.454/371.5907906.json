Cruz-Nagera\u2019s written judgment included as a special condition of supervised release the requirement that \u201cupon completion of his term of imprisonment, [he] is to be surrendered to a duly-authorized immigration official for deportation.\u201d The district court did not mention this special condition at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Cruz-Nagera argues that because the district court did not orally impose this condition at sentencing, the written judgment should be amended to conform with the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement of his sentence. Because Cruz-Nagera did not have the opportunity at sentencing to challenge the district court\u2019s inclusion of this special condition in the written judgment, we review the district court\u2019s imposition of this condition for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Bigelow, </em>462 F.3d 378, 381 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Where there is a conflict between a written sentence and an oral pronouncement, the oral pronouncement controls. <em>United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 935 (5th Cir.2003). \u201c[T]he judgment\u2019s inclusion of conditions that are mandatory, standard, or recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines does not create a conflict with the oral pronouncement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938. However, \u201cif the district court fails to mention a <em>special </em>condition at sentencing, its subsequent inclusion in the written judgment creates a conflict that requires amendment of the written judgment to conform with the oral pronouncement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 936 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">The condition imposed by the district court is not listed among the standard conditions of supervised release found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.3(c). Furthermore, the condition is not recommended under \u00a7 5D1.3(d)(6) because the record does not support that the section applies here. Because the district court did not impose this special condition orally at sentencing, the district court abused its discretion by including it in the written judgment, and this case must be remanded for the district court to amend its written judgment to conform with its oral sentence. <em>See United States v. Wheeler, </em>322 F.3d 823, 828 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">For the above reasons, we AFFIRM in part, VACATE in part, and REMAND for amendment of the written judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined diat this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
