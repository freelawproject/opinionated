We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We grant Avila\u2019s petition for review and vacate the order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">We review the BIA\u2019s determination of purely legal questions de novo. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Cazarez-Gutierrez v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 905, 909 (9th Cir.2004). While this Court lacks jurisdiction to review legal claims that were not presented to the BIA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), a \u201cpetitioner is not limited to raising issues in exactly the same terms as they were presented to the Board.\u201d <em>Pagayon v. Holder, </em>642 F.3d 1226, 1232 (9th Cir.2011) (citing <em>Vizcarra-Ayala v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 870, 873 (9th Cir.2008)). In this case, we find adequate exhaustion.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must prove by \u201cclear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the facts alleged as grounds for [removal] are true.\u201d <em>Gameros-Hernandez v. INS, </em>883 F.2d 839, 841 (9th Cir.1989) (citing <em>Woodby v. INS, </em>385 U.S. 276, 286, 87 S.Ct. 483, 17 L.Ed.2d 362 (1966)). DHS charged Avila as removable pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) (providing for removal following a conviction related to a controlled substance) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(C) (providing for removal for illicit trafficking). To be removable under either of these statutory provisions, \u201cthe government [is required] to prove that the substance underlying the alien\u2019s state law conviction ... is one that is covered by Section 102 of the [Controlled Substances Act (CSA) ].\u201d <em>Ruiz-Vidal v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 1072, 1076 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-15\">Avila\u2019s conviction under California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11352(b) is not categorically a removable offense. \u201cCalifornia regulates the possession and sale of numerous substances that are not similarly regulated by the CSA,\u201d <em>Ruiz-Vidal, </em>473 F.3d at 1078. Therefore, we cannot determine from the state statutory definition alone whether a conviction pursuant to Section 11352(b) relates to a controlled substance under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) or constitutes an illicit trafficking offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(C) sufficient to render Avila removable. <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). Consequently, we must use the modified categorical approach to determine whether, based on the administrative record, Avila\u2019s conviction qualifies as a predicate offense for removal purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>DHS presented to the immigration judge (IJ) only three judicially cognizable documents relating to Avila\u2019s 2002 conviction to support the charges of removal against her. DHS submitted a certified copy of the criminal complaint, a \u201cWaiver of Rights!,] Plea of Guilty/No Contest\u201d form, and a minute order. Neither the plea agreement nor the minute order specify the controlled substance at issue in Avila\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">In analyzing the record of conviction, we are permitted to consider \u201cthe charging documents in conjunction with the plea agreement, the transcript of a plea proceeding, or the judgment to determine whether the defendant pled guilty to the elements of the generic crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Corona-Sanchez, </em>291 F.3d 1201, 1211 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc), superseded on other grounds by statute as explained in <em>United States v. Gomez-Mendez, </em>486 F.3d 599, 604-05 (9th Cir.2007). However, \u201ca charging document does not, standing alone, demonstrate that the crime charged and the crime of conviction are one and the same. Something else must connect the two.\u201d <em>Pagayon, </em>642 F.3d at 1233.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Based on the administrative record submitted to the IJ, we cannot determine whether Avila\u2019s conviction pursuant to Section 11352(b) involved a federally prohibited controlled substance. While the complaint against Avila identifies heroin, which is a drug listed in Schedule I of the CSA, 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1308.11(c)(11), the plea agreement and minute order are silent as to the nature of the controlled substance. Nothing connects the crime charged to the crime of conviction. Since the documents submitted by DHS are inconclusive, we are left to speculate, \u201c[b]ut speculation is not enough.\u201d <em>Ruiz-Vidal, </em>473 F.3d at 1079.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The government urges us to consider additional evidence to determine whether Avila is removable as charged. The government cites to an unpublished decision by the California Court of Appeal for the Sixth District, which appears to rely on the transcript of Avila\u2019s plea proceeding. The opinion states that Avila \u201cpleaded guilty to a \u2018violation of ... section 11352(b), as alleged in the complaint in count 2.... \u2019 \u201d <em>People v. Avila, </em>2010 WL 3623639 at *2 (Cal.Ct.App.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Petitions for review generally are evaluated based on \u201cthe record of the pleadings, evidence adduced, and proceedings before the agency.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2347(a). We may consider additional evidence if a party demonstrates that \u201c(1) the additional evidence is material; and (2) there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce the evidence before the agency.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2347(c). Avila\u2019s plea proceeding occurred on January 3, 2002, more than three years before the initiation of Avila\u2019s removal proceedings, yet DHS failed to include the plea colloquy in Avila\u2019s record of conviction. In a case where DHS submitted <em>\u201csome </em>evidence in support of its position ... [n]o reason appears why it could not have introduced <em>sufficient </em>evidence.\u201d <em>Huerta-Guevara v. Ashcroft, </em>321 F.3d 883, 886 (9th Cir.2003) (emphasis in original). We decline to consider the additional evidence submitted by the government to demonstrate that Avila pled guilty \u201cas alleged.\u201d Considering this evidence now would undermine \u201cthe fundamental principle that, in determining whether a prior conviction constitutes a predicate offense, we must avoid the enormous problems of re-litigating past convictions, especially in cases where the defendant pleads guilty and there is no record of the underlying facts.\u201d <em>Tokatly v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 613, 621 (9th Cir.2004) (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">Because the record of conviction is inconclusive, \u201cthe government has not met its burden of proof, and the conviction may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>not be used for purposes of removal.\u201d <em>Tokatly, </em>371 F.3d at 624. Since Avila is a lawful permanent resident who is \u201cnot subject to removal on the basis charged,\u201d her order of removal \u201cmust accordingly be vacated.\u201d <em>Huerta-Guevara, </em>321 F.3d at 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Petition GRANTED and Order of Removal VACATED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b641-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
