Agents observed the two men meet with Borbon in the parking lot of the Westfield Inn in Lancaster. Camacho and Juan rented Room # 163, and Borbon and his female companion rented Room # 147. The agents observed Juan carrying black duffels into his room and all three men were observed frequenting Room # 163. The agents proceeded to obtain a search warrant for Room # 163 and recovered 40 kilograms of cocaine from two large black duffels, and arrested the three men. Borbon\u2019s female companion then consented to a search of Room # 147, where agents discovered $182,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">At trial, a leader in the conspiracy, Amauris Sanchez, testified against Borbon, as did Camacho, recounting drug deliveries and money collections in which Borbon was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">Borbon was convicted and sentenced by the District Court to the minimum guidelines sentence of 292 months. Borbon challenges both his conviction and sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-14\">Borbon\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967) identifying five possible issues on appeal, challenging:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-15\">1. The District Court\u2019s adoption of a procedure allowing informants to testify directly from English translations of wiretaps and recorded conversations rather than first establishing that the informant had an independent recollection of the events.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-16\">2. The District Court\u2019s permitting the introduction of coconspirator statements made in furtherance of the conspiracy without establishing by independent evidence that Borbon participated in the conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-17\">3. The sufficiency of the evidence that Borbon was responsible for distribution of at least 50 but not less than 150 kilograms of cocaine; and that pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(a), Borbon should receive a 4-level leadership enhancement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-18\">4. The sufficiency of the evidence for Borbon\u2019s convictions for conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute 5 kilograms and more of cocaine hydrochloride.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-19\">5. The legality of the search of Room # 147 and subsequent seizure of $182,000 in drug proceeds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-20\">Counsel has also filed a motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-21\">Borbon filed a pro se brief raising several additional arguments, all relating to his sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>In assessing an Anders brief, we must determine: 1) whether counsel has thoroughly examined the record for appealable issues and has explained why any such issues are frivolous; and 2) whether an independent review of the record presents any non-frivolous issues. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>389 F.3d 424, 425 (3d Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 300 (3d Cir.2001). If the <em>Anders </em>brief appears adequate, we will conf\u00edne our scrutiny to the portions of the record identified in appellant\u2019s pro se brief and counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief. <em>See Youla, </em>241 F.3d at 301. Our independent review of those portions of the record addressing issues raised by the <em>Anders </em>and pro se brief reveal no non-frivolous arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">We agree with counsel that it would be frivolous to urge that the District Court abused its discretion by admitting the translated transcripts of the recorded conversations or the coconspirator statements because the Court correctly applied our decision in <em>United States v. Starks, </em>515 F.2d 112 (3d Cir.1975) as well as Rule 801(d)(2)(E) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. The attack on the drug quantity calculation and the sufficiency of the evidence would clearly fail in light of the clear testimony of Sanchez and Camacho regarding the seizure of the drugs and money. The Fourth Amendment challenge would necessarily fail based on the uncontested consent of Borbon\u2019s female companion. Borbon\u2019s variety of attacks on his sentence are frivolous as they lack any legal support whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">Thus, issues raised by Borbon and his counsel are patently without merit and, through our own independent review, we can identify no other non-frivolous arguments. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court and, in a separate order, grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b65-11\">. The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231 and our jurisdiction is based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b65-22\">. Borbon raises the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-23\">1. Under <em>Booker, </em>certain provisions of \u00a7 3553(f) should be severed from the statute, and therefore the District Court erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>in determining that petitioner was not eligible for \"safety valve\u201d relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">2. Whether appellant\u2019s sentence was subject to review under the \"reasonableness\u201d standard (including \u201cwhether the court erred in its upward decisions under 4A1.3\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">3. Summary of the argument (including argument that (1) his sentence, that gives exceptional weight to Guidelines calculation violates the Eighth Amendment and (2) his sentence is grossly disproportionate and violates <em>Nelson v. United </em>States)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-20\">4. Whether the District Court lost the power to sustain the subject matter jurisdiction of the presentencing investigation report which contains constitutional errors based on recent Supreme Court\u2019s line of rulings requiring resentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-21\">5. Whether the District Court erred under the Fifth Amendment pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) because the grand jury failed to find a drug quantity that would trigger the provision.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
