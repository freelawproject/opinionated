We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-28\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b157-29\">Because we write for the parties, who are well acquainted with the case, we recount only the essential facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Fry was a truck driver for Johnson Con-' trols, Inc. (JCI), a battery manufacturer. Fry and two other truck drivers, Parke Reese and Kenneth Brown, were tasked with delivering new batteries to JCI\u2019s distributors and collecting used batteries to be dropped off to a recycler, RSR Corporation (RSR). Instead of delivering the used batteries to RSR as instructed, however, the three sold them to other recycling companies in twenty separate sales over the course of two years. The co-conspirators stole a total of $1,692,855 from JCI, and Fry was individually responsible for eight of the illegal sales, profiting $268,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Like his co-conspirators, Fry pleaded guilty. The District Court set an advisory Guidelines range of 37 to 46 months imprisonment, which Fry does not dispute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Before sentencing, Fry\u2019s counsel submitted a letter to the Probation Office objecting to the PSR\u2019s statement that \u201c[Fry\u2019s co-conspirators] and Fry shared in the proceeds of the sale of the batteries.\u201d The Probation Office noted this objection in its addendum to the PSR and responded: \u201cAll three defendants were held accountable for the full loss due to the conspiracy element of the offense.\u201d In his sentencing letter to the Court, Fry requested leniency because \u201c[o]f the three Defendants in this case, [he] benefited the least from the conspiracy.\u201d According to Fry, the \u201cnature and circumstances of the offense\u201d supported a downward variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">At the sentencing hearing, Fry\u2019s counsel again argued for a sentence below the Guidelines range based on the fact that \u201cthe total dollar loss was 1.69 million dollars, but Mr. Fry received only $268,000 of that amount [and] other defendants received more.\u201d The Government responded by pointing out that \u201c[t]his was a substantial fraud, a substantial .amount of money ... and Mr. Fry was an equal participant.\u201d The District Court addressed this dispute, and Fry\u2019s counsel had a second opportunity to clarify the purpose of the obj\u00e9ction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC\">[Fry\u2019s Counsel]: ... I\u2019m not disputing that was the loss in this case, and as a member of the conspiracy is [ sic] responsible for that. What I did object to was that they shared equally in the proceeds, which I did relate here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmG\">The Court: I see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-9\">[Fry\u2019s Counsel]: But my point is, we\u2019re not\u2014we\u2019re no longer arguing the sentencing guidelines points. I\u2019m arguing that Mr. Fry as a matter of just of [sic] your Honor\u2019s discretion should take note of the fact that he only received 268,000\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-10\">The Court: As compared to the other\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATl\">[Fry\u2019s Counsel]: Defendants, right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-11\">The Court: Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">Shortly after this colloquy, the District Court sentenced Fry to 37 months imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and restitution in the amount of $1,692,855, for which Fry\u2019s co-conspirators were also jointly and severally liable. The Court explained its duty to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and described its view of Fry\u2019s crime. The Court further explained the need to deter Fry from future criminal conduct and that Fry would receive a longer sentence than his co-conspirators because Fry had not cooperated as substantially as they had. In its written Statement of Reasons, the District Court indicated that it adopted the find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>ings of the PSR with the \u201cfollowing changes\u201d and listed several facts to which Fry had objected, including: \u201cDefendant didn\u2019t share proceeds w/his Co-Defendants\u2014He received approximately = $268,000.00\u201d Beneath the list of disputed facts, the District Court wrote: \u201cAll of above, <em>not </em>considered by the court for sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Fry raises only one argument on appeal. He claims that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the District Court failed to give due consideration to his argument that his lesser profit from the conspiracy warranted a downward variance from the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">We have jurisdiction over Fry\u2019s timely appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), and we review the District Court\u2019s sentencing decision for abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 56, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">It is well-established that a sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the district court \u201cfail[ed] to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>accord United States v. Gunter, </em>462 F.3d 237, 247 (3d Cir.2006). But that did not occur in this case. The District Court played an active role in elucidating Fry\u2019s argument at the hearing, interjecting to ensure that it understood the purpose for which Fry objected to the PSR\u2019s representation that he \u201cshared\u201d in the proceeds of the conspiracy and twice acknowledging that it comprehended Fry\u2019s argument, responding \u201cI see\u201d and \u201c[o]kay\u201d following defense counsel\u2019s explanations. In its Statement of Reasons, the Court indicated that it disregarded parts of the PSR that suggested Fry had shared equally in the proceeds.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court\u2019s statements in pronouncing Fry\u2019s sentence make clear that it merely found Fry\u2019s arguments unpersuasive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-11\">In this case, this -was a long ongoing fraud against Johnson Controls, for the theft of batteries and their resale to third-parties [ sic]. And <em>the defendants, Mr. Fry included, received money for those batteries </em>that they sold. <em>And they kept the money for their oim purposes. </em>So, the nature of the offense is serious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqj\">(App. 76 (emphasis added)); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 358, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (\u201cThe record makes clear that the sentencing judge listened to each argument.... The judge then simply found these circumstances insufficient to warrant a sentence lower than the Guidelines range.... \u201d). The District Court did not fail to consider Fry\u2019s lesser financial gain; it simply declined to differentiate him on that basis. <em>Cf. United States v. Tomko, </em>562 F.3d 558, 568-69 (3d Cir.2009) (en banc) (finding that Tomko\u2019s sentence was procedurally reasonable where the sentencing judge clearly heard each argument but rejected the Government\u2019s contentions regarding general deterrence). Finally, the Court related Fry\u2019s monetary gains to the \u201cnature of the offense,\u201d precisely the \u00a7 3553(a) factor to which Fry tied his objection in his sentencing letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">Contrary to Fry\u2019s argument that the brevity of the District Court\u2019s sentencing explication demonstrates a lack of consideration, \u201c[a] sentencing court does not have to \u2018discuss and make findings as to each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors if the <em>record </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>makes clear the court took the factors into account in sentencing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tomko, </em>562 F.3d at 568 (quoting <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 329 (3d Cir.2006), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007)); <em>cf. Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456 (\u201c[G]iven the straightforward, conceptually simple arguments before the judge, the judge\u2019s statement of reasons here, though brief, was legally sufficient.\u201d). The record thus reveals that the Court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing or commit procedural error with respect to Fry\u2019s \u00a7 3553(a) arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment of sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b158-7\">. In his initial brief, Fry claimed (1) that the Government violated the plea agreement by refusing to move for a one-point reduction necessary to reach the stipulated offense level of 19 because Fry had failed to relinquish a boat he owned, and (2) that his obligation to forfeit the boat was relieved or never arose under the doctrine of impracticability or was subject to rescission because of mutual mistake. By motion dated August 10, 2011, Fry withdrew these arguments. We granted that motion on August 31, 2011.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b159-9\">. Fry argues that the sentence \"All of above, <em>not </em>considered by court for sentencing\u201d in the Statement of Reasons means that the District Court refused to take account of Fry\u2019s objection. We disagree. The Court would not have indicated that it had adopted various changes to the PSR, including Fry\u2019s objections, if it intended not to take account of those objections.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
