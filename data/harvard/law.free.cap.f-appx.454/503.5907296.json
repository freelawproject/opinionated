The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) calculated an advisory range of ten to sixteen months and recommended the maximum of sixteen months, due to Martinez-Rendon\u2019s recidivism. The district court issued an upward variance, imposing a sentence of forty-eight months, based on Martinez-Rendon\u2019s repetition of the instant offense, a series of prior crimes that did not count toward his criminal history category, and the lack of regard for public safety that this history displayed. Martinez-Rendon challenges this variance as unreasonable, claiming that the district court increased his criminal history category without adequate explanation and double-counted his prior felony conviction. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b526-13\">On June 2, 2010, Martinez-Rendon pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful presence in the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(1). Section 1326(b)(1) carries a statutory maximum penalty of ten years. Martinez-Rendon previously had been deported on two separate occasions. His first deportation occurred in late 2000, after his third conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol (\u201cDUI\u201d) and an attempted escape from custody. He returned to the United States and thereafter pleaded guilty to facilitation of possession of over half a gram of cocaine on January 10, 2003. Following a four-year period of incarceration and a fourth DUI conviction, Martinez-Rendon was again deported in the fall of 2008. In October 2009, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d) received information indicating that Martinez-Rendon had returned to the United States. ICE agents apprehended him on May 1, 2010. Upon apprehension, Martinez-Rendon cooperated completely with the ICE agents, admitting to his true identity and his unlawful reentry.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-14\">The PSR set forth a total offense level of ten and a criminal history category of three, yielding a Guidelines sentence of ten to sixteen months. Based on numerous offenses not factored into the criminal history calculation and Martinez-Rendon\u2019s repeated illegal reentries into the United States, the PSR recommended a sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>at the top of the Guidelines range, sixteen months, and three years of supervised release. Taking the advisory and statutory ranges into account, the district court considered the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and imposed an upward variance, sentencing Martinez-Rendon to forty-eight months\u2019 incarceration, followed by three years of supervised release. This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Martinez-Rendon challenges his sentence as both proeedurally and substantively unreasonable. He claims that the district court arrived at the above-Guidelines sentence by increasing his base offense level from ten to twenty-one. He contends that the court impermissibly relied on factors not countable toward an \u201cupward departure,\u201d and \u201cdouble counted\u201d his prior narcotics conviction to justify an offense-level increase. Martinez-Rendon misses, however, that a \u201cvariance\u201d and a \u201cdeparture\u201d are not two versions of the same thing. <em>See United States v. Denny, </em>653 F.3d 415, 420-21 (6th Cir.2011).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this case, the district court upwardly varied, on the basis of the discretion afforded by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">We review the district court\u2019s sentence for substantive and procedural reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>588 F.3d 301, 324 (6th Cir.2009) (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 56, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). We apply the same standard whether the district court imposed a sentence within or outside the advisory range established by the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Herrera-Zuniga, </em>571 F.3d 568, 590-91 (6th Cir.2009). Unlike sentences within the Guidelines range, however, sentences outside it carry no presumption of reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 582. We ensure that such sentences have sufficient support from the district court\u2019s analysis of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Keller, </em>498 F.3d 316, 326 (6th Cir.2007) (citing <em>United States v. Davis, </em>458 F.3d 491, 496 (6th Cir.2006), <em>vacated, </em>552 U.S. 1088, 128 S.Ct. 856, 169 L.Ed.2d 708 (2008)). To affirm, we must find the sentence both proeedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">\n<em>B. Procedural Reasonableness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">Martinez-Rendon argues that the district court improperly calculated his sentence under the Guidelines, ignored clear Guidelines policy directives, and failed to explain adequately its chosen sentence. We review the procedural reasonableness of the district court\u2019s sentence by ascertaining whether it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-13\">(1) properly calculated the applicable advisory Guidelines range; (2) considered the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors as well as the parties\u2019 arguments for a sentence outside the Guidelines range; and (3) adequately articulated its reasoning for imposing the particular sentence chosen, including any rejection of the parties\u2019 arguments for an outside-Guidelines sentence and any decision to deviate from the advisory Guidelines range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APS\"><em>United States v. Barahona-Montenegro, </em>565 F.3d 980, 983 (6th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Bolds, </em>511 F.3d 568, 581 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>(6th Cir.2007)). The record of the sentencing hearing must reflect that the court considered the \u00a7 8553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>640 F.3d 195, 203 (6th Cir.2011). Section 3553(a) requires the court to \u201cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to satisfy the purposes of sentencing. <em>Denny, </em>653 F.3d at 420 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)) (internal quotation marks omitted). These purposes include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-4\">[T]he need for the sentence imposed\u2014 (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In assessing this need, the district court must consider \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), as well as the various available sentences and the policies behind them. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(3)-(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">A <em>review of </em>the record, including the sentencing hearing transcript, establishes that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining Martinez-Rendon\u2019s sentence. The PSR properly calculated, and the district court properly accepted, Martinez-Rendon\u2019s Guidelines range. The base offense level for violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is eight, after which Martinez-Rendon received a four-level enhancement for his previous felony conviction, and a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. His criminal history reflects a series of misdemeanors committed more than ten years ago (which do not count toward his criminal history category), a drug offense, and a drunk-driving offense, yielding a criminal history category of three.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">The transcript likewise shows that the court fully considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Regarding Martinez-Rendon\u2019s history and characteristics, the court noted his multiple illegal reentries into the United States and sought a sentence \u201csufficiently severe to deter this defendant from further illegal entries into the United States.\u201d (Tr. of Sentencing Hr\u2019g, Dist. Ct. Docket No. 25, at 8.) It further found that Martinez-Rendon\u2019s criminal history evinced \u201ca lack of respect for the judicial system and for the administration of justice,\u201d especially given his multiple prior drunk driving offenses and his failure to enroll in an alcohol treatment program previously offered to him. <em>(Id. </em>at 9.) Based on the DUIs, the court concluded that \u201cthis man\u2019s presence in the United States presents a significant risk of injury to the innocent citizens of the United States.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 10.) The court considered the statutory range, which permits up to ten years of incarceration, and understood it to reflect Congress\u2019s view that \u201cthere may be certain cases of illegal entry by a convicted felon which could warrant a sentence as severe as 10 years in prison.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 11.) With this in mind, the court sentenced Martinez-Rendon to forty-eight months\u2019 incarceration, coupled with three years of supervised release, in order to adequately convince Martinez-Rendon \u201cthat he is not to illegally reenter the United States, and he is not to continue committing offenses in the United States.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">Martinez-Rendon does not argue that the district court failed to consider his mitigating evidence in imposing the sentence. Given the district court\u2019s express articulation of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the explicit connections that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>drew between those factors and the need for an above-Guidelines sentence, we conclude that the court imposed a procedurally reasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">\n<em>C. Substantive Reasonableness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Martinez-Rendon maintains that the court improperly double-counted his narcotics conviction by considering it as part of the \u00a7 3553(a) analysis, when it already factored into his criminal history category. He further claims that the court impermissibly relied on his uncounted misdemeanors, because Guidelines policy dictated that courts may consider them only in \u201crare\u201d circumstances where the criminal history \u201csubstantially under-represents\u201d the defendant\u2019s criminal past. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The Supreme Court requires us to give district courts substantial latitude to calculate sentences that they deem appropriate. Indeed, it has made clear that \u201c \u2018[n]o limitation shall be placed on the information\u2019 a sentencing court may consider \u2018concerning the [defendant\u2019s] background, character, and conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pepper v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1229, 1235-36, 179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011) (alterations in original) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661) (relying on this principle to strike down a statutory provision limiting the information that district courts may consider in sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">As a cardinal rule, the fact that we might reasonably disagree with the sentence imposed is insufficient to justify vacating a sentence imposed by a district court. <em>Johnson, </em>640 F.3d at 202 (citing <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). We may not apply a presumption of unreasonableness to above-Guidelines sentences, but rather must examine the totality of the circumstances and \u201cgive due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">We may find a sentence substantively unreasonable if it appears that the district court has \u201cselect[ed] the sentence arbitrarily, bas[ed] the sentence on impermissible factors, fail[ed] to consider pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors or giv[en] an unreasonable amount of weight to any pertinent factor.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>588 F.3d 301, 328 (6th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Collington, </em>461 F.3d 805, 808 (6th Cir.2006)). Where a sentence deviates from the Guidelines, we may \u201crequire some correlation between the extent of the variance and the justification for it,\u201d but we may not apply a \u201crigid mathematical formula that uses the percentage of a departure as the standard for determining the strength of the justifications required for a specific sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>537 F.3d 611, 614 (6th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 47, 128 S.Ct. 586).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">Here, the court did not rely on impermissible factors in determining MartinezRendon\u2019s sentence. The district court did not double count the narcotics conviction, because it properly considered that conviction as part of Martinez-Rendon\u2019s history and characteristics, under \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Likewise, the district court used sound discretion in considering Martinez-Rendon\u2019s uncounted misdemeanors as part of his history and in considering the need to promote respect for the law and protect the public from Martinez-Rendon\u2019s future crimes, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1) and (2), respectively. The policy statement discouraging courts from considering \u201cout of time\u201d convictions does not bind the court. <em>Keller, </em>498 F.3d at 319 (citing <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 261, 125 S.Ct. 738). Rather, courts retain broad discretion to \u201cimpose a sentence sufficient but not greater than neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>sary to serve the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>537 F.3d at 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Given that the district court imposed an above-Guidelines sentence, the question is whether the court relied on facts that distinguish this instance of illegal reentry from the \u201cmine run of cases\u201d contemplated by the Guidelines. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). We agree with the district court that the record supports the upward variance in this case. While Martinez-Rendon\u2019s criminal history included only two non-immigration offenses over the past ten years, the record suggests that Martinez-Rendon\u2019s ability to keep his more recent crimes to a minimum follows as much from his four-year incarceration and two deportations as from any attempt at reform. Second, his four DUIs, while not commanding high sentences, raise the inference that Martinez-Rendon\u2019s mere presence in this country may pose a danger to himself and others. Finally, Martinez-Rendon\u2019s persistence in driving while under the influence of alcohol, coupled with his repeated reentry into this country in defiance of court orders, evidences a lack of deterrence from committing future crimes. The Supreme Court has made clear that few factors are \u201cimpermissible\u201d in the sentencing context, <em>see Pepper, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1240, and thus, it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to rely on Martinez-Rendon\u2019s past crimes in imposing an upward variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-9\">. An above- or below-Guidelines sentence is a \"departure\u201d where it is \"based on Chapter 5 of the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>544 F.3d 656, 671 n. 12 (6th Cir.2008) (citing <em>United States v.
