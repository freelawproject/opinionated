PARKER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b49-22\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b49-23\">Appellant Richard Massie, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment granting the motion of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (the \u201cMet\u201d) to dismiss as time-barred certain claims raised in his employment discrimination complaint and granting the Met\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to his remaining claim for retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <em>et seq. </em>We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity . with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-24\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), construing the complaint liberally, accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor. <em>Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir.2002). Additionally, we review an order granting summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and ask whether the district court properly concluded that there were no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Miller v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, L.L.P., </em>321 F.3d 292, 300 (2d Cir.2003). In determining whether there are genuine issues of material fact, we are \u201crequired to resolve all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.\u201d <em>Terry v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 128, 137 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, \u201cconclusory statements or mere allegations [are] not sufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion.\u201d <em>Davis v. New York, </em>316 F.3d 93,100 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Here, Massie has waived any challenge to the district court\u2019s decision granting the Met\u2019s motion to dismiss by raising such a challenge for the first time in his reply brief, <em>see Conn. Bar Ass\u2019n v. United States, </em>620 F.3d 81, 91 n. 13 (2d Cir.2010), and has waived any challenge to the court\u2019s decision granting the Met\u2019s summary judgment motion by failing to raise such a challenge in his objections to the relevant magistrate judge report, <em>see Cephas v. Nash, </em>328 F.3d 98, 107 (2d Cir.2003). Moreover, even if we were to reach the merits of the district court\u2019s decisions, we would affirm the district court\u2019s judgment for substantially the same reasons stated by the magistrate judge in his thorough and well-reasoned reports. The magistrate judge correctly concluded that any claims in Massie\u2019s complaint based on the June 2004 or February 2006 charges that he filed with the New York State Division of Human Rights were untimely under the applicable 90-day limitations period. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1). The arguments in Massie\u2019s reply brief challenging this conclusion are inapposite as they rely on his lack of knowledge of the alleged violations at issue, which is irrelevant to the limitations period applied by the district court. Additionally, the magistrate judge correctly concluded that the Met was entitled to summary judgment on Massie\u2019s retaliation claim because he failed to dispute the Met\u2019s evidence establishing that there was a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for his termination and subsequent reinstatement subject to a suspension; namely, his abandonment of his security post in April 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">We have considered Massie\u2019s other arguments on appeal and have found them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
