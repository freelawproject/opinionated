Lee, Sr., contends that the Hawaii Department of Public Safety retaliated against him in violation of the First Amendment and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. To prevail on a First Amendment retaliation claim, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>plaintiff must show that his protected speech was a \u201csubstantial or motivating factor\u201d in an adverse employment action taken against him. <em>Coszalter v. City of Salem, </em>320 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, to prevail on a Title VII retaliation claim, a plaintiff must show \u201ca causal link between [his] protected activity and [an] adverse employment action\u201d taken against him. <em>Davis v. Team Electric Co., </em>520 F.3d 1080, 1093-94 (9th Cir.2008). We agree with the district court that Lee presented insufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether his speech was a substantial or motivating factor in, or had a causal link to, any adverse employment action that may have been taken against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b632-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
