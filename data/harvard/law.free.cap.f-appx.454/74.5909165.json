For the following reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-17\">\n<em>I. BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b97-18\">Bartos alleges that the Appellees discriminated against her on the basis of her gender during the time that she was a mental health worker at the State Correctional Institution in Frackville, Pennsylvania (\u201cSCI Frackville\u201d). Bartos also alleges hostile work environment, retaliation, and conspiracy claims related to the alleged discrimination. Because we write principally for the parties, who are familiar with the background of the case, we will recite only those facts relevant to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-19\">Bartos was employed by Appellee MHM Correctional Services (\u201cMHM\u201d) as a mental health worker at SCI Frackville from September 1, 2003 until her termination on October 24, 2007. She worked under Program Director David Mont until his resignation in March of 2006, at which time Mont was replaced as Program Director by Appellee Ardie Kissinger. Prior to Mont\u2019s resignation, Appellee Charles Whitney became MHM\u2019s Senior Human Resources Partner for the Northern Region, which included MHM\u2019s operations at SCI Frackville.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-20\">On July 14, 2006, Bartos gave a deposition in a gender discrimination case filed by former MHM employee, Wanda Bates, against MHM, David Mont, and the Department of Corrections. Six months la<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>ter, on January 16, 2007, Bartos received verbal and written warnings after Ardie Kissinger allegedly witnessed her speaking to inmates in a degrading way, cursing at inmates, and withholding food through a practice known as the \u201cpurple diet.\u201d The following month, February 12, 2007, Bartos was again disciplined for a negative attitude and use of inappropriate language around inmates, this time on the report of a Corrections Officer. On May 29, 2007, Bartos gave a deposition in a second gender discrimination suit, filed by former MHM employee, Mary Kay Prezlomski, against MHM. Over two months after the second deposition, on August 17, 2007, Bartos received a written warning for failure to work her posted shift. Also in August of 2007, Bartos received a substandard performance evaluation and was given a performance improvement plan. Bartos was suspended from employment on October 17, 2007 after an inmate was improperly placed on suicide precautions and moved to a more restrictive confinement area during her shift the previous night. Following an investigation, Bartos was terminated on October 24, 2007 on the grounds that she assisted in moving an inmate without proper authority and participated in forging a doctor\u2019s signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Bartos filed charges related to her termination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (\u201cPHRC\u201d). Upon receiving a \u201cright to sue\u201d letter from the EEOC, Bartos initiated this suit on May 29, 2009 in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, claiming gender discrimination, retaliation, and hostile work environment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2000e-17 (2006), and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (\u201cPHRA\u201d), 43 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 951-63 (West 2009). Bartos also alleged state law claims for conspiracy and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">On July 6, 2010, the District Court issued an Order dismissing Bartos\u2019s state law claims for failure to state a claim. In a second Order, dated March 18, 2011, the District Court granted summary judgment against Bartos on the remaining claims. On April 11, 2011, Bartos filed this appeal challenging the District Court\u2019s March 18, 2011 Order granting summary judgment and the July 6, 2010 Order dismissing her conspiracy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">\n<em>II. JURISDICTION &amp; STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The District Court had jurisdiction over Bartos\u2019s federal claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (2006), and supplemental jurisdiction over her state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a) (2006). We have jurisdiction over this Appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">We review a \u201cDistrict Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard the District Court applied.\u201d <em>Alcoa, Inc. v. United States, </em>509 F.3d 173, 175 (3d Cir.2007) (citing <em>Doe v. County of Centre, PA., </em>242 F.3d 437, 447 (3d Cir.2001)). When reviewing a grant of summary judgment we \u201cmust view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all inferences in that party\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Stratechuk v. Bd. of Educ., </em>587 F.3d 597, 603 (3d Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Norfolk S. Ry. Co. v. Basell USA, Inc., </em>512 F.3d 86, 91 (3d Cir.2008)). However, general averments and conclusory allegations are insufficient to rebut a motion for summary judgment. <em>Lujan v. Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n, </em>497 U.S. 871, 888-89, 110 S.Ct. 3177, 111 L.Ed.2d 695 (1990); <em>Trap Rock Indus., Inc. v. Local 825, Int\u2019l Union of Operating Eng\u2019rs, </em>982 F.2d 884, 890 (3d Cir.1992) (\u201cA non-moving party may not \u2018rest upon mere allegations, general deni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>als or ... vague statements ....\u201d\u2019) (quoting <em>Quiroga v. Hasbro, Inc., </em>934 F.2d 497, 500 (3d Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">We also review a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss <em>de novo. Morse v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., </em>132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir.1997). Dismissal is appropriate when a plaintiff has failed to plead sufficient facts to state a claim that is plausible on its face. <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). \u201c[W]here the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged-but it has not show[n]-that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1950, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2) (internal quotation marks omitted)). \u201c[O]nly a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">\n<em>III. ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\"><em>A. </em>Claims under Title VII and the PHRA</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">The District Court properly granted summary judgment on Bartos\u2019s Title VII and PHRA claims because Bartos has not presented a <em>prima facie </em>case on any of her three alleged theories: gender discrimination, hostile work environment, or retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of gender discrimination, the plaintiff must show that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-12\">(1) [she] belongs to a protected class;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-13\">(2) [she] was qualified for the position;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-14\">(3) [she] was subject to an adverse employment action despite being qualified; and (4) under circumstances that raise an inference of discriminatory action, the employer continued to seek out individuals with qualifications similar to [hers] to fill the position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-18\"><em>Sarullo v. USPS, </em>352 F.3d 789, 797 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-19\">The District Court correctly found that Bartos failed to present evidence raising an inference of discriminatory action. Most of the evidence Bartos presents carries no inference of gender discrimination, as it does not suggest that discriminatory intent (rather than some other factor) motivated the adverse employment actions taken against her. Bartos\u2019s evidence that could support an inference of discrimination is insufficient because it consists of general and conclusory allegations of gender based preferential treatment and gender based antagonism. <em>See Lujan, </em>497 U.S. at 888-89, 110 S.Ct. 3177. For these reasons, the District Court properly granted summary judgment on the gender discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-20\">The District Court also properly granted summary judgment on Bartos\u2019s hostile work environment claim. This claim is founded on actions taken by David Mont both prior to MHM\u2019s contract at SCI Frackville and during his tenure as MHM\u2019s Program Director. Claims based on Mont\u2019s actions are time barred under both Title VII and the PHRA. In order to file a suit under the PHRA, a plaintiff must file a claim with the PHRC within 180 days of the alleged act. <em>Woodson v. Scott Paper Co., </em>109 F.3d 913, 925 (3d Cir.1997) (\u201cIf a plaintiff fails to file a timely complaint with the PHRC, then he or she is precluded from judicial remedies under the PHRA.\u201d). To file a suit under Title VII, a plaintiff must file a charge with the EEOC within 300 days<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>complained of action or the suit is time-barred. <em>Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>586 U.S. 101, 109-10, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">David Mont resigned from MHM in March of 2006. A suit based on any actions taken by Mont prior to his resignation was time-barred under the PHRC as of September 2006 (at the latest) and under the EEOC as of January 2007 (at the latest). Though the dates of Bartos\u2019s administrative filings are not readily apparent from the record, the parties\u2019 briefs, or the District Court\u2019s Orders, they do not appear to have fallen within the statutory time limits. Under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.28(a)(1) (2006), the EEOC \u201cshall promptly issue such notice [of right to sue] to all parties, at any time after the expiration of one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the filing of the charge.... \u201d Upon receipt of the right to sue notice, the plaintiff then has ninety days to bring a suit. \u00a7 1601.28(e)(1). If Bartos filed her suit on May 29, 2009, the earliest she could have filed her charge under the regulatory time limits would be September 1, 2008. Even accounting for some tardiness by the EEOC in releasing the right to sue notice, Bartos\u2019s administrative claim was over eighteen months too late to preserve any claims against Mont.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Nor does Bartos\u2019s claim against MHM for wrongful termination preserve any claims against Mont. Under the timing requirements of Title VII, \u201cdiscrete acts that fall within the statutory time period do not make timely acts that fall outside the time period.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp., </em>536 U.S. at 112, 122 S.Ct. 2061; <em>see also id. </em>at 111, 122 S.Ct. 2061 (\u201cWe have repeatedly interpreted the term \u2018practice\u2019 to apply to a discrete act or single \u2018occurrence,\u2019 even when it has a connection to other acts.\u201d). For these reasons, the District Court properly granted summary judgment on the hostile work environment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">To establish a <em>prima fade </em>case for retaliation, \u201ca plaintiff must show: (1) protected employee activity; (2) adverse action by the employer either after or contemporaneous with the employee\u2019s protected activity; and (3) a causal connection between the employee\u2019s protected activity and the employer\u2019s adverse action.\u201d <em>Shellenberger v. Summit Bancorp, Inc., </em>318 F.3d 183, 187 (3d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Krouse v. Am. Sterilizer Co., </em>126 F.3d 494, 500 (3d Cir.1997)). Causation can be shown through temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse employment action; an intervening pattern of antagonism; or the evidence taken as a whole. <em>See Farrell v. Planters Lifesavers Co., </em>206 F.3d 271, 280-81 (3d Cir.2000); <em>Kachmar v. SunGard Data Sys., Inc., </em>109 F.3d 173, 177 (3d Cir.1997). Bartos did not present sufficient evidence to support a causal connection between her protected activity and the adverse employment action on any of these three theories. Bartos\u2019s termination occurred five months after her deposition in the Prezlomski case and fourteen months after her deposition in the Bates case; neither period of time is unduly suggestive of a causal connection. <em>See Williams v. Phila. Hous. Auth. Police Dep\u2019t, 380 F.3d 751, </em>760 (3d Cir.2004) (holding two months between protected activity and adverse employment action not unduly suggestive). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Though Bartos was subject to several disciplinary actions in the period between her first deposition testimony and her termination, these actions do not amount to a pattern of antagonism as they were neither consistent and continuous during the intervening period nor does Bartos offer any basis for linking the disciplinary actions to her deposition testimony. <em>Cf. Robinson v. Se. Pa. Transp. Auth, </em>982 F.2d 892, 895 (3d Cir.1993) (finding a pattern of antagonism where plaintiff was subject to a \u201cconstant barrage of written and verbal warnings ..., inaccurate point totalings, and disciplinary action, all of which occurred soon after plaintiffs initial complaints and continued until his discharge.\u201d (ellipses in original) (internal quotation marks omitted)). For the same reasons, even when the evidence is taken as a whole, there is no basis for drawing a causal connection between Bartos\u2019s protected activity and her termination. In short, the connection between the protected activity (Bartos\u2019s depositions) and the adverse employment action (her discipline and eventual termination) was so attenuated and remote in time that no causal connection can be inferred.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For these reasons, the District Court properly granted summary judgment on the retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">B. State Law Conspiracy Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The District Court properly dismissed the state law conspiracy claim because Bartos insufficiently pled an underlying cause of action. A civil action for conspiracy requires an agreement by the conspirators to commit an unlawful act. <em>McKeeman v. Corestates Bank, N.A., </em>751 A.2d 655, 660 (Pa.Super.Ct.2000). \u201c[Ajbsent a civil cause of action for a particular act, there can be no cause of action for civil conspiracy to commit that act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Pelagatti v. Cohen, </em>370 Pa.Super. 422, 536 A.2d 1337, 1342 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Bartos premised her conspiracy claim on the tort of false light. False light is an invasion of privacy that occurs when \u201c(a) the false light in which the other was placed would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and (b) the actor had knowledge of or acted in reckless disregard as to the falsity of the publicized matter and the false light in which the other would be placed.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652E (1977). False light is only applicable when the plaintiff \u201cis given publicity,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 652E cmt. a., meaning that \u201cthe matter is made public, by communicating it to the public at large, or to so many persons that the matter must be regarded as substantially certain to become one of public knowledge,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 652D cmt. a (distinguishing publicity from publication, \u201cwhich includes any communication by the defendant to a third person\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">Bartos has failed to state a claim for conspiracy to place her in a false light because she has averred no facts regarding publicity. There is nothing in the record to indicate that Appellees made any information about Bartos a matter of \u201cpublic knowledge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Without publicity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>there cannot be false light. Because Bartos has pled no facts that can support an inference of an underlying unlawful act for the purposes of showing a conspiracy, she has failed to plead sufficient facts to state a claim that is plausible on its face. <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955. For these reasons, the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Bartos\u2019s conspiracy claim was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\n<em>IV. CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s Orders dismissing Bartos\u2019s claim in part and granting summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-16\">. \"In a State that has an entity with the authority to grant or seek relief with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>-to the alleged unlawful practice, an employee who initially files a grievance with that agency must file the charge with the EEOC within 300 days of the employment practice; in all other States, the charge must be filed within 180 days.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp., </em>536 U.S. at 109, 122 S.Ct 2061. Because Pennsylvania has the PHRC to hear discrimination claims, the later deadline is applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-7\">. Though we do not reach the question of whether MHM\u2019s stated reasons for terminating Bartos were pretextual because we find that no <em>prima facie </em>case has been presented, <em>see McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), we note that evidence merely suggesting an adverse employment decision is wrong or mistaken is insufficient to support a claim of retaliation. <em>Fuentes v. Perskie, </em>32 F.3d 759, 765 (3d Cir.1994) (\"To discredit the employer\u2019s proffered reason, however, the plaintiff cannot simply show that the employer\u2019s decision was wrong or mistaken, since the factual dispute at issue is whether discriminatory animus motivated the employer, not whether the employer is wise, shrewd, prudent, or competent.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
