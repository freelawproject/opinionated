(\u201cVentana\u201d) appeals from the district court\u2019s summary judgment and attorney fees award in its insurance coverage action against St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine, Ins. Co. (\u201cSt. Paul\u201d). We affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the history of this case, we need not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b619-19\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Ventana\u2019s claim that St. Paul owed it a duty to defend an .underlying patent infringement action filed by Di-gene Corporation. Because this is a diversity case on appeal from the District Court for the District of Arizona, Arizona law applies. <em>Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. v. Owen, </em>519 F.3d 1035, 1037-38 (9th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938)). Arizona courts have long recognized that the duty to defend is distinct and broader than the duty to indemnify. <em>See INA Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. Valley Forge Ins. Co., </em>150 Ariz. 248, 722 P.2d 975, 982 (Ariz.Ct.App.1986). Under Arizona law, an insurer\u2019s duty to defend attaches to \u201cany claim potentially covered by [its] policy.\u201d <em>United Servs. Auto. </em>Ass\u2019n <em>v. Morris, </em>154 Ariz. 113, 741 P.2d 246, 250 (1987). An insurance company does, however, have the \u201cright to limit its liability and to impose conditions and restrictions upon its contractual obligations not inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>with public policy.\u201d <em>Kepner v. Western Fire Ins. Co., </em>109 Ariz. 329, 509 P.2d 222, 223 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Digene\u2019s first amended complaint dictates the analysis of Ventana\u2019s claims for coverage against St. Paul. Despite Ventana\u2019s argument to the contrary, St. Paul did not have a duty to investigate facts beyond the allegations in this complaint and the materials submitted with it. <em>See U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Corp. v. Advance Roofing &amp; Supply Co., Inc., </em>163 Ariz. 476, 788 P.2d 1227, 1231 (Ariz.Ct.App.1989) (concluding that \u201cno Arizona authority defin[ed] the extent of an insurer\u2019s duty to investigate facts outside the allegations of the complaint where ... those allegations would not impose a duty to defend.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">A careful reading of Digene\u2019s first amended complaint reveals that Digene did not allege claims for implied disparagement or for unauthorized use of a slogan. Moreover, even if Digene\u2019s allegations regarding the 2002 Ventana press release could be interpreted as a claim for implied disparagement, such a claim would have fallen under an exclusion of the policy then in force. The Intellectual Property exclusion in St. Paul\u2019s December 2001 to December 2002 liability policy specifically excluded coverage for \u201cany other injury ... alleged in a claim or suit that also alleges [patent] infringement.\u201d Thus, because Di-gene\u2019s complaint alleged patent infringement, St. Paul had no duty to defend against any other claims potentially covered by the 2002 policy. Ventana\u2019s arguments that this exclusion is not enforceable are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Ventana\u2019s argument that Digene\u2019s claims were potentially covered by St. Paul\u2019s December 2000 to December 2001 liability policy is similarly unpersuasive. Nothing in the record suggests that any of Digene\u2019s claims were based on allegedly disparaging statements made by Ventana in 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">We review a district court\u2019s award of attorney fees for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Velarde v. PACE Membership Warehouse, Inc., </em>105 F.3d 1313, 1318-19 (9th Cir.1997); <em>Chevron U.S.A Inc. v. Schirmer, </em>11 F.3d 1473, 1480 (9th Cir.1993). We will not reverse a district court\u2019s award unless we have a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that the court below committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.\u201d <em>Smith v. Jackson, </em>84 F.3d 1213, 1221 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Here, the district court awarded fees under Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 12-341.01. The Arizona Supreme Court has identified the relevant factors for deciding whether to award attorney fees under this statute. <em>Associated Indem. Corp. v. Warner, </em>143 Ariz. 567, 694 P.2d 1181, 1184 (1985). The district court weighed these factors and conducted the proper analysis. There is thus no cause for us to disturb its conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b619-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
