Chan, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals from an interlocutory order granting partial summary judgment to The Flag Company, Inc., his business competitor. The district court awarded injunctive relief, monetary damages, and attorney\u2019s fees to Flag Co. on its trademark infringement claim brought under the Lanham Act. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1114; <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1117. That claim was one of three asserted in Flag Co.\u2019s complaint, and other two, which allege violations of the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act and the Georgia Deceptive Trade Practices Act, are still pending before the district court. Chan contends that the evidence establishes that Flag Co.\u2019s FARMING FLAGS trademark is generic and as a result Flag Co.\u2019s registration of that mark is invalid.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues that summary judgment should be reversed and the FARMING FLAGS marks should be cancelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-16\">As an initial matter we consider our subject matter jurisdiction, which is an issue that we review <em>de novo. AT&amp;T Mobility, LLC v. Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n for Stock Car Auto Racing, Inc., </em>494 F.3d 1356, 1360 (11th Cir.2007). As a general rule, \u201can order adjudicating fewer than all the claims in a suit ... is not a final judgment from which an appeal may be taken.\u201d <em>Edwards v. Prime, Inc., </em>602 F.3d 1276, 1288, 602 F.3d 1276 (11th Cir.2010). Even so, both sides assert that this Court has jurisdiction. Flag Co. acknowledges that the district court\u2019s order did not address all of its claims. It contends, however, that this Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 to review the district court\u2019s order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>as a final judgment because after this appeal was filed, Flag Co. filed in the district court a motion to dismiss its two remaining claims. Flag Co.\u2019s motion does not create appellate jurisdiction in this case. <em>See State Treasurer of Michigan v. Barry, </em>168 F.3d 8, 11 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201c[Ajppellate jurisdiction over a non-final order cannot be created by dismissing the remaining claims without prejudice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Even though we do not have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) we do have jurisdiction over district courts\u2019 \u201c[interlocutory orders ... granting ... injunctions.\u201d Section 1292(a)(1) gives us jurisdiction over the grant of injunctive relief to Flag Co., but Chan more generally challenges the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in Flag Co.\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">We may exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over a matter that would not be otherwise appealable if it is \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with an appealable decision, or if review of the non-appealable decision is necessary to ensure meaningful review of the appealable one. <em>Swint v. Chambers Cnty. Comm\u2019n, </em>514 U.S. 35, 51, 115 S.Ct. 1203, 1212, 131 L.Ed.2d 60 (1995). Here, a review of the district court\u2019s decision to grant injunctive relief necessarily requires us to determine whether summary judgment was appropriate on Flag Co.\u2019s trademark infringement claim, so we will exercise our discretion to review the grant of summary judgment. <em>Cf. Cable Holdings of Battlefield, Inc. v. Cooke, </em>764 F.2d 1466, 1472 (11th Cir.1985) (exercising pendent jurisdiction in order to consider the merits of the district court\u2019s underlying summary judgment decision in an appeal from a denial of a preliminary injunction).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the grant of summary judgment, applying the same legal standards as the district court. <em>Tana v. Dantanna\u2019s, </em>611 F.3d 767, 772 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cSummary judgment is proper where \u2018the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">To prove trademark infringement under the Lanham Act, a plaintiff must show that it owns a valid mark and that the defendant\u2019s use of its mark is likely to cause confusion. <em>See 15 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a); <em>Tana, </em>611 F.3d at 773. Trademarks are generally entitled to different levels of protection depending on their level of distinctiveness. <em>See Tana, </em>611 F.3d at 773. We have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-11\">Our circuit recognizes four categories of distinctiveness, listed in ascending order of strength: (1) generic\u2014marks that suggest the basic nature of the product or service; (2) descriptive\u2014marks that identify the characteristic or quality of a product or service; (3) suggestive\u2014 marks that suggest characteristics of the product or service and require an effort of the imagination by the consumer in order to be understood as descriptive; and (4) arbitrary or fanciful\u2014marks that bear no relationship to the product or service, and the strongest category of trademarks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 774 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-13\">Five years after a mark has been registered, its holder may file an affidavit with the United States Patent and Trademark Office certifying that the mark has been in continuous use since registration, that there is no pending proceeding concerning the mark, and that there has been no adverse decision concerning the regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>trant\u2019s ownership of the mark. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1065. If these requirements are met, the mark is declared \u201cincontestable,\u201d and is presumed valid. <em>See Dieter v. B &amp; H Indus, of Sw. Fla., Inc., </em>880 F.2d 322, 328 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Flag Co. has been using the FARMING FLAGS trademark to market and sell hand-held flags for twenty years. It obtained federal registration for its FARMING FLAGS mark in 1994, and later it met the requirements for incontestability. The validity of an incontestable mark, like FARMING FLAGS, cannot be challenged on the ground that it is merely descriptive. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">A generic term, which is a weaker mark than a descriptive one, \u201crefers to the genus of which the particular product is a species.\u201d <em>Park \u2019N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park and Fly, Inc., </em>469 U.S. 189, 194, 105 S.Ct. 658, 661, 83 L.Ed.2d 582 (1985). \u201cGeneric terms are not registerable, and a registered mark may be canceled at any time on the grounds that it has become generic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A term may be generic for one category of goods and non-generic for another. <em>See Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., </em>537 F.2d 4, 9 (2d Cir.1976). \u201cTo take a familiar example \u2018Ivory\u2019 would be generic when used to describe a product made from the tusks of elephants but arbitrary as applied to soap.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">\u201cA descriptive mark identifies a characteristic or quality of the service or product [e.g., Vision Center].\u201d <em>Caliber Auto. Liquidators, Inc. v. Premier Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, LLC, </em>605 F.3d 931, 938 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted; alteration in original). For example, \u201cMilk Delivery\u201d could be a generic service mark for a milk delivery service, while \u201cBarnMilk\u201d could be a descriptive service mark for the same business. <em>Investacorp, Inc. v. Arabian Inv. Banking Corp., </em>931 F.2d 1519, 1522 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">Chan argues that FARMING FLAGS is a generic mark in the real estate business. He asserts that real estate agents often plant small American flags in homeowners\u2019 yards to promote their services in the communities where they advertise\u2014areas that are referred to as the agents\u2019 \u201cfarms.\u201d According to Chan, the agents\u2019 promotional give-aways include not just farming flags but also farming postcards, farming notepads, and farming refrigerator magnets.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">As Chan\u2019s own argument shows, FARMING FLAGS is, at the very least, a descriptive trademark. It is not generic. \u201cFarming\u201d is a characteristic or quality of the product sold\u2014flags. <em>See Caliber Auto. Liquidators, </em>605 F.3d at 938. The validity of an incontestable mark, like FARMING FLAGS, cannot be challenged on the ground that it is merely descriptive. The district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Flag Co. on its trademark infringement claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">In addition his argument that the FARMING FLAGS mark is generic, Chan also asserts a slew of challenges to the district court\u2019s discovery and evidentiary rulings. Even if the district court had made the evidentiary and discovery errors that Chan asserts it did, his evidence was still insufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact about the validity of the \u201cFARMING FLAGS\u201d mark. The evidence showed, at most, that the mark was merely descriptive, which is not enough to rebut a presumption of validity. <em>See Dieter, </em>880 F.2d at 328. Thus, even if the evidentiary rulings Chan complains about were made in error, any error was harmless. <em>See Hearn v. McKay, </em>603 F.3d 897, 904 n. 11 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201cErroneous evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>dentiary determinations that do not affect the substantial rights of a party must be disregarded.\u201d) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111; Fed.R.Civ.P. 61; Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-12\">. Because Chan is <em>pro se, </em>we construe his brief liberally. <em>See Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
