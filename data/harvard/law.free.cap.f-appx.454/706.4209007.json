Lawson\u2019s Motion for Rehearing is GRANTED. The panel\u2019s opinion of May 25, 2011, 427 Fed.Appx. 799, is withdrawn and the following opinion is substituted in its place.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-17\">Ross Lawson, a Florida prisoner, filed a <em>pro se </em>lawsuit against the Secretary of the Florida Department of Corrections in his official capacity (the \u201cDOC\u201d) for injunctive and declaratory relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In his complaint, Lawson alleged violations of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (\u201cRLUIPA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-1, and the Florida Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\u201cRFRA\u201d), Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 761.01.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finding that Lawson\u2019s professed beliefs in Orthodox Judaism were insincere, the district court dismissed the action as frivolous under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). On appeal, Lawson argues that the district court erroneously dismissed his suit as frivolous, inappropriately resolved disputed issues of fact about Lawson\u2019s sincerity, and failed to afford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>him adequate notice and an opportunity to present evidence before dismissing the complaint. After a review of the record, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Lawson filed an amended complaint alleging that the DOC burdened his practice of Orthodox Judaism by, <em>inter alia, </em>denying him access to Kosher meals, denying access to. daily and weekly religious services, and denying his right to observe Jewish holidays.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The DOC moved to dismiss the complaint as frivolous because Lawson\u2019s religious beliefs were not sincere. It also requested dismissal as a sanction against Lawson for filing a frivolous lawsuit. In support of the motion, the DOC submitted records of Lawson\u2019s canteen purchases, showing that he purchased non-Kosher food items, as well as several affidavits from prison personnel supporting the DOC\u2019s position that Lawson\u2019s beliefs were insincere. In opposition to the motion to dismiss, Lawson filed a motion to strike the affidavits, disputed the content of the affidavits, and submitted affidavits of other inmates to establish that he had been deprived of the opportunity to practice his religion. He also submitted grievances and other documentation for the district court\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Although Lawson paid his initial filing fee in full, the magistrate judge recommended that the complaint be dismissed as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519 because there was evidence that Lawson\u2019s religious beliefs were not sincere and that Lawson be given a \u201cstrike\u201d under \u00a7 1519(g).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Over Lawson\u2019s objections, and after considering Lawson\u2019s motion, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and dismissed the complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-12\">On appeal, Lawson first argues that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing the action as frivolous. We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of action as frivolous under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) for abuse of discretion. <em>Mitchell v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>294 F.3d 1309, 1315 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion if it applies an incorrect legal standard, follows improper procedures in making the determination, or makes findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Chicago Tribune Co. v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., </em>263 F.3d 1304, 1309 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-13\">Section 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) provides that the district court shall dismiss the case of a prisoner proceeding <em>in forma pauperis </em>(IFP) if the action is frivolous or malicious. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). A claim is frivolous if it \u201clacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u201d <em>Miller v. Donald, </em>541 F.3d 1091, 1100 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-14\">On review, we conclude that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing Lawson\u2019s action as frivolous under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). This court has held that \u201c \u00a7 1915(e) <em>only </em>applies to cases in which the plaintiff is proceeding <em>[in forma pauperis].\u201d Farese v. Scherer, </em>342 F.3d 1223, 1228 (11th Cir.2003) (emphasis added). Additionally, the Supreme Court has clarified that courts only review for frivolity under \u00a7 1915 when the plaintiff fails to pay the initial filing fee; this is not the case here. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325-26, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Lawson did not cite to our circuit precedent regarding \u00a7 1915 in his initial brief on appeal, nor did he specifically argue that the district court erred for dismissing his claim as frivolous under the IFP statute. Ordinarily when an appellant fails to make an explicit argument in his initial brief, we consider it waived. <em>Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Bds. of Pharmacy v. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. Sys. of Georgia, </em>633 F.3d 1297, 1309 n. 25 (11th Cir.2011). Here, however, Lawson did note in several places before the district court and the court of appeals that he paid the initial filing fee in full. And briefs filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants are to be read liberally. <em>United States v. Hung Thien Ly, </em>646 F.3d 1307, 1316 (11th Cir.2011). Because Lawson paid the filing fee in full at the time he filed his initial complaint, he was never subject to the statute governing the filings of IFP litigants. Thus, the district court erred when it dismissed his complaint for frivolity pursuant to that statute. The order of the district court is REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b729-10\">. Lawson initially filed his complaint <em>pro se, </em>but paid the full filing fee with his complaint. After eighteen months of litigation, Lawson retained counsel, who filed an amended complaint. Counsel later withdrew. Lawson proceeds <em>pro se </em>on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b730-8\">. He also requested an emergency preliminary injunction requiring the DOC to provide Kosher meals and to exempt him from the grooming code. The district court denied the preliminary injunction and Lawson does not appeal from that order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b730-9\">. At the time of the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, Lawson had not filed a response to the motion for sanctions. Lawson had timely tendered his response to the prison mail system, but his objections were not docketed in the district court until after the magistrate judge\u2019s report. In any event, the district court considered Lawson's response and the evidence before adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
