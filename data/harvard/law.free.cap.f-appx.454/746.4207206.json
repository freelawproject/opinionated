His motion was based on Amendment 706 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c), which awards a two-level reduction in the base offense level for certain crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C amend. 706 (Nov.2007). For those crack cocaine offenses, the two-level reduction of Amendment 706 applies retroactively to defendants already sentenced. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C amend. 713 (May 2008). Solomon asks this Court to decide whether his particular circumstances justify the application of Amendment 706. After thorough review, we affirm the ruling of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">Amendment 706 does not provide relief to those defendants who are sentenced as career offenders under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir.2008). At sentencing, the district court found Solomon met the definition of a career offender, but Solomon was not sentenced under the career offender guidelines of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Instead, the district court sentenced him under the drug guidelines of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c). On appeal, Solomon argues that he is eligible for relief pursuant to Amendment 706, because he was not sentenced as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">Solomon is indeed correct that he was not sentenced under the career offender guidelines. Where the base level offense under the drug guidelines is greater than the calculation under the career offender guidelines, the sentencing court is to apply the higher drug guideline. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b). Solomon\u2019s drug offense level of 38 exceeded the base offense level of 37 under the career offender guidelines. Thus, the district court properly sentenced Solomon under the drug guidelines at level 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1326. A district court may modify a term of imprisonment when that term is \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See id. </em>The policy statements say that a reduction is not authorized if the amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). Specifically, the application note for \u00a7 1B1.10 provides that a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not warranted where the amendment \u201cis applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-14\">In reviewing a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, this Court recalculates the defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cby substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1) (\u201cthe court shall determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the amendment(s) to the guidelines listed in subsection (c) had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced\u201d). Thus, we must now determine the guideline range that would have applied to Solomon if Amendment 706 had been in effect at his original sentencing. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Because the district court determined that Solomon qualified as a career offender, if Amendment 706 had been in effect at Solomon\u2019s original sentencing, the career offender offense level of 37 would have governed. Using the career offender table\u2019s offense level of 37 along with the criminal history category of VI, the guideline range for Solomon would not have changed, but would still have been 360 months to life. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Thus, even though Amendment 706 applies to Solomon, the operation of another guideline provision\u2014U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b)\u2014 means \u201cthe amendment does not have the effect of lowering [his] applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A). <em>Cf. Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330 (declining to apply \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction for Amendment 706, where defendants were sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1, because \u201cit would not affect their guideline ranges\u201d). As a result, Solomon is not eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
