After review and oral argument, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-27\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A1Z\">A. 2006 Arrest</p>\n<p id=\"b802-28\">In December 2006, Zheng was arrested in Charlotte, North Carolina during a raid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>on a Chinese restaurant where Zheng worked. Zheng told immigration officials that a smuggler had transported him over the U.S./Mexico border in the trunk of a car for $10,000. Zheng was taken into Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody and held at a detention facility in Atlanta.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">On December 19, 2006, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) issued a Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) charging Zheng with being removable as an alien present in the United States without being lawfully admitted or paroled, pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 212(a)(6)(A)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). The NTA was personally served on Zheng and warned him that his failure to appear at his removal hearing at the date and place directed by the Immigration Court could result in a removal order being entered in his absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">B. January 16, 2007 Hearing in Atlanta</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">On January 16, 2007, Zheng (still in custody) appeared at a master calendar hearing in Atlanta, Georgia, where he was represented by a New York attorney, K.C. Huang. The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) granted Zheng\u2019s request for release on a $20,000 bond. Upon release, Zheng reported to immigration officials that his address would be in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">At the hearing, the IJ set a master calendar hearing in Atlanta for February 1, 2007. The hearing notice advised Zheng, among other things, that if he failed to appear at his removal hearing, the hearing may proceed in his absence and a removal order may be entered against him. Immigration Court staff personally served the written notice on attorney Huang, and the IJ orally advised Zheng of the contents of the notice in his native language.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">C. February 1, 2007 Hearing in Atlanta</p>\n<p id=\"b803-14\">On February 1, 2007, Zheng and attorney Huang appeared at the second master calendar hearing in Atlanta.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At that hearing, the IJ set a third master calendar hearing for February 20, 2007 and issued a written notice of that hearing. The written notice advised Zheng that if he failed to appear, the hearing might be held in his absence and a removal order might be entered. The IJ orally advised Zheng of the contents of the written notice in his native language.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-15\">On the same day, attorney Huang filed a written motion for change of venue from Atlanta, Georgia to New York City, Zheng\u2019s new place of residence. The motion stated that Zheng was living in New York City and that \u201ctrips between Atlanta and New York City\u201d would \u201cstrain[] his financial sources, if there is any.\u201d In an affidavit in support of the motion 'for a change of venue, Zheng advised that he currently resided in Brooklyn, New York. Zheng\u2019s affidavit admitted the charges of removability in the NTA and stated that Zheng was seeking political asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture. Zheng also filed a change of address form stating that his new address was in Brooklyn, New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-16\">Also on February 1, 2007, Zheng filed a bare-bones application for asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture based on nationality, political opinion and Convention Against Torture. Zheng merely checked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>the \u201cYes\u201d boxes for the questions asking if: (1) he, his family or close friends or colleagues had experienced harm or mistreatment or threats in the past; (2) he feared harm or mistreatment if he was returned to China; (3) he or his family members had been accused, charged, arrested, detained, interrogated, convicted and sentenced, or imprisoned in another country; and (4) he feared he would be tortured in China. However, Zheng did not complete any sections of the application asking him to provide details if he had answered yes to these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">D. February 20, 2007 Hearing in Atlanta</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">On February 20, 2007, during a third master calendar hearing in Atlanta, the IJ set Zheng\u2019s final removal hearing for April 5, 2007 in Atlanta, Georgia. Zheng was present at the February 20 hearing, but his attorney was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">The IJ issued a written notice of the April 5 second hearing that advised Zheng that his failure to appear at the hearing may result in a removal order being entered in his absence if the government established that Zheng or his attorney was provided with notice of the April 5 hearing and Zheng was removable. The IJ orally advised Zheng of the contents of the notice in his native language. In this appeal, Zheng does not dispute that he knew the date and place of his removal hearing and has never claimed that he did not understand the possible consequences he faced if he failed to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Also on February 20, 2007, attorney Huang filed a motion for a telephonic hearing on Zheng\u2019s motion to change venue. The motion argued that both Huang and Zheng resided in New York City and that Zheng could not afford to pay for attorney Huang to fly to Atlanta for the hearing. The motion admitted the charges of removability in the NTA and stated that Zheng was seeking asylum and withholding of removal. During February and March 2007, there was no ruling on Zheng\u2019s motion to change venue or request for telephonic hearing on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">E. April 2-4, 2007</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">On April 2, 2007, attorney Huang renewed his request for a telephone hearing on Zheng\u2019s motion to change venue. Huang stated that he could not be present at Zheng\u2019s April 5 removal hearing because he would be in court in San Antonio, Texas on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">On April 4, 2007, the IJ denied Zheng\u2019s motion to change venue, stating no good cause had been shown. In a separate order, the IJ denied Zheng\u2019s request for a telephonic hearing on the motion and stated that the removal hearing was set for April 5, 2007 at 1:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-12\">On April 5, neither Zheng nor his attorney appeared at the removal hearing in Atlanta. The IJ entered a final order of removal <em>in absentia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-13\">F. October 1, 2007 Motion to Reopen</p>\n<p id=\"b804-14\">Zheng retained new counsel and, on October 1, 2007, moved to reopen his removal proceedings based on attorney Huang\u2019s alleged ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-15\">In a supporting affidavit, Zheng alleged that \u201cin the weeks and days approaching the April 5th, 2007 hearing in Atlanta I asked Attorney Huang what we should be doing to prepare for the hearing, and that he repeatedly told me not to worry about the hearing because he expected that venue in the matter would be changed[.]\u201d According to Zheng\u2019s affidavit, attorney Huang \u201ccontinued to make such assurances right up until a day or two before the hearing on April 5th, 2007.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>Then, on April 4, \u201cwhile at Attorney Huang\u2019s office [Zheng] spoke with Attorney Huang over the phone and that together with [Huang\u2019s] staff we found out that in fact the venue in the matter had not been changed.\u201d At that point, Huang\u2019s staff informed Zheng that Huang needed $5,000 to appear at the April 5 hearing and that Zheng \u201cshouldn\u2019t worry about his [attorney] appearing or not appearing.\u201d \u201c[B]y the end of the meeting [Zheng] was quite diswrought [sic], and fearful that [his] case was in trouble.\u201d When Zheng complained at the exorbitant fee, Huang\u2019s staff advised Zheng \u201cthat it didn\u2019t matter if Attorney Huang went to the hearing or not.\u201d Negotiations \u201cbroke off,\u201d and Zheng left Huang\u2019s office \u201cfeeling ... deceived and victimized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Zheng\u2019s October 1 motion to reopen admitted that Zheng did not go to the April 5 hearing in Atlanta \u201cbecause he was without guidance from his attorney as to how to proceed in his immigration action, and because he was fearful.\u201d And Zheng does not dispute that he knew that he still needed to attend the April 5 hearing. The IJ denied Zheng\u2019s motion to reopen. The BIA remanded for the IJ to make more particularized findings. The IJ entered a second order denying Zheng\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Subsequently, the BIA dismissed Zheng\u2019s appeal. The BIA found that Zheng had notice of the removal hearing and does not challenge that proper notice was given of the April 5 hearing. The BIA also found that Zheng was informed by his attorney that venue had not changed and that Zheng needed to appear at the hearing. The BIA further found that Zheng\u2019s former attorney had not prevented Zheng from attending the hearing and had correctly advised Zheng that he should appear at the hearing. The BIA concluded Zheng had not shown that his former attorney prejudiced him. Zheng timely petitioned for review of the denial of his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">An alien who seeks to reopen removal proceedings following the entry of an <em>in absentia </em>removal order must demonstrate that the alien\u2019s failure to appear was due to \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d INA \u00a7 240(b)(5)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i). Exceptional circumstances are only those <em>\u201cbeyond the control of the alien,\u201d </em>such as serious illness or death of a family member. INA \u00a7 240(e)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">Ineffective assistance of counsel may be an exceptional circumstance only if the alien shows prejudice. <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir.2005). A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel may amount to exceptional circumstances \u201cwhen an applicant\u2019s failure to appear is due to his attorney\u2019s errant instruction.\u201d <em>Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1224, 1226 (11th Cir.2008) (concluding that alien showed prejudice where his attorney told him he did not need to appear at hearing and that case had been transferred to Tennessee); <em>see also In re Grijalva-Barrera, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 472, 473-74 (BIA 1996) (concluding an alien showed prejudice where the alien failed to appear because he was incorrectly informed by his attorney\u2019s staff that there had been a continuance and he did not need to appear at the hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen <em>in absentia </em>removal proceedings based on exceptional circumstances. <em>Montano Cisneros, </em>514 F.3d at 1226. \u201cIn this particular area, the BIA\u2019s discretion is quite broad.\u201d <em>Anin v. Reno, </em>188 F.3d 1273, 1276 (11th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>review is limited to whether the exercise of discretion was \u201carbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d <em>1148, </em>1149 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Zheng\u2019s motion to reopen because Zheng did not show that his own failure to appear at the hearing was the result of his attorney\u2019s errant instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">As recounted above, on February 20, 2007, Zheng\u2019s removal hearing was set for April 5, 2007 in Atlanta, Georgia. Zheng\u2019s attorney moved to change the venue to New York City, where both Zheng and his attorney reside. Although Zheng\u2019s attorney several times told Zheng he expected the motion to be granted, there was undisputedly no ruling forthcoming on the motion during February and March, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Rather, on April 4, 2007, the IJ denied the motion, and the attorney immediately informed Zheng the motion was denied, the hearing would occur in Atlanta the next day, and Zheng needed to attend. Although Zheng\u2019s attorney would not attend without an additional $5,000 fee, and Zheng balked at the \u201cexorbitant cost,\u201d the attorney\u2019s staff advised Zheng he \u201cshouldn\u2019t worry about his [attorney]' appearing or not appearing\u201d and that it did not matter if his attorney went to the hearing or not.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">Before this Court, Zheng admits that he knew he needed to attend. Yet Zheng did not appear at the hearing. Zheng also admits that he did not appear because \u201che was fearful\u201d and did not have guidance from his attorney how to conduct his immigration action.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">Unlike the aliens in <em>Montano Cisneros </em>and <em>In re Grijalva-Barrera, </em>Zheng has not alleged that his attorney told him that the motion for a change of venue was granted or that Zheng did not have to attend the hearing. Just the opposite occurred here. Both Zheng\u2019s attorney on April 4, as well as the IJ at three prior hearings, told Zheng he needed to appear.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In fact, Zheng\u2019s brief on appeal admits that his attorney told him he had to attend and that he shouldn\u2019t worry about his attorney not being present as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-13\">At the time that Mr. Zheng\u2019s counsel had informed him of the fact that venue had not been changed in his case, and that Mr. Zheng had to attend a hearing in Atlanta, Georgia two days later, Mr. Zheng attached an affidavit to his motion to reopen....The affidavit further states that Mr. Zheng was at his lawyer\u2019s office, which was located in New York, one day before the hearing, when his attorney informed him that venue had not been changed and that Mr. Zheng would have to appear at the hearing in Atlanta. Mr. Zheng\u2019s counsel then informed Mr. Zheng that \u2018... it didn\u2019t matter if Attorney Huang went to the hearing or not[,]\u2019 and that he \u201c... shouldn\u2019t worry about his appearing or not appearing! ]....\u201d (AR at 187).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AD4-\">The BIA concluded that, even assuming his attorney\u2019s performance was \u201cdeficient in certain respects,\u201d it did not prevent Zheng from appearing at his hearing. In other words, Zheng did not show the kind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>of prejudice that constitutes exceptional circumstances beyond Zheng\u2019s control. Given the record and Zheng\u2019s brief on appeal, we also cannot say the BIA\u2019s determination was arbitrary or capricious.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-10\">. Zheng\u2019s motion to reopen alleges that he paid Huang for his expenses to travel to the February 1, 2007 hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b806-8\">. Where, as here, die BIA issued its own decision and did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision or reasoning, we review only the BIA's ruling. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b806-9\">. In his motion to reopen, Zheng stated that his attorney did not attend the hearing because he \"had an obligation to another client in California on the same day.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b806-16\">. Zheng had attended hearings in Atlanta thrice before and he has not alleged, much less submitted evidence, that he did not have funds to travel to Atlanta.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b807-16\">. We do not address Zheng\u2019s argument that the IJ failed to make particularized findings on remand from the BIA. Zheng failed to exhaust this issue before the BIA in his second BIA appeal. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006). Furthermore, because the BIA issued its own decision and did not adopt the IJ\u2019s order, our review is limited to the BIA's decision. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
