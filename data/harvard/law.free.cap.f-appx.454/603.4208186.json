The ALJ ruled that Paglia established a <em>prima, facie </em>claim for occupational hearing loss and was thus entitled to a presumption in favor of compensability pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(a). Jones has not contested that determination. The ALJ further concluded that Jones produced sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption. The Benefits Review Board (the Board), however, reversed on that point, holding that Jones did not rebut the \u00a7 20(a) presumption, and remanded for resolution of remaining issues. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-16\">1. Jones contends that the Board exceeded its authority by reviewing the evidence <em>de novo. </em>The inquiry into whether an employer has produced sufficient evidence to rebut the \u00a7 20(a) presumption is, however, a legal judgment subject to plenary review by the Board. <em>See Haw. Stevedores, Inc. v. Ogawa, </em>608 F.3d 642, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>651 (9th Cir.2010) (citing <em>Bath Iron Works Corp. v. Fields, </em>599 F.3d 47, 54-55 (1st Cir.2010)). The Board therefore did not exceed its authority by reviewing the ALJ\u2019s decision <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">2. Jones alternatively contends that the Board erred in holding that Jones did not produce substantial evidence to rebut the \u00a7 20(a) presumption. To rebut that presumption, an employer must produce substantial evidence that is specific and comprehensive enough to sever the connection between an employee\u2019s disability and the conditions of his employment. <em>Id. </em>Where the conditions of covered employment aggravate or accelerate a claimant\u2019s pre-existing condition, the aggravation rule renders the last covered employer liable for the entire resulting disability. <em>See Port of Portland v. Dir., OWCP, </em>932 F.2d 836, 839-40 (9th Cir.1991). Thus, to rebut the \u00a7 20(a) presumption, Jones had to produce specific and comprehensive evidence tending to show that Paglia\u2019s covered employment did not cause or contribute to his hearing loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The Board correctly determined that the circumstantial and negative evidence produced by Jones, and relied upon by the ALJ, did not satisfy this standard. First, Jones\u2019s circumstantial evidence of alternative sources for Paglia\u2019s hearing loss does not respond to the \u00a7 20(a) presumption. The existence of alternative sources of hearing loss is not inconsistent with the proposition that the conditions of Paglia\u2019s employment contributed to his hearing loss. <em>See Cordero v. Triple A Mach. Shop, </em>580 F.2d 1331, 1335 (9th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Second, Jones\u2019s negative evidence\u2014the medical and audiological experts\u2019 testimony that Paglia\u2019s hearing loss might be attributable entirely to nonemployment-related sources\u2014is too speculative to rebut the \u00a7 20(a) presumption. <em>See Bath Iron Works, </em>599 F.3d at 56-57 (citing <em>Wheatley v. Adler, </em>407 F.2d 307, 313 (D.C.Cir.1968) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Third, that Paglia and his wife did not notice any significant hearing problems until several years after Paglia\u2019s retirement is not, by itself, sufficient to rebut the \u00a7 20(a) presumption. <em>See Swinton v. J. Frank Kelly, Inc., </em>554 F.2d 1075, 1084 &amp; n. 52 (D.C.Cir.1976); <em>cf. Pedroza v. BRB, </em>624 F.3d 926, 929 n. 2 (9th Cir.2010) (citing Swinton\u2019s explication of the rebuttal standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">In the end, the circumstantial and negative evidence, taken as a whole, cannot overcome the \u00a7 20(a) presumption. Jones did not produce any specific and comprehensive evidence severing the link between Paglia\u2019s hearing loss and the conditions of his employment (e.g., that Paglia\u2019s employment was not noisy). <em>Compare Haw. Stevedores, </em>608 F.3d at 650-51 (holding that an employer produced sufficient evidence to rebut a claimant\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>claim where the employer produced specific evidence that the claimant\u2019s job was not stressful).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">Because Jones failed to produce specific and comprehensive evidence severing the connection between Paglia\u2019s covered employment and his hearing loss, the Board properly held that Jones did not rebut the \u00a7 20(a) presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b626-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
