His surviving wife and children, Plaintiffs-Appellants, filed suit against the officers and their employers, among others, asserting claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and state law. The district court granted summary judgment dismissing various claims against appellees Mike Marshall, Travis Miller, Jeff Pittman, Jeff Morgan, and Anthony Mancuso. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b285-17\">The incident giving rise to this case occurred on November 1, 2007, in Lake Charles, Louisiana. At approximately 9:20 p.m., Cherie Norsworthy looked out her back door and saw Seldon Deshotels in her garage. Deshotels, a clinical and anatomical pathologist, had recently moved to Lake Charles for employment purposes and was living in the nearby Nelson Pointe apartment complex. Ms. Norsworthy did not recognize Deshotels, but assumed he was there to see her husband.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>opened the door and asked if he was \u201clooking for Greg,\u201d Deshotels \u201ckind of panicked\u201d and quickly exited the garage. Alarmed by Deshotels\u2019s reaction, Ms. Norsworthy went back into the house and yelled for her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">When Ms. Norsworthy told her husband what happened, he instructed her to call the police and then immediately left the house to look for Deshotels. Ms. Norsworthy contacted the Calcasieu Parish Sheriffs Office (CPSO). Mr. Norsworthy searched the neighborhood on his four-wheeler and eventually located Deshotels running toward the Nelson Pointe apartment complex. Norsworthy, a trained martial artist, caught up with Deshotels near the gate to the apartment complex, jumped on his back, and applied a choke hold that rendered Deshotels temporarily unconscious. Both men fell to the ground and Norsworthy released the choke hold. Deshotels regained consciousness shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">At about the same time, Jessica Cobb and two friends were driving into the apartment complex parking lot. Cobb testified that when they approached the gate, she saw Deshotels laying on his stomach and Norsworthy sitting on his back. Norsworthy yelled to Cobb that Deshotels had broken into his house and asked her to call the police. Cobb called 911 and was connected to the Lake Charles Police Department (LCPD). She told the 911 operator that a homeowner was restraining a man who broke into his house and that they were near the gate to the Nelson Pointe apartment complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Both CPSO and LCPD dispatched officers to respond to the incident. LCPD officer Jeff Pittman was the first law enforcement officer at the scene. When he arrived, Deshotels was sitting on the ground and Norsworthy was standing nearby. Norsworthy identified himself as the complainant and Deshotels as the burglary suspect. As Pittman approached the two men, Deshotels got up and began running toward Nelson Road. Pittman chased and quickly caught Deshotels, bringing him to the ground face down. Pittman straddled Deshotels\u2019s lower back and pulled on his left arm in an attempt to apply handcuffs. Deshotels resisted, pulling his arms down and underneath his chest. As Pittman struggled with Deshotels, CPSO deputies Mike Marshall and Travis Miller and LCPD officers Jeff Morgan and Kevin O\u2019Rourke arrived and began assisting. Marshall attempted to gain control of Deshotels\u2019s right arm and Miller placed his knee on Deshotels\u2019s right shoulder. Deshotels was kicking his legs, so officer Morgan crossed one leg over the other and pushed them down towards Deshotels\u2019s back. Officer O\u2019Rourke warned Deshotels to stop resisting or he would be tased. When Deshotels failed to surrender his hands, O\u2019Rourke conducted a five second \u201cdrive-stun\u201d tase to Deshotels\u2019s right shoulder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Despite being tased, Deshotels continued to pull his arms under his chest. O\u2019Rourke moved to Deshotels\u2019s left side and conducted another drive-stun tase to Deshotels\u2019s lower back. After the second tasing, the officers secured Deshotels\u2019s arms and applied handcuffs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">Once the handcuffs were on, Pittman and Marshall attempted to lift Deshotels <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>off the ground. They noticed that Deshotels\u2019s body was limp and that he was unable to support his own weight. At about the same time, LCPD officers John Thacker, Robert McCauley, and Larry Moss arrived at the scene. They observed Deshotels being dragged as \u201cdead weight\u201d in the direction of a police car. They noticed that Deshotels\u2019s face looked blue and that he did not appear to be breathing. Thacker instructed Pittman to remove Deshotels\u2019s handcuffs and lay him on the ground. The officers removed Deshotels\u2019s handcuffs, laid him on his back, and at some point, called an ambulance.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The parties dispute what, if anything, the officers did to assist Deshotels before the ambulance arrived. McCauley testified that Deshotels\u2019s tongue appeared to be blocking his airway. He stated that Moss held Deshotels\u2019s head while he used a pen to move Deshotels\u2019s tongue in an attempt to clear the blockage. Moss testified that he assisted McCauley until a paramedic arrived and was standing next to Deshotels.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Appellants point to the deposition testimony of Walter Siefford, an EMT/paramedic who responded to the incident. Siefford testified that when he arrived at the scene, Deshotels was lying on his back and a single officer, presumably McCauley, was attempting to pry his mouth open with a pen.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Siefford stated that the officer repeatedly asked him to help Deshotels. Siefford further testified that Deshotels\u2019s mouth was full of vomit and that there was vomit on his face and in the area around his head. McCauley, Moss, and Thacker all testified that they did not see Deshotels vomit and did not see vomit on or around Deshotels.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Deshotels was eventually transported to Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital where he was later pronounced dead. He was fifty-six years old. According to an autopsy conducted by the Parish Coroner, Dr. Terry Welke, Deshotels was asthmatic and had a blood alcohol level of .12. The reported cause of death was excited delirium. Appellants commissioned a second autopsy, which was performed by Dr. Collie Trant, a board certified forensic pathologist. Dr. Trant concluded that the cause of death was asphyxia caused by a misapplied choke hold, compression of the chest and abdomen during the struggle with the officers, and airway obstruction by gastric contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">Appellants filed suit on September 18, 2008, naming as defendants, among others, Marshall, Miller, Pittman, Morgan, and O\u2019Rourke, in their individual capacities, and Calcasieu Parish Sheriff Anthony Mancuso in his individual and official capacities. Appellants brought claims under \u00a7 1983 and state law for excessive force and for failing to render appropriate medical assistance. Appellants also brought \u00a7 1983 bystander liability claims, asserting that Marshall, Miller, Pittman, and Morgan are liable for failing to prevent O\u2019Rourke from tasing Deshotels.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">In opinions filed October 27, 2010, and January 4, 2011, the district court granted summary judgment dismissing Appellants\u2019 excessive force and bystander liability claims against Marshall, Miller, Pittman, and Morgan. The district court also granted summary judgment dismissing Appellants\u2019 official and individual capacity excessive force claims against Calcasieu Parish Sheriff Anthony Mancuso. The court denied summary judgment on Appellants\u2019 excessive force claims against O\u2019Rourke. The court also denied summary judgment on Appellants\u2019 claims against Marshall, Miller, Pittman, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Morgan for failing to render appropriate medical assistance. Those claims are currently pending before the district court. The judgments accompanying the October 27 and January 4 opinions were certified as final and appealable under Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">This court reviews the grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard used by the district court. <em>Hill v. Carroll Cnty., Miss., </em>587 F.3d 230, 233 (5th Cir.2009). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). \u201cA fact is \u2018material\u2019 if its resolution in favor of one party might affect the outcome of the lawsuit under governing law.\u201d <em>Sossamon v. Lone Star State of Tex., </em>560 F.3d 316, 326 (5th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Hamilton v. Segue Software, Inc., </em>232 F.3d 473, 477 (5th Cir.2000)). \u201cAn issue is \u2018genuine\u2019 if the evidence is sufficient for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hamilton, </em>232 F.3d at 477). In determining whether a fact issue exists, the court views \u201cthe facts and the inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Reaves Brokerage Co. v. Sunbelt Fruit &amp; Vegetable Co., </em>336 F.3d 410, 412 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\n<em>Section 1983 Claims Against Marshall, Miller, Pittman, and Morgan</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">1. Excessive Force</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The district court concluded that Marshall\u2019s, Miller\u2019s, Pittman\u2019s, and Morgan\u2019s actions to subdue and handcuff Deshotels were objectively reasonable and that the officers are entitled to qualified immunity from Appellants\u2019 \u00a7 1983 excessive force claims. Appellants argue that they have raised a fact issue as to whether the officers\u2019 actions were reasonable and that the district court therefore erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">Qualified immunity protects government officials \u201cfrom liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). To determine whether qualified immunity applies, the court conducts the two-part analysis set forth in <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001), <em>overruled in part by Pearson v. Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009). The court decides \u201c(1) whether facts alleged or shown by plaintiff make out the violation of a constitutional right, and (2) if so, whether that right was clearly established at the time of the defendant\u2019s alleged misconduct.\u201d <em>Pasco v. Knoblauch, </em>566 F.3d 572, 579 (5th Cir.2009). \u201cThe relevant, dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\u201d <em>Lytle v. Bexar Cnty., Tex., </em>560 F.3d 404, 410 (5th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151). If the answer to either of the two above questions is \u201cno,\u201d qualified immunity applies and the government official is immune from suit. The plaintiff bears the burden of overcoming the qualified immunity defense. <em>Bennett v. City of Grand Prairie, Tex., </em>883 F.2d 400, 408 (5th Cir.1989). After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pearson, </em>555 U.S. 223, 129 S.Ct. 808, courts have discretion as to which of the two qualified immunity prongs to address first.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">Turning to the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis, this court must determine whether the facts, taken in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>light most favorable to Appellants, show that the officers violated a constitutional right. <em>\u201c[A ]ll </em>claims that law enforcement officers have used excessive force\u2014deadly or not\u2014in the course of an arrest, investigatory stop, or other \u2018seizure\u2019 of a free citizen should be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment and its \u2018reasonableness\u2019 standard.\u201d <em>Bazan ex rel. Bazan v. Hidalgo Cnty., </em>246 F.3d 481, 487 (5th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 395, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989)) (alteration in original). To prevail in an excessive force claim, \u201ca plaintiff must show that he was seized and that he \u2018suffered (1) an injury that (2) resulted directly and only from the use of force that was excessive to the need and that (3) the force used was objectively unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ballard v. Burton, </em>444 F.3d 391, 402 (5th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Flores v. City of Palacios, </em>381 F.3d 391, 396 (5th Cir.2004)). Determining whether an officer\u2019s use of force was objectively reasonable \u201crequires careful attention to the facts and circumstances of each particular case, including the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\u201d <em>Graham, </em>490 U.S. at 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865. Courts must be mindful that police officers are often required to make split-second judgments \u201cin circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving\u201d and must evaluate an officer\u2019s use of force \u201cfrom the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396-97, 109 S.Ct. 1865.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">To support a fact issue, Appellants point to Marshall\u2019s deposition testimony stating that he was not concerned for his or the other officers\u2019 safety during the struggle with Deshotels and that he believed they could have handcuffed Deshotels without the use of a Taser. Appellants also point to Miller\u2019s testimony that he agreed with O\u2019Rourke\u2019s use of a Taser and that he would have used his Taser had O\u2019Rourke not done so first. Appellants further note that Deshotels did not attempt to strike or kick the officers and that the LCPD use of force report characterized Deshotels\u2019s behavior as \u201cempty hand defensive resistance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Appellants\u2019 evidence tends to focus on whether O\u2019Rourke\u2019s use of a Taser constituted excessive force, an issue not before the court. The relevant inquiry is whether Marshall\u2019s, Miller\u2019s, Pittman\u2019s, and Morgan\u2019s individual actions to subdue and handcuff Deshotels were reasonable under the circumstances. <em>See Meadours v. Ermel, </em>483 F.3d 417, 421-22 (5th Cir.2007) (holding that each officer\u2019s individual actions should be considered in determining whether qualified immunity applies). The facts show that the officers were responding to a burglary in progress, \u201ca crime normally and reasonably expected to involve a weapon.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Barnett, </em>505 F.3d 637, 640 (7th Cir.2007). When Pittman approached the scene, Deshotels immediately fled, and when caught, actively resisted Pittman\u2019s attempts to apply handcuffs. Marshall, Miller, and Morgan arrived to see Pittman struggling with a large, unruly suspect. (At the time of the autopsy, Deshotels was 5'10\" tall and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>240 lbs.) The officers repeatedly instructed Deshotels to show them his hands and to stop resisting. Despite the commands, Deshotels continued to resist the officers by pulling his arms under his chest. Though the officers had not seen a weapon on Deshotels, they had also not confirmed that he was unarmed. To secure Deshotels, Pittman straddled his back and pulled on his left arm. Miller kneeled on Deshotels\u2019s right shoulder while Marshall seized Deshotels\u2019s right forearm. Morgan folded one of Deshotels\u2019s legs over the other to stop him from kicking. In light of the above described circumstances, the officers\u2019 actions were objectively reasonable and they are entitled to qualified immunity from Appellants\u2019 \u00a7 1988 excessive force claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">2. Bystander Liability</p>\n<p id=\"A_z\">Appellants argue that Marshall, Miller, Pittman, and Morgan are liable for failing to prevent O\u2019Rourke\u2019s alleged use of excessive force when he tased Deshotels.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In support of these claims, Appellants rely on this court\u2019s holding in <em>Hale v. Townley, </em>45 F.3d 914, 919 (5th Cir.1995), that \u201can officer who is present at the scene and does not take reasonable measures to protect a suspect from another officer\u2019s use of excessive force may be liable under section 1983.\u201d The court determined that liability under \u00a7 1983 can attach when the bystander officer \u201chad a reasonable opportunity to realize the excessive nature of the force and to intervene to stop it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Appellants maintain that Marshall, Miller, Pittman, and Morgan had an opportunity to realize that O\u2019Rourke was going to tase Deshotels and to intervene and stop him.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">As discussed above, to overcome the officers\u2019 defense of qualified immunity, Appellants must show that the officers \u201cviolated clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Manis v. Lawson, </em>585 F.3d 839, 845 (5th Cir.2009). Exercising the discretion provided in <em>Pearson, </em>555 U.S. 223, 129 S.Ct. 808, we first consider whether the officers\u2019 conduct violated clearly established law. If the answer is \u201cno,\u201d the officers are entitled to qualified immunity and the court need not decide whether Appellants\u2019 facts make out the violation of a constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">For a right to be clearly established, the \u201ccontours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.\u201d <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151. \u201cAs we have held, pre-existing law must dictate, that is, truly compel (not just suggest or allow or raise a question about), the conclusion for every like-situated, reasonable government agent that what defendant is doing violates federal law <em>in the circumstances.\u201d Pasco, </em>566 F.3d at 579-80 (internal quotations omitted); <em>see also Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 202, 121 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>S.Ct. 2151 (\u201cThe relevant, dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\u201d). \u201c[Qjualified immunity operates to ensure that before they are subjected to suit, officers are on notice their conduct is unlawful.\u201d <em>Hope v. Pelzer, </em>536 U.S. 730, 739, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Thus, the inquiry is whether, under the law in effect at the time of the arrest, the officers could have reasonably believed that they were not required to intervene and prevent O\u2019Rourke\u2019s alleged use of excessive force. The answer to that question is clearly \u201cyes.\u201d The facts in <em>Hale </em>are significantly different from the facts in this case. In <em>Hale, </em>the plaintiff produced evidence that he was beaten by a police officer while the bystander officer stood by and laughed, making no effort to intervene. <em>Hale, </em>45 F.3d at 919. Nothing in <em>Hale </em>provided police officers \u201cfair notice\u201d that officers actively engaged in restraining a large, potentially dangerous suspect are required to intervene and prevent another officer\u2019s use of excessive force. <em>See Manis, </em>585 F.3d at 845-46 (\u201cIf the law at the time of a constitutional violation does not give the officer \u2018fair notice\u2019 that his conduct is unlawful, the officer is immune from suit.\u201d). Nor do Appellants provide any other authority, and we could not find any, supporting that proposition. Accordingly, the officers\u2019 actions were objectively reasonable in light of clearly established law and they are entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\n<em>State Law Claims Against Marshall, Miller, Pittman, and Morgan</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Appellants argue that the district court erred in dismissing their state law excessive force claims against Marshall, Miller, Pittman, and Morgan. In Louisiana, excessive force claims are analyzed under a reasonableness standard similar to that used to evaluate \u00a7 1983 excessive force claims. <em>Kyle v. City of New Orleans, </em>353 So.2d 969, 972-73 (La.1977). \u201cWhether the force used is reasonable depends upon the totality of the facts and circumstances in each case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 973. Factors to be considered include \u201cthe known character of the arrestee, the risks and dangers faced by the officers, the nature of the offense involved, the chance of the arrestee\u2019s escape if the particular means are not employed, the existence of alternative methods of arrest, the physical size, strength, and weaponry of the officers as compared to the arrestee, and the exigencies of the moment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given the similarity between these factors and thos\u00e9 used to evaluate \u00a7 1983 excessive force claims, we conclude that the officers\u2019 use of force was reasonable under Louisiana law for the same reasons the use of force was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Deville v. Marcantel, </em>567 F.3d 156, 173 (5th Cir.2009) (\u201cThese considerations are sufficiently similar to the <em>Graham </em>factors that our decision on this claim mirrors our decision of plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1983 excessive force claim....\u201d); <em>see also Winston v. City of Shreveport, </em>390 Fed.Appx. 379, 385-86 (5th Cir.2010). We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Appellants\u2019 state law excessive force claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">Appellants also argue that the district court erred in dismissing claims that the officers were negligent under Louisiana law because they \u201chad notice of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s intentions with regard to the use of his Taser and ... failed to take any action whatsoever to prohibit O\u2019Rourke\u2019s excessive use of force.\u201d Appellants\u2019 brief, however, provides no authority discussing bystander liability claims under Louisiana law or whether Louisiana law enforcement officers have a duty to prevent another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>officer\u2019s use of excessive force. Accordingly, that argument is waived. <em>See Kohler v. Englade, </em>470 F.3d 1104, 1114 (5th Cir.2006) (holding appellant\u2019s claim waived for inadequate briefing because it was not supported with any legal authority); <em>Salazar-Regino v. Traminski, </em>415 F.3d 436, 452 (5th Cir.2005) (holding that a claim supported by only one citation was waived for inadequate briefing), <em>vacated on other grounds sub nom. Salazar-Regino v. Moore, </em>549 U.S. 1093, 127 S.Ct. 827, 166 L.Ed.2d 660 (2006); <em>L &amp; A Contracting Co. v. S. Concrete Servs. Inc., </em>17 F.3d 106, 113 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201cSouthern cites no authority in its one-page argument on the attorney fee question, however, and we consider the challenge abandoned for being inadequately briefed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">\n<em>Vicarious Liability Excessive Force Claim Against Sheriff Mancuso</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">In Louisiana, sheriffs are vicariously liable in their official capacity for the torts of their deputies committed in the course and scope of employment. <em>Jenkins v. Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office, 402 </em>So.2d 669, 669 (La.1981); <em>Riley v. Evangeline Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office, </em>637 So.2d 395, 395 (La. 1994). Appellants argue that the state law excessive force claims against deputies Marshall and Miller were erroneously dismissed and therefore it follows that the vicarious liability excessive force claim against Calcasieu Parish Sheriff Anthony Mancuso was also erroneously dismissed. As discussed above, the state law excessive force claims against deputies Marshall and Miller were correctly dismissed by the district court. Therefore, there is no basis for a vicarious liability excessive force claim against Sheriff Mancuso. The district court\u2019s ruling on this issue is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judge dismissing Appellants\u2019 \u00a7 1983 and state law excessive force and bystander liability claims against officers Marshall, Miller, Pittman, and Morgan. We also affirm the dismissal of the state law excessive force claims against Sheriff Mancuso.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b285-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b285-20\">. The Norsworthys did not know, and had never met, Deshotels.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b286-6\">. With a drive-stun tase, an officer shocks a suspect by applying the Taser directly to the suspect\u2019s body.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b286-7\">. It is not clear when Deshotels's left hand was cuffed and under control. Marshall testified that Deshotels\u2019s left hand was cuffed and in Pittman's control before Deshotels was tased. O\u2019Rourke testified that Pittman cuffed Deshotels's left hand between the first and second tasing. Pittman testified that neither hand was cuffed until after the second tasing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b287-8\">. According to Siefford, seven to eight officers were congregated near the parking lot gate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b289-5\">. CPSO deputies Marshall and Miller were initially dispatched to respond to a trespass at the Norsworthy\u2019s house. As they were driving to the Norsworthy\u2019s, Pittman passed them in his patrol car with his lights and siren on. The dispatch informed the deputies that Pittman was responding to a burglary in progress at the Nelson Pointe complex. They assumed that their call and Pittman\u2019s were related and decided to follow him to the apartment complex.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b290-5\">. As mentioned above, Appellants' \u00a7 1983 excessive force claim against O'Rourke is currently pending at the district court. There has been no determination whether O'Rourke\u2019s use of a Taser constituted excessive force and we offer no opinion on that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b290-6\">. In support, Appellants point to testimony that Deshotels was verbally warned that he would be tased unless he stopped resisting. O'Rourke testified that before he tased Deshotels he told him \"stop resisting or I\u2019m going to deploy the Taser on you.\u201d Marshall testified that O'Rourke said \"Taser, Taser, Taser,\u201d before he tased Deshotels. Brady Hendrix, an eyewitness, testified that he heard an officer tell Deshotels \"if you keep moving, you will get tased.\u201d Appellants argue that if these warnings were sufficient for Deshotels to cease straggling and avoid being tased, they were also sufficient to alert the officers that O'Rourke planned to use his Taser and to do something to stop him.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
