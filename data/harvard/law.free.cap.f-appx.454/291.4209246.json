(\u201cMicrotherm\u201d) (Puget, ASRC, and Microtherm will be collectively referred to as \u201cAppellants\u201d). Following our affirmance and remand on the first (interlocutory) appeal of this case, <em>Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Puget Plastics Corp., </em>532 F.3d 398 (5th Cir.2008) (hereinafter <em>Puget I), </em>the district court conducted a bench trial on the issues outlined in <em>Puget I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The district court explained <em>Puget I </em>as follows: \u201cIn essence, the Fifth Circuit simplified the entire \u201coccurrence\u201d definition into three specific \u201cnon-occurrence\u201d scenarios .... Puget\u2019s deliberate actions are not an \u201coccurrence\u201d if: (1) the injury to Microtherm was highly probable, (2) Puget intended or expected the injury inflicted on Microtherm, or (3) Puget committed an intentional tort, in which case the intent to harm Microtherm would be presumed.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Puget Plastics Corp., </em>649 F.Supp.2d 613, 630 (S.D.Tex.2009). After an exhaustive discussion of the facts, the district court concluded that the injury to Microtherm as a result of Puget\u2019s deliberate actions was \u201chighly probable,\u201d and, therefore, did not constitute an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy as defined by <em>Puget I. Id. </em>at 645-46. Alternatively, the court determined that Microtherm and Puget failed to present evidence upon which the court could base an allocation of damages awarded by the jury verdict in the underlying liability case between covered and uncovered damages. <em>Id. </em>at 647-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">We have carefully considered the pertinent portions of the record, the parties\u2019 briefs,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the district court\u2019s opinions,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the oral arguments made to this panel in light of <em>Puget I. </em>For substantially the same reasons as those set forth in the district court\u2019s careful and thorough original opinion, 649 F.Supp.2d at 629-31 and 645-46, we find no error warranting reversal in its determination of the occurrence issue applying <em>Puget I. </em>Accordingly, we do not reach the second issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b315-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b315-8\">. After oral argument, Appellants filed a Rule 28j letter to alert us to the recent decision in <em>Mid-Continent Casualty Co. v. Brock, </em>451 Fed.Appx. 335, 2011 WL 4807715 (5th Cir. Oct. 11, 2011) (unpublished). That unpublished opinion does not support Appellants\u2019 position here. In that case, the district court granted summary judgment for the insurer, concluding that the jury\u2019s finding of \"knowingly\u201d and \u201cintentionally\u201d under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act in the underlying liability-case meant that there could be no \"occurrence\u201d as a matter of law. <em>Puget I </em>addressed the interlocutory appeal of the district court's denial of National Union's motion urging a similar conclusion in this case. Thereafter, the district court conducted a trial and faithfully applied <em>Puget I. Brock </em>is inapposite here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b315-14\">. The district court\u2019s opinion regarding Appellants\u2019 motion for new trial is published at <em>National Union Fire Insurance v. Puget Plastics Corp., </em>735 F.Supp.2d 650 (S.D.Tex.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
