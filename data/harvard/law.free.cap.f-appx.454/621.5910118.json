We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-22\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. The IJ identified specific inconsistencies in Kapoor\u2019s testimony and the medical documents he presented that relate to the injuries and incidents of persecution at the heart of his claims. <em>See Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 938 (9th Cir.2000). In the absence of credible evidence, Kapoor has failed to show eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-23\">Because Kapoor\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony the agency found not credible, substantial evidence also supports denial of relief under the CAT. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b643-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
