For the following reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Diggs filed a complaint in the District Court seeking review of the Social Security Commissioner\u2019s final determination disallowing her claim for disability benefits. She originally applied for disability insurance benefits on April 20, 2005, claiming a disability that resulted from a series of injuries, beginning with those that she sustained when she fell in a drainage ditch while shoveling snow on December 6, 2002.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) denied her claims and thereafter denied reconsideration. Diggs was granted a hearing before an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), who determined that Diggs was not disabled. The SSA Appeals Council declined to review the ALJ\u2019s decision, and Diggs filed suit in the District Court. The District Court granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion to remand for further administrative proceedings, specifically to determine whether any work-related functional limitations might be due to Diggs\u2019 obesity.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">Diggs appeared with counsel and testified at a supplemental hearing before an ALJ. After considering Diggs\u2019 testimony, updated medical evidence, and the testimony of an impartial vocational expert, the ALJ again determined that Diggs was not disabled. In making this decision, the ALJ applied the five-step sequential evaluation process for determining disability. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a) and \u00a7 416.920(a); <em>Jones v. Barnhart, </em>364 F.3d 501, 503 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-13\">Diggs thereafter filed the current complaint in the District Court. On June 15, 2011, the District Court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision, determining that the ALJ relied on substantial evidence to determine that Diggs was not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-14\">Diggs now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-16\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of the Commissioner\u2019s final decision is limited to determining whether it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Poulos v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>474 F.3d 88, 91 (3d Cir.2007). Substantial evidence \u201cdoes not mean a large or considerable amount of evidence, but rather such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Hartranft v. Apfel, </em>181 F.3d 358, 360 (3d Cir.1999) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-17\">To establish a disability under the Social Security Act, a- claimant must show an \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). A claimant is considered to be disabled \u201conly if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A). The SSA has promulgated regulations prescribing a five-step process for evaluating whether a claimant is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520. We have described this process as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-4\">In step one, the Commissioner must determine whether the claimant is currently engaging in substantial gainful activity. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a). If a claimant is found to be engaged in such activity, the claim will be denied. <em>Bowen v. Yuckert, </em>482 U.S. 137, 140, 107 S.Ct. 2287, 96 L.Ed.2d 119 (1987). In step two, the Commissioner must determine whether the claimant is suffering from a severe impairment. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(c). If the claimant fails to show that her impairments are \u201csevere,\u201d she is ineligible for benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">In step three, the Commissioner compares the medical evidence of the claimant\u2019s impairment to a list of impairments presumed severe enough to preclude any gainful work. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(d). If a claimant does not suffer from a listed impairment or its equivalent, the analysis proceeds to steps four and five. Step four requires the ALJ to consider whether claimant retains the residual functional capacity to perform her past relevant work. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(d). The claimant bears the burden of demonstrating an inability to return to her past relevant work. <em>Adorno v. Shalala, </em>40 F.3d 43, 46 (3d Cir.1994).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">If a claimant is unable to resume her occupation, the evaluation moves to the final step. At this stage, the burden of production shifts to the Commissioner, who must demonstrate that the claimant is capable of performing other available work in order to deny a claim of disability. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(f). The Commissioner must show there are other jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy, which the claimant can perform, consistent with her medical impairments, age, education, past work experience, and residual functional capacity. The ALJ must analyze the cumulative effect of all the claimant\u2019s impairments in determining whether she is capable of performing work and is not disabled. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1523.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-9\"><em>Plummer v. Apfel, </em>186 F.3d 422, 428 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">In this case, the ALJ properly conducted the five-step inquiry, concluding that Diggs was not eligible for disability benefits. First, the ALJ found that Diggs satisfied the insured status requirement of the Social Security Act through March 31, 2007. It then determined that she satisfied steps one and two, finding that she had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since December 6, 2002, and that her osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain, and morbid obesity constituted \u201csevere impairments.\u201d As to step three, the ALJ determined that Diggs did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that meets or medically equals a \u201clisted impairment,\u201d even when considering her obesity in conjunction with her other impairments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In evaluating whether Diggs satisfied step four, the ALJ first determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>that she had the residual functional capacity to, among other things, sit for eight hours in an eight-hour workday with normal and customary breaks; to stand and/or walk for one hour continuously, for a total of six hours in an eight-hour workday; and that she could lift 50 pounds occasionally and 25 pounds frequently. After examining the evidence, the ALJ determined that Diggs\u2019 \u201cmedically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to cause some of the alleged symptoms,\u201d but that Diggs\u2019 \u201cstatements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms are not entirely credible.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The ALJ then determined that Diggs was capable of performing past relevant work as a computer programmer, and that she was not disabled as it is defined in the Social Security Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The District Court issued a thorough and well-reasoned opinion concluding that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. We agree with the District Court, and will therefore adopt its reasoning. The ALJ properly weighed the relevant evidence and adequately conducted the five-step evaluation to reach its decision. <em>See Plummer, </em>186 F.3d at 428. As the District Court explained, the ALJ\u2019s assessments were consistent with the evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">We have considered Diggs\u2019 remaining arguments on appeal and conclude that they are without merit. Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-9\">. Diggs also asserted that she was injured: (1) in January 2003, when someone grabbed her while she was in a prayer line at church; (2) in September 2004, when a boy ran into her while they were playing basketball; (3) in October 2004, when her supervisor hugged and rocked her while introducing her as a new employee; (4) in December 2004, when she fell at UPS; (5) in June 2005, when she hit her head at a playground; and (6) in July 2005, when her hair was pulled at a hair salon. Diggs also asserted that she gained a significant amount of weight due to injections she took to control endometriosis. On August 28, 2005, Diggs weighed 273 pounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b104-6\">. Qualifying impairments are listed at 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P. App'x 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b105-7\">. To the extent that Diggs challenges the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination, we agree with the District Court that the ALJ\u2019s credibility finding was fully explained and supported by substantial evidence. <em>See, e.g., Hartranft, </em>181 F.3d at 363 (holding that the ALJ properly evaluated credibility where he \"cited specific instances where [claimant's] complaints about pain and other subjective symptoms were inconsistent with\" the objective medical evidence of record). Here, the ALJ stated that the \u201cobjective medical evidence simply does not support the extent of [Diggs\u2019] subjective complaints.\u201d The AU then gave numerous reasons for this determination, including that Diggs\u2019 treating physician found \"no significant abnormalities of [Diggs\u2019] spinal processes or major joints.\u201d The ALJ appropriately determined that this as well as other reports did not support Diggs' allegation that \"she can sit for only 90 minutes, stand for only 30 minutes, and use her hands for writing and related tasks for only 15 minutes in the course of an 8-hour workday.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
