LUDINGTON, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b448-22\">Virginia Hauf, the mother of a child diagnosed with brain cancer, purchased shark cartilage supplements from the Life Extension Foundation. Several years later, Hauf contacted the Foundation and offered to endorse its products. The Foundation sent her a proposed \u201cTestimonial\u201d and a \u201cStandard Release of Testimonials &amp; Photos.\u201d Hauf revised the proposed testimonial and returned it to the Foundation. She also signed and returned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>the release, which provides that Hauf grants the Foundation the \u201cirrevocable right\u201d to use her \u201cname (or any fictional name)\u201d and her image \u201cin all manners, including composite or distorted representations, for advertising, trade, or any other legal purposes.\u201d It further provides that Hauf releases \u201cany right to inspect or approve the finished product, including written copy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">After the Foundation ascribed a variety of testimonials to Hauf, she brought suit alleging false endorsement, false advertising, and misappropriation of name and likeness under the Lanham Act, the Michigan Consumer Protection Act, and Michigan common law. Based on the unambiguous language of the release, the district court summarily dismissed all of Haufs claims. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Virginia Hauf, formerly Virginia Gorka, is the mother of Stephen Barrow. As a child, Barrow was diagnosed with brain cancer; doctors found a tumor in the base of his brain in 1991. After Barrow underwent surgery to remove the tumor, Hauf sought alternative treatments for her son. In May 1991, mother and son traveled from Michigan, where they resided, to Mexico for \u201cimmune augmentative therapy.\u201d Hauf also started providing her son with shark cartilage supplements.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">In 1993, Hauf contacted the Foundation to purchase shark cartilage supplements. The Foundation, a non-profit Florida corporation, supports itself through membership dues, donations, and royalties from products sold through its \u201cLife Extension Buyers\u2019 Club.\u201d One of its founders, William Faloon, spoke with Hauf about why she was placing the order. After learning her reasons, Faloon asked Hauf whether she would be willing to publish a letter to-the editor in the <em>Life Extension Magazine </em>recounting her son\u2019s story. Hauf agreed. In 1994, Hauf stopped purchasing shark cartilage from the Foundation; she has not purchased any since. Haufs letter to the editor was published in 1994. Sometime later, she was asked and agreed to publish an updated letter to the editor. The updated letter was published in 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">In 2001, Hauf contacted the Foundation again and offered to endorse its products. She wrote: \u201ci would like to get with you on the life extension foundation, i feel your products are wonderful .... i would like to work out something with you in regards to recommending your products.\u201d A Foundation employee, Steven Stahl, faxed Hauf two documents, a proposed \u201cTestimonial\u201d based on Haufs earlier letters to the editor and a \u201cStandard Release of Testimonials &amp; Photos.\u201d Believing that the proposed testimonial contained several errors, Hauf crossed out inaccuracies (struck through below), interlineated additions (bracketed below), and faxed the following back to the Foundation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-11\">In my search for-a-way-to- save my son\u2019s life, someone referred-me to Life Extension</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-12\">The People at your organization supported my search\u2014for--different treatment-regimens we could try. My thirteen year old son was diagnosed with brain cancer (astrocytoma grade 3) on January 21, 1991, however, they were not able to remove all of it. I sent his records to Sloan Kettering, Mayo Clinic, and several specialists. I also sent his records to a world renowned brian surgeon and his reply was the same as everyone else, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but there is nothing more to be done. Besides radiation or experimental chemotherapy, this may only give him a little extra time. Just take your son home, make him comfortable, and love him for the remainder of his time.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Steve\u2019s prognosis was very grim, six months at the most. I started him on high doses of vitamin C, E, beta carotene, shark cartilage, garlic, selenium, and other nutrients and minerals. I found out about a clinic called the IAT West Clinic [Dr. Gustavo Andrade] which pioneered a treatment called Immuno Augmentative Therapy. Finally, I decided to take him to Mexico to undergo this type of treatment. Steve has been tumor free for the last year [0 yrs.]. Steve is doing very well. He is [was] back on the track team, wrestling team and football team ... Steve has no limitations at all [and leads a very productive life.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-4\">EPILOGUE: The tumor was eradicated completely within two [1] years. Steve has been free from cancer for the last 8 [9] years. The IAT West Clinic is listed in LIFE EXTENSION\u2019S Directory of Innovative Medical Clinics.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">These revisions were necessary, Hauf asserts, to accurately recount her son\u2019s story.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">In a phone conversation with Stahl, Hauf alleges, she also explained that she was supplying the testimonial for publication in a single issue of <em>Life Extension Magazine </em>arid that it was not to be used for monetary gain. According to Hauf, Stahl assured her that her requests would be respected and that she would be allowed to view and approve the testimonial before it was published. Hauf then signed and returned the following release:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-10\">STANDARD RELEASE OF TESTIMONIALS &amp; PHOTOS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-12\">I ... do hereby give LIFE EXTENSION FOUNDATION AND ALL ITS BUSINESS AFFILIATES, its assigns, licensees, and legal representatives the irrevocable right to use my name (or any fictional name), picture, portrait, digital \u2022image, or photograph in all forms and media and in all manners, including composite or distorted representations, for advertising, trade or any other legal purposes, and I waive any right to inspect or approve the finished product, including written copy, that may be created in connection therewith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-13\">I am over eighteen (18) years of age and have read the above release and authorization prior to its execution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-14\">Instead of being published in a single issue of <em>Life Extension Magazine, </em>the testimonial was published more than forty times in various Foundation materials between 2001 and 2005. Its language was modified as well. For example, the following sentence was added: \u201cThrough your organization I found out about a treatment called Immuno Augmentative Therapy.\u201d Additionally, notwithstanding Plaintiffs striking through \u201cIn my search for a way to save my son\u2019s life, someone referred me to Life ExtensionTM\u201d and \u201cThe People at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>your organization supported my search for different treatment regimens we could try,\u201d these sentences were included in several versions of the testimonial. At Haufs request in 2005, the Foundation ceased publishing testimonials bearing Haufs name.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In 2006, Hauf and Barrow brought suit against the Foundation and Faloon, alleging several claims arising from the publication of the testimonials. Specifically, Hauf and Barrow brought: (1) a false-endorsement claim under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a)(1)(A); (2) a false-advertising claim under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a)(1)(B); (3) an invasion-of-privacy claim alleging misappropriation of names and likeness for commercial benefit under Michigan common law; and (4) a false-advertising claim under the Michigan Consumer Protection Act, Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 445.903(1). The Foundation and Faloon, relying on the release, moved for summary judgment. Hauf and Barrow likewise moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The district court granted the motion of the Foundation and Faloon and denied the motion of Hauf and Barrow, explaining: \u201cThe language of the \u2018Standard Release of Testimonials <em>&amp; </em>Photos\u2019 in this case is unambiguous.\u201d <em>Hauf v. Life Extension Found., </em>640 F.Supp.2d 901, 905 (W.D.Mich.2009). The parties then submitted, and the court entered, a stipulated order dismissing Barrow and Faloon from the litigation. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Farhat v. Jopke, </em>370 F.3d 580, 587 (6th Cir.2004). Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact as to an essential element of the nonmoving party\u2019s case. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). An issue of fact is \u201cgenuine\u201d if a reasonable person could return a verdict for the nonmoving party. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 </em>U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). The party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden to show that no genuine issue of material fact exists. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). After the moving party has satisfied its burden, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to set forth \u201cspecific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">Hauf enumerates nine assignments of error on appeal. Appellant\u2019s Br. 2-3. On inspection, however, only four distinct issues are identified: (1) whether the court erred in concluding the release is a \u201crelease\u201d rather than an \u201cauthorization\u201d; (2) whether the court erred in concluding that the scope of the release is unambiguous; (3) whether the court erred in concluding that the release authorizes the Foundation to modify the language of the testimonial without Haufs knowledge; and (4) whether the court erred in concluding that the release does not violate public policy. Each is addressed in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-15\">The district court correctly concluded that the document at issue, titled a \u201cStandard Release of Testimonials and Photos\u201d is, as its title suggests, a release. The document begins by stating in boldfaced, capitalized letters that it is a \u201cRELEASE.\u201d And it concludes, in the line immediately preceding Haufs signature, by reiterating that it is a \u201crelease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Hauf nevertheless disputes that \u201crelease\u201d means release. To interpret the meaning of a disputed term, this Court looks to, inter alia, \u201cthe plain language\u201d and \u201crelevant dictionary definitions of the term.\u201d <em>City of Wyandotte v. Consol. Rail Corp., </em>262 F.3d 581, 586 (6th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Kerns, Inc. v. Wella Corp., </em>114 F.3d 566, 569 (6th Cir.1997); <em>N. Am. Specialty Ins. Co. v. Myers, </em>111 F.3d 1273, 1278 (6th Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The plain language, naturally, must speak for itself. In pertinent part, it provides that Hauf grants the Foundation the \u201cthe irrevocable right\u201d to use her \u201cname (or any fictional name), picture, portrait, digital image, or photograph in all forms and media and in all manners.\u201d She further agrees to \u201cwaive any right to inspect or approve the finished product, including written copy.\u201d And the document plainly states and restates that it is a \u201crelease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AX5Z\">Turning to relevant dictionary definitions, <em>Webster\u2019s </em>variously defines a release as \u201ca giving up (as of a right or claim)\u201d and \u201can act or instrument by which a legal right is discharged.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1917 (unabridged ed.1993). Similarly, <em>Black\u2019s </em>defines \u201crelease\u201d as \u201c[a] written authorization or permission for publication\u201d and \u201c[t]he act of conveying an estate or right to another, or of legally disposing of it.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1315-16 (8th ed.2004). As noted above, the document at issue provides a written authorization for the publication of Hauf s name and image \u201cin all forms and media.\u201d And the document provides that Hauf releases \u201cany right to inspect or approve the finished product.\u201d The district court correctly concluded that the document is what it titles itself as\u2014a release.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">The district court likewise correctly concluded that the scope of the release is unambiguous. \u201cThe general rules governing the construction of contracts are applicable in the construction of written releases.\u201d 76 C.J.S. <em>Release </em>\u00a7 43. \u201cWhether or not a contract is ambiguous is a question of law properly determined by the district court.\u201d <em>City of Wyandotte, </em>262 F.3d at 585 (citing <em>Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians v. Engler, </em>146 F.3d 367, 373 (6th Cir.1998)) (applying Michigan law).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>\u201cThe court examines the contract as a whole, giving effect to all parts and language of a written agreement according to their ordinary and natural meaning.\u201d <em>Wonderland Shopping Ctr. Venture Ltd. P\u2019ship v. CDC Mortg. Capital, Inc., </em>274 F.3d 1085, 1092 (6th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing <em>City of Wyandotte, </em>262 F.3d at 585) (applying Michigan law); <em>see also Holland v. Trinity Health Care Corp., </em>287 Mich.App. 524, 791 N.W.2d 724, 727 (2010) (\u201cWe enforce contracts according to their terms, as a corollary of the parties\u2019 liberty of contracting.\u201d (citing <em>Rory v. Cont\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>473 Mich. 457, 703 N.W.2d 23, 30 (2005))).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u201c[A] contract is ambiguous when two provisions irreconcilably conflict with each other, or when a term is equally susceptible to more than a single meaning.\u201d <em>Trinity Health Care Corp., </em>791 N.W.2d at 727 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Coates v. Bastian Bros., Inc., </em>276 Mich.App. 498, 741 N.W.2d 539, 543 (2007)). \u201cThe rule of contra proferentum (construction of an agreement against its drafter) is used only when there is a true ambiguity and the parties\u2019 intent cannot be discerned through all conventional means, including extrinsic evidence.\u201d <em>Coates, </em>741 N.W.2d at 543 n. 3 (citing <em>Klapp v. United Ins. Grp. Agency, Inc., </em>468 Mich. 459, 470-71, 663 N.W.2d 447, 454-55 (2003)). \u201cIf the parties\u2019 intent is unambiguously clear from the language of the written agreement, the court must enforce the parties\u2019 intent as expressed in the writing.\u201d <em>Wonderland Shopping Ctr., </em>274 F.3d at 1092 (quoting <em>Birchcrest Bldg. Co. v. Plaskove, </em>369 Mich. 631, 120 N.W.2d 819, 823 (1963)). If the language is unambiguous, parol evidence will not be considered. <em>See Shay v. Aldrich, </em>487 Mich. 648, 790 N.W.2d 629, 640-11 (2010) (\u201c[R]eleases are generally treated as contracts under Michigan law and, thus, subject to the parol evidence rule, which prohibits the use of extrinsic evidence to interpret unambiguous language within a document.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">In this case, the scope of the release can be separated into three distinct parts\u2014the who, the what, and the how. The release begins by stating to whom Hauf is giving the \u201cirrevocable right\u201d: \u201cLife Extension Foundation and all its business affiliates, its assigns, licensees, and legal representatives.\u201d Next, the release states what the Foundation may use: \u201c[Haufs] name (or any fictional name), picture, portrait, digital image, or photograph in all forms and media.\u201d Finally, the release states how the Foundation may use Haufs name and image: \u201cin all manners, including composite or distorted representations, for advertising, trade or any other legal purposes.\u201d Moreover, the release provides, Hauf agrees to \u201cwaive any right to inspect or approve the finished product, including written copy.\u201d In sum, the release is unambiguous; its plain language provides that the Foundation may use Haufs name for advertising, trade or any other legal purposes, including in composite or distorted representations, without Haufs inspection or approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">Haufs arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. Hauf first argues that \u201cthe body of the \u2018release\u2019/authorization only refers to names, photographs and other images; it is entirely ambiguous whether that language also refers to testimonials.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 27. Hauf is correct that the body of the release does not expressly reference testimonials. It does not need to. The release provides that the Foundation may use Haufs name and image \u201cin all manners, including composite or distorted representations, for advertising, trade or any other legal purposes.\u201d One <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>manner of using her name and image is as a testimonial of a satisfied customer. Moreover, this may be the most logical use, as neither Haufs name nor her image has independent commercial value (Hauf is not a celebrity spokesperson, for example).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Hauf also argues that \u201cthere is no indication of exactly what legal right [she] is relinquishing.\u201d Contrary to Haufs assertion, the release plainly .states that Hauf grants the Foundation the right to use her \u201cname (or any fictional name)\u201d and her image \u201cin all manners, including composite or distorted representations, for advertising, trade or any other legal purposes,\u201d and that Hauf releases \u201cany right to inspect or approve the finished product, including written copy.\u201d Simply put, Hauf is relinquishing the advertising rights in her name to the Foundation. The scope of the release is unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The district court correctly concluded that the release authorized the Foundation to modify the language of the testimonial without Haufs knowledge. The release expressly grants the Foundation the right to use Haufs name \u201cin all manners, including composite or distorted representations, for advertising, trade or any other legal purposes\u201d and Hauf releases \u201cany right to inspect or approve the finished product, including written copy.\u201d Thus, under the release\u2019s plain terms, the testimonial Hauf faxed to the Foundation may be modified (or, in the release\u2019s distinctive diction, \u201cdistorted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Haufs argument to the contrary, that waiving \u201cany right to inspect or approve the finished product, including written copy\u201d does not authorize the modification of her testimonial, is unpersuasive. Hauf defines \u201ccopy\u201d to mean \u201cduplicate,\u201d the \u201creproduction of an original work.\u201d Thus, Hauf reasons, \u201cthe release only authorizes defendant to use plaintiffs testimonial and her testimonial alone.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 31 (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[I]nstead of reproducing a \u2018copy\u2019 of plaintiffs testimonial,\u201d Hauf concludes, \u201cdefendant fabricated a new and false testimonial and attributed it to plaintiff.\u201d Mat 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Hauf is correct that \u201ccopy\u201d may mean \u201cduplicate,\u201d among other things. In this case, however, the context in which \u201ccopy\u201d is used shows that it does not mean \u201cduplicate\u201d but \u201cadvertising copy,\u201d the written text of an advertisement. In construing a contract, \u201c[t]he court examines the contract as a whole, giving effect to all parts and language of a written agreement according to their ordinary and natural meaning.\u201d <em>Wonderland Shopping Ctr., </em>274 F.3d at 1092 (citing <em>City of Wyandotte, </em>262 F.3d at 585) (internal punctuation omitted). In pertinent part, the release provides that Hauf grants the Foundation the right to use her name \u201cin all manners, including composite or distorted representations, for advertising, trade or any other legal purposes\u201d and Hauf releases \u201cany right to inspect or approve the finished product, including written copy.\u201d Thus, under the terms of the release, Hauf gives the Foundation carte blanche in its use of her name for advertising. This means that the Foundation may use Haufs original testimonial as advertising, or it may modify the language and nevertheless use Haufs name, or it may create a wholly new \u201ctestimonial\u201d and ascribe it to Hauf, as long as its purpose is not illegal. And the Foundation may do all of this without Hauf inspecting or approving the finished product.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">Alternatively, Hauf argues, the Lanham Act categorically prohibits modifying the language of a testimonial. In support, Hauf cites a single case, <em>Facenda v. NFL Films, Inc., </em>542 F.3d 1007 (3d Cir.2008). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Her reliance is misplaced. In that case, John Facenda, \u201cknown by many football fans as \u2018the Voice of God,\u2019 \u201d signed a release shortly before his death in 2004 giving NFL Films \u201cthe unequivocal rights to use the audio and visual film sequences recorded of me ... provided, however, such use does not constitute an endorsement of any product or service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1011-12. The next year, NFL Films used Facenda\u2019s voice in its production of \u201cThe Making of Madden NFL 06.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1012. When his estate brought suit alleging the use constituted an endorsement of the videogame, the NFL raised the release as a defense. <em>Id. </em>at 1022-23. Considering the issue, the Third Circuit wrote: \u201cIn the contract, Facenda waived his rights with regard to any uses that were not endorsements. But if the Estate succeeds in proving the elements of its false-endorsement claim, such a finding by the District Court will demonstrate that the NFL\u2019s use of Facenda\u2019s voice was an endorsement, falling outside the contract\u2019s waiver clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1023. \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d the court explained, \u201cif the Estate\u2019s false-endorsement claim were to fail, meaning that the use was not an endorsement, the contract\u2019s waiver would apply to that claim. Thus, what falls inside the Lanham Act\u2019s prohibitions defines what is outside the contract\u2019s waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court\u2019s holding was based on the plain language of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Hauf, however, offers a different interpretation of the decision, writing: \u201cAs in <em>Facenda, </em>if defendants had only used plaintiffs actual testimonial then the release agreement may potentially act as a defense\u201d\u2014but, she argues\u2014\u201cif plaintiff in this case can show that the testimonials published by defendant were not the testimonial provided by plaintiff, then such conduct is not protected by the release regardless of its provisions.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 31. Contrary to Haufs assertion, <em>Facenda </em>does not stand for the proposition that a court should ignore the express language of a release. Rather, it stands for the opposite proposition. The release\u2019s express terms authorize the Foundation to modify the language of the testimonial without Haufs knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Finally, the district court correctly concluded that the release is not void as against public policy. Hauf is quite right that, \u201cas a general proposition, contracts in violation of statutes enacted to protect the public against imposition or fraud are void.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 33. The plain language of the release, however, does not violate any statutes; rather, its scope is expressly limited to \u201clegal purposes.\u201d <em>See generally </em>76 C.J.S. <em>Release </em>\u00a7 43 (\u201c[W]ritten releases will be construed reasonably and given effect according to their plain terms.\u201d). Moreover, the manner in which the release was used does not constitute fraud. Hauf herself concedes that the modifications were principally \u201cchanges to the verbiage of the testimonial.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">First, as matter of long-standing federal policy, \u201c[t]he general rule is that competent persons shall have the utmost liberty of contracting and that their agreements voluntarily and fairly made shall be held valid and enforced in the courts.\u201d <em>Twin City Pipe Line Co. v. Harding Glass Co., </em>283 U.S. 353, 356, 51 S.Ct. 476, 75 L.Ed. 1112 (1931), <em>quoted in FDIC v. Am. Cas. Co., </em>998 F.2d 404, 409 (7th Cir.1993). \u201cThe power to deny enforcement of contract terms on public policy grounds is restricted to those situations in which the contract would violate \u2018some explicit public policy that is well-defined and dominant, and is to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Am. Cas. Co., </em>998 F.2d at 409 (quoting <em>United Paperworkers Int'l Union v. Misco, Inc., </em>484 U.S. 29, 43, 108 S.Ct. 364, 98 L.Ed.2d 286 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\u201cIn defining \u2018public policy,\u2019 \u201d the Michigan Supreme Court similarly cautions, \u201cthe focus of the judiciary must ultimately be upon the policies that, in fact, have been adopted by the public through our various legal processes, and are reflected in our state and federal constitutions, our statutes, and the common law.\u201d <em>Terrien v. Zwit, </em>467 Mich. 56, 648 N.W.2d 602, 608 (2002). Moreover, the Michigan Supreme Court firmly defends the liberty to contract: \u201c[Ujnless a contract provision violates law or one of the traditional defenses to the enforceability of a contract applies, a court must construe and apply unambiguous contract provisions as written.\u201d <em>Rory v. Cont\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>473 Mich. 457, 703 N.W.2d 23, 26 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In this case, the release provides that Hauf grants the Foundation the right to use her name \u201cin all forms and media and in all manners ... for advertising, trade or any other legal purposes.\u201d By its express terms, the release\u2019s scope is thus limited to \u201cpurposes\u201d that are \u201clegal.\u201d <em>See generally In re SBC Mich., </em>482 Mich. 90, 754 N.W.2d 259, 273 (2008) (citing <em>Griffith v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>472 Mich. 521, 697 N.W.2d 895 (2005)) (\u201cAs a general matter, words and clauses will not be divorced from those which precede and those which follow. When construing a series of terms we are guided by the principle that words grouped in a list should be given related meaning.\u201d (internal punctuation omitted)); 11 Richard Lord, <em>Williston on Contracts </em>\u00a7 32:6 (4th ed. 1999 &amp; Supp. 2010) (\u201cThe ancient maxim <em>noscitur a sociis </em>summarizes the rule of both language and law that the meanings of particular words may be indicated or controlled by associated words.\u201d). The release\u2019s plain language provides that it extends only to \u201clawful\u201d purposes. Accordingly, Haufs observation that \u201ccontracts in violation of statutes enacted to protect the public against imposition or fraud are void\u201d is inapposite. By its express terms, the release limits its scope to legal purposes. And Hauf identifies no authority holding that a voluntarily executed release granting the use of an individual\u2019s name \u201cfor advertising, trade or any other legal purposes\u201d is contrary to public policy. The plain language of the release does not violate public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">Likewise, the de minimis alterations to the testimonial do not offend public policy. Hauf directs our attention to three additions, which she contends \u201ccreated false, inaccurate and misleading testimonials.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 16. They are: (1) \u201cIn my search for a way to save my son\u2019s life, someone referred me to Life Extension\u201d; (2) \u201cThe People at your organization supported my search for different treatment regimens we could try\u201d; and (3) \u201cThrough your organization I found out about a treatment called Immuno Augmentative Therapy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12-13 n. 4. None of these additions, however, regard the quality or efficacy of the products offered by the Foundation. They do not misrepresent the effectiveness of immuno-augmentative therapy, for example, or create a false impression regarding how the Foundation\u2019s products helped Haufs son.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>deed, they do not reference any of the Foundation\u2019s products. In sum, neither the language of the release, nor the additions that it in fact authorized, violate public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The district court\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-7\">. The surgeon who operated on Barrow on January 21, 1991, Dr. Mark Meyer, disagrees. He testifies that the surgery completely eradicated Barrow\u2019s tumor and that, moreover, he never told Hauf or Barrow that Barrow had only six months to live\u2014and when asked about Barrow by the Make-a-Wish Foundation, Dr. Meyer informed them that Barrow\u2019s condition was not life-threatening.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Dr. Andrade, like Dr. Meyer, similarly disagrees with Hauf's version of events. He testifies that he recommended radiation and chemotherapy for Barrow, that the mother and son rejected his advice, and that he never told them that Barrow had only six months to live if he did not receive treatment. Dr. Andrade also notes that Hauf did not show him the MRIs and CAT scans taken of Barrow following the January 21, 1991 surgery, which Dr. Andrade now agrees show Barrow \"was recovering a hundred percent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b452-5\">. The district court interpreted the document at issue under Michigan law. <em>See Hauf v. Life Extension Found., </em>640 F.Supp.2d 901, 905 n. 3 (W.D.Mich.2009) (citing <em>Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Co. v. Chicago &amp; N.W. Transp. Co., </em>581 F.Supp. 1144, 1149-50 (W.D.Mich.1984)). On appeal, neither party contests this choice of law\u2014indeed, neither party briefs the issue. As an aside, however, we note that the district court was correct. Because the case was brought pursuant to both diversity and federal-question jurisdiction, in the case of a conflict in choice of law, we would apply the choice of law rules of the forum state, Michigan. <em>See generally Trinh v. Citibank, N.A., </em>623 F.Supp. 1526, 1530 (E.D.Mich.1985) (holding that a court having both types of jurisdiction should apply the forum state\u2019s choice-of-law rules, thereby treating the case as one arising under diversity jurisdiction), <em>aff'd </em>850 F.2d 1164 (6th Cir.1988). Here, however, no conflict exists. Both federal common law and Michigan follow the <em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws. Compare Med. Mut. of Ohio v. deSoto, </em>245 F.3d 561, 570 (6th Cir.2001) (adopting <em>Restatement </em>as matter of federal common law), <em>with Chrysler Corp. v. Skyline Indus. Servs., Inc., </em>448 Mich. 113, 528 N.W.2d 698, 702 (1995) (adopting <em>Restatement </em>as matter of Michigan law). Thus, because the release does not contain a choice-of-law provision, the \"most significant relationship\u201d test applies. The place of contracting was Michigan, where Hauf manifested her acceptance. The negotiation, in contrast, took place \"on the cloud\u201d\u2014via email, fax, and phone conversations. The record is silent as to the place of performance. The subject matter of the contract, Hauf, is located in Michigan. On balance, Michigan has the most significant relationship to the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>tract, and so Michigan law applies to the contract issues before the Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b456-6\">. Indeed, any substantive misstatements regarding Barrow's story appear to have been made by Hauf herself. Barrow's surgeon, for example, testifies that the surgery completely eradicated Barrow\u2019s tumor and that he never told Hauf or Barrow that Barrow had only six months to live. Likewise, Dr. Andrade testifies that he in fact recommended radiation and chemotherapy for Barrow, but that the mother and son rejected his advice, and that he never told them that Barrow had only six months to live if he did not receive treatment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Dr. Andrade also notes that Hauf did not show him the MRIs and CAT scans taken following the January 21, 1991 surgery, which Dr. Andrade now agrees show Barrow \"was recovering a hundred percent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
