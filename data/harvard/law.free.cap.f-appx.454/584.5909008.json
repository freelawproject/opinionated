Falahee also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to remand this action, which Defendants removed from state court on the grounds that Falahee\u2019s claims are completely preempted by the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Removal of this action was proper because Falahee\u2019s state law claims are preempted by \u00a7 301 of the LMRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a). \u201cThe pre-emptive force of \u00a7 301 is so powerful as to displace entirely any state cause of action \u2018for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization.\u2019 \u201d <em>Balcorta v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp., </em>208 F.3d 1102, 1107 (9th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for S. Cal, </em>463 U.S. 1, 23, 103 S.Ct. 2841, 77 L.Ed.2d 420 (1983)). A cause of action is not preempted by the LMRA only if it depends on a personal right conferred entirely by state law <em>and </em>the vindication of the right does not depend on analyzing the collective bargaining agreement. <em>See Burnside v. Kiewit Pac. Corp., </em>491 F.3d 1053, 1059 (9th Cir.2007). Plaintiffs estoppel and emotional distress claims depend on the terms of the CBA, and Plaintiffs failure to adequately plead a recognized public policy means there was no error in the district court\u2019s holding that aspect of Plaintiffs complaint also preempted. <em>See Shane v. Greyhound Lines, Inc., </em>868 F.2d 1057, 1062-63 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">\u201cPrior to bringing suit, an employee seeking to vindicate personal rights under a collective bargaining agreement must first attempt to exhaust any mandatory or exclusive grievance procedures provided in the agreement.\u201d <em>Soremekun v. Thrifty Payless, Inc., </em>509 F.3d 978, 985-86 (9th Cir.2007). Section 17 of the CBA, sets forth a two-step dispute resolution process which there is no dispute was not utilized by Falahee. Accordingly, the district court properly granted summary judgment for Falahee\u2019s failure to exhaust.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b606-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
