Erickson, Chief District Judge for the U.S. District Court for North Dakota, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b586-8\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">Abimael Najera (\u201cNajera\u201d) was convicted of second degree murder in a California state court for killing Victor Hernandez (\u201cHernandez\u201d). He appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for habeas corpus. Certified for appeal is a single issue: \u201cwhether trial counsel was ineffective under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) for failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s multiple misstatements of the law of voluntary manslaughter.\u201d Najera contends that he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to object to the misstatements, that this prejudice denied him a fair trial, and that the California Court of Appeal\u2019s method of determining prejudice was contrary to <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>standard for evaluating ineffective assistance of counsel claims under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). We do not find his arguments persuasive.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-13\">Under AEDPA, Najera\u2019s petition may only be granted if the state court\u2019s adjudication of his claim (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland; </em>or \u201c(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>see also Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 70, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-14\">Here, the Court of Appeal\u2019s application of <em>Strickland </em>was not unreasonable. First, the court\u2019s factual determination that Najera was not entitled to the voluntary manslaughter instructions was reasonable. Our review is limited to whether the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision was unreasonable, not whether there was some support for Najera\u2019s argument. <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786-87, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011). Reasonable minds could conclude that the passage of time between Najera\u2019s argument with Hernandez and Najera\u2019s assault on Hernandez precluded giving a sudden passion or heat of passion instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-17\">Second, any harm from the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision that Najera was not entitled to voluntary manslaughter instructions is dissipated by the facts that the jury was given, and appears to have understood, the voluntary manslaughter instructions, including instructions for heat of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>passion and sudden quarrel. The jury\u2019s appreciation of the instructions is demonstrated by its inquiry during deliberations as to whether the reasonable person standard applied to the provocation, or to the defendant\u2019s conduct in response to the provocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Finally, Najera\u2019s arguments concerning counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s misstatements are not persuasive because, (a) the jury was given the correct instructions, (b) the jury was instructed that counsel\u2019s arguments are not evidence, and (c) the jury\u2019s inquiry during deliberations as to the application of the reasonable person standard demonstrates that the jury was not misled by the alleged misstatements.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Because Najera has not shown that the California Court of Appeal erred in concluding that he was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s misstatements under <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, Najera is not entitled to relief under AEDPA. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>see also Andrade, </em>538 U.S. at 70, 123 S.Ct. 1166; <em>Richter, </em>131 S.Ct. at 786-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b586-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
