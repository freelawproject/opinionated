SMITH, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b609-25\"> The panel unanimously concludes this case is suitable for decision without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b609-21\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-22\">The Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirmed the immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d)\u2019s rejection of Yong Zhong Zheng\u2019s applications for asylum and withholding of removal because his testimony was not credible.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The facts are known to the parties; we do not repeat them except as necessary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-23\">Because the BIA adopted the decision of the IJ pursuant to <em>Matter of Burbano, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 872 (BIA 1994) without including any independent analysis, we \u201clook through the BIA\u2019s decision and treat the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency decision.\u201d <em>Tamang v. Holder, </em>598 F.3d 1083, 1088 (9th Cir.2010); <em>see also Joseph v. Holder, </em>600 F.3d 1235, 1239-40 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-24\">The IJ applied the appropriate preREAL ID Act standard to determine Zheng\u2019s credibility. <em>Cf. Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039 (9th Cir.2010). As such, we will uphold the IJ\u2019s credibility finding even if \u201csome of the factors the IJ relied upon are either unsupported or irrelevant, so long as one of the identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>grounds is supported by substantial evidence and goes to the heart of [Zheng\u2019s] claim of persecution.\u201d <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 964 (9th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">During his prolonged journey through the U.S. immigration system, Zheng provided at least four different accounts of why he left China. These inconsistencies in \u201ctestimony about the events leading up to [Zheng\u2019s] departure\u201d go to the heart of his claim as they \u201crelate to the basis for his alleged fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Li, </em>378 F.3d at 960, 962-63. Zheng was given the opportunity to which he was entitled to explain these inconsistencies. <em>Soto-Olarte v. Holder, </em>555 F.3d 1089, 1092 (9th Cir.2009). However, the IJ\u2019s rejection of his explanation was supported by substantial evidence and represented \u201ca legitimate application of common sense.\u201d <em>Jibril v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 1129, 1135 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Without \u201ccandid, credible and sincere testimony,\u201d Zheng failed to show his eligibility for either asylum, <em>Mejia-Paiz v. INS, </em>111 F.3d 720, 723 (9th Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks omitted) or withholding of removal, <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"A92\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A9n\">. Because Zheng waived his claim for protection under the U.N. Convention Against Torture before the IJ, it is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AWM\">. Zheng\u2019s removal during the pendency of this appeal does not render his case moot because he is ineligible to return to the United States for a period of time. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9); <em>see also Zegarra-Gomez v. INS, </em>314 F.3d 1124, 1127 (9th Cir.2003) (discussing the collateral consequences exception to mootness),</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
