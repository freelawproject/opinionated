We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">The BIA denied Garcia\u2019s application for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver, because he was convicted after a jury trial for the sale/transportation of cocaine base. The BIA did not err in finding Garcia statutorily ineligible for relief. Garcia did not demonstrate objective reliance on the now-repealed \u00a7 212(c), when he rejected a plea agreement and elected to have a jury trial. <em>See INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 325-26, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001); <em>Armendariz-Montoya v. Sonchik, </em>291 F.3d 1116, 1121-22 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201cUnlike aliens who pleaded guilty, aliens who elected a jury trial cannot plausibly claim that they would have acted any differently if they had known about [the enactment of Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA)] \u00a7 440(d).\u201d). Garcia was charged with seven separate violations of California law (five of which were felonies) and an enhancement under California Penal Code \u00a7 12022(c). If convicted, he could have received more than five years imprisonment. At the time of Garcia\u2019s criminal proceedings, the relevant law required that Garcia serve no more than a five-year term of imprisonment for an aggravated felony in order to be eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1994). Thus, Garcia\u2019s statutory right to apply for \u00a7 212(c) was unknown when he proceeded to trial. Garcia states that he went to trial, in lieu of pleading guilty, because (1) he thought he may be acquitted and (2) he hoped for a sentence less than five years. This statement does not suggest that Garcia \u201cwould have acted differently if [he] had known about the elimination of the relief.\u201d <em>See Hernandez de Anderson v. Gonzales, </em>497 F.3d 927, 941 (9th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks, alterations, and citation omitted). Thus, Garcia cannot plausibly claim that he relied on the availability of \u00a7 212(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">Garcia argues that international law prohibits family separation without due process, therefore his deportation would violate international law. However, that argument lacks merit. Congress clearly intended to preclude aggravated felons from receiving relief under \u00a7 212(c) when it enacted the AEDPA. <em>See Munoz v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 950, 958 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cIn enacting statutes, Congress is not bound by international law; if it chooses to do so, it may legislate contrary to the limits posed by international law, so long as the legislation is constitutional.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). In light of Congress\u2019s adoption of AEDPA and its clear mandate, Garcia has not pointed to \u201cany binding obligation under international law that has been violated.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number><em>Padilla-Padilla v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 972, 979-80 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Garcia also argues that international law entitles him to an individualized analysis concerning his eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief. This argument also lacks merit. Garcia was provided the necessary safeguards and hearings as required by the law enacted by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b658-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
