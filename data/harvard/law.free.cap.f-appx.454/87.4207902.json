Cushard pled guilty to receipt of stolen property in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2315.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As part of the plea agreement, the parties agreed that Cushard should receive a two-level credit for his minor role under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). At sentencing, however, the District Court denied that request and sentenced Cushard to twenty-four months imprisonment, followed by a three-year period of supervised release.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court also ordered him to pay $769,762.64 in restitution. Cushard appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">This appeal requires us to decide whether the Government breached the terms of its plea agreement in this appeal by taking the position that \u201cthe record in this case, including the relevant conduct, supported the district court\u2019s determination that Cushard was not less culpable than his wife.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 5 n. 2. It also requires us to decide whether the District Court misinterpreted the Sentencing Guidelines when it denied the minor role adjustment. Because we agree with the Appellant that the District Court appears to have focused only on the Appellant\u2019s relationship to the charged conduct, rather than all relevant conduct, we will reverse and remand for resentencing before the District Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-17\">Because we write primarily for the parties, we need not discuss the specific facts underlying Cushard\u2019s conviction or his wife Linda Cushard\u2019s related conviction of stealing funds in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314. It is sufficient to note that Linda Cushard stole \u201can astonishing amount of money\u201d from her employer, and this money was then spent by both Mr. and Mrs. Cushard for personal purposes. App. at 18, 35-36. Mr. and Mrs. Cushard entered guilty pleas pursuant to \u201cwired\u201d plea agreements.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A \u201cwired\u201d plea agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>has been described as one \u201cin which the agreement of one defendant is conditioned upon the similar agreement of another defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Vest, </em>125 F.3d 676, 679 (8th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Plea Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">The plea agreement expressly states \u201c[t]he defendant and United States agree that the defendant was a minor participant in the criminal activity and the offense level should be decreased by two levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b).\u201d App. 10, ECF No. 4, Plea Agreement \u00b6 11. The Government now argues that \u201cthe record in this case, including the relevant conduct, supported the district court\u2019s determination that Cushard was not less culpable than his wife.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 5 n. 2. After receiving the Government\u2019s brief, we directed the Government to respond to Appellant\u2019s argument that the Government\u2019s brief represented a breach of the plea agreement. The Government emphasizes that its argument on appeal addresses only \u201cthe specific claim of procedural error in applying the Guidelines\u201d and states that it \u201cstands behind its recommendation in the plea agreement and at sentencing that Cushard was a minor participant in the offense.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 5 n. 2. Cushard asserts that the Government is estopped on appeal from arguing a position that is contrary to the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">\u201cWhether the government\u2019s conduct violates the terms of the plea agreement is a question of law and our review is plenary.\u201d <em>United States v. Badaracco, </em>954 F.2d 928, 939 (3d Cir.1992) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). After reviewing the Government\u2019s supplemental memorandum addressing this issue, we are satisfied that it has not violated the terms of the plea agreement. Specifically, we note that the Government has never withdrawn its recommendation for a minor role adjustment, and we agree that under the terms of the plea agreement, the United States was permitted to argue that the District Court did not commit any procedural error in sentencing Cushard.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">Minor Role</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">Both parties agree that \u201cthe determination of the defendant\u2019s relative culpability for purposes of assessing the applicability of the [minor role] adjustment must be made on the basis of all relevant conduct\u2014 namely, all conduct within the scope of [U.S.S.G.] \u00a7 1B1.3\u2014and not simply on the basis of the elements and acts referenced in the count of conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Isaza-Zapata, </em>148 F.3d 236, 239 (3d Cir.1998). The parties dispute whether the District Court properly considered all relevant conduct, or whether it confined its analysis to Cushard\u2019s conduct that specifically related to his offense of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-13\">As this court has explained, \u201c[w]e employ a mixed standard of review when considering whether a defendant was entitled to a downward adjustment as a minor participant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237. This court exercises \u201cplenary review where the district court\u2019s denial of a downward adjustment is based primarily on a legal interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines,\u201d but \u201cwhere the district court\u2019s decision rests on factual determinations, we review for clear error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, Cushard argues that the District Court improperly interpreted the Sentencing Guidelines, so this issue is subject to plenary review. <em>See also United States v. Grier, </em>475 F.3d 556, 570 (3d Cir.2007) (en banc) (\u201c[T]his Court will continue to review factual findings relevant to the Guidelines for clear error and to exercise plenary review over a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>The Government argues that the District Court \u201cin its own words, reviewed the case \u2018from a big picture perspective\u2019\u2014a view that took in the full panorama of criminal conduct committed by both Cushard and the only other participant in the offense, his wife Linda Cushard.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 12. It further argues that \u201cthe district court followed this Court\u2019s requirement[ ] to carefully compare Cushard\u2019s culpability in receiving the stolen funds to the culpability of his wife in both stealing and receiving them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Careful review of the transcript, however, reveals that the District Court failed to recognize that \u201c \u00a7 3B1.2 is ultimately concerned with the defendant\u2019s relative culpability.\u201d <em>See Isaza-Zapata, </em>148 F.3d at 239. In explaining its reasons for denying the minor role adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2, the District Court stated, \u201c[wjell, you\u2019re talking about degrees of culpability. I\u2019m talking about how could he be\u2014it sounds to me like this was an appropriate charge and that the charge itself takes into consideration his role in the offense and that there wasn\u2019t anything that was minor about it, if you consider this in the context of the charge.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> App. at 18-19. When the District Court explicitly stated that it was looking at the issue \u201cfrom a big picture perspective,\u201d it explained that the Court was \u201chaving some difficulty determining how [Cushard\u2019s] role was minor in the receipt of stolen property when, in fact, that is exactly what he did.\u201d App. at 18. The Court concluded by stating it did not \u201cfind [Cushard\u2019s role] to be minor, given the nature of the charge here.\u201d App. at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">It therefore appears that the District Court considered Cushard\u2019s relative culpability only in relation to the offense of his conviction, rather than his relative culpability (as compared to his wife\u2019s culpability) in the entire scheme to steal and use funds from his wife\u2019s employer. The Government articulated the distinction as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-10\">The minor role from our standpoint was intended to capture the fact that his conduct[,] in the scheme[,] looking at both pieces, the receiving and the actual front-end theft, was more passive than the role of his wife, who actively worked in the business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">App. at 18. As noted above, the District Court looked \u201cin the context of the charge\u201d but this court has made clear that the District Court is required to base its determination \u201con the basis of all relevant conduct\u2014namely, all conduct within the scope of [U.S.S.G.] \u00a7 1B1.3\u2014and not simply on the basis of the elements and acts referenced in the count of conviction.\u201d <em>Isaza-Zapata, </em>148 F.3d at 239. Counsel for Cushard noted that if the District Court just looked at the offense of receiving, then Cushard was a full participant in the receiving offense. He continued,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-12\">I think I understand the Court\u2019s position. But I think, Your Honor, I would look\u2014minor role guideline adjustment looks more broadly. The Court is looking just at the offense. If you just look at the offense of receiving, then I guess he was a full participant in the receiving. And that\u2019s what the Court is saying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-13\">But the actual guideline reads, A defendant was a minor participant in any criminal activity. I think you have to look at the broader criminal activity that took place, <em>which was the stealing of the funds and the using of the funds. </em>Since Mr. Cushard had nothing to do with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>stealing the funds whatsoever, he was a minor participant in the criminal activity-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">App. at 19-20 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">We recognize that the District Court has broad discretion in sentencing, but it appears that the District Court may have overlooked the need to consider all relevant conduct, rather than focusing only on the charged conduct. It does not appear that the District Court considered all relevant conduct when it denied the minor role adjustment for Cushard. Accordingly, we will remand this matter for resentencing to give the District Court an opportunity to reconsider the sentence in light of our prior authority and the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b110-12\">. The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231, and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b110-13\">. The Guidelines range without the minor role adjustment was 24 to 30 months. If Cushard had received the minor role adjustment, the Guidelines range would have been reduced to 18 to 24 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b110-14\">. Here, the Government has not argued that the error in interpreting the Guidelines was harmless. <em>See United States v. Hawes, </em>523 F.3d 245, 253 (3d Cir.2008) (\"As the party defending the sentence imposed, the government bears the burden of \u2018persuadfing] the court of appeals that the district court would have imposed die same sentence absent the erroneous factor.\u2019 \u201d (citing <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992))). Therefore, we must remand for resentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 254.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b110-19\">. Both Mr. and Mrs. Cushard attempted to enter guilty pleas, pursuant to wired plea agreements, to interstate transportation of stolen funds in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314, but the District Court did not accept Mr. Cushard's guilty plea because he was not able to admit sufficient facts to establish his guilt in light of the fact that he was not involved in the stealing of funds. Later, pursuant to wired plea agreements, Mr. Cushard entered a guilty plea to receipt of stolen funds in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2315 and Mrs. Cushard entered a guilty plea to interstate transportation of stolen funds in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b112-6\">. Notably, Cushard\u2019s conviction for receipt of stolen funds under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2315 carries the same statutory maximum and the same guideline range as his wife\u2019s conviction of interstate transportation of stolen funds in violation of \u00a7 2314.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
