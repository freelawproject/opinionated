We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AKd\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b478-17\">Plaintiff is the brother of William Scozzari, who was shot and killed in front of his cabin at the Lone Pine Motel in Clare, Michigan, in September 2007.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Scozzari was a rather small man (5'3\", 133 lbs.) of 51 years when he died. According to Plaintiff, Scozzari was hard of hearing and was blind in one eye, with diminished sight in the other. He frequently wore an eye patch, causing at least one neighbor to assume that he was blind in one eye. Scozzari was wearing a patch when he was shot, but it is unclear whether it covered his eye or simply pressed against his forehead. Plaintiff also alleges that Scozzari had a bad hip. The record contains no medical evidence to corroborate this assertion, but one neighbor observed that Scozzari walked with a limp and usually with a cane; another testified that Scozzari sometimes walked at a fair pace and sometimes just shuffled along.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-18\">The Lone Pine Motel is a collection of two-story buildings and stand-alone cabins offering overnight stays and extended lodging. Before his death, Scozzari had been living alone for several years in Cabin 17. The motel owner, Timothy Rynearson, had been Clare\u2019s Chief of Police, until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>2005. Rynearson described Scozzari as a short, disheveled man, a loner who \u201cstuck out like a sore thumb\u201d in this small town, and who typically wore unlaced boots and a winter jacket in the summer. Scozzari kept to himself, seldom had visitors and was generally averse to people; he preferred to go out at night, when there was no one else around. Scozzari was also a \u201cpack rat\u201d who loved to collect knives and hatchets, which he displayed throughout his cabin. However, Rynearson never saw Scozzari with a weapon outside his cabin.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Plaintiff asserts that Scozzari was diagnosed with schizophrenia in his mid twenties and had been hospitalized due to his illness in the past; however, he was not taking medication when these events took place. Neighbors described Scozzari as mentally challenged and somewhat of a hermit. A neighbor recalled that once, in response to a friendly wave, Scozzari gave him this look like he was growling or snarling or whatever and just looked away. The neighbor assumed from Scozzari\u2019s demeanor that he had some kind of mental disturbance. Rynearson testified that Scozzari communicated mostly by grunting, but added that he was not aware of any instance in which Scozzari argued with, yelled at, or threatened anyone. Rynearson recalled that everyone on the police force knew Scozzari when Rynearson was chief and that Scozzari was never in any trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Around 11 P.M. on September 18, 2007, Police Chief Dwayne Miedzianowski responded to a report that gun shots had been heard in a park adjacent to the Lone Pine Motel. While investigating, he noticed a man later identified as Scozzari coming around a nearby building and walking toward the motel. Scozzari carried what appeared to be a stick or a cane on his shoulder, a backpack<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a flashlight, which he briefly directed at Miedzianowski\u2019s vehicle. Miedzianowski radioed Officer Jeremy McGraw for assistance and stepped out of his car to speak with Scozzari. Miedzianowski asked Scozzari to drop the stick and to come closer, but Scozzari responded, \u201cFuck you, boy\u201d and continued walking. This reaction caused Miedzianowski to wonder if Scozzari was the armed person who had fired gunshots in the park.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">With Miedzianowski following at a distance, Scozzari proceeded toward the motel, looking back over his shoulder from time to time. Miedzianowski ordered, \u201cStop, police, put the stick down,\u201d but Scozzari again responded \u201cFuck you,\u201d and continued into the motel parking lot. Miedzianowski approached within ten feet of Scozzari and repeated his order; this time, Scozzari turned around, said \u201cFuck you\u201d and pulled the stick back in his left hand, as if intending to hit the officer. Miedzianowski backed up, took a position behind a nearby truck and yelled at Scozzari to drop his weapon. Scozzari lowered the stick, but again yelled \u201cFuck you\u201d and advanced toward Miedzianowski, who responded with pepper spray. Scozzari yelled, \u201cYou fucking want [sic],\u201d reached into his waistband and pulled out what Miedzianowski took to be a knife. Drawing his service weapon, Miedzianowski yelled back for Scozzari to put the knife away. Scozzari complied slowly, turned and walked into Cabin 17, closing the door behind him. At this time, Miedzianowski believed that he had been assaulted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Officer McGraw arrived at the motel a few minutes later. In his police report, McGraw noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\">The Chief informed me that he had just dealt with a male that had pulled out a possible cane and threatened him.... [Wjhen he spoke with the male he pulled out what appeared to be a cane, walked after him waving it and stating, \u201cDo you want to go boy?\u201d or something to that extent. The Chief ... took cover behind a vehicle to protect himself and the male walked away and entered cabin 17. The Chief stated he believed that the male possibly had some mental issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"As-\">McGraw did not mention that Scozzari pulled a knife on Miedzianowski, or that Miedzianowski pepper sprayed and drew his gun on Scozzari.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The Officers returned to Cabin 17; by their own account, they were now intent on arresting Scozzari. They positioned themselves on either side of the cabin entrance, McGraw to the right, within arm\u2019s reach of the door, Miedzianowski further away on the left. McGraw drew his taser and struck the door loudly several times, shouting: \u201cPolice, open the door.\u201d When the door opened, McGraw saw Scozzari a foot away from him, arms raised above his shoulders, with a military knife in one hand and a hatchet in the other. Both blades were sheathed, but Scozzari seemed to be fumbling with his hands to unsheathe the knife. Scozzari took a step toward McGraw, who backed up and fired the taser, apparently without effect; Scozzari turned back into the cabin and shut the door. Thinking he had gone to get more weapons, the Officers tried to kick open the door. The door opened, either under their blows or from the inside, and Scozzari appeared in the doorway, still wielding the knife and hatchet and still fumbling with the sheathes. The Officers backed up a few steps and ordered Scozzari to drop his weapons, but he yelled back: \u201cYou drop your weapons.\u201d Leaving the cabin threshold, Scozzari took a few steps onto the sidewalk in McGraw\u2019s direction. Fearing for his life, McGraw stepped back and tripped on a wooden barrier 12 to 18 inches high, between the sidewalk and the adjacent parking lot. McGraw landed on his back and tried to scurry backward, stand up and reach for his gun all at once; meanwhile, Scozzari continued to advance, stepping over the barrier with his hatchet now unsheathed. When Scozzari was within two to four feet of McGraw, Miedzianowski fired four shots at Scozzari from about ten feet away. Scozzari appeared to stop and turn toward Miedzianowski; at that moment, McGraw drew his weapon and fired seven rounds. Scozzari turned toward his cabin, took two or three steps and fell face down over the wooden barrier, still clutching the knife and hatchet in his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">Several motel tenants witnessed the incident; however, their accounts sharply contradict Defendants\u2019. Jason Miller, the person who initially reported shots fired near the motel, testified that he was standing in the parking lot when he heard voices yelling \u201cGet away, kid,\u201d \u201cknife,\u201d and other unintelligible words. Miller observed Miedzianowski running across the motel grounds and saw McGraw arrive shortly thereafter. The Officers conferred together briefly and, as they walked away, Miller heard Miedzianowski say, \u201cHe\u2019s going to jail tonight,\u201d and something that sounded like \u201cmental problems\u201d or \u201cmental issues.\u201d During the actual shooting, Miller stood facing Scozzari\u2019s cabin, about 40 feet away from the doorstep. He watched the Officers take positions on either side of the cabin, bang loudly on the door and yell, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>\u201cPut the knife down\u201d a dozen times. The door began to open and Miller observed Miedzianowski back away about ten feet; however, he lost sight of McGraw. The Officers resumed shouting, \u201cPut the knife down\u201d and the door stopped moving, but remained narrowly ajar. Miller heard a popping sound and saw a blue spark characteristic of a taser being fired, and the cabin door slammed shut. When it reopened, Miller heard a new voice say: \u201cPut your gun down,\u201d or \u201cPut gun down. Gun down.\u201d A male silhouette appeared in the doorway with his left arm extended in front of his body, holding something six to seven inches long. There was a volley of gunfire and Miller saw the man collapse. McGraw reentered Miller\u2019s field of vision as the Officers approached the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Wanetta Gibbons, a long-term motel resident, awoke to the sound of yelling voices. From her window, Gibbons had a sideways view of the front of Cabin 17. She observed two policemen facing the cabin and yelling \u201cDrop the knife\u201d at Scozzari, who was standing on the sidewalk in front his door. Scozzari had his arm extended in front of him, but Gibbons did not see anything in his hand. Scozzari took one or two steps forward, stepping over the small wooden barrier as he did so, and the Officers fired their weapons. Gibbons testified that Miedzianowski and McGraw were about 15-20 feet away from Scozzari when they shot him, and that they remained standing throughout the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Jeffrey Richardson lived in the cabin adjacent to Scozzari\u2019s. He heard loud voices, footsteps running toward Scozzari\u2019s cabin, a door being slammed or kicked open and a taser being fired. Through his window, Richardson saw two police officers 10 to 12 feet away from Scozzari\u2019s cabin, their guns trained on the doorway, yelling at someone to drop his weapons. From his vantage point, Richardson could see to the edge of the sidewalk in front of Scozzari\u2019s cabin, but Scozzari never stepped forward enough for Richardson to see him. Richardson saw McGraw trip slightly over the wooden barrier as he backed away from Scozzari\u2019s cabin. However, Richardson testified that McGraw did not fall and was standing for several minutes before the actual shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">Jeffrey Morgan II was visiting his girlfriend in Cabin 19, two doors down from Scozzari, when he saw a flashlight shine outside. Through a -window, he watched the Officers order Scozzari to come out of his cabin and drop his weapon. Morgan briefly caught sight of Scozzari before the taser was fired; otherwise, he did not see Scozzari or hear him speak. According to Morgan, McGraw deployed his taser and fired his gun from the same position, about 20 feet away from Scozzari\u2019s cabin. McGraw was standing throughout the incident and fired the first shot; however, Morgan could not see Miedzianowski due to his viewing angle.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">The Officers described the aftermath of the shooting as follows. When Scozzari collapsed, Miedzianowski radioed for an ambulance; however, in case Scozzari was faking injury, the Officers held back for a minute before approaching him. During this interval, McGraw heard gurgling sounds coming from Scozzari\u2019s mouth and observed his body shaking. After a minute had passed, Miedzianowski covered McGraw with his weapon while McGraw approached and removed the hatchet and knife from Scozzari\u2019s hands.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A large pool of blood had formed near Scozzari\u2019s mouth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>and neck; McGraw felt for a pulse and, finding none, rolled Scozzari onto his back and handcuffed his wrists over his chest. The Officers took no medical or resuscitative action until the ambulance arrived. McGraw testified that several people emerged from nearby cabins and that Miedzianowski had them observe the knife and hatchet in Scozzari\u2019s hands, but Miedzianowski did not recall doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Once again, the Officers\u2019 account contrasts with statements of other witnesses. From their room on the second floor of the main motel building, Jeffrey Morgan Sr. and his minor son heard a rapid succession of firecracker-like explosions. Morgan Sr. stepped out onto the balcony and saw the Officers, weapons drawn, standing about 20 feet from Scozzari and yelling at him to drop his weapons. Scozzari was lying on the sidewalk in a pool of blood, his head and arms near the door to his cabin. Morgan Sr. did not see any weapon in Scozzari\u2019s hands or elsewhere. One Officer then stepped over Scozzari\u2019s body, entered the cabin and returned with a knife and a hatchet, which he placed on the ground away from the body. The Morgans went back to their room for a few minutes and when they returned, the weapons were near Scozzari\u2019s head.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Jeffrey Richardson did not see McGraw or Miedzianowski go into Scozzari\u2019s cabin after the incident. He testified that shortly after the shooting, the Officers knocked on neighboring cabins, including his own, asking the occupants to observe the weapons in Scozzai\u2019i\u2019s hands. Scozzari was lying on the ground, his face almost up to the doorjamb. Richardson saw what appeared to be the butt of a hatchet in one hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Morgan and his girlfriend Sheryl Irwin were also called outside. Morgan testified that he saw a knife resting in Scozzari\u2019s left palm, which was facing up; the knife was unsheathed and appeared \u201coddly placed.\u201d Irwin also observed a knife, the placement of which did not seem normal to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">Scozzari was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. An autopsy revealed that he was struck by five bullets, all shot from McGraw\u2019s firearm. Two bullets entered Scozzari\u2019s body from the front, the others from the back. A ballistics technician testified that two bullets traceable to McGraw\u2019s gun entered the front wall of Scozzari\u2019s cabin at a slight downward angle, suggesting that McGraw was standing upright when he fired them.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">Plaintiff sued Miedzianowski, McGraw, the City of Clare and City Manager Ken Hibl in connection with Scozzari\u2019s death (the City and Ken Hibl are not parties to this appeal). Plaintiffs amended complaint alleges: (I) violation of Scozzari\u2019s rights under the Fourth Amendment (excessive force) and Fourteenth Amendment (deliberate indifference to a serious medical need), pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; (II) municipal liability under \u00a7 1983; (III) common-law assault and battery; (IV) gross negligence under Michigan Compiled Laws (\u201cM.C.L.\u201d) \u00a7 691.1407; (V) conspiracy to violate Scozzari\u2019s civil rights; and (VI) discrimination in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">Miedzianowski and McGraw moved for summary judgment on all claims against them. The district court granted the motion in part, denied it in part, and held other issues in abeyance. <em>Scozzari v. City of Clare, </em>723 F.Supp.2d 945 (E.D.Mich.2010). Relevant to this appeal, the court held the Officers were not entitled to qualified immunity from Plaintiffs constitutional claims. The court also ordered the parties to brief two new Fourth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>claims, which Plaintiff raised for the first time in response to Defendants\u2019 motion. Finally, the court granted summary judgment for Defendants on Plaintiffs state-law gross-negligence and civil-conspiracy claims. The district court later issued its ruling on matters held in abeyance by its previous order. <em>Scozzari v. City of Clare, </em>723 F.Supp.2d 974 (E.D.Mich.2010). The court held that Defendants could not assert governmental immunity from Plaintiffs common-law assault-and-battery claims, but granted summary judgment for Defendants on the new Fourth Amendment claims because they were not properly raised in the amended complaint. Defendants timely appealed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the denial of a summary-judgment motion based on qualified immunity. <em>Vakilian v. Shaw, </em>335 F.3d 509, 515 (6th Cir.2003). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, the discovery and disclosure material on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Estate of Smithers v. City of Flint, </em>602 F.3d 758, 761 (6th Cir.2010); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, Advisory Committee Notes (\u201cThe standard for granting summary judgment remains unchanged\u201d despite 2010 amendments to Rule 56). A court reviewing a motion for summary judgment cannot weigh the evidence or make credibility determinations. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); <em>Schreiber v. Moe, </em>596 F.3d 323, 333 (6th Cir.2010). Rather, the court must view the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986); <em>Biegas v. Quickway Carriers, Inc., </em>573 F.3d 365, 374 (6th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">Government officials may invoke qualified immunity as a defense only \u201cinsofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Pearson v. Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 231, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009) <em>(quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982)). To determine if qualified immunity protects a government official\u2019s actions, the Supreme Court prescribes a two-step inquiry: (1) whether the defendant violated a constitutional right; and (2) whether that right was clearly established.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001); <em>Morrison v. Bd. of Trs. of Green Twp., </em>583 F.3d 394, 400 (6th Cir.2009). Courts may \u201cexercise their sound discretion in deciding which of the two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis should be addressed first in light of the circumstances in the particular case at hand.\u201d <em>Pearson, </em>555 U.S. at 236, 129 S.Ct. 808; <em>see also Aldini v. Johnson, </em>609 F.3d 858, 863 (6th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">This Court has explained that in qualified-immunity cases,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">[s]ummary judgment ... is proper if the law did not put the officer on notice that his conduct would be clearly unlawful. However, if genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether the officer committed acts that would violate a clearly established right, then summary judgment is improper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-6\"><em>Vakilian, </em>335 F.3d at 515 (citing <em>Higgason v. Stephens, </em>288 F.3d 868, 876 (6th Cir.2002); <em>Poe v. Haydon, </em>853 F.2d 418, 425-26 (6th Cir.1988)). Summary judgment is also improper where the reasonableness of an officer\u2019s action depends on a disputed issue of fact. <em>Leonard v. Robinson, </em>477 F.3d 347, 355 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">A. Excessive Force</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Plaintiff contends that Defendants violated Scozzari\u2019s constitutional protections against excessive force. Defendants assert they are entitled to qualified immunity because their conduct was objectively reasonable and did not violate clearly established law.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">The Fourth Amendment\u2019s guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures protects an individual\u2019s right not to be subjected to excessive force in the course of an arrest, investigatory stop, or other seizure of his person. <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 394, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989); <em>Aldini, </em>609 F.3d at 864. The question is whether the search or seizure at issue was objectively reasonable under the circumstances in which it occurred. <em>Tennessee v. Garner, </em>471 U.S. 1, 8-9, 105 S.Ct. 1694, 85 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985). Reasonableness is determined by \u201cbalancing] the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment interests against the importance of the governmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 8, 105 S.Ct. 1694 (quoting <em>United States v. Place, </em>462 U.S. 696, 703, 103 S.Ct. 2637, 77 L.Ed.2d 110 (1983)) (other citations omitted). \u201cGiven the <em>extreme </em>intrusion caused by use of deadly force, the countervailing governmental interests must be weighty indeed; \u2018only in rare instances may an officer seize a suspect by use of deadly force.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davenport v. Causey, </em>521 F.3d 544, 551 (6th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Whitlow v. City of Louisville, </em>39 Fed.Appx. 297, 302-03 (6th Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-14\">When analyzing the reasonableness of a search or seizure, courts must pay \u201ccareful attention to the facts and circumstances of each particular case, including the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\u201d <em>Graham, </em>490 U.S. at 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865. Reasonableness must not be judged retrospectively, but rather from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene during the incident. <em>Id. </em>In particular, courts must ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>count for \u201cthe fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments\u2014in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving\u2014about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 397, 109 S.Ct. 1865. Nevertheless, \u201cthe fact that a situation unfolds relatively quickly \u2018does not, by itself, permit [officers] to use deadly force.\u2019 \u201d <em>Estate of Kirby v. Duva, </em>530 F.3d 475, 483 (6th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Smith v. Cupp, </em>430 F.3d 766, 775 (6th Cir.2005)) (alteration in <em>Kirby).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Defendant Officers argue that their conduct was objectively reasonable and cite <em>Chappell v. City of Cleveland, </em>585 F.3d 901 (6th Cir.2009), in support. In <em>Chappell, </em>police officers executed an early morning search warrant at the home of a fifteen-year old boy (\u201cMcCloud\u201d) suspected of armed robbery. <em>Id. </em>at 904. Using flashlights and with firearms drawn, the officers conducted a protective sweep of the house, during which they found McCloud hiding in his bedroom closet. <em>Id. </em>at 904-05. When they ordered him to come out, McCloud emerged holding a serrated steak knife with the blade pointing upward. <em>Id. </em>at 905. Ignoring commands to drop his weapon, McCloud moved quickly toward the officers, who shot and killed him. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, this Court held that the officers had probable cause to believe that they faced an imminent threat of serious physical harm, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">Considering McCloud\u2019s stature (5'7\", 165 lbs.) and the size of the knife ..., it is apparent that if the detectives had hesitated one instant, i.e., long enough to allow McCloud to take even one more step, they would have been within his arm\u2019s reach and vulnerable to serious or even fatal injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 911. The Court concluded as a matter of law that the officers\u2019 conduct was objectively reasonable under the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">Defendants argue that, like the officers in <em>Chappell, </em>they had probable cause to believe that Scozzari posed an imminent threat of serious physical harm. However, the differences between <em>Chappell </em>and this case are significant. Viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the evidence indicates that the Officers were standing 15 to 20 feet from Scozzari when they shot him. Further, Scozzari was 51 years old, 5'3' and 133 pounds, blind in one eye and hardly physically intimidating. Additionally, there are genuine issues of material fact whether Scozzari was wielding a knife and hatchet over his head. Further, there is evidence that Scozzari was moving slowly. According to Miedzianowski, Scozzari walked or took \u201ca couple steps\u201d in McGraw\u2019s direction; other witnesses recalled Scozzari moving slowly or not at all. In contrast to <em>Chappell, </em>the circumstances here present- a genuine question whether the situation compelled a split-second decision to use lethal force. <em>See Estate of Kirby, </em>530 F.3d at 482-83 (affirming denial of qualified immunity where, under plaintiffs version of the facts, defendant officers were not in harm\u2019s way \u201cand critically, defendants had sufficient time ... to assess the situation before firing several rounds at\u201d the decedent); <em>cf. Garner, </em>471 U.S. at 11, 105 S.Ct. 1694 (\u201cWhere the suspect poses no immediate threat to the officer and no threat to others, the harm resulting from failing to apprehend him does not justify the use of deadly force to do so.\u201d). Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Defendant Officers qualified immunity with respect to Plaintiffs excessive-force claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>B. Deliberate Indifference</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Defendants contend that the district court erred in denying their motion for summary judgment with respect to Plaintiffs claim that the Officers were deliberately indifferent to Scozzari\u2019s medial needs when they delayed calling for medical assistance after the shooting and prevented emergency responders from treating Scozzari as soon as they arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires government officials to provide adequate medical care to individuals injured while apprehended by police. <em>Revere v. Mass. Gen. Hosp., </em>463 U.S. 239, 244, 103 S.Ct. 2979, 77 L.Ed.2d 605 (1983) (\u201c[T]he due process rights of a [pre-trial detainee] are at least as great as the Eighth Amendment protections available to a convicted prisoner.\u201d); <em>Phillips v. Roane Cnty., </em>534 F.3d 531, 539 (6th Cir.2008). A claim for deliberate indifference to serious medical needs has both objective and subjective components. <em>Phillips, </em>534 F.3d at 539. The objective component requires showing the existence of a \u201csufficiently serious\u201d medical need. <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); <em>Phillips, </em>534 F.3d at 539. In a deliberate-indifference claim based on delay of medical care, a constitutional violation arises if the injury in question is \u201cso obvious that even a layperson would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor\u2019s attention,\u201d and the resulting need for treatment was \u201cnot addressed within a reasonable time frame.\u201d <em>Blackmore v. Kalamazoo Cnty., </em>390 F.3d 890, 899-900 (6th Cir.2004). To establish the subjective component, the plaintiff must \u201callege facts which, if true, would show that the official ... subjectively perceived facts <em>from </em>which to infer substantial risk to the [individual], that he did in fact draw the inference, and that he then disregarded that risk.\u201d <em>Comstock v. McCrary, </em>273 F.3d 693, 703 (6th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Farmer, 511 </em>U.S. at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970). However, it is not necessary to prove that the officer acted \u201cfor the very purpose of causing harm or with knowledge that harm will result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Farmer, 511 U.S. </em>at 835, 114 S.Ct. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">In the instant case, Defendants knew that the likely cause of Scozzari\u2019s collapse was one or more gunshot wounds. Furthermore, as they waited to ensure that Scozzari was not faking injury, the Officers observed a large pool of blood near his neck and heard gurgling sounds coming from his mouth. Lastly, when McGraw felt Scozzari for a pulse, he found none. A layperson under these circumstances would immediately recognize that Scozzari risked serious harm unless given immediate medical attention. Therefore, the questions to resolve are whether medical treatment was unreasonably delayed for non-medical reasons and whether this delay was due to deliberate indifference on the Officers\u2019 part.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Blackmore, </em>390 F.3d at 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Plaintiff argues that Defendants showed deliberate indifference to Scozzari\u2019s medical needs by delaying their initial request for medical assistance and preventing medical responders from treating Scozzari immediately on arrival. Viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, slightly less than twelve minutes lapsed from the moment the shooting was first reported until Scozzari received medical assistance. Defendants reported the shooting at 23:26:09, but they did not request medical assistance until 23:29:28. However, an ambulance was dispatched at 23:27 and reached the Lone Pine Motel six minutes later, at 23:33. On instructions from Miedzianowski, paramedics initially staged off-site, approximately a block away. At 23:35, medical responders were allowed to approach Scozzari, but they were unable to assess his condition until 23:38. The medical responders\u2019 log includes the following comment: \u201cAssessment initially delayed due to restricted access to pt. (crew directed by PD to approach pt without disterbing [sic] evidence).\u201d (R. 84-6, at 3.) Either during this assessment or soon afterwards, paramedics were directed to move back so police could check Scozzari for weapons; treatment resumed after an officer removed two knives from Scozzari\u2019s pockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Defendants contend that there is no evidence that they delayed Scozzari\u2019s receipt of urgently needed medical care. However, the record is uncontroverted that, seven minutes after they first reported the shooting, Miedzianowski and McGraw had not secured the scene of the incident. As a result, when the ambulance arrived, paramedics were forced to stage off-site for two minutes before approaching. Even then, the Officers instructed paramedics to proceed without disturbing the evidence, further delaying Scozzari\u2019s treatment by three minutes. In all, it took twelve minutes, from the initial report of the shooting until paramedics were able to treat Scozzari. Defendants emphasize that medical responders are frequently required to stage off-site until the scene of a shooting is secured. However, they fail to explain why they were unable to secure the scene and search Scozzari before the ambulance arrived. Moreover, there is evidence that the Officers spent at least part of this time knocking on doors and asking neighbors to witness Scozzari\u2019s weapons, activities that were unrelated to securing the scene or saving Scozzari\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, a genuine question of material fact exists regarding whether Defendants acted with deliberate indifference to Seozzari\u2019s pressing medical needs. <em>See Estate of Owensby v. City of Cincinnati, </em>414 F.3d 596, 601, 603 (6th Cir.2005) (denying qualified immunity to officers who, after severely beating a suspect, locked him in the back of a police cruiser and waited six minutes before calling for medical assistance, during which they greeted each other, prepared for their superiors\u2019 arrival, adjusted their uniforms and discussed the severity of the victim\u2019s injuries).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">The dissent distinguishes <em>Owensby </em>as involving a delay in summoning medical assistance after the situation was secure; in contrast, the Officers in this case summoned an ambulance, but did not secure the scene to enable the prompt provision of medical care. However, <em>Owensby </em>involved not only the failure to summon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>medical care, but also the failure to provide medical care:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-4\">[W]e note in summary that each officer viewed Owensby in significant physical distress, yet made no attempt to summon or provide any medical care until several minutes later, when Sergeant Watt checked on Owensby and discovered that he was not breathing. This evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that each officer\u2019s failure to provide medical care to Owensby constituted a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABZ\">414 F.3d at 603. Further, as in <em>Owensby, </em>there is evidence that the Officers were aware of Scozzari\u2019s precarious medical condition but nevertheless engaged in activities unnecessary to their duties. The characterization of the Officers\u2019 activities as not \u201cbrazenly dilatory behavior\u201d because they merely \u201cinterviewed a few witnesses while the ambulance was en route\u201d fails to abide by the requirement that we view the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. The record can be viewed to support that the Officers did not interview witnesses to gather their impressions of the event, but rather called on the occupants of nearby cabins to view Scozzari\u2019s body and observe the weapons he purportedly brandished during the standoff. When considered together with testimony that Scozzari was unarmed when he was shot and that one of the Officers retrieved knives from his cabin and arranged them around Scozzari\u2019s body after the fact, there is a genuine issue regarding whether the Officers were deliberately indifferent to Scozzari\u2019s medical needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Defendants argue that, even if their behavior amounted to deliberate indifference, they are entitled to qualified immunity because it was not clearly established when this incident occurred that failing to give medical responders immediate access to an injured detainee violates the Fourteenth Amendment. However, a constitutional right need not be expressly recognized to be clearly established. To the contrary, \u201c \u2018general statements of the law' are capable of giving clear and fair warning to officers even where \u2018the very action in question has [not] previously been held unlawful.\u2019\u201d <em>Smith, </em>430 F.3d at 776-77 (quoting <em>Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987)) (alteration in <em>Smith). See also Anderson, </em>483 U.S. at 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034 (\u201cThe contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.\u201d); <em>Feathers v. Aey, </em>319 F.3d 843, 848 (6th Cir.2003) (\u201c[A]n action\u2019s unlawfulness can be apparent <em>from </em>direct holdings, from specific examples described as prohibited, or from the general reasoning that a court employs.\u201d (citing <em>Hope v. Pelzer, </em>536 U.S. 730, 740-41, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002))). Reasonable officers would have known, based on this Circuit\u2019s precedent, that the obligation to provide adequate medical care to an injured detainee is not discharged merely by promptly calling for assistance, but extends to ensuring that medical responders are able to access the victim without unreasonable delay. Accordingly, we hold that Miedzianowski and McGraw are not entitled to qualified immunity on Plaintiffs deliberate-indifference claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">C. Assault and Battery Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Under Michigan law, judges, legislators and the highest-ranking appointed official at any level of government are absolutely immune from tort liability when they act within the scope of their authority, whereas lower-ranking employees and officials may only seek governmental immunity for such acts. M.C.L. \u00a7 691.1407(2)-(3), (5); <em>Odom v. Wayne Cnty., </em>482 Mich. 459, 760 N.W.2d 217, 222-23 (2008). A lower-rank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>ing official who seeks governmental immunity for an alleged intentional tort bears the burden to show that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">(a) The acts were undertaken during the course of employment and the employee was acting, or reasonably believed that he was acting, within the scope of his authority,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">(b) the acts were undertaken in good faith, or were not undertaken with malice, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">(c) the acts were discretionary, as opposed to ministerial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-8\"><em>Odom, </em>760 N.W.2d at 228; <em>Ross v. Consumers Power Co. (On Rehearing), </em>420 Mich. 567, 363 N.W.2d 641, 667-68 (1984). There is no dispute that Defendants acted or reasonably believed to be acting within the scope of their authority, or that their actions were discretionary as opposed to ministerial. Therefore, the sole question is whether they acted in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">Under Michigan law, a governmental employee lacks good faith, and therefore cannot claim immunity, when he \u201cacts <em>maliciously </em>or with a <em>wanton or reckless disregard of the rights of another.\u201d Odom, </em>760 N.W.2d at 225 (citing William L. Prosser, <em>Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 132, at 987-90 (4th ed.1971)). In <em>Odom, </em>the Michigan Supreme Court emphasized that determining good faith is not the same as analyzing whether a defendant\u2019s conduct was objectively reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 229. To the contrary, \u201c[t]he good-faith element ... is subjective in nature. It protects a defendant\u2019s honest belief and good-faith conduct with the cloak of immunity while exposing to liability a defendant who acts with malicious intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Prosser, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 132, at 989); <em>see also Szwabowski v. Burdick, </em>No. 282388, 2009 WL 1440945, 2009 Mich.App. LEXIS 1126, at *3-4 (Mich.Ct.App. May 21, 2009) (remanding for trial court to determine whether defendants\u2019 actions were subjectively reasonable); <em>but see Grawey v. Drury, </em>567 F.3d 302, 316 (6th Cir.2009) (accepting parties\u2019 argument that good-faith analysis under Michigan law is \u201cessentially the same\u201d as the objective-reasonableness test for federal qualified immunity).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">Defendants assert that the district court erroneously relied on its finding that the Officers\u2019 use of force was objectively unreasonable to hold that they also acted in bad faith. We disagree. Admittedly, the court reviewed the same facts and allegations, but evidence useful to determine objective reasonableness can also serve to evaluate good faith. Moreover, if a jury were to credit Plaintiffs version of the facts, it could conclude that the Officers displayed a wanton or reckless disregard for Scozzari\u2019s rights that was tantamount to bad faith. <em>See Odom, </em>760 N.W.2d at 225 (\u201c \u2018[Wjillful and wanton misconduct is made out only if the conduct alleged shows an intent to harm or ... <em>such indifference to whether harm will result as to be the equivalent of a willingness that it does.\u2019\u201d </em>(emphasis added) (quoting <em>Burnett v. City of Adrian, </em>414 Mich. 448, 326 N.W.2d 810, 812 (1982))).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">Other parts of the record, when read in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, also support the district court\u2019s ruling. For instance, Miedzianowski\u2019s comment that Scozzari was \u201ca mental\u201d who was \u201cgoing to jail\u201d could be seen as evidence of malice. A reasonable jury could also infer malice or reckless disregard upon finding that Scozzari did not threaten Miedzianowski with a knife during their initial encounter. Similarly, a jury could infer malicious intent from one or more of the eyewitness accounts of what happened both before and after the shooting. <em>See Tobias v. Phelps, </em>144 Mich.App. 272, 375 N.W.2d 365, 369-70 (1985) (\u201c[I]f [defendants] were deliberately indifferent to the decedent\u2019s serious medical needs and, therefore, liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>under 42 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 1983, then they could not have been acting in good faith.... [Deliberate indifference to serious medical needs ... is utterly inconsistent with good faith.\u201d (quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Finally, it is worth repeating that, at this stage of the proceedings, Plaintiff must simply raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the Officers\u2019 good faith. By contrast, as the parties seeking to assert governmental immunity, Miedzianowski and McGraw bear the greater burden to prove that they acted without malice. <em>Odom, </em>760 N.W.2d at 225. Plaintiff fulfilled his requirement, Defendants failed to meet theirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the order of the district court denying Defendants summary judgment based on qualified immunity is AFFIRMED, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-19\">. In this opinion, we refer to the plaintiff, Steven Scozzari, as \"Plaintiff,\u201d and to the decedent, William Scozzari, as \"Scozzari.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b479-7\">. Plaintiff disputes whether Scozzari carried a backpack on the night in question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b479-9\">. Plaintiff disputes whether Scozzari drew a knife during this encounter because Scozzari was wearing pants four or five times too large for him, making it difficult to keep a knife concealed in the waistband. Plaintiff also disputes whether Miedzianowski used pepper spray at all because none of the witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>recalled smelling pepper spray on Scozzari\u2019s clothes after the incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b481-7\">. McGraw also claims that he removed approximately three other knives that were in Scozzari\u2019s waistband or lying on the ground nearby; Miedzianowski\u2019s report does not mention this.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b483-7\">. During the pendency of this appeal, Plaintiff filed a separate action alleging that Scozzari\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights were violated because: (1) Miedzianowski illegally detained Scozzari during their first encounter; (2) the Officers\u2019 attempt to force their way into Scozzari\u2019s cabin amounted to an unreasonable seizure; and (3) Miedzianowski's use of pepper spray constituted excessive force. <em>Scozzari v. McGrow (Scozzari I), </em>10-13698 (E.D.Mich.). Plaintiff requests that we review these claims as well. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Because this appeal poses the question whether Miedzianowski and McGraw are entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law from claims that they used excessive force and were deliberately indifferent to Scozzari's medical needs, the two cases are not \"inextricably intertwined\u201d such that our decision here will \"necessarily resolve[] the pendant claims as well.\u201d <em>Brennan v.

However, in exces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>sive force cases, the third step is redundant because the defendant's conduct must be objectively unreasonable to find a constitutional violation under the first step. Thus, qualified immunity is a two-step inquiry in excessive force cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-17\"><em>Binay </em>v. <em>Bettendorf, </em>601 F.3d 640, 647 n. 3 (6th Cir.2010) (other citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b485-7\">. Miedzianowski also argues that he did not commit a true Fourth Amendment seizure because none of his bullets actually struck Scozzari. The district court declined to ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>dress this defense, which was first raised in Defendants' motion for reconsideration. <em>See Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Flowers, </em>513 F.3d 546, 553 (6th Cir.2008) (explaining that issues raised for the first time in motions for reconsideration are considered waived). An argument not raised in district court is deemed waived on appeal, but this Court will depart from this rule \"in exceptional cases or particular circumstances or when the rule would produce a plain miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 552 (quoting <em>Foster v. Barilow, </em>6 F.3d 405, 407 (6th Cir.1993)) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). These are not exceptional circumstances, as Miedzianowski will have the chance to raise this defense on remand, for instance in a motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50. Therefore, we decline to address it here. <em>See Scottsdale Ins. Co., </em>513 F.3d at 552 (noting that this Court rarely exercises its discretion to hear arguments waived on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"A4K\">. This Court has explained that, in delay-of-treatment cases, it is not necessary to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>that the delay in providing medical care proximately caused the injury. <em>See Estate of Owensby v. City of Cincinnati, </em>414 F.3d 596, 604 (6th Cir.2005). Instead, \"the delay alone ... creates a substantial risk of serious harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Blackmore, </em>390 F.3d at 899). Therefore, since Scozzari's need for medical care was obvious, whether the delay actually worsened his injuries is irrelevant to the analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b490-7\">McKEAGUE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AMX\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">I concur that Defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity on the claim of excessive force because I agree that the record as a whole indicates that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether deadly force was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">I dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether Defendants acted with deliberate indifference to Scozzari\u2019s urgent medical needs. I cannot conclude, as the majority does, that the slight delay caused by the officers\u2019 failure to secure the scene by the time paramedics arrived violated Scozzari\u2019s clearly established constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">The right at issue is Scozzari\u2019s right to receive adequate medical care when injured while being apprehended by the police. <em>Revere v. Mass. Gen. Hosp., </em>463 U.S. 239, 244, 103 S.Ct. 2979, 77 L.Ed.2d 605 (1983). The question is whether the officers acted with deliberate indifference to Scozzari\u2019s serious medical needs. We look to whether, objectively, the officers unreasonably delayed Scozzari\u2019s access to medical treatment and whether, subjectively, they consciously disregarded the risk Seozzari faced. As the majority has set out the relevant standards, we turn directly to the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">The majority points to two instances of delay: the two minutes that paramedics were \u201cforced\u201d to stage offsite and the three minutes paramedics had to wait due to restricted access to Scozzari. However, a closer examination of the record reveals that it is not clear how long paramedics were staged offsite. The police incident report indicates that Chief Miedzianowski instructed paramedics to stage offsite about a block away at 23:29, when he first radioed for medical aid. At some time before 23:33, paramedics arrived at staging site and waited for clearance to enter the scene. (Paramedic testimony establishes that \u201cstaging\u201d and \u201cat scene\u201d are two different things: staging is when paramedics wait for clearance to enter, and \u201cat scene\u201d is the time of arrival onto the scene after receiving such clearance.) At 23:33, paramedics had received clearance and were \u201cat scene,\u201d meaning that they pulled up in their vehicle. At 23:35 paramedics were \u201cat patient.\u201d The majority\u2019s reading of the record\u2014that the ambulance reached the scene at 23:33, then were turned away by Chief Miedzianowski and instructed to stage offsite for an additional two minutes\u2014is simply wrong.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The two-minute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>period from when paramedics were \u201cat scene\u201d (23:33) to \u201cat patient\u201d (23:35) is the time it took the paramedics to park their vehicle, get ready to make contact with Scozzari, and make their way to his location, which included traversing a distance estimated by paramedics to be somewhere between 75-200 feet. Thus, the two-minute period relied on by the majority is time that would have elapsed anyway, regardless of officer conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">On this more precise reading of the record, the instruction to stage offsite seems considerably less blameworthy. Chief Miedzianowski gave the instruction to stage offsite when he radioed for medical help at 23:29, meaning simply that the officers had failed to secure the scene at that moment, three minutes after the shooting, not seven minutes after as the majority states. In addition, the three-minute delay from when the paramedics were \u201cat patient\u201d (23:35) to when they were able to assess Scozzari (23:38) simply does not rise to the level of deliberate indifference. While the officers had removed weapons from Scozzari\u2019s hands and waistband when they handcuffed him prior to the paramedics\u2019 arrival, the officers had neglected to cheek the rest of Scozzari\u2019s body for weapons, requiring paramedics to stop their assessment while police checked again and removed additional weapons from Scozzari\u2019s pockets. Such conduct\u2014 failing to thoroughly cheek Scozzari when initially securing him\u2014is negligence at most, falling short of the \u201cconscious! ] disregard\u201d required to meet, the deliberate indifference standard. <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 839, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (internal alteration omitted). Plaintiff has not put forward any evidence to indicate that the officers subjectively knew that additional weapons were in Scozzari\u2019s pockets and consciously chose not to retrieve them before the paramedics began attending to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">Of course, there is still the time the paramedics waited at the staging site for clearance to enter the scene, sometime in between 23:29, when Chief Miedzianowski instructed them to stage offsite, and 23:33, when they arrived on the scene. While the exact amount of time the paramedics waited is unclear, it is evident Scozzari\u2019s treatment was delayed. R. 71-13, Winifred Bryans Dep., at 5-6 (stating that paramedic Carl Bryans and she were staged and that the ambulance met them at their staged position); R. 71-14, Carl Bryans Dep., at 6 (\u201cI was staged longer than the ambulance was, but I don\u2019t recall how long that was.\u201d). Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there is evidence that one of the officers spent at least part of this time gathering witness testimony, conduct that is part of routine police work but arguably improper in light of Scozzari\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">On this record, I find little basis to conclude there is a triable fact issue on the subjective component of deliberate indifference. There is no evidence that the officers thought through the chain of events that could lead to a delay in paramedics\u2019 access to Scozzari and then consciously disregarded that risk. But even assuming that the officers\u2019 actions raise an issue of fact, the officers are entitled to qualified immunity because the law did not give fair warning to Miedzianowski and McGraw that their conduct\u2014seeking witnesses to confirm that Scozzari was armed while the ambulance was on its way and before the scene was disturbed by paramedics\u2014was clearly unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>The right of pretrial detainees to adequate medical care is a fairly general one. While a delay-of-treatment claim under the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments may not quite involve the \u201cfactbound morass of reasonableness\u201d that courts must wade through in analyzing a Fourth Amendment claim, <em>Scott v. Harris, </em>550 U.S. 372, 383, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007), it undeniably involves a generalized framework through which we view the specific facts of each case. The majority finds that this generalized right, standing alone, gave clear and fair warning to the officers in this case that their conduct was unlawful. The only Sixth Circuit case on which the majority relies for substantive guidance is <em>Estate of Owensby v. City of Cincinnati, </em>414 F.3d 596 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><em>Owensby </em>does not provide clearly established law for the officers in our case. In Owensby, an arrestee died from asphyxiation after he was handled roughly during an arrest, handcuffed, and placed in the back of a squad car. Though the officers subjectively perceived that the arrestee was in significant physical distress, none of the officers summoned or attempted to provide emergency medical aid but rather greeted each other, straightened their uniforms, and waited for their superiors to arrive. An EMT was eventually summoned by a sergeant who arrived six minutes after the incident. This Court affirmed the denial of qualified immunity. <em>Owensby, </em>414 F.3d at 604. What is clearly established in <em>Owensby </em>is only that an officer cannot stand around and do nothing where he subjectively perceives a serious medical need and the arrestee has already been secured. The case at hand is different in two significant respects: (1) the scene had not yet been secured, and (2) the officers responded appropriately to Scozzari\u2019s obvious need for medical attention by promptly calling for an ambulance.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The majority and I differ over whether the officers\u2019 subsequent conduct, which caused a slight delay in paramedics\u2019 access to Scozzari, violated clearly established law. The majority attempts to fit this case under <em>Owensby </em>by reading <em>Owensby </em>to impose a specific duty on police officers that extends beyond promptly summoning an ambulance. They say, <em>\u201cOwensby </em>involved not only the failure to summon medical care, but also the failure to provide medical care.\u201d However, it is clear that <em>Owensby </em>did not break new ground on the generalized \u201cright of pretrial detainees to adequate medical care\u201d but was rather decided as one of the \u201cobvious\u201d cases in which that generalized right sufficed to put officers on notice that their conduct was clearly unlawful. <em>See Brosseau v. Haugen, </em>543 U.S. 194, 199, 125 S.Ct. 596, 160 L.Ed.2d 583 (2004) (noting that in \u201can obvious case,\u201d general standards can clearly establish a constitutional violation, \u201ceven without a body of relevant case law\u201d). Where officers, upon observing the secured arrestee in precarious physical condition (prompting one officer to comment, \u201cThis looks f-ed up. Can he breathe? It doesn\u2019t look like it from the way he\u2019s laying.\u201d), stood around and displayed <em>no </em>intention of <em>ever </em>summoning aid, the general <em>right </em>of pretrial detainees to adequate medical care was sufficient to put officers on notice that their conduct was clearly unlawful. <em>Owensby, </em>414 F.3d at 600, 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Not only does <em>Owensby </em>fail to provide the clearly established law here, no other case in this Circuit or the Supreme Court provides guidance on how an officer must proceed after he has already called for emergency medical services beyond the general admonition not to unreasonably delay access to medical treatment in the face of a serious need. The majority\u2019s decision runs afoul of the Supreme Court\u2019s repeated exhortation to the lower courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>\u201cnot to define clearly established law at a high level of generality.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. alKidd, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2074, 2084, 179 L.Ed.2d 1149 (2011). Otherwise, the qualified immunity doctrine turns from a guarantee of immunity to \u201call but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law,\u201d <em>Malley v. Briggs, </em>475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986), into a rule of pleading. <em>See Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 639, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987) (\u201cPlaintiffs would be able to convert the rule of qualified immunity ... into a rule of virtually unqualified liability simply by alleging violation of extremely abstract rights.\u201d). The Supreme Court has noted, for example, that \u201c[t]he general proposition ... that an unreasonable search or seizure violates the Fourth Amendment is of little help in determining whether the violative nature of particular conduct is clearly established.\u201d <em>al-Kidd, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2084 (citing <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201-202, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Where a Plaintiff relies solely on the strength of a generalized standard to claim that his constitutional right was violated, it is only in the obvious case that an officer has fair warning his conduct is unlawful. <em>Brosseau, </em>543 U.S. at 199, 125 S.Ct. 596; <em>Murray-Ruhl v. Passinault, </em>246 Fed.Appx. 338, 347 (6th Cir.2007) (finding that the Fourth Amendment right at issue was clearly established by the general standard in <em>Tennessee v. Garner </em>because the facts presented \u201can obvious case involving the use of deadly force\u201d). The majority states the unremarkable proposition that the obligation to provide adequate medical care to an injured detainee is not discharged merely by promptly calling for assistance. Indeed, if officers may not delay summoning emergency medical services in the face of an obvious medical need, logic dictates that, once summoned, officers cannot then unreasonably delay or deny paramedics\u2019 access to the detainee. But this is merely a reformulation of the same generalized standard, which, again, would be sufficient to govern only the <em>obvious </em>case. <em>E.g., King v. Reap, </em>269 Fed.Appx. 857 (11th Cir.2008) (affirming denial of qualified immunity where officers summoned an ambulance but then sent it away without allowing paramedics to examine or assist detainee).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">This case is emphatically not the obvious one. Once an officer has summoned emergency medical aid, the only standard governing his conduct is that he may not unreasonably delay access to the patient. While enough to put officers on notice not to engage in brazenly dilatory behavior, this standard alone is insufficient to have made clear to Officers Miedzianowski and McGraw that they could not interview a few witnesses while the ambulance was en route. <em>See al-Kidd, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2083 (\u201cWe do not require a case directly on point, but existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">The majority contends that I fail to view the record in the light most favorable to Scozzari because I describe the officers\u2019 conduct as \u201cinterviewing] a few witnesses while the ambulance was en route\u201d when, in fact, the record shows that \u201cthe officers did not interview witnesses to gather their impressions of the events but rather called the occupants of nearby cabins to view Scozzari\u2019s body and observe the weapons he purportedly brandished during the standoff.\u201d I do not see how these two descriptions are different, as both describe officers talking to witnesses. The latter merely goes into the officers\u2019 purported subjective intentions for doing so. The officers\u2019 purported motivations, however, do not make unclear law clear. Using the majority\u2019s language and assuming \u201cthat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>the officers did not interview witnesses to gather their impressions of the events but rather called the occupants of nearby cabins to view Seozzari\u2019s body and observe the weapons he purportedly brandished during the standoff,\u201d there is still no violation of a clearly established constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">An officer\u2019s duty to secure a crime scene necessitates preserving the exact condition of such scene before paramedics and other personnel disturb it. Thus, in any criminal situation where someone is injured, an officer\u2019s dual duties to secure the scene and ensure access to adequate medical care are in tension, and no court has mandated a clear procedure that officers must follow. Rather, they are guided by the general directive not to unreasonably delay the patient\u2019s access to treatment. This general directive would be sufficient to alert a reasonable officer that he cannot, for example, stall a paramedic\u2019s access to a seriously injured patient while the officer dusts every fingerprint or waits for a forensic specialist to arrive or, as in <em>Owens-by, </em>stand around and do nothing. But it does not put a reasonable officer on notice that they cannot interview a few witnesses\u2014for whatever motivation\u2014while the ambulance is <em>en </em>route, especially where, on any reading of the record, the maximum resulting delay was about three minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The majority opinion sweeps too far. What, then, is an officer to do after summoning an ambulance? Are officers now prohibited from engaging in any investigatory duties that might potentially delay paramedics, even by a few seconds? Is there a time limit on how quickly officers must secure a crime scene? I refrain from further engaging in a parade of horribles and merely conclude that I would reverse the district court\u2019s determination on the basis that the right at issue here was not clearly established. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-10\">.
