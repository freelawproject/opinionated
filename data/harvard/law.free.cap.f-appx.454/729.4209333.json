After review, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">In March 2008, Dempsey applied for disability insurance benefits, alleging that she was unable to work as of July 1, 2002, due to pain in her back, neck and hips. Dempsey\u2019s application was denied initially and on reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">After a hearing, the ALJ issued a decision denying Dempsey disability insurance benefits. Following the five-step evaluation process, the ALJ found that: (1) Dempsey had not engaged in substantial gainful activity from her alleged disability onset date of July 1, 2002 to September 30, 2006, her date last insured; (2) Dempsey had severe impairments of lumbar spinal stenosis, degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine and a history of cervical laminectomies; (3) none of Dempsey\u2019s impairments, alone or in combination, met or medically equaled a listed impairment; (4) Dempsey had the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform a range of light work; and (5) Dempsey\u2019s residual functional capacity permitted her to perform her past relevant work as a manager/assistant manager, a bookkeeper and a cashier.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-15\">With respect to Dempsey\u2019s RFC, the ALJ found that: (1) Dempsey could sit for a total of six hours and stand and walk for one hour each at a time during an eight-hour work day; (2) Dempsey could lift and carry up to five pounds continuously, ten pounds frequently and twenty pounds occasionally; (3) Dempsey could not crawl, but could reach frequently and bend, squat or climb occasionally; (4) Dempsey would have to avoid unprotected heights and moving machinery and could have only moderate exposure to driving; and (5) Dempsey \u201chas not had significant work-related mental limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-16\">In summarizing the medical evidence, the ALJ noted that Dr. E. Ross Clifton (one of the treating physicians) diagnosed Dempsey with fibromyalgia in 2002, but the ALJ did not review Dempsey\u2019s treatment history for fibromyalgia. The ALJ did not identify fibromyalgia as one of Dempsey\u2019s severe impairments or explicitly address fibromyalgia in evaluating Dempsey\u2019s subjective complaints of pain or in assessing her RFC.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-17\">In determining Dempsey\u2019s RFC, the ALJ gave \u201csignificant evidentiary weight\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>to the findings and conclusions of another of Dempsey\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Rachelle Janush, \u201cas set out in her August 18, 2008 PCE [Physical Capabilities Evaluation] form.\u201d The ALJ noted that \u201cDr. Janush\u2019s assessment of the claimant\u2019s physical capacities and limitations are consistent with her own examination findings and with those of other examining or treating physicians\u201d and that Dr. Janush, as a pain management specialist, was \u201cwell qualified to evaluate the claimant\u2019s impairments and form conclusions regarding her symptoms, conditions, and resulting limitations.\u201d The ALJ did not, however give significant weight to Dr. Janush\u2019s opinion, contained in her August 18, 2008 Physical Residual Function Capacity (\u201cPRFC\u201d) Questionnaire, that Dempsey would miss more than four days of work per month due to her impairments and treatment. The ALJ explained that this particular finding was not supported by Dr. Janush\u2019s treatment notes. The ALJ did not address Dr. Janush\u2019s opinion, also in the PRFC Questionnaire, that Dempsey\u2019s pain and other symptoms would frequently interfere with the attention and concentration needed to perform even simple tasks. The ALJ acknowledged that Dr. Janush rendered her 2008 opinions almost two years after Dempsey\u2019s September 30, 2006 last insured date, but observed that Dr. Janush\u2019s opinions were generally consistent with the medical reports and records from before 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">The Appeals Council denied review of the ALJ\u2019s decision, making it the final decision of the Commissioner. <em>See Lewis v. Barnhart, </em>285 F.3d 1329, 1330 (11th Cir.2002). On judicial review, the magistrate judge entered an order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dempsey filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">A. Five-Step Sequential Evaluation</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">An ALJ uses a five-step sequential evaluation to determine whether the claimant is disabled, which considers: (1) whether the claimant is engaged in substantial gainful activity; (2) if not, whether the claimant has a severe impairment; (3) if so, whether the severe impairment meets or equals an impairment in the Listing of Impairments in the regulations; (4) if not, whether the claimant has the RFC to perform her past relevant work;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (5) if not, whether, in light of the claimant\u2019s RFC, age, education and work experience, there are other jobs the claimant can perform. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4), (c)(f); <em>see also Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1237 (11th Cir.2004). If the claimant proves that she cannot do her past relevant work at the fourth step, the burden shifts to the Commissioner to show, at the fifth step, that the claimant can perform other work available in the economy. <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>B. Dempsey\u2019s Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">On appeal, Dempsey argues that the ALJ erred when he failed to address at step four: (1) Dr. Janush\u2019s opinion in her PRFC Questionnaire that Dempsey\u2019s pain symptoms would interfere frequently with her ability to attend and concentrate; and (2) the opinion of Dr. Ben Smith, another treating physician, in an undated application for disability access parking privileges that Dempsey was severely limited in her ability to walk.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">\u201cIt is well-established that the testimony of a treating physician must be given substantial or considerable weight unless \u2018good cause\u2019 is shown to the contrary.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1159 (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(1)-(2). Good cause exists \u201cwhen the: (1) treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician\u2019s opinion was conclusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1241. The ALJ must state with particularity the weight given to different medical opinions and the reasons therefore. <em>Sharfarz v. Bowen, </em>825 F.2d 278, 279 (11th Cir.1987). Moreover, \u201c[t]he ALJ must clearly articulate the reasons for giving less weight to the opinion of a treating physician, and the failure to do so is reversible error.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2) (requiring the agency to \u201cgive good reasons\u201d for not giving weight to a treating physician\u2019s opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">A general statement that the ALJ carefully considered all the testimony and exhibits is not sufficient. <em>Cowart v. Schweiker, </em>662 F.2d 731, 735 (11th Cir.1981). Without an explanation of the weight the ALJ accorded the different medical opinions, it is not possible for us to determine whether the ultimate decision on the merits is rational and supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, when the ALJ fails to state \u201cwith sufficient clarity\u201d the grounds for his evidentiary decisions, we will not affirm \u201csimply because some rationale might have supported the ALJ\u2019s conclusion,\u201d and instead remand \u201cfor further findings at the administrative hearing level.\u201d <em>Owens v. Heckler, </em>748 F.2d 1511, 1514-16, 1516 (11th Cir.1984) (involving ALJ\u2019s failure to explain credibility finding); <em>see also Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1179 (11th Cir.2011) (involving ALJ\u2019s failure to mention treating physician\u2019s opinion).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>In determining Dempsey\u2019s RFC, the ALJ explicitly addressed, and gave significant weight to Dr. Janush\u2019s opinions in her PCE form. The ALJ discounted one of Dr. Janush\u2019s opinions in her PRFC Questionnaire, that is, the number of days of work per month Dempsey would miss due to her impairments. The ALJ explained that this particular opinion was not supported by Dr. Janush\u2019s own treatment notes. However, the ALJ said nothing about the rest of the three-page PRFC Questionnaire, which included Dr. Janush\u2019s opinion that Dempsey\u2019s experience of pain and other symptoms were severe enough to frequently interfere with the attention and concentration needed to perform even simple work tasks. And, the ALJ stated in his RFC finding that Dempsey had not had \u201csignificant work-related mental limitations,\u201d which is inconsistent with Dr. Janush\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The ALJ erred when he failed to mention, much less consider, Dr. Janush\u2019s opinion of Dempsey\u2019s ability to concentrate. Dr. Janush\u2019s opinion is contrary to the ALJ\u2019s finding in his RFC assessment that Dempsey had no significant mental limitations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, it is possible the ALJ did not give this opinion significant weight. If the ALJ considered and discounted Dr. Janush\u2019s opinion as to Dempsey\u2019s ability to concentrate, however, he provided no explanation for the weight, or lack thereof, that he assigned to it. Without a clear explanation of the ALJ\u2019s treatment of Dr. Janush\u2019s opinion, we cannot determine whether the ALJ\u2019s ultimate decision on the merits was rational and supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">The Commissioner argues that Dr. Janush\u2019s opinion was rendered two years after Dempsey\u2019s last insured date and there is no specific medical evidence that Dempsey had mental limitations during the period she was insured. However, the ALJ did not offer this explanation in his decision. We cannot affirm based on a' post hoc rationale that \u201cmight have supported the ALJ\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>See </em>Owens, 748 F.2d at 1516.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On remand, the ALJ must explicitly consider and explain the weight accorded to Dr. Janush\u2019s opinion as to the effect of Dempsey\u2019s pain and other symptoms on her ability to concentrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">Dempsey correctly points out that the ALJ also failed to address Dr. Smith\u2019s certification in Dempsey\u2019s application for disability access parking privileges that Dempsey was \u201cseverely limited in her ability to walk due to an arthritic, neurological, or orthopedic condition.\u201d Although the Commissioner offers reasons for disregarding Dr. Smith\u2019s opinion, those reasons were not given by the ALJ, who never mentioned the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-12\">In addition, the ALJ did not address Dempsey\u2019s fibromyalgia in evaluating her subjective complaints of pain or her ability to perform her past relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>work. The ALJ must consider all of the claimant\u2019s impairments, including non-severe impairments, in assessing the claimant\u2019s RFC. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(a)(2); <em>see also Jamison v. Bowen, </em>814 F.2d 585, 588 (11th Cir.1987) (explaining that the ALJ must consider the claimant\u2019s \u201cmedical condition taken as a whole\u201d at steps three, four and five of the sequential process). This Court has concluded that remand is required where the ALJ \u201cfails to consider properly a claimant\u2019s condition despite evidence in the record of the diagnosis.\u201d <em>Vega v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>265 F.3d 1214, 1219 (11th Cir.2001). Although Dempsey\u2019s fibromyalgia and its symptoms appear in her doctors\u2019 treatment notes beginning as early as 1997, the ALJ did not discuss fibromyalgia. Instead, the ALJ\u2019s evaluation of Dempsey\u2019s pain complaints and RFC focused on Dempsey\u2019s pain caused by her lumbosacral spinal stenosis and cervical spine surgeries.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Thus, on remand, in addition to Dr. Janush\u2019s opinion, the ALJ shall address Dr. Smith\u2019s statement in the disability access parking privileges application and shall consider Dempsey\u2019s fibromyalgia and its symptoms in evaluating Dempsey\u2019s subjective complaints of pain and the effects, if any, on her residual functional capacity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment and remand the case with instructions that it be returned to the Commissioner for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-11\">. In her appeal, Dempsey includes her application for supplemental security income; however, the agency apparently never issued a final ruling with respect to that application. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review it. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g), 1383(c)(3) (explaining that only a \"final decision\u201d of the Commissioner is subject to judicial review).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b753-5\">. The parties consented to proceeding before the magistrate judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b753-6\">. Residual functional capacity, or RFC, is a medical assessment of what the claimant can do in a work setting despite any mental, physical or environmental limitations caused by the claimant's impairments and related symptoms. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(a). RFC includes physical abilities, such as sitting, standing or walking, and mental abilities, such as the ability to understand, remember and carry out instructions or to respond appropriately to supervision, coworkers and work pressure. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1545(b)-(c). The ALJ\u2019s finding as to a claimant\u2019s RFC is based on all the relevant evidence in the record, including any medical evidence, and is used in steps four and five of the sequential evaluation to determine whether the claimant can do her past relevant work or any other work. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1545(a)(1), (5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b754-8\">. In social security appeals, our review is limited to whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards. <em>Crawford v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). Under this limited standard of review, we may not make findings of fact, reweigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for that of the Commissioner. <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). We will reverse, however, if the AU fails to apply the correct legal standards or fails to provide sufficient reasoning to allow us to determine that the proper legal standards were applied. <em>Keeton v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>21 F.3d 1064, 1066 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b754-12\">. We recognize that in <em>MacGregor v. Bowen, </em>786 F.2d 1050, 1053 (11th Cir.1986), this Court concluded that the Commissioner must accept as true a treating physician's opinion if <em>the </em>Commissioner ignored or failed to properly refute it. Our earlier precedent, however, remanded cases in which the ALJ failed to adequately explain the weight given doctors\u2019 opinions. <em>See, e.g., Broughton v. Heckler, </em>776 F.2d 960, 962 (11th Cir.1985); <em>Wiggins v. Schweiker, </em>679 F.2d 1387, 1390 (11th Cir.1982). To the extent <em>MacGregor </em>is inconsistent, under the prior panel precedent rule, we are bound by the holding of the first panel to address an issue of law, unless and until it is overruled by this Court sitting en banc or the Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Steele, </em>147 F.3d 1316, 1318 (11th Cir.1998) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>Thus, rather than accept the ignored treating doctor's opinion as true and remand for the award of benefits, we remand to the agency to determine in the first instance the proper weight to be afforded the treating doctor's opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b755-8\">. Whether or not Dempsey has an inability to concentrate is significant because the vocational expert testified that an individual with all of Dempsey\u2019s physical limitations whose pain and other symptoms would interfere with the attention and concentration needed to perform simple work tasks would be precluded from performing any work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b755-14\">. We also reject the Commissioner\u2019s argument that the ALJ\u2019s failure to address Dr. Janush\u2019s opinion was harmless because Dr. Janush did not examine Dempsey until after the date she was last insured. Absent good cause, a treating physician's opinion is entitled to substantial weight even if the physician did not treat the claimant during the relevant period of time. <em>See Boyd v. Heckler, </em>704 F.2d 1207, 1211 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b756-8\">. We remand so that the ALJ may explicitly consider the treating physicians\u2019 opinions and Dempsey\u2019s fibromyalgia and express no opinion on the merits of Dempsey\u2019s claim for benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
