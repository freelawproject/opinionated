The district court ordered restitution, to which Nelson did not object. On appeal, Nelson challenges the district court\u2019s authority to enter the restitution order. We hold that the district court properly ordered restitution but remand for the district court to correct its clerical error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-15\">The legality of restitution orders is reviewed <em>de novo, United States v. Stoddard, </em>150 F.3d 1140, 1147 (9th Cir.1998), and the amount of restitution is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Fu Sheng Kuo, </em>620 F.3d 1158, 1162 (9th Cir.2010). Here, because Nelson did not object to the restitution order in the proceedings below, his claim is reviewed for plain error. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, Nelson must show error that is plain, and that affects his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Pelisamen, </em>641 F.3d 399, 404 (9th Cir.2011). Should he make such a showing, we may then grant relief only if \u201cthe error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Fu Sheng Kuo, </em>620 F.3d at 1164 (quoting <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-16\">Nelson signed a Plea Agreement that provided that the district court could order him to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties. At a hearing on his sentence on April 12, 2010, Nelson acknowledged his outstanding federal tax obligation, and through counsel reaffirmed that the restitution amount agreed to by the parties had been determined by Nelson\u2019s accountant and was lower than the government\u2019s estimate. On October 5, 2010, when Nelson was sentenced, the prosecuting attorney reiterated that the parties had agreed to $433,031.92 as the amount of restitution, Nelson offered no objection, and the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>entered a restitution order in that amount. We determine that the record shows that Nelson agreed to restitution in the amount of $433,031.92.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">In its Judgment and Commitment Order, the district court stated that Nelson was required to pay the restitution amount \u201cpursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A.\u201d This was error. Section 3663A was enacted as part of the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act in 1996, and its mandatory restitution provision is triggered only by \u201ccrimes of violence, crimes against property, and crimes related to tampering with consumer products.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(c)(1). Nelson\u2019s conviction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1) for filing a false tax return is not covered by \u00a7 3663A. <em>United States v. Dubose, </em>146 F.3d 1141, 1143 (9th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Bussell, </em>504 F.3d 956, 967 n. 15 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">However, the restitution order is proper under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(a)(3) which provides that a \u201ccourt may also order restitution in any criminal case to the extent agreed to by the parties in a plea agreement.\u201d In <em>United States v. Soderling, </em>970 F.2d 529, 534 (9th Cir.1992), we noted that \u201cwhereas section 3663(a)(1) is limited to restitution for offenses under title 18 or ... title 49, section 3663(a)(3) applies to offenses under <em>any </em>title of the United States Code.\u201d <em>See also United States v. Phillips, </em>174 F.3d 1074 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">We find that the district court\u2019s citation to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A rather than 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(a)(3) was a clerical error and harmless. We have held that \u201c[c]lerical mistakes in judgments, orders or other parts of the record and errors in the record arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at any time and after such notice, if any, as the court orders.\u201d <em>Chowdhury v. I.N.S., </em>249 F.3d 970, 973 n. 2 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s imposition of the restitution, but remand the matter to the district court to correct its clerical error to reflect that the restitution order is pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(a)(3). <em>See United States v. Grzesczuk, </em>125 F.3d 1319 (9th Cir.1997) (court remand for clarification where district court failed to cite a restitution statute in either the court transcripts or final order.)</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">AFFIRMED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b597-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
