Appellees have filed a motion seeking summary affirmance of the District Court\u2019s order. We grant the motion and will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>i.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">In July 2011, Lomax filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in the District Court against the United States Senate Armed Services Committee and several leaders of the armed forces. Lomax alleged that he had endured racial discrimination while serving in the United States Navy between 1988 and 1991 and that this discrimination caused him to be deprived of the Congressional Medal of Honor award. Lomax asked the District Court to order a United States Department of Defense investigation into his military service. Lomax seeks the investigation in order to: 1) correct errors in his military service record caused by the alleged racial discrimination; and 2) determine his eligibility for the Congressional Medal of Hon- or.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The District Court sua sponte dismissed Lomax\u2019s complaint as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Lomax timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and our review is plenary. <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). A court may dismiss a complaint as frivolous under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) if the action \u201clacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u201d <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). We may summarily affirm a district court\u2019s judgment if the appeal does not raise a substantial question. <em>See </em>Third Cir. LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6. We may affirm on any basis supported by the record. <em>Hedges v. Musco, </em>204 F.3d 109, 116 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">The District Court properly dismissed Lomax\u2019s complaint. Lomax purported to proceed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. As the District Court noted, to state a claim under section 1983 a plaintiff \u201cmust allege the violation of a right secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and must show that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d <em>West v. Atkins, </em>487 U.S. 42, 48, 108 S.Ct. 2250, 101 L.Ed.2d 40 (1988). The District Court correctly determined that Lomax\u2019s complaint fails to allege that any of the defendants were acting under color of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">The District Court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the complaint without leave to amend because we agree that amendment of Lomax\u2019s complaint would have been futile. <em>See Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962). Even if Lomax\u2019s claims against the federal officials were construed as challenges under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), they are time-barred.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statute of limitations for a <em>Bivens </em>claim, as for claims arising under section 1983, is borrowed from the forum state\u2019s personal injury statute. <em>See Wilson v. Garcia, </em>471 U.S. 261, 266-67, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985); <em>King v. One Unknown Fed. Corr. Officer, </em>201 F.3d 910, 913 (7th Cir.2000) (same statute of limitations applies to actions under <em>Bivens </em>and \u00a7 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">In Pennsylvania, the statute of limitations for personal injury actions is two years. 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5524. Here, the incidents underlying Lomax\u2019s complaint occurred before 1992, making it apparent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>from the face of the complaint that the two-year statute of limitations expired well before he filed suit in 2011. Lomax conceded in his complaint that his claims are likely untimely and, although he argues that his claims should be equitably tolled, he does not provide any basis for doing so.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In light of the above, the District Court did not err in dismissing Lomax\u2019s complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that no substantial question is presented in this appeal, and that summary action is appropriate. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4. Accordingly, we grant the Appellees\u2019 motion for summary action and will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>Third Circuit I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-9\">. <em>Bivens </em>allows a plaintiff to bring a claim against federal officers acting under color of law for violations of that individual\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>Id. </em>at 397, 91 S.Ct. 1999. However, <em>Bivens </em>claims do not lie against the federal government or federal agencies. <em>See F.D.I.C. v. Meyer, </em>510 U.S. 471, 486, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b118-9\">. Equitable tolling is appropriate where: (1) a defendant actively misleads a plaintiff with respect to her cause of action; (2) the plaintiff has been prevented from asserting her claim as a result of other extraordinary circumstances; or (3) the plaintiff asserts her claims in a timely manner but has done so in the wrong forum. <em>See Lake v. Arnold, </em>232 F.3d 360, 370 n. 9 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
