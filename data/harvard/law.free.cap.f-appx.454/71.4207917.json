Duronio, a prisoner in the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), appeals an order of the District Court denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition. Having carefully reviewed the record, we are in full accord with the District Court and will affirm its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Following a 2006 jury trial, Duronio was found guilty of securities fraud and computer fraud, and was sentenced to 97 months of confinement followed by three years of supervised release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Other penalties included a $200.00 special assessment, \u201cwhich shall be due immediately,\u201d and a restitution order. Duronio owed a total of $3,162,376 to UBS Financial Services, and the restitution order instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-8\">The restitution is due immediately. It is recommended that the defendant participate in the Bureau of Prisons Inmate Financial Responsibility Program [ (IFRP, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 545.10-.11) ]. In the event the entire restitution is not paid prior to the commencement of supervision, the defendant shall satisfy the amount due in monthly installments of no less than $200.00, to commence 30 days after release from confinement. The Court waived the interest requirement on the restitution payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">The order made no mention of Duronio\u2019s payment schedule during the period of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">Before briefs were filed in Duroni\u00f3\u2019s direct appeal, he commenced a pro se civil-rights action pursuant to <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In that suit, Duronio maintained that the BOP had \u201cdeprived him of his constitutional right to due process of law under the Fifth Amendment ... by setting [his] restitution schedule of payments and then coercing him to meet that schedule of payments under the [IFRP].\u201d He claimed that this violated the strictures of the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)). Duronio relied on our opinion in <em>United States v. Coates, </em>178 F.3d 681 (3d Cir.1999), in which we emphasized that \u201cthe fixing of restitution payments is a judicial act that may not be delegated to a probation officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-13\">The District Court denied relief in April 2008, and we affirmed. First, we stressed that a direct appeal was the proper path for a challenge of the actual District Court restitution plan, as a <em>Bivens </em>remedy would violate the favorable-termination rule of <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). <em>Duronio v. Gonzales, </em>293 Fed.Appx. 155, 157 (3d Cir.2008). Second, \u201c[t]o the extent that Duronio challenged] the execution of his sentence, he should ordinarily proceed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also explained to Duronio that, under the facts adduced, his claim of \u201ccoercion\u201d lacked a proper legal foundation under <em>Bivens: </em>the privileges lost by failing to participate in the IFRP program would not \u201ctrigger a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>constitutionally protected interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Five months later, we affirmed Duronio\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>See generally United States v. Duronio, </em>\u2014 Fed.Appx. -, 2009 WL 294377 (3d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Since that time, Duronio has commenced two further actions in the District Court: 1) the present case, a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition attacking the BOP\u2019s \u201cunlawful modification\u201d of Duronio\u2019s restitution schedule, <em>see generally Duronio v. Yost, </em>W.D. Pa. Civ. No. 3:09-cv-00289; and 2) a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, <em>see generally </em>Mot. to Vacate, <em>Duronio v. United States, </em>D.N.J. Civ. No. 2:10-cv-01574, ECF No. 1 (entered Apr. 6, 2010), which is still pending at this time. After the District Court denied his \u00a7 2241 petition, Duronio took a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and to the extent that Duronio challenges the execution of his sentence with regard to the BOP\u2019s modification of a payment schedule, the claim falls within the purview of a \u00a7 2241 petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See McGee v. Martinez, </em>627 F.3d 933, 937 (3d Cir.2010); <em>Coady v. Vaughn, </em>251 F.3d 480, 485 (3d Cir.2001). We \u201cexercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its findings of fact.\u201d <em>O\u2019Donald v. Johns, </em>402 F.3d 172, 173 n. 1 (3d Cir. 2005) (per curiam); <em>see also United States v. Friedland, </em>83 F.3d 1531, 1542 (3d Cir.1996) (\u201cOur review of the district court\u2019s order denying ... relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 is plenary.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">We agree with the Appellee that by \u201cvoluntarily<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> entering into the IFRP,\u201d Duronio \u201cpersonally provided the BOP the authority to collect\u201d restitution funds. We are aware of no holding that would suggest that an inmate is prohibited from contributing additional monies to restitution he owes, especially when doing so\u2014and being placed on IFRP status\u2014confers benefits that would otherwise be lost. If we were to adopt instead Duronio\u2019s arguments about the IFRP\u2019s unconstitutionality, we would embrace the absurd result of an inmate being unable to gain program benefits because of an allegedly faulty (and potentially immutable) District Court order. We are not confronted with a situation in which a restitution program is being imposed upon Duronio against his will. \u201cThe IFRP can be an important part of a prisoner\u2019s efforts toward rehabilitation, but strictly speaking, participation in the program is voluntary[;] ... an inmate in the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 custody may lose certain privileges by not participating in the IFRP, but the inmate\u2019s participation <em>cannot be compelled.\u201d United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number><em>Boyd, </em>608 F.3d 331, 334 (7th Cir.2010) (emphasis added). As we hold that Duronio\u2019s voluntary participation is determinative and necessarily defeats his claim, we do not need to reach the Appellee\u2019s alternative argument that the BOP may act to obtain restitution payments even under the improper delegation of authority we identified in <em>United States v. Corley, 500 </em>F.3d 210 (3d Cir.2007), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>556 U.S. 303, 129 S.Ct. 1558, 173 L.Ed.2d 443 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Thus, for the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-9\">. <em>See </em>Judgment, <em>United States v. Duronio, </em>D.N.J.Crim. No. 2:02-cr-00933, ECF No. 135 (entered Dec. 20, 2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b94-14\">. <em>See </em>Compl., <em>Duronio v. Gonzalez, </em>W.D. Pa. Civ. No. 3:07-cv-00169, ECF No. 1 (entered July 6, 2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b95-7\">. To the extent that Duronio wished to contest the validity of the restitution order itself, such a challenge should have been made on direct appeal. Section 2241 \"cannot be used to challenge just the restitution part of a sentence when the custody supporting ... jurisdiction is actual imprisonment.\" <em>Arnaiz v. Warden, </em>594 F.3d 1326, 1330 (11th Cir.2010); <em>see also United States v. Sloan, </em>505 F.3d 685, 697 (7th Cir.2007) (\"Restitution orders that sweep too much conduct into their calculations are issues that must be raised on direct appeal....\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b95-8\">. Throughout, Duronio has maintained that he was functionally \"coerced\" into entering the IFRP program. As we have explained, however, the penalties associated with \u201cIFRP refuse\u201d status are \"reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\u201d <em>See James v. Quinlan, </em>866 F.2d 627, 630 (3d Cir.1989); <em>see also Duronio, </em>293 Fed.Appx. at 157. Further, Duronio \"ha[s] no entitlement, constitutional or otherwise, to any of the benefits agreeing to participate in the IFRP would provide, such as a work detail outside the prison perimeter, a higher commissary spending limit, a release gratuity, or pay beyond the maintenance pay level.\u201d <em>United States v. Lemoine, </em>546 F.3d 1042, 1049 (9th Cir.2008). To that end, we cannot find that he was coerced into . IFRP compliance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
