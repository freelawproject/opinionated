Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). \u201cIt can be reversed only if the evidence presented ... was such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). When an alien seeks to over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>turn the BIA\u2019s adverse determination, \u201che must show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. at 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Mirza has not met that burden. That is, he has not shown that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that is \u201c \u2018both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Halim v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 971, 976 (9th Cir.2009). Among other things, the evidence does not compel a determination that he would be singled out individually because he is Muslim,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> despite the fact that there are problems between the Hindu and Muslim communities in India. Moreover, the evidence does not compel a finding that there is a pattern or practice of persecution of Muslims in India. <em>See Lolong, </em>484 F.3d at 1178. Rather, the evidence supports the determination that there is no systematic persecution of Muslims in India,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that the government does not countenance attacks upon Muslims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, in both instances that Mirza had an opportunity to observe, the advent of the police dispersed the miscreants. <em>See Halim, </em>590 F.3d at 977. We also note that many of Mirza\u2019s family members continue to reside in India without significantly untoward results. <em>See Mansour v. Ashcroft, </em>390 F.3d 667, 673 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Because Mirza did not meet his burden regarding asylum, he necessarily failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Liu v. Holder, </em>640 F.3d 918, 926 n. 5 (9th Cir.2011); <em>Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">Finally, the evidence in the record does not compel a determination that it is more likely than not that Mirza would be tortured in India. Thus, he is not entitled to CAT relief. <em>See Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1067-68; <em>Almaghzar v. Gonzales, </em>457 F.3d 915, 922-23 (9th Cir.2006); <em>Singh v.
