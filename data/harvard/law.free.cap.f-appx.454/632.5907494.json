Burns, District Judge for the U.S. District Court for Southern California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b654-16\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-17\">Birgit Putz appeals the district court\u2019s denial of her motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-18\">To be \u201csubstantially justified\u201d under the EAJA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A), the government\u2019s position must have a \u201creasonable basis in law and fact.\u201d <em>Corbin v. Apfel, </em>149 F.3d 1051, 1052 (9th Cir.1998). A position is likely to be substantially justified if it is taken in the context of a \u201cdispute over which \u2018reasonable minds could differ.\u2019\u201d <em>Gonzales v. Free Speech Coal., </em>408 F.3d 613, 618 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-22\">Although a majority of the prior panel reversed the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (ALJ) disability ruling and remanded for payment of benefits, the dispute was one in which reasonable minds did differ: the ALJ, the district judge, and a dissenting circuit judge were all convinced that Putz was not disabled. <em>See Putz v. Astrue, </em>371 Fed.Appx. 801, 802, 805 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-23\">The dispute over the ALJ\u2019s disability determination centered on the ALJ\u2019s assessment of the evidence and not on whether he employed the correct decisional processes required by the Social Security Administration\u2019s policies and regulations. For instance, in support of his decision to discredit Putz\u2019s testimony about the severity of her fatigue, the ALJ enumerated six independent reasons drawn directly from the evidentiary record, as he was required to do. That this court ultimately disagreed with his assessment of the evidence does not mean that the position was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-24\">As the dissenting panel judge noted, \u201c[mjuch of the evidence in this case is susceptible to different interpretations.\u201d <em>Putz, </em>371 Fed.Appx. at 804. In light of the ambiguity of the evidence and the closeness of the legal and factual questions posed by Putz\u2019s case, the district court did not err in determining that the government\u2019s position was substantially justified. Accordingly, it did not abuse its discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>in denying Putz\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b654-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
