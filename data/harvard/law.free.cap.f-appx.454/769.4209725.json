The Attorney General first argues the habeas corpus petition became moot when Alvarez was released from detention, and that therefore the district court did not have jurisdiction to act. Alternatively, the Attorney General argues that the district court erred in striking several conditions of Alvarez\u2019s release. Alvarez cross-appeals the district court\u2019s decision to reinstate one of the conditions after previously striking it.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-15\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b793-16\">Alvarez is a native citizen of Cuba who has been living in the United States as a lawful permanent resident since 1959.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He is under a final order of removal on the basis of several criminal convictions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After being held in ICE custody for over six months, Alvarez filed a petition for a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 writ of habeas corpus, asserting that his detention was no longer \u201cpresumptively reasonable\u201d under <em>Zadvydas v. Davis, </em>533 U.S. 678, 701, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001). A hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>on Alvarez\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition was set for October 26, <em>2009.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Alvarez was released from ICE custody on October 21, 2009, five days before his hearing date. On October 22, 2009, the Attorney General filed a Motion to Dismiss Alvarez\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition arguing that, because Alvarez had been released, his petition was now moot. Attached to the government\u2019s motion was the Order of Supervision (\u201cOSUP\u201d), which provided that Alvarez be \u201cplaced under supervision and permitted to be at large,\u201d subject to certain conditions, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-5\">[Condition 3]: That you do not travel beyond 50 miles of your residence without the advanced, written permission from ICE. Included in any request for travel must be information about the dates, purposes, places and manner of such proposed travel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-6\">[Condition 11]: That you do not have any verbal, written, or physical contact or association, direct or indirect, except as permitted by court order, with Luis Posada-Carriles, Ernesto Abreu, Osvaldo Mitat, Ruben Lopez-Castro, Jose Pujol, Gilberto Abascal, Generoso Bringas, Edwardo Coloma, Pedro Lopez, Sixto Reinaldo Aquit, and Orlando (\u201cLandy\u201d) Gonzalez.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-7\">[Condition 17]: That you will make good faith and timely efforts to obtain a travel document to effectuate your removal from the United States and will comply with any request by ICE to assist with these efforts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-8\">[Condition 20]: At any time, ICE may modify certain terms and conditions of the order of supervision based on changed circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">Alvarez filed a Response to Respondent\u2019s Motion to Dismiss arguing that his \u201csudden and unexpected\u201d conditional release just five days before his habeas hearing did not render his petition moot. He also challenged the above conditions of release. In an order dated October 30, 3009, the district court granted Alvarez\u2019s habeas petition, \u201cretroactively to October 21, 2009,\u201d and also struck the above conditions of release on the basis that the conditions constituted unconstitutional \u201cconstructive detention.\u201d In an order dated November 9, 2009, the district court reinstated Condition 11, finding that the government\u2019s arguments for the no-contact provision were appropriate in the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b794-11\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-12\">a. <em>Jurisdiction over habeas claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-13\">Initially, we reject the government\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019 lacked jurisdiction to hear the constitutional arguments related to Alvarez\u2019s conditions of release. An individual may seek habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 if he is \u201cin custody\u201d under federal authority, and the Supreme Court has found that the in custody requirement is satisfied where restrictions are placed on a petitioner\u2019s freedom of action or movement. <em>See, e.g., Jones v. Cunningham, </em>371 U.S. 236, 83 S.Ct. 373, 9 L.Ed.2d 285 (1963) (parolee still \u201cin custody\u201d of the parole board because the parole order imposed conditions that \u201csignificantly confine[d] and restrain[ed] his freedom\u201d; habeas relief may be sought); <em>see also, Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998) (incarcerated parolee\u2019s challenge to the validity of his conviction can be main-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>tamed if a \u2018collateral consequence\u2019 of the conviction still exists).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">In <em>Dawson v. Scott, </em>50 F.3d 884, 886 n. 2 (11th Cir.1995), we found that a \u00a7 2241 petition filed by a prisoner while in custody was not mooted by his subsequent release because he was \u201cstill serving his term of supervised release\u201d which \u201cinvolves some restrictions upon his liberty.\u201d Because the OSUP amounted to a \u201ccollateral consequence\u201d of Alvarez\u2019s release that was not moot, we find that the district court had jurisdiction to rule on his \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">b. <em>Challenge to the individual release conditions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">With reference to the conditions of release, the Supreme Court explained in <em>Zadvydas </em>that, if removal is not reasonably foreseeable, \u201cthe alien\u2019s release may and should be conditioned on any of the various forms of supervised release that are appropriate in the circumstances ....\u201d 533 U.S. at 699-700, 121 S.Ct. 2491 (emphasis added). Here, we find that the conditions of release imposed by ICE were appropriate in the circumstances. Conditions 3 and 17 are expressly authorized by administrative regulation 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 241.5. The regulation provides, in relevant part, that an Order of Supervision <em>\u201cshall </em>specify conditions of supervision\u201d (emphasis added) including, \u201c[a] requirement that the alien continue efforts to obtain a travel document and assist the Service in obtaining a travel document\u201d (Condition 17) and \u201c[a] requirement that the alien obtain advance approval of travel beyond previously specified times and distances\u201d (Condition 3). Condition 20, which provides that ICE be allowed to modify the terms of the OSUP at any time, \u201cbased on changed circumstances,\u201d is reasonable because Alvarez would be able to challenge any further modifications to his OSUP in a later proceeding, and because ICE has broad discretion to construct reasonable conditions of supervision. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court erred in striking these conditions as unduly \u201crestrictive,\u201d and reverse the district court\u2019s order of October 30, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">c. <em>Alvarez\u2019s challenge to the reinstatement of Condition 11</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">On cross-appeal, Alvarez argued that the district court violated his rights to due process, freedom of association and freedom of speech when it reinstated Condition 11 without giving him the opportunity to respond or to be heard. Condition 11 requires that Alvarez stay away from the following individuals listed in the OSUP: Luis Posada-Carriles, Ernesto Abreu, Osvaldo Mitat, Ruben Lopez-Castro, Jose Pujol, Gilberto Abascal, Generoso Bringas, Edwardo Coloma, Pedro Lopez, Sixto Reinaldo Aquit, and Orlando (\u201cLandy\u201d) Gonzalez. The government presented a Declaration of Omar Vega, a Special Agent with the FBI, which explained the government\u2019s reasons for imposing the no-contact order in the OSUP:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-11\">(1) Luis Posada-Carriles was allegedly smuggled into the United States on a boat named \u201cSantrina\u201d and a federal grand jury was convened to investigate the allegations against Carriles;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-12\">(2) Alvarez, Generoso Bringas, and Ernesto Abreu were listed as officers of the \u201cSantrina\u201d and that, at the time of Alvarez\u2019s release, Bringas and Abreu were potential witnesses in the trial against Carriles;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-13\">(3) Alvarez and Osvaldo Mitat were convicted as co-defendants for conspiracy to possess destructive devices and unregistered machine guns and a silencer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>(4) Alvarez, Pedro Lopez-Castro, Ernesto Abreu, Jose Pujol, and Osvaldo Mitat all pled guilty to obstructing justice for refusing to testify before a grand jury that was convened to investigate Carriles;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-4\">(5) Carriles was once again indicted by a grand jury on April 8, 2009.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">At the time that the OSUP was issued, each of the individuals listed in Condition 11 was either a co-defendant of Alvarez, or a witness in the then upcoming Carriles trial, from which Alvarez\u2019s 2007 conviction for obstruction of justice previously stemmed. Alvarez does not retain the absolute right to associate with individuals with whom he has been criminally involved, or who might have themselves been involved in criminal activity. Because the government presented a reasonable basis for its restriction on Alvarez\u2019s rights to associate with these individuals, we find Condition 11 \u201cappropriate in the circumstances,\u201d and affirm the district court\u2019s judgment of November 9, 2009 that Condition 11 is not \u201carbitrary, vague [or] unconstitutional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b793-10\">. In 1961, Alvarez was recruited and served under a provisional Operational Approval for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). In 1962, Alvarez enlisted in the U.S. Army and received extensive military training by the Army and CIA for possible invasion of Cuba.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b793-11\">. In 1990, Alvarez pled <em>nolo contendere </em>to aggravated assault and aggravated battery with a gun. He was sentenced to probation. In 2006, Alvarez pled guilty to conspiracy and was sentenced to 46 months incarceration and two years supervised release, which was later reduced to 30 months pursuant to a Government Motion under Rule 35 for reduction of sentence upon valuable assistance to the government. In 2007, Alvarez was convicted of obstruction of justice for failing to testify before a grand jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b796-8\">.
