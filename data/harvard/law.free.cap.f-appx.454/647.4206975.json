Sessions III, United States District Judge for the District of Vermont, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Juan Francisco-Peguero (\u201cFrancisco\u201d), a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the district court\u2019s imposition of a seventy-month sentence, following his conviction for illegal reentry after deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">1. The district court did not abuse its discretion in applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(e), which adds one criminal history point when the offense of conviction was committed within two years of the defendant\u2019s release from imprisonment. The district court sentenced Francisco on October 15, 2010 under the 2009 version of \u00a7 4A1.1(e), which was not effectively repealed until November 1, 2010, U.S.S.G. app. C. at 356 (2010). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4)(A)(ii) (providing that the sentencing court shall consider the guidelines that \u201care in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced\u201d). We have considered and rejected the argument that the repeal of \u00a7 4A1.1(e) applies retroactively. <em>See United States v. Ruiz-Apolonio, </em>657 F.3d 907, 916-18 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">2. Although the district court erred in assigning Francisco an additional criminal history point under \u00a7 4A1.1(e), Francisco failed to object at the time of sentencing, so we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Burgum, </em>633 F.3d 810, 812 (9th Cir.2011) (citing <em>United States v. Evans-Martinez, </em>611 F.3d 635, 642 (9th Cir.2010)). We may correct only \u201ca plain forfeited error affecting substantial rights if the error \u2018seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Here, even if the district court had not assigned the additional criminal history point, Francisco would have remained in the same criminal history category and thus received the same sentence. Therefore, because Francisco\u2019s substantial rights were not affected, the district court did not commit plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">3. The district court did not err in assigning Francisco two additional criminal history points under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(d) for having committed an offense while under parole. Francisco was arrested for the instant offense while on parole for his 2002 firearm felony\u2014in fact, he was initially taken into state custody on the basis of that parole violation\u2014thus, his criminal history score was properly increased by two points under \u00a7 4A1.1(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">4. The district court\u2019s sixteen-level upward adjustment of Francisco\u2019s offense level for prior drug trafficking offenses pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L 1.2(b)(1)(A)(i) was substantively reasonable. Because <em>United States v. Amezcua-Vasquez, </em>567 F.3d 1050 (9th Cir.2009), does not control here, the district court did not plainly err.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">In <em>Amezcuar-Vasquez, </em>we explicitly warned against applying our decision too broadly, noting that \u201c[t]he scope of our decision is limited.... We make no pronouncement as to the reasonableness of a comparable sentence were Amezcua\u2019s conviction more recent, the sentence resulting from the prior conviction more severe or \u2018the need ... to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant\u2019 otherwise greater.\u2019 \u201d 567 F.3d at 1058 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C)). Here, Francisco\u2019s prior drug convictions are significantly more recent\u2014eleven and thirteen years old, respectively, at the time of sentencing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>And, unlike <em>Amezcua-Vasquez </em>where there was no subsequent criminal history, Francisco has multiple subsequent convictions for drug trafficking offenses as well as for'a DUI and firearm-related offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">5. The district court\u2019s sentence was substantively reasonable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). \u201cThe touchstone of \u2018reasonableness\u2019 is whether the record as a whole reflects rational and meaningful consideration of the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Ruiz-Apolonio, </em>657 F.3d 907, 910-11 (citations omitted). Lengthy explanations of decisions, however, are not necessary if \u201cthe record makes clear that the sentencing judge considered the evidence and arguments.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 359, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Here, the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors at the sentencing hearing, discussing explicitly the applicable statutory factors, mitigating facts, criminal history, and arguments of counsel. Ultimately, the district court imposed a sentence of seventy months, a variance of thirty months below the low end of the guidelines range and fourteen months below the government\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">6. The record reflects, however, that the district court misapprehended the law by failing to recognize that Francisco was eligible for a two-point reduction in his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a), despite exercising his right to proceed to trial. \u00a7 3E1.1(a), cmt. n. 2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Even \u201c \u2018a defendant who contests his factual guilt may ... be entitled to the [\u00a7 3E1.1] adjustment.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Cortes, </em>299 F.3d 1030, 1038 (9th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Mohrbacher, </em>182 F.3d 1041, 1042 (9th Cir.1999)); <em>see also United States v. Ochoa-Gaytan, </em>265 F.3d 837, 843 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201c[A] defendant\u2019s choice to exercise the constitutional right to trial ... does not automatically make the defendant ineligible for the [\u00a7 3E1.1] adjustment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">Because the district court did not squarely rely on any other basis in the record for denying Francisco the reduction, we vacate his sentence and remand to the district court to consider Francisco\u2019s eligibility for the reduction. <em>See Cortes, </em>299 F.3d at 1039 (remanding to allow district court to \u201cfully explicate the issue in the first instance\u201d where unclear if district court relied on anything beyond the defendant\u2019s decision to go to trial in denying the \u00a7 3E1.1 adjustment).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">AFFIRM in part, REVERSE in part, VACATE and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b670-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-8\">. Although the Guidelines enumerate two situations in which this is particularly true\u2014 where a defendant goes to trial \u201cto make a constitutional challenge to a statute or a challenge to the applicability of a statute to his conduct,\u201d \u00a7 3E1.1(a), cmt. n. 2\u2014we have held that this list is not exhaustive. <em>United States v. Cortes, </em>299 F.3d 1030, 1038 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
