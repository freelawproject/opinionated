Heggins\u2019 attorney filed this appeal pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), averring that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning the substantive reasonableness of Heggins\u2019 sentence. Although advised of her right to file a pro se supplemental brief, Heggins has not done so. The Government has moved to dismiss the appeal on the basis of the waiver of appellate rights contained in Heggins\u2019 plea agreement. We grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss and dismiss the appeal of Heggins\u2019 sentence, and we affirm her convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">We first conclude that Heggins has waived her right to appeal her sentence. A defendant may, in a valid plea agreement, waive the right to appeal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 (2006). <em>United States v. Wiggins, </em>905 F.2d 51, 53 (4th Cir.1990). This court reviews the validity of an appellate waiver de novo, and will enforce the waiver if it is valid and the issue appealed is within the scope thereof. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">An appeal waiver is valid if the defendant knowingly and intelligently agreed to the waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 169. To determine whether a waiver is knowing and intelligent, this court examines the background, experience, and conduct of the defendant. <em>United States v. Broughton-Jones, </em>71 F.3d 1143,1146 (4th Cir.1995). Generally, if the district court fully questions a defendant regarding the waiver during the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 plea colloquy, the waiver is both valid and enforceable. <em>United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167-68 (4th Cir.1991). The record establishes that the district court fully discussed the terms of the waiver and questioned Heggins to ensure her understanding of those terms. Accordingly, we conclude that Heggins knowingly and intelligently entered into the plea agreement and understood the waiver. See <em>United States v. General, </em>278 F.3d 389, 400 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">We next consider whether Heggins\u2019 challenge to the substantive reasonableness of her sentence falls within the scope of the waiver. According to the plea agreement, Heggins waived the right \u201cto appeal whatever sentence is imposed,\u201d save for a sentence in excess of the Guidelines range determined at sentencing. (J.A. 11).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The twenty-four-month sentence Heggins received was within her Guidelines range. Accordingly, we conclude the waiver bars appellate review of the substantive reasonableness of Heggins\u2019 sentence, and thus grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal of Heggins\u2019 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">The appellate waiver does not, however, preclude appellate review of Heggins\u2019 convictions. Although no challenge to Heggins\u2019 convictions is raised, because this case is before us pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the Rule 11 hearing and discern no infirmity in that proceeding. Accordingly, we affirm Heggins\u2019 convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">We have examined the entire record in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders </em>and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We thus grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss as to Heggins\u2019 sentence and affirm Heggins\u2019 convictions. This court requires that counsel inform Heggins, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Heggins requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Heggins. We dispense with oral argument because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b222-6\"> Citations to \"J.A.\u201d refer to the joint appendix submitted by the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
