Paul, federal prisoner # 78802-012, moves this court for expedited consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>eration of his appeal and release pending appeal of the dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Paul challenged the Bureau of Prisons\u2019s (BOP) sentence calculation. The district court dismissed the \u00a7 2241 petition on the grounds that Paul was not statutorily eligible under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b) for credit for the time he spent in home confinement and there was no evidence that the Government had agreed at sentencing that Paul was entitled to credit towards his sentence for the time he spent in home confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The evidence Paul points to shows only that the Government agreed not to oppose defense counsel\u2019s request for a sentence to time served, 96 months, comprised of all the time Paul spent in jail and home confinement; this did not amount to an agreement to give him a post-sentence credit of 96 months. Because Paul\u2019s claims are premised on the existence of such an agreement, they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Any claim that the BOP erred by refusing to give him credit for the time he spent in home confinement because it based its refusal on the sentencing court\u2019s decision to deny him credit is without merit as well. Even though the sentencing court\u2019s judgment as to the propriety of the credit was not binding on the BOP, <em>see United States v. Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 333-35, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992); <em>Leal v. Tombone, </em>341 F.3d 427, 428 (5th Cir.2003), Paul was not statutorily eligible for credit for the time he spent in home confinement. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3585(b); <em>Reno v. Koray, </em>515 U.S. 50, 58-65, 115 S.Ct. 2021, 132 L.Ed.2d 46 (1995). Therefore, the BOP did not err by refusing to give him credit for that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">This appeal is frivolous and without merit. Accordingly, we DISPENSE with further briefing and DISMISS the appeal as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Paul\u2019s motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b402-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
