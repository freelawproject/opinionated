While Hiller indicated his intent to file a Rule 29(e) motion for judgment of acquittal, he never did so. Hiller now appeals, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence against him on all three counts. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Because we write solely for the parties, we recount the facts and proceedings only to the extent required for resolution of this appeal. Walter Leon, Pedrito Moreta, and a man named \u201cKev,\u201d had a plan to rob a Brinks armored truck at a bank in Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania. Leon had a gun, and was to point it at the Brinks guard after he exited the vehicle; Moreta had a pepper spray can and was to spray it in the guard\u2019s eyes while Leon had him under control with the gun; and, with the guard unable to see, Leon and Moreta would run off with the bags of currency to Kev\u2019s red jeep.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">On the morning of August 24, 2005, the three attempted to execute the plan. When the guard walked out of the bank with several bags of currency, Leon approached him from behind, pointed a gun to his head, and said \u201cdon\u2019t move.\u201d When the guard reached for his holster, Leon told him \u201cdon\u2019t do it.\u201d Moreta then bicycled over and pepper sprayed the guard in the face; Leon and Moreta reached for the currency and fled. The guard, who was not blinded by the spray, fired several shots at the fleeing men, causing Leon and Moreta to drop the money prior to reaching Kev\u2019s red jeep. Kev then drove the two men to Vitaly Liberman who was waiting in another car at a separate location.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">On the night before this botched robbery, Leon and Moreta slept at Liberman\u2019s house. After they woke, Liberman drove the two men to \u201cKev\u2019s\u201d apartment, where he dropped them off. This was the first time that Leon had met Kev. Liberman, however, knew Kev to be the defendant, Hiller\u2014a man he had worked and socialized with during that summer. Prior to leaving, Liberman listened to Kev instruct the two men on how they would pull off the robbery. After Liberman left, Kev applied black paint to the two men\u2019s faces and gave Leon a gun and Moreta a pepper spray can. Kev then drove Leon to the bank, with Moreta following behind on a bicycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">This was the second time that Kev had attempted to rob the Brinks truck that August. Earlier in the month, Kev, Liberman, and Moreta had attempted to carry out a similar plan at the same bank. As with the robbery at issue, Kev provided the gun, pepper spray, and getaway car. The plan was thwarted, however, when Moreta failed to notice the guard return from the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">II.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">When a defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence upon which he was convicted, our review \u201cis guided by strict principles of deference to a jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Rosario, </em>118 F.3d 160, 162-63 (3d Cir.1997). Specifically, \u201c[w]e must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and must sustain a jury\u2019s verdict if \u2018a reasonable jury believing the government\u2019s evidence could find.beyond a reasonable doubt that the government proved all the elements of the offenses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163 (quoting <em>United States v. Salmon, </em>944 F.2d 1106, 1113 (3d Cir.1991)). Thus, even where an insufficiency challenge has been preserved through a timely motion for judgment of acquittal, the defendant has \u201ca very heavy burden.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>108 F.3d 478, 481 (3d Cir.1997) (quoting <em>United States v. Coyle, </em>63 F.3d 1239, 1243 (3d Cir.1995)). Where, as here, an insufficiency claim has not been preserved, the bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>den is even greater, as we will only review for plain error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Mornan, </em>413 F.3d 372, 381 (3d Cir.2005). \u201cA conviction based on insufficient evidence is plain error only if the verdict \u2018constitutes a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\u201d\u2019 <em>United States v. Thayer, </em>201 F.3d 214, 219 (3d Cir.1999) (quoting <em>United States v. Barel, </em>939 F.2d 26, 37 (3d Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">On appeal, Hiller contends that the Government presented insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction on any count. Hiller\u2019s argument, which applies to each of the three counts, rests on the following two pieces of evidence: Leon\u2019s testimony that Hiller was not the \u201cKev\u201d who participated in the robbery, and the fact that Liberman, who identified Kev as Hiller, did not participate in the actual robbery in question. Based on this evidence, Hiller argues that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that he \u201cactually participated in the robbery, ... possessed or aided and abetted in the possession of a firearm, or that he conspired with the two actual robbers.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 7. A review of the record, however, readily belies Hiller\u2019s claim with respect to all three counts. As we detail herein, the government provided ample evidence to support a rational jury\u2019s conclusion that Hiller was the \u201cKev\u201d who coordinated, participated in, and provided the gun for, the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">We start first with Hiller\u2019s conviction for conspiring to interfere with interstate commerce by robbery. To be guilty of this offense, there must be evidence that Hiller, Leon, and Moreta (1) shared a \u201cunity of purpose,\u201d (2) had a common intent to commit a robbery, and (3) agreed \u201cto work toward that goal, which [Hiller] knowingly joined.\u201d <em>United States v. Boria, </em>592 F.3d 476, 481 (3d Cir.2010). Based on Liberman\u2019s testimony alone, the jury had a sufficient basis to conclude that each of these requisite elements was satisfied. Liberman testified that three weeks prior to the robbery, Hiller proposed the idea of robbing the Brinks truck, and that shortly before the robbery in question, Hiller, Moreta, and himself unsuccessfully attempted to carry out a nearly identical plan. In that first attempt, Liberman testified that Hiller provided the gun, pepper spray, and getaway car. Liberman further testified that, on the morning of the robbery in question, he dropped Moreta and Leon off at Hiller\u2019s apartment, and that prior to leaving, he heard Hiller instructing Moreta and Leon on how they would rob the guard. Finally, Liberman testified that, minutes after the robbery at issue, Hiller drove Leon and Moreta over to Liberman\u2019s waiting place.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">Hiller attempts to discount Liberman\u2019s testimony on the basis of Leon\u2019s testimony that Hiller was not the \u201cKev\u201d he conspired with. A rational jury, however, would be warranted in discrediting Leon\u2019s testimony with respect to Kev\u2019s identity. As Leon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>himself testified, he had never met Kev until the morning of the robbery. Leon also testified that he was high on marijuana when he met Kev, and remained high throughout the course of the robbery. Liberman, by contrast, had previously worked and socialized with Hiller, and knew Hiller well enough to have Hiller\u2019s cell phone number (which Liberman called\u2014and received calls from\u2014numerous times throughout the morning of the robbery). Moreover, details that Leon provided about \u201cKev\u201d\u2014including the location of his apartment and type of ear he drove (i.e., a red jeep)\u2014provided a clearly compelling match with Hiller. Finally, FBI Agent Kenneth Vincent testified that Hiller confessed to \u201cprovid[ing] advice\u201d to the robbers, and driving to the scene of the robbery to be \u201ctheir eyes.\u201d A. 241^42. We have no trouble, therefore, concluding that the testimony adduced at trial provided a sufficient basis for the jury to conclude that Hiller conspired with Leon and Moreta to interfere with interstate commerce by robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">We now address Hiller\u2019s other two convictions. The evidence described above is sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s conviction on both counts. As we have already established, a rational jury would be justified in concluding that the person Leon referred to as \u201cKev\u201d was, in fact, Hiller. Accordingly, since Leon testified that Kev served as the getaway driver for the robbery of an armored truck, we will affirm the conviction for interference with interstate commerce by robbery. <em>Cf. United States v. Williams, </em>844 F.3d 365, 372 (3d Cir.2003) (\u201cOur case law has consistently treated escape as part and parcel of a bank robbery, including federal bank robbery....\u201d). Similarly, since Leon testified that Kev gave him the gun and instructed him how to use it to carry out the robbery, we will affirm Hiller\u2019s conviction for using a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. <em>See United States v. Gordon, </em>290 F.3d 539, 547 (3d Cir.2002) (\u201c[Djefendant can be convicted of aiding and abetting a violation of \u00a7 924(c)(1) without ever possessing or controlling a weapon if the defendant\u2019s actions were sufficiently \u2018intertwined with, and his criminal objectives furthered by\u2019 the actions of the participant who did carry and use the firearm.\u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Garth, </em>188 F.3d 99, 113 (3d Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm Hiller\u2019s conviction and the District Court\u2019s judgment of sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b139-7\">. While Hiller indicated his intention to file a Rule 29(c) motion, he never did so. In a letter addressed to Judge Robreno two days after his conviction, Hiller requested new counsel and stated that \"once ... appointed new counsel,\" he would file motions for acquittal and a new trial. District Court Docket Entry No. 114. Even if we were to assume that this was sufficient to put the government on notice of Hiller's intention to raise a sufficiency challenge, it would not impact the outcome of this case. <em>See United States v. South, </em>28 F.3d 619, 627 (7th Cir.1994) (stating that Rule 29 \"does not require anything more\u201d than putting government on notice that defendant is \"contesting the sufficiency of the evidence\u201d). As described below, the government clearly presented enough evidence at trial to convict Hiller on all charges irrespective of whether we use the plain error standard or not.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
