Erickson, Chief District Judge for the U.S. District Court for North Dakota, Fargo, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Appellant Victor Alonso Hernandez claims that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the charge that he unlawfully reentered the United States following his deportation. The district court held that Hernandez failed to show that his due process rights were violated by defects in the removal proceedings and even if they were so violated, Hernandez failed to show that he suffered any prejudice as a result. Hernandez then conditionally pled guilty to a single violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 pursuant to a plea agreement that specifically preserved his right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss. The district court sentenced Hernandez to thirty-six months in prison. On appeal, Hernandez contends that: (1) he did not receive adequate notice regarding the potential effects of his advance parole; (2) the Immigration Judge (the \u201cIJ\u201d) should have heard his request to renew his application for adjustment of status and seek relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h)(2) (known as Section 212(h)); (3) the IJ should have advised him to seek a continuance of the removal proceedings because he may have later become eligible for relief; and (4) he demonstrated that he suffered prejudice as a result of these alleged due process violations. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The denial of a motion to dismiss an illegal reentry charge based on alleged due process defects in the underlying removal proceedings is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Muro-Inclan, </em>249 F.3d 1180, 1182 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">First, Hernandez\u2019s claim that he did not receive adequate notice that his advance parole could impact his ability to seek adjustment of status at a deportation hearing fails because the Immigration and Naturalization Service (the \u201cINS\u201d) correctly advised him that he could renew his application upon return from his advance parole and correctly advised him that he would be subject to removal if the application was denied during his absence. Hernandez has not shown that he was entitled to any further legal advice from the INS regarding the possible ramifications of accepting advance parole. <em>See Barney v. Rogers, </em>83 F.3d 318, 320-21 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">Second, the IJ did not err in concluding that lacked jurisdiction to hear Hernandez\u2019s renewed application for adjustment of status or hear his claim for relief under Section 212(h). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h)(2). The applicable regulation at that time, former 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.2(a)(1), provided in relevant part that the IJ only had jurisdiction to hear a renewed adjustment application during the removal proceedings if the denied application was \u201cproperly filed subsequent to the applicant\u2019s earlier inspection and admission to the United States.\u201d Under the plain language of the governing statutes, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h)(2), the IJ lacked jurisdiction to evaluate both Hernandez\u2019s renewed application and his Section 212(h) claim because he had entered the United States without inspection and admission. <em>See also Jiang v. Gonzales, </em>425 F.3d 649, 652-53 (9th Cir.2005) (finding that an IJ may only consider an arriving alien\u2019s renewed application during a removal hearing when the requirements of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a) are met).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Third, Hernandez\u2019s argument that the IJ violated his due process rights by-failing to advise him that he could seek a continuance of the proceedings fails because \u201can IJ\u2019s duty is limited to informing an alien of a reasonable possibility that the alien is eligible for relief at the time of the hearing.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>629 F.3d 894, 895 (9th Cir.2010) <em>(en bane). </em>Hernandez was not eligible for any relief from the IJ at the time of the hearing because of his criminal convictions. Additionally, the IJ was not required to anticipate potential changed circumstances and continue the hearing so that Hernandez could seek Section 212(h) relief from the Attorney General. IJs are not required \u201cto speculate about the possibility of anticipated changes of circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Moriel-Luna, </em>585 F.3d 1191, 1197 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Finally, even if Hernandez could demonstrate that his due process rights were violated, he would still have to demonstrate that he suffered prejudice as a result. Hernandez attempts to meet this burden by pointing to his closeness with his family, who are United States citizens, and the emotional and financial hardship they will suffer if separated from him. However, the alleged hardships on Hernandez\u2019s family do not demonstrate an \u201cextreme hardship\u201d to a United States citizen sufficient to establish prejudice. <em>See Perez v. INS, </em>96 F.3d 390, 392 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of Hernandez\u2019s motion to dismiss is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b595-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
