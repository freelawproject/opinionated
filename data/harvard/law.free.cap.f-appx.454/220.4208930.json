We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-22\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). \u201c[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d <em>Bowles v.

The notice of appeal was filed on August 4, 2011.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because Jones failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b243-17\"> Jones did not date his notice of appeal. For the purpose of this appeal, we assume that the date appearing on the envelope containing the notice of appeal is the earliest date it could have been properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court.
