CONSOLIDATION COAL COMPANY; Director, Office of Worker\u2019s Compensation Programs, United States Department of Labor, Respondents.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b411-7\">No. 10-3558.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b411-8\">United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b411-10\">Dec. 19, 2011.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b411-17\">Before: MERRITT, CLAY and SUTTON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b411-18\">SUTTON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b411-19\">After her husband passed, Dorothy Kidd filed a claim for survivor\u2019s benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act. Finding insufficient support in the record for the supervising autopsy doctor\u2019s opinion that pneumoconiosis was one of the causes of Mr. Kidd\u2019s death, an Administrative Law Judge denied benefits. Because the ALJ did not address one of the key statements in the doctor\u2019s opinion, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-21\">The parties agree that Donald Kidd had pneumoconiosis when he died in 2003 at the age of 64. They agree that he also suffered from liver and kidney disease. And they agree that he worked in the coal mines of Consolidation Coal Company for at least seventeen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-22\">The question is whether Mr. Kidd\u2019s death was caused by pneumoconiosis, either in full or in part. Mrs. Kidd says it was, relying on the medical opinion of the doctor who supervised Mr. Kidd\u2019s autopsy, Dr. Booth. Consolidation Coal says it was not, contending that Mr. Kidd\u2019s liver and kidney failure caused his demise and pointing to the medical opinions of Drs. To<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>mashefski and Fino, who found he would have died in the same way and at the same time even if he did not have pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">An Administrative Law Judge initially agreed with Mrs. Kidd. He found that pneumoconiosis contributed to Mr. Kidd\u2019s death and awarded survivor\u2019s benefits under the Act. The Benefits Review Board reversed, reasoning that the ALJ inadequately explained his reliance on Dr. Booth\u2019s testimony over that of the other doctors. On remand, the ALJ found that Dr. Booth\u2019s opinion was too conclusory to support an award. The Benefits Review Board affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Mrs. Kidd seeks survivor\u2019s benefits on the ground that pneumoconiosis was a \u201csubstantially contributing cause\u201d of her husband\u2019s death. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.205(c)(2). A \u201csubstantially contributing cause\u201d is one that \u201chastens the miner\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 718.205(c)(5). To meet this requirement, the claimant must present medical evidence describing \u201ca specifically defined process\u201d by which the pneumoconiosis \u201creduce[d] the miner\u2019s life by an estimable time.\u201d <em>Eastover Mining Co. v. Williams, </em>838 F.3d 501, 518 (6th Cir.2003). That evidence must be something more than \u201ca conclusory, unsupported [medical] opinion\u201d about causation. <em>Conley v. Nat\u2019l Mines Corp., </em>595 F.3d 297, 303 (6th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Ordinarily, we will affirm the ALJ\u2019s decision whether to grant benefits if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 301. But \u201c[w]here ... an ALJ has improperly characterized the evidence or failed to account [for] relevant record material, deference is inappropriate and remand is required.\u201d <em>Eastover Mining, </em>338 F.3d at 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Just such an improper characterization and omission occurred here. Dr. Booth stated clearly that he thought pneumoconiosis contributed to Mr. Kidd\u2019s death. The ALJ found that Dr. Booth failed to offer sufficient objective support for this opinion, rendering it \u201cconclusory,\u201d and therefore gave Dr. Booth\u2019s views little, if any, weight in his analysis. JA at 214. But the ALJ\u2019s analysis of this issue consisted of just two sentences and, crucially, made no mention of Dr. Booth\u2019s statement that pneumoconiosis \u201caccentuates the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and accelerates the desiccation of the lungs.\u201d JA 43. This statement suggested the avenue by which the disease could have hastened Mr. Kidd\u2019s death\u2014the very thing that the ALJ found lacking in Dr. Booth\u2019s testimony. As such, the ALJ\u2019s failure \u201cto account [for this] relevant record material\u201d means that \u201cdeference is inappropriate and remand is required.\u201d <em>Eastover Mining, </em>338 F.3d at 508. Mrs. Kidd asks for no more than a remand, and that is what she is entitled to.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">That said, Mr. Kidd died in 2003, and while the closeness of the case provides some explanation for the length of time it has taken to resolve this dispute, the time has come to reach a final benefits decision. In the light cast by today\u2019s decision, it is now clear that Dr. Booth\u2019s opinion should be credited. When read in context, his testimony does not equivocate in its finding that pneumoconiosis was a cause of the decedent\u2019s death. To the extent Dr. Booth qualified his testimony, the qualification accounted for the difficulty of apportioning the exact causes of death on a percentage basis among Kidd\u2019s pneumoconiosis, liver disease and kidney disease, a level of precision not required by the benefits inquiry. Whether through a concession by the company that benefits now must be awarded or through an expedited hearing on remand, the time has come for a prompt final benefits decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>hi.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">For these reasons, we remand to the ALJ for further consideration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
