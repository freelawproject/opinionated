Monteemos of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute cocaine, cocaine base, and marijuana, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(D), 846 (2006), and conspiracy to commit money laundering, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h) (2006). The district court granted her motion for a downward variance and sentenced her to 160 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Monteemos\u2019 counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that he has found no meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning whether the sentencing court erred in basing its factual findings regarding drug quantity on acquitted conduct, causing Monteemos\u2019 offense level to exceed that which was authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict. Although advised of her right to file a pro se supplemental brief, Monteemos has not done so. The Government declined to file a response. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-24\">Monteemos argues the district court\u2019s factual finding of drug quantity attributable to her based on acquitted conduct increased her sentence beyond that which was authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict, in violation of her Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. \u201cSentencing judges may find facts relevant to determining a Guidelines range by a preponderance of the evidence, so long as that Guidelines sentence is treated as advisory and falls within the statutory maximum authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Benkahla, </em>530 F.3d 300, 312 (4th Cir.2008); <em>see also United States v. Perry, </em>560 F.3d 246, 258-59 (4th Cir.2009) (\u201cIt has long been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>established that sentencing courts may consider acquitted conduct in establishing drug amounts for the purpose of sentencing, so long as the amounts are established by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d). Here, the district court treated the Guidelines as advisory; Montecinos was sentenced within the statutory maximum authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict; and the district court\u2019s findings were supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Accordingly, we reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and conclude there are no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform Montecinos, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Montecinos requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Montecinos. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
