We dismiss Zhao\u2019s asylum claim for lack of jurisdiction to review findings of fact going to the timeliness of asylum petitions. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). We have jurisdiction over Zhao\u2019s remaining claims and we deny Zhao\u2019s petition for review over those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-24\">We review the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination under a substantial evidence standard. <em>Guo v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1194, 1199 (9th Cir.2004). This court must accept the adverse credibility determination if no reasonable factfinder would be compelled to conclude differently. <em>Kin v. Holder, </em>595 F.3d 1050, 1054 (9th Cir.2010). In this case, the Immigration Judge did not find Zhao\u2019s testimony to be credible. Overall, it is unlikely that any reasonable factfinder would be compelled to reach a different conclusion. Therefore, Zhao\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails. Zhao\u2019s claim for protection under CAT is forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-25\">For these reasons, this petition is DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b628-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
