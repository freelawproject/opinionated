California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). White has filed a response in which he requests credit against his sentence for the time spent in custody after his arrest. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as White\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Further, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 is the proper procedural vehicle for obtaining credit for prior custody. <em>United States v. Cleto, </em>956 F.2d 83, 84 (5th Cir.1992). Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
