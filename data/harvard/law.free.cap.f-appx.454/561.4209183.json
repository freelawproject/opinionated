We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>See Afriyie v. Holder, </em>613 F.3d 924, 931 (9th Cir.2010). We deny in part and grant in part the petition for review, and we remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b584-14\">We deny Kaur\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision to deny her CAT relief. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that she failed to establish it is more likely than not she would be tortured upon return to India. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1113 (9th Cir.2006) (evidence did not compel the conclusion it was more likely than not the petitioner would be tortured).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b584-16\">We grant Singh\u2019s petition for review. The BIA found that, even assuming he had established past persecution through credible testimony, he could relocate within India. On this basis, the BIA denied asylum and withholding of removal. Because it is unclear whether the BIA evaluated the relocation issue with the proper burden of proof, <em>see Afriyie, </em>613 F.3d at 935, and because the BIA failed to consider the reasonableness factors set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.13(b)(3) and 1208.16(b)(3), <em>see id. </em>at 935-36, we must grant the petition as to these claims and remand for the BIA\u2019s further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-17\">In addition, it is not clear whether the immigration judge denied Singh\u2019s CAT claim on the merits, independent of his adverse credibility determination, nor is it clear on what basis the BIA agreed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>the I J. Thus, we also grant the petition as to Singh\u2019s CAT claim. <em>See id. </em>at 935 (explaining the BIA must \u201cprovide a comprehensible reason for its decision\u201d) (internal citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">We deny in part and grant in part the petition for review, and we remand to the agency for further proceedings consistent with this disposition. <em>See INS v. Ventura, 537 </em>U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam). Because Kaur is a derivative petitioner on Singh\u2019s asylum claim, we remand for further proceedings as to both petitioners on the issues raised in Singh\u2019s petition. Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b584-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
