For the following reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-23\">Because we write for the parties, we recount only the essential facts and procedural history. Petitioner was arrested for and charged with the kidnaping and first degree murder of Nancy White. Jack Singer was the prosecution\u2019s key witness, connecting Diggs to the crime. While incarcerated as a parole violator, Jack Singer wrote four letters to the police and district attorney in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania offering information concerning Diggs\u2019s case. In those letters, Singer asked the district attorney to arrange for him to return to parole status and to help him avoid prison, but stated that his testimony and help were not contingent upon these requests. At the time of his trial testimony, Singer was not incarcerated, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>charges were pending against him, and no deal for his testimony was in place. In April 1977, petitioner was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">After petitioner exhausted his right of direct appeal, he filed a habeas corpus petition and a state court petition under Pennsylvania\u2019s Post Conviction Relief Act (\u201cPCRA\u201d), which were denied. <em>See 42 </em>Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-6. In November 2000, petitioner filed a second PCRA petition, claiming, inter alia, that evidence impeaching Singer had been withheld and the failure to disclose this evidence constituted a violation under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). The PCRA court found no <em>Brady </em>violation and denied relief. Diggs exhausted his state court appeals. In August 2007, petitioner filed his second habeas corpus petition, which the District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania denied. Petitioner now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and \u00a7 2253.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">[Wjhere a habeas petitioner\u2019s claim was \u201cadjudicated on the merits\u201d in state court, the petition may not be granted unless the state court decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-8\"><em>Simmons v. Beard, </em>590 F.3d 223, 231 (3d Cir.2009) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)). Our review of the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions is plenary. <em>See Coombs v. Diguglielmo, </em>616 F.3d 255, 260 (3d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">A <em>Brady </em>violation occurs when evidence, 1) is favorable to the accused, 2) was suppressed by the prosecution, and 3) is prejudicial or material to petitioner\u2019s guilt. <em>See Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 281-82, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999); <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 112-13, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976). The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s recommendation to uphold Pennsylvania Superior Court\u2019s affirmance of the PCRA court\u2019s decision. The Superior Court agreed with the PCRA court that the prosecutor did not suppress the letters Singer wrote while incarcerated because no evidence of a deal existed and the State had filed an \u201cApplication Concerning Material Witness\u201d regarding Singer seven months before petitioner\u2019s trial. The Application stated that Singer had been incarcerated but was released and that the charges against him had been dropped. It also stated that Singer was previously motivated to testify out of a fear that he might be imprisoned again and he felt endangered in prison. Even though this Application was docketed but not personally served on petitioner\u2019s counsel, the Application was served on the Public Defender\u2019s Office and was a matter of public record. Therefore, petitioner was on notice that documentary evidence regarding Singer\u2019s testimony might exist. Accordingly, the District Court did not err in agreeing with the state court that the letters were not suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">Second, even if the letters were suppressed, they were not material. Evidence is material \u201c \u2018if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019 \u201d <em>Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 280, 119 S.Ct. 1936 (quoting <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 677-81, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985) (noting a stricter standard for materiality where defendant fails to make a specific request for the evidence in question)). Here, the District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s recommendation and Superior Court\u2019s conclusion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>letters did not create a reasonable doubt as to petitioner\u2019s guilt, and therefore the four letters were not material. The District Court did not err because, at the time of the trial, Singer was not facing criminal charges or incarcerated, so his testimony was not motivated by fear or any agreement with the State. Moreover, Singer initially offered to testify at the trial even if the charges against him were not dropped. Thus, the letters were not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
