Wilkerson seeks relief, alleging trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel when he failed to object to certain remarks made by the prosecutor during closing argument. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of a state prisoner\u2019s habeas petition, <em>Parle v. Runnels, </em>505 F.3d 922, 926 (9th Cir.2007), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-13\">1. Remarks applicable to Wilkerson\u2019s self-defense claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-14\">The Oregon state court\u2019s denial of Wilkerson\u2019s <em>Strickland </em>claim was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, Supreme Court precedent with regard to trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s closing statements relating to the location of Wilkerson\u2019s t-shirt. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) (a federal court may not grant habeas relief unless it concludes that the state court\u2019s adjudication of the claims \u201c(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-15\">Under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>Wilkerson must allege both (1) \u201cthat counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d 466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); and (2) \u201cthat there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The Umatilla Circuit Court found that, while the prosecutor\u2019s statements were improper, trial counsel\u2019s failure to object was a trial tactic not inadequate representation. Accepting the Umatilla Circuit Court\u2019s finding, Wilkerson failed to provide any evidence to support his claim that his counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>tively unreasonable. As the Supreme Court suggested in <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>\u201c[t]here is a \u2018strong presumption\u2019 that counsel\u2019s attention to certain issues to the exclusion of others reflects trial tactics rather than \u2018sheer neglect.\u2019\u201d \u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 770, 790, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Even if trial counsel\u2019s failure to object was objectively unreasonable, Wilkerson cannot show that \u201cbut for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The trial court cured any error by its reading of the jury instructions. <em>See United States v. McKoy, </em>771 F.2d 1207, 1213 (9th Cir.1985). The jury was properly instructed that the prosecution had the burden of proving Wilkerson\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. That burden specifically included Wilkerson\u2019s self-defense claim. Thus, the state court\u2019s determination that trial counsel did not provide inadequate representation was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established law.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">2. Remarks regarding who was the aggressor.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">Assuming exhaustion of this claim, Wilkerson failed to provide any evidence to support his claim that the prosecutor\u2019s statements were improper or a mischaracterization of the facts, as there was conflicting testimony regarding who was the aggressor. Even if the statement were improper, Wilkerson failed to meet the <em>Strickland </em>test. There is no support for the argument that trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was ineffective assistance. Lastly, any failure to object was rendered harmless by the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury that the attorneys\u2019 statements and arguments are not evidence. <em>McKoy, </em>771 F.2d at 1213.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b592-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
