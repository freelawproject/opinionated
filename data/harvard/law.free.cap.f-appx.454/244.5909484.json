Because we determine that there is sufficient evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could find for Appellant, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Appellees Riddell, Inc. and All American Sports Corporation (collectively, the \u201cAppellees\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">A.K.W. was injured during his ninth grade football team\u2019s practice on September 13, 2006. A.K.W.\u2019s coaches were trying A.K.W. out as a middle linebacker during a scrimmage near the end of that day\u2019s practice. On the final play of that scrimmage, A.K.W. stepped up to tackle the opposing side\u2019s quarterback and was aided in that tackle by two of his teammates. All of the players in on the tackle landed on top of A.K.W.; his head was the first thing to hit the ground. At the conclusion of practice, A.K.W.\u2019s right eye blurred, he stumbled into a friend, and then collapsed on the football field. A.K.W.\u2019s coaches removed his helmet, which is now lost. A.K.W. was taken to the University of South Alabama Medical Center, where he was diagnosed with a carotid artery tear that has since rendered him partially paralyzed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">A.K.W.\u2019s mother filed this suit in Mississippi state court on his behalf against the Appellees and other parent and subsidiary companies of the Appellees (the \u201cDefendants\u201d). The complaint alleged defective design of A.K.W.\u2019s helmet. Defendants removed the case to federal court. The district court dismissed A.K.W.\u2019s claims against all of the Defendants except the Appellees and those entities are not party to this appeal. Appellees moved for summary judgment, which the district court granted. A.K.W. filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW AND APPLICABLE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court. <em>Hernandez v. Yellow Transp., Inc., </em>641 F.3d 118, 124 (5th Cir.2011). Summary judgment is appropriate where the movant shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a)). In reviewing the record, all facts and inferences are construed in the light most favorable to the non-movant. <em>Id. </em>However, \u201c[i]f the record, taken as a whole, could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, then there is no genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">Where, as here, federal jurisdiction is based on diversity, we apply the substantive law of the forum state. <em>First Colony Life Ins. Co. v. Sanford, </em>555 F.3d 177, 181 (5th Cir.2009) (citing <em>Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 78-79, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938)). In resolving issues of Mississippi law, \u201cwe look to the final decisions of that state\u2019s highest court\u201d and if there is no decision directly on point, then we must determine how that court, if presented with the issue, would resolve it. <em>Chaney v. Dreyfus Serv. Corp., </em>595 F.3d 219, 229 (5th Cir.2010). In making this determination, decisions from the intermediate state appellate court are useful. <em>Id. </em>Beyond Mississippi sources, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>\u201c\u2018[w]e may consult a variety of sources, including the general rule on the issue, decisions from other jurisdictions, and general policy concerns.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. of Am. v. Ernst &amp; Young LLP, </em>542 F.3d 475, 483 (5th Cir.2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">A.KW.\u2019s claims arise under the Mississippi Products Liability Act (\u201cMPLA\u201d). Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 11-1-63. The MPLA sets out three elements for a defective design claim: (1) the product was defectively designed, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 11\u20141\u201463(a)(i)(3); (2) the design defect made the product \u201cunreasonably dangerous,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 11\u20141\u2014 63(a)(ii); (3) the design defect caused the injury, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 11\u20141\u201463(a)(iii). <em>See also 3M Co. v. Johnson, </em>895 So.2d 151, 161 (Miss.2005). The Mississippi Supreme Court has said, however, that the fact that a product is unreasonably dangerous is what \u201c[i]n most cases ... makes the design defective.\u201d <em>Williams v. Bennett, </em>921 So.2d 1269, 1274 (Miss.2006). Moreover, we have previously stated that the MPLA imposes three conditions to satisfy the \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d element: (a) the manufacturer/seller knew, or should have known, about the dangerous condition, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 11\u20141\u201463(f)(i); (b) the product \u201cfailed to function as expected,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 11-163(f)(ii); and (c) there was a \u201cfeasible design alternative,\u201d <em>id. Guy v. Crown Equip. Corp., </em>394 F.3d 320, 324 (5th Cir.2004); <em>see also Williams, </em>921 So.2d at 1274. A.K.W. must present evidence of each of these elements to survive summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">A. Design Defect</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Appellant claims that the defect in Riddell\u2019s helmet design is that Riddell used a discrete liner padding system and traditional foam (\u201ctraditional discrete padding\u201d). Appellees contend that Appellant cannot prove defective design because the helmet that A.K.W. wore when he was injured is lost and because there were at least four different types of Riddell helmets in use on the date of A.K.W.\u2019s injury, in addition to helmets by other manufacturers. Appellees point to cases where Mississippi courts have required plaintiffs to show that, at the time of the injury, the product was in substantially the same condition as when it left the defendant\u2019s control. <em>See, e.g., Harris v. Int\u2019l Truck &amp; Engine Corp., </em>912 So.2d 1101, 1105 (Miss.Ct.App.2005) (citing <em>Wolf v. Stanley Works, </em>757 So.2d 316, 319 (Miss.Ct.App.2000)). Appellant counters by claiming that his expert Dr. Ari Engin, when rendering his opinion, assumed that A.K.W.\u2019s helmet was in perfect condition and that regardless of which model A.K.W. wore, all the Riddell helmets were defective per se upon leaving the manufacturer because of the traditional discrete padding. Therefore, Appellant reasons that since the comparison product for the feasible design alternative is not the exact, individual product involved in the injury, proof as to substantial similarity is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">Appellant\u2019s argument about the necessity of producing the actual helmet is persuasive. A.K.W. has testified that the helmet he wore had a Riddell sticker on it. Appellees admit that all four models of Riddell helmets used by A.K.W.\u2019s high school had traditional, discrete padding. Appellant\u2019s expert Engin opined that a continuous padding system using thermoplastic urethane (\u201cTPU continuous padding\u201d) is \u201cbetter\u201d at dealing with impacts, like the one sustained by A.K.W.\u2019s helmet and has said that this conclusion applies to all four Riddell models that A.K.W. could have been wearing. Because the opinion is not based on the actual helmet there is no need for Appellant to have produced the actual helmet. To be sure, the Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>lees can argue to the jury that the differences between the four models are so significant to undercut Engin\u2019s opinion about the per se nature of traditional discrete padding. But where an opinion about defect is based on a perfect condition product that is straight-from-the-manufacturer and that opinion applies to all potential products that could have caused the injury, there seems no basis to erect a bar at the summary judgment phase. <em>See Bradley v. Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>2005 WL 5989799, at *4-5 (S.D.Miss. Oct.25, 2005) (\u201cThe court is not persuaded that the fact that the accident tire is unavailable for physical examination and inspection (i.e., for visual and tactile examination) will always present an insurmountable impediment to the formation of a reliable expert opinion as to the existence of a defect-particularly a design defect [under the MPLA] ... \u201d) (citing <em>Henry v. Bridge-stone/Firestone, </em>63 Fed.Appx. 953, 957 (7th Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">B. Unreasonably Dangerous</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Though there are three components of the \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d element under the MPLA, <em>Guy, </em>394 F.3d at 324, where the product, like the helmet at issue in this case, is designed primarily to prevent injuries, proof as to each of the three components overlaps. Proving the existence of a \u201cfeasible design alternative\u201d is proof of failing to perform as expected. <em>Id. </em>(\u201c[T]he claimant must provide evidence that the product failed to function as expected by way of producing evidence of a feasible design alternative that could have reasonably prevented the claimant\u2019s injury.\u201d). The MPLA defines a \u201cfeasible design alternative\u201d as \u201ca design that would have to a reasonable probability prevented the harm without impairing the utility, usefulness, practicality or desirability of the product to users or consumers.\u201d Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 11\u20141\u201463(f)(ii). Engin identified TPU continuous padding as a design alternative to the traditional discrete padding used by Riddell. Engin noted that such a design is used in motorcycle helmets as well as in other manufacturers\u2019 football helmets. The fact that the alternative design offered by Appellant\u2019s expert was in use by Riddell\u2019s competitors is proof of its feasibility and that Riddell should have known about the dangerous condition. <em>See </em>Restatement (Third) Torts: Products Liability \u00a7 2 cmt. d (\u201cIndustry practice may also be relevant to whether the omission of an alternative design rendered the product not reasonably safe.\u201d); Phillip L. McIntosh, <em>Tort Reform in Mississippi: An Appraisal of the New Law of Products Liability, Part II, </em>17 Miss.C.L.Rev. 277, 282 (1997) (\u201cFor example, a new design may create a danger that is not discovered by the manufacturer because ... the manufacturer failed to keep up with reasonably available technological advances.\u201d). That is to say that TPU continuous padding could have been implemented by Riddell \u201cwithout impairing the utility, usefulness, practicality or desirability of the product to users or consumers.\u201d Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 11-1-63(f)(ii). Since the harm-prevention component of the feasible design alternative definition involves some of the same analysis as causation, we turn to that element now.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>C. Causation</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In Mississippi products liability-cases, \u201c[t]he plaintiff must introduce evidence ... that it is more likely than not that the conduct of the defendant was a cause in fact of the result!\u2014a] mere possibility of such causation is not enough.\u201d <em>Herrington v. Leaf River Forest Prods., Inc., </em>733 So.2d 774, 777 (Miss.1999). \u201c[T]he cause in fact of an injury is that cause which, in natural and continuous sequence unbroken by any efficient intervening cause, produces the injury and without which the injury would not have occurred.\u201d <em>Glover ex. rel. Glover v. Jackson State Univ., </em>968 So.2d 1267, 1277 (Miss.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Engin opines in his report \u201cwithin a reasonable degree of engineering and bioengineering certainty\u201d that the discrete padding \u201clocalized the impact force on the scalp and skull and contributed to the basilar skull fracture,\u201d which combined with other forces on A.K.W.\u2019s head \u201ccaused dissection injury of the right internal carotid artery at the base of the skull.\u201d Appellees point to a part of Engin\u2019s deposition where he was pressed about his conclusion that, Appellees argue, undercuts Engin\u2019s report.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">Q: \u201c... you\u2019re not saying that [A.K.W.] would not have been inured if [A.K.W.\u2019s helmet] had (TPU continous padding] put in place.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">A: \u201c... \u2018it\u2019s very difficult to make that judgment because I\u2019m a scientist. You know, I don\u2019t want to guess here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">We are not persuaded that this brief exchange is enough to undercut Engin\u2019s consistent opinion that A.K.W.\u2019s injury would have been prevented or lessened by TPU continuous padding.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b267-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-6\">. Appellees urge that Appellant cannot prove that Engin\u2019s design alternative could have to a \u201creasonable probability prevented the harm\u201d because Engin failed to test his alternative design. Engin relied on his expertise in the field and force models of how different padding systems would have distributed the force. Failure to conduct testing of the alternative design goes to the weight that should be afforded to Engin's opinions but is not fatal to Appellant's prima facie case. <em>Watkins v. Telsmith, Inc., </em>121 F.3d 984, 992 (5th Cir.1997) (\"This is not to say that alternative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>product designs must always be tested by a plaintiffs expert.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
