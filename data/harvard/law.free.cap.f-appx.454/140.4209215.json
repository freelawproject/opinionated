Because 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) prohibits our review of the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s determinations of timeliness, we will dismiss D.C.A.G.\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Because we write for the parties, who are well acquainted with the case, we review only briefly its essential facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">D.C.A.G. suffered inhumane treatment while living in Jamaica: at age 13, he was raped repeatedly by a family member; at age 16 or 17, he was beaten by an anti-gay mob as police officers refused to intercede; at age 19 or 20, he was abducted by the police for several hours and, upon his release past the mandatory curfew, was brutally assaulted by a group of Jamaican soldiers who forced him to lie naked on a nest of ants, stood on his back, and sodomized him several times.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">D.C.A.G. entered the United States on November 9, 2004, on a non-immigrant visa and overstayed the six-month period allowed by law. During his first years in the United States, D.C.A.G. learned that he was HIV-positive and that his longtime partner had been murdered in Jamaica. D.C.A.G. was hospitalized after attempting suicide and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and depression with psychotic features. A psychologist determined that D.C.A.G. also suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">On January 2, 2008, D.C.A.G. was placed in removal proceedings following a 2007 arrest in New Jersey for presenting false documents during a traffic stop. On January 8, 2008, he applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture. Noting that D.C.A.G.\u2019s application for asylum was untimely pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), the IJ evaluated the statute\u2019s time-bar exceptions. The IJ determined that, while D.C.A.G.\u2019s HIV-positive diagnosis could constitute \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D), the application had not been filed \u201cwithin a reasonable-period given those \u2018changed circumstances.\u2019 \u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(4)(ii). The IJ also found that D.C.A.G. failed to demonstrate \u201cthat a serious mental disability prevented him from recognizing the importance of following the statutory procedures to apply for asylum or that he was somehow faced with challenges different from other asylum applicants in having to recount how he was persecuted in his country of origin.\u201d Accordingly, the IJ denied D.C.A.G.\u2019s asylum application as time-barred. The IJ did, however, conclude that he was entitled to withholding of removal because he was likely to face persecution in Jamaica.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-15\">D.C.A.G. appealed, arguing that the IJ erred in failing to find that his circumstances warranted an exception to the one-year filing deadline. The BIA disagreed, stating: \u201c[ejven if the respondent did demonstrate extraordinary circumstances ... waiting over 3 years after his arrival to file his asylum application, or more than 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>years after his partner was killed, and not applying for asylum until he was detained and in proceedings, [was] not reasonable under the circumstances.\u201d Noting that the Government did not challenge the IJ\u2019s grant of withholding of removal, the BIA remanded to the IJ for proceedings pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1008.1(d)(6). The IJ entered a final order of removal on October 8, 2010, simultaneously granting D.C.A.G. withholding of removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Our jurisdiction is governed by \u00a7 242 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, Div. B, 119 Stat. 231 (May 11, 2005), which authorizes us to review final orders of deportation, exclusion, or removal. Section 208(a)(3) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3), strips us of jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s determination that an alien\u2019s failure to apply for asylum within one year of his arrival in the United States was not due to changed or extraordinary circumstances. <em>Sukwanputra v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d 627, 634 (3d Cir.2006). \u201c[Despite the changes of the REAL ID Act, factual or discretionary determinations continue to fall outside the jurisdiction of the court of appeals entertaining a petition for review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We may review only \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">D.C.A.G. raises neither constitutional claims nor questions of law. He argues that the IJ, and by extension the BIA, \u201cerred by too narrowly applying the extraordinary circumstances\u2019 requirement\u201d when, in discussing his PTSD, it ignored the fact that he suffered from <em>\u201cmultiple </em>[mental] disabilities,\u201d HIV, and the recent loss of a loved one. D.C.A.G. also claims that those same errors \u201cprecluded an individualized review of [his] case\u201d and thus violated his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">While D.C.A.G. attempts to recast his challenges to the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination of untimeliness as constitutional claims, we have held that \u201cchallenges to the [agency\u2019s] extraordinary or changed circumstances determinations do not constitute \u2018questions of law\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).\u201d <em>Jarbough v. Att\u2019y Gen. of the United States, </em>483 F.3d 184, 189 (3d Cir.2007). \u201c[A]rguments such as that an Immigration Judge or the BIA incorrectly weighed evidence, failed to consider evidence or improperly weighed equitable factors are not questions of law under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Such claims concern the exercise of agency discretion and are not reviewable. <em>See Sukwanputra, </em>434 F.3d at 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">Because D.C.A.G.\u2019s arguments challenge only the exercise of the BIA\u2019s discretion, we cannot review them. Accordingly, we will dismiss his petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-7\">. When D.C.A.G. filed his petition for review on November 6, 2009, his case was still pending before the IJ. In his brief to this Court, D.C.A.G. argues that the BIA decision constituted a final order as to his asylum claim. On October 8, 2010, the IJ entered a final order of removal, which also granted D.C.A.G. withholding of removal. Because a premature notice of appeal from a non-final order may ripen upon the IJ\u2019s disposal of the remaining issues, see <em>Lazy Oil Co. v. Witco Corp., </em>166 F.3d 581, 585-86 (3d Cir.1999), we need not decide whether D.C.A.G. was correct in characterizing the BIA decision as a final order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
