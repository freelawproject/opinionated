We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Applying de novo review, <em>Metoyer v. Chassman, </em>504 F.3d 919, 930 (9th Cir.2007), and construing the evidence in favor of Riddle as the nonmoving party, <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986), we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Riddle, a Caucasian, alleges that he was terminated because of his race in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2000e-17. The analytic framework used in Title VII cases also applies to Riddle\u2019s purposeful discrimination claims under sections 1981 and 1983. <em>Metoyer, </em>504 F.3d at 930. Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer \u201cto discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race [or] color....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). This section prohibits discrimination against Caucasians as well as minorities. <em>Ricci v. DeStefano, </em>557 U.S. 557, 129 S.Ct. 2658, 2673, 174 L.Ed.2d 490 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">We apply the framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). The parties do not contest the district court\u2019s conclusion that Riddle established a prima facie case for employment discrimination or the district court\u2019s conclusion that Appellees articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Riddle\u2019s termination. But, \u201ca plaintiff may defeat a defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment by offering proof that the employer\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason is actually a pretext for racial discrimination.\u201d <em>Cornwell v. Electra Cent. Credit Union, </em>439 F.3d 1018, 1028 (9th Cir.2006). Much of Riddle\u2019s evidence of pretext is speculative, hearsay or self-serving, but there is enough admissible evidence that, construed most favorably to Riddle, is sufficient to defeat Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">A reasonable juror could view the written documentation of Riddle\u2019s job performance as inconsistent with Appellees\u2019 proffered reason for Riddle\u2019s termination. Riddle\u2019s employment file does not contain references to the violations that purportedly caused Washington to lose all faith in Riddle. Moreover, Washington wrote a favorable recommendation letter for Riddle in February 2006 only months before Riddle\u2019s July termination. Washington wrote, among other things, that Riddle \u201cwas once my immediate supervisor and we enjoyed an excellent working relationship,\u201d that Riddle \u201cis a visionary in this service,\u201d that Riddle \u201chas an excellent work record with our department\u201d and that he is \u201cextremely professional.\u201d Riddle received numerous merit increases in pay between 2001 and June 2006. Riddle also received good performance reviews from Washington in 2005 and 2006, which Riddle claims were not included in the employment file produced by Appellees. <em>See Akiona v. United States, </em>938 F.2d 158, 161 (9th Cir.1991) (\u201cGenerally, a trier of fact may draw an adverse inference from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>destruction of evidence relevant to a case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">In addition, based on Riddle\u2019s assertions in his declaration, Appellees\u2019 reasons for Riddle\u2019s termination rest on disputed issues of material fact. Riddle denies Washington\u2019s assertion that Riddle missed a meeting called by Washington in August 2001 because it slipped Riddle\u2019s mind; instead, Riddle alleges that he was out of town. Riddle denies that he ever disappeared from his job for long periods or that Washington talked with him about it. Riddle admits that Washington advised him to stop smoking in his office in 2004, but denies that Washington had three discussions with him regarding smoking in his office between 2002 and 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Other aspects of Riddle\u2019s termination and replacement could buttress a reasonable finding of pretext. According to Riddle and another fire department employee, Washington repeatedly commented that \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m anti white, I\u2019m pro black.\u201d <em>See Mangold v. Cal. Pub. Utils. Comm\u2019n, </em>67 F.3d 1470, 1477 (9th Cir.1995) (comments favoring one group may support inference of discrimination against another group). Riddle has presented some evidence that Washington stated a preference for Gene Campbell, an African American, to replace Washington as Fire Chief upon his retirement. Riddle was one of four Deputy Fire Chiefs, the position directly below Fire Chief. After working for the fire department for 28 years and serving as Deputy Chief for 11 years, Riddle was terminated without having an opportunity to refute the emailed complaint of his smoking that led to his termination. <em>See Fonseca v. Sysco Food Servs. of Ariz., Inc., </em>374 F.3d 840, 850 (9th Cir.2004) (failure to conduct investigation may support finding of pretext). Washington promoted Campbell to replace Riddle although another employee viewed Campbell as knowing nothing about areas in which he had previously been promoted. This evidence, combined with the written documentation of Riddle\u2019s job performance and the materially disputed aspects of his performance, viewed in the light most favorable to Riddle, could provide a sufficient basis for a reasonable juror to find that Appellees\u2019 reasons for Riddle\u2019s termination are pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Because we reverse the summary judgment on Riddle\u2019s federal claims, we also remand for the district court to reconsider whether it should exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Riddle\u2019s state law claims for wrongful termination and defamation. <em>See Fang v. U.S., </em>140 F.3d 1238, 1244 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b636-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
