The sentence is the statutory maximum and exceeds the recommended guideline range of three to nine months.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-15\">Ibanez claims that the district court plainly erred in basing his sentence on a factor that we have held is barred from consideration by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 844 (5th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 496, 181 L.Ed.2d 345 (2011). He asserts that the reason given by the district court in imposing the 24\u2014month sentence-that the court believed that Ibanez had \u201cvery little respect for his legal obligations\u201d\u2014reflects that the district court improperly relied on the need to \u201cpromote respect for the law,\u201d a factor listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), which we held in <em>Miller </em>is prohibited from consideration under \u00a7 3583(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-18\">We generally review a sentence imposed on revocation of supervised release if it is \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d rather than merely \u201cunreasonable,\u201d as is the standard of review for other criminal sentences. <em>See id. </em>at 843. When specific claims of procedural error raised on appeal were not raised in the district court, as however, our review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259 (5th Cir.2009). Even though Ibanez objected to his sentence as \u201cunreasonable,\u201d he did not object to his sentence on the ground that the district court considered a prohibited factor in imposing his sentence. Thus, our review of his sentence is for plain error only. <em>See id. </em>To establish plain error, Ibanez must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-19\">In <em>Miller, </em>which was decided before Ibanez\u2019s revocation hearing, we held that it is improper for a district court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>rely on \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), which permits a sentencing court to consider the need for the sentence \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense,\u201d when modifying or revoking a term of supervised release. <em>Miller, </em>634 F.3d at 844. Here, the record reflects that revocation of Ibanez\u2019s supervised release was mandated by \u00a7 3583(g) because he violated express conditions of his supervised release by possessing a controlled substance and refusing to comply with drug testing. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3583(g). Section 3583(g) does not expressly invoke the sentencing factors of \u00a7 3553(a) or the limits imposed by the first clause of \u00a7 3583(e). <em>See </em>\u00a7 3583(g); <em>United States v. Giddings, </em>37 F.3d 1091, 1095 (5th Cir.1994) (noting that a court need not consider \u00a7 3553(a) when revocation is mandated by \u00a7 3583(g)). Thus, Ibanez cannot show that it is \u201cclear or obvious\u201d that a sentence imposed when revocation of supervised release is mandatory must be limited by \u00a7 3583(e). <em>Cf. United States v. Larison, </em>432 F.3d 921, 923 n. 3 (8th Cir.2006) (observing that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is not constrained by the factors specifically enunciated in \u00a7 3583(e) when revocation is mandated by \u00a7 3583(g)). Even if Ibanez\u2019s revocation were limited by the factors listed in \u00a7 3583(e), he has not demonstrated that the district court\u2019s statement that it believed that Ibanez had \u201clittle respect for his legal obligations\u201d constituted a clear and obvious error, as that statement was made in the context of Ibanez\u2019s failure to comply with the obligations under the terms and conditions of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">As Ibanez acknowledges, his contention that his sentence should be reviewed for reasonableness instead of \u201cplain unreasonableness,\u201d is foreclosed by <em>Miller. </em>In any event, he asserts that his sentence is \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d in light of his ongoing battle against drug addiction and his forthright admissions regarding his drug usage. There is nothing in the record to suggest that the 24-month sentence imposed in this case failed to account for a factor that should have received significant weight or gave significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, <em>see United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006). Neither is the sentence, which does not exceed the statutory maximum, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3583(e)(3), plainly unreasonable. <em>See Miller, </em>634 F.3d at 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
