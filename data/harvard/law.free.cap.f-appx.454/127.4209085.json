For the following reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-16\">Because we write for the parties, we recount only the essential facts and procedural history.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We presume familiarity with our prior decision. <em>United States v. Dobson, </em>380 Fed.Appx. 170 (3d Cir.2010). In November 2007, Dobson\u2014a Deputy U.S. Marshal at the time\u2014acquired a .40 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>caliber Glock 27, for which he had received authorization but had not yet been trained to carry, through his position in the United States Marshals Service. At some point prior to January 18, 2008, Larry Langforddavis, Dobson\u2019s friend and a convicted felon, acquired Dobson\u2019s Glock 27, perhaps multiple times. On the evening of January 4, 2008, Dobson was celebrating his birthday at the Jersey Girls Entertainment Club. Langforddavis entered the club without being searched because he had been incorrectly introduced to the club\u2019s employees as a law enforcement officer. Dobson sustained injuries after being assaulted outside the club on the morning of January 5. Dobson and Langforddavis spoke briefly before Langforddavis got into a car and chased after the assailants. Langforddavis returned twenty minutes later, proclaiming that he \u201cgot them\u201d and had \u201csprayed the vehicle.\u201d Dobson replied that he \u201cwanted his gun.\u201d Langforddavis later went to visit Dobson in the hospital, at which time Langforddavis showed several officers a gun, which appeared to be a Glock, holstered to his leg. On January 18, 2008, Dobson and Langforddavis became heavily intoxicated together at Slick\u2019s Tavern. Langforddavis drove Dobson to a diner where he left Dobson in the care of another friend. When Dobson got home, he called Langforddavis and told him to bring the gun back and not to leave the gun in the car overnight. Langforddavis, however, proceeded to Jersey Girls to pick up his girlfriend and upon arriving strapped the gun to his leg and exited the car. Police officers, who were already at the club for other reasons, arrested Langforddavis and confiscated the gun, later identified as Dobson\u2019s Glock 27. Dobson was indicted on one count of disposing of a firearm and ammunition to a person convicted of a felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2), and one count of aiding and abetting the same, as well as four counts of perjury. The jury convicted Dobson on one count of disposing of a firearm and ammunition to a person convicted of a felony and one count of perjury for lying about his knowledge of whether Langforddavis was carrying a gun on January 5, 2008. The District Court set aside the perjury conviction, but we reinstated it. <em>Dobson, </em>380 Fed.Appx. at 180. In October 2010, Dobson was sentenced to forty-five months in prison. Dobson now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) to review the final judgment of the U.S. District Court. Because defendant concedes he failed to raise his evidentiary claim before the District Court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Christie, </em>624 F.3d 558, 567 (3d Cir.2010). We review challenges to jury instructions and based on variance not raised before the district court for plain error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Williams, </em>464 F.3d 443, 445 (3d Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Daraio, </em>445 F.3d 253, 259 (3d Cir.2006). The district court\u2019s interpretation of the United States Sentencing Guidelines is reviewed de novo, while determinations of sentencing facts are reviewed for clear error and the application of facts to the sentencing guidelines are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Aquino, </em>555 F.3d 124, 127 (3d Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Tupone, </em>442 F.3d 145, 149 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Dobson alleges that the District Court erred in admitting statements by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>witness into evidence because the statements were irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial to Dobson. \u201cEvidence which is essentially background in nature can scarcely be said to involve a disputed matter, yet it is universally offered and admitted as an aid to understanding.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 401, Comm. Notes. Here, Officer Paul Pereira\u2014who interviewed Dobson in the hospital on January 6\u2014 testified that he knew Dobson \u201cwas on the job with the U.S. Marshals from previous run-ins throughout the city where me and him had spoken before he had identified himself.\u201d App. to Br. of Appellant at 109-10. When asked if Dobson had been in uniform at the time, Pereira responded that Dobson had not been and that Pereira had met Dobson \u201cat either Jersey Girls Go-Go lounge and he also frequents a Cinderella Go-go Lounge.\u201d App. to Br. of Appellant at 110. The statements are relevant as background information and do not imply any illegal or deviant activity. In this context, \u201crun-ins\u201d does not mean nefarious or illegal infractions on Dobson\u2019s part, as Dobson alleges, but rather chance encounters between two individuals. That Dobson frequented strip clubs was not unfairly prejudicial information where the jury heard that he went to a strip club for his birthday. Thus, the District Court did not plainly err in admitting Pereira\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Dobson also alleges that prejudicial variance occurred because the government failed to prove\u2014and the District Court instructed the jury that it was required to find only\u2014that Langforddavis continually possessed Dobson\u2019s gun from January 5 until January 19. \u201cWhere \u2018on or about\u2019 language is used, the government is not required to prove the exact dates, if a date reasonably near is established.\u201d <em>Real v. Shannon, </em>600 F.3d 302, 308 (3d Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (finding no variance where the indictment charged the crime to have been committed in December, but the crime may have occurred in November or January). Here, the judge issued instructions substantively identical to the our model jury instructions.3d Cir. Model Jury Instructions \u00a7 3.08. Comments to those jury instructions clarify that \u201ca variance in proof of a date is not material in the absence of some specific evidence of prejudice.\u201d 3d Cir. Model Jury Instructions \u00a7 3.08, Cmt. (quoting <em>United States v. Schurr, </em>775 F.2d 549, 558 (3d Cir.1985)). The jury could have found that Dobson placed the gun into Langforddavis\u2019s control at any point during\u2014or even slightly before or after\u2014the time period set forth in the indictment so long as Dobson was not unfairly prejudiced. Thus, there is no plain error as to variance in the government\u2019s proof at trial or the related jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Dobson also challenges his sentence, arguing that the District Court erred in enhancing his sentence for abuse of public trust under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3B1.3. Abuse of public trust requires that the defendant, 1) be in a position of trust, and 2) abuse that position. <em>United States v. Sherman, </em>160 F.3d 967, 969 (3d Cir.1998). The factors for determining whether a position of trust exists are: 1) the position allows defendant to commit a difficult-to-detect wrong, 2) the degree of authority which the position vests in the defendant vis-a-vis the object of the wrongful act, and 3) whether the public relied on the integrity of the person occupying the position. <em>Id. </em>The District Court found at sentencing that Dobson abused his position when he gave his gun to Langforddavis, and record evidence permits this conclusion. Dobson\u2019s sweeping statement that \u201cit is common knowledge that it would have been easier for Langforddavis and/or appellant to purchase a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>weapon on the streets of Newark or Elizabeth than it was for appellant to lawfully purchase it,\u201d is unsupported by any record evidence, and likely irrelevant. Because of his position Dobson lawfully possessed a gun, was trusted by establishments he frequented, was not subject to searches for illegal or dangerous weapons, and could easily transfer his gun to another. Thus, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in enhancing Dobson\u2019s sentence based on Dobson\u2019s abuse of public trust.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Dobson asserts that the District Court erred in enhancing his sentence on the basis that he provided the weapon with the belief it would be used in a felony. The Sentencing Guidelines provide: \u201cIf the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense; or possessed or transferred any firearm or ammunition with knowledge, intent, or reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense, increase by 4 levels.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). Here, the District Court found that Dobson had extensive knowledge of Langforddavis\u2019s criminal past. Furthermore, Langforddavis\u2019s actions on the morning of January 6 confirm this, as Langforddavis ran off after the assailants, returning to triumphantly declare to an apparently unshocked Dobson that he had \u201cgot them\u201d and had \u201csprayed the vehicle\u201d with bullets. A finder of fact could infer Langforddavis\u2019s actions were not a surprise to Dobson. Thus, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Dobson had provided a weapon with the belief that it would be used in a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Dobson argues that the District Court erred by unreasonably sentencing the defendant and failing to rely on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Specifically, Dobson asserts that the District Court did not examine factors one and two by failing to consider Dobson\u2019s mother\u2019s illness and death, Dobson\u2019s military service, the need to focus on rehabilitation, and the cost to Dob-son\u2019s future opportunities. After hearing from Dobson, family members and friends, reading letters, and reviewing Dobson\u2019s criminal and professional records, the District Court commented on the severity of the offense, the need to protect the public, Dobson\u2019s care for his ailing mother, and the need for a sufficient but not excessive sentence. The District Court then sentenced Dobson to forty-five months, within the lower half of the forty-one to fifty-one sentence range. Dobson\u2019s claim that the District Court failed to address certain \u00a7 3553(a) factors is directly contradicted by the record. Because the District Court considered and discussed the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors and sentenced Dobson within the middle of the Guideline range based on facts which do not appear to be beyond the Guideline heartland, we cannot say Dobson\u2019s due process rights were violated or that no reasonable sentencing court would have imposed the same sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-10\">. Dobson does not appeal his conviction for perjury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b150-11\">. Dobson contends that his acquittal on three of four counts of perjury may be used to conclude that certain facts were not proven by the Government at trial. We previously rejected a permutation of this argument. Last year, Dobson argued that his acquittal on the three counts of perjury demonstrated that \" \u2018[tjhere can be no doubt that the [Government] had failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt a fundamental allegation of its case\u2014that Langforddavis had possession of Mr. Dobson\u2019s newly purchased firearm on January 5, 2008\u2019 because the jury \u2018completely rejected the allegation in two counts of the indictment.' \u201d <em>United States v. Dobson, </em>380 Fed.Appx. 170, 179 (3d Cir.2010) (quoting Br. of Appellee 17). We determined that there was \u201cno requirement that a jury\u2019s verdict be consistent,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Mussare, </em>405 F.3d 161, 167 (3d Cir.2005)), and \"[i]t was not the province of the courts to 'inquir[e] into a jury\u2019s thought process,' \u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Powell, </em>469 U.S. 57, 67, 105 S.Ct. 471, 83 L.Ed.2d 461 (1984)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b151-5\">. Dobson alleges that his jury instruction claim was \"partially raised\u201d before the District Court. Dobson cites no part of the appendix or record\u2014nor do we find any\u2014to support this allegation. We therefore find that Dobson failed to raise his jury instruction challenge before the District Court and we review his claim for plain error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b153-6\">. Dobson seems to argue that the abuse of the position of trust must have a \"victim\u201d and because no definable victim exists in the instant case, the judge erred in applying the sentencing enhancement. <em>See United States v. Hickman, </em>991 F.2d 1110, 1112 (3d Cir.1993) (\u201cTo abuse a position of trust, a defendant must, by definition, have taken criminal advantage of a trust relationship between himself and his victim\u201d). Dobson has inflicted a definite harm on the general public in permitting a convicted felon to carry a firearm authorized for use by a Deputy U.S. Marshal. That is sufficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
