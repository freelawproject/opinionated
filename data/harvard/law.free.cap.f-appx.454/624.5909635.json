We affirm the grant of a new trial, but reverse the order suppressing evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-19\">In granting McDuffie a new trial, the district court concluded that the government violated <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), when it. failed to disclose in a timely manner certain fingerprint evidence. To establish a <em>Brady </em>violation, a defendant must show that \u201c[t]he evidence at issue [is] favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching; that evidence [was] suppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently; and prejudice ... ensued.\u201d <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number><em>v. Price, </em>566 F.3d 900, 907 (9th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 281-82, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999)) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">The evidence at issue here showed that Detective Barrington\u2019s fingerprint was on a drug scale, which was found in the Ash Street apartment. This evidence supported McDuffie\u2019s theory that Barrington sought to frame him in order to pressure him to cooperate with one of Barrington\u2019s on-going murder investigations. This evidence was disclosed <em>during </em>trial, despite the fact that the government learned of it some five days <em>prior </em>to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The fingerprint evidence is favorable to McDuffie and potentially impeaching of Barrington, the government\u2019s key witness. Because the government\u2019s disclosure of this evidence near the end of its own case in chief prevented McDuffie from presenting his theory of the case in a coherent manner, the government effectively suppressed it. McDuffie was unable to retain his own experts in forensics or police procedure, or to do any pre-trial discovery into the CD scale\u2019s chain of custody. In light of its late disclosure, the evidence was of no \u201csubstantial value\u201d to McDuffie. <em>United States v. Woodley, </em>9 F.3d 774, 777 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The government\u2019s failure to disclose this evidence was also prejudicial, again because it prevented McDuffie from presenting a coherent version of his theory of the case. <em>See United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 683, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). Detective Barrington was the government\u2019s key witness, and had McDuffie been able to present a coherent theory of evidence tampering, there is a reasonable probability that the jury would have discredited Barrington and reached a different conclusion in the case. The prejudicial effect of the government\u2019s late disclosure is therefore \u201csufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.\u201d <em>Price, </em>566 F.3d at 911. The district court did not err in granting a new trial on the basis of the <em>Brady </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">McDuffie\u2019s motion to suppress evidence sought to exclude items seized from searches of McDuffie\u2019s car and Walnut Street apartment. The Supreme Court recently held in <em>Davis v. United States </em>that \u201csearches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent are not subject to the exclusionary rule.\u201d \u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2419, 2423-24, 180 L.Ed.2d 285 (2011). The search of McDuffie\u2019s car after the police had already handcuffed him and placed him in a patrol car clearly violated <em>Arizona v. Gant, </em>556 U.S. 332, 129 S.Ct. 1710, 173 L.Ed.2d 485 (2009), which was decided after the search of McDuffie\u2019s car but while McDuffie\u2019s case was on appeal. The car search, however, did not violate <em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981), which was binding precedent at the time of the search. Therefore, the search of McDuffie\u2019s car\u2014although unconstitutional under Gant\u2014does not invoke the exclusionary rule and the evidence found in his car is admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">The items seized from McDuffie\u2019s Walnut Street apartment, which the district court deemed \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d and excluded, are also admissible. The exclusionary rule\u2019s \u201csole purpose ... is to deter future Fourth Amendment violations.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2426; <em>see also Hudson v. Michigan, </em>547 U.S. 586, 596-99, 126 S.Ct. 2159, 165 L.Ed.2d 56 (2006) (discussing deterrence as a necessary but not sufficient condition for applying the exclusionary rule). There is no deterrent effect when the police are not culpable. <em>See Davis, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2428-29; <em>see also United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 922, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>(1984). Here, the police obtained a search warrant on the basis of an affidavit that relied, in part, on the evidence found in McDuffie\u2019s car, and searched his apartment pursuant to that warrant. Because the police relied on binding appellate precedent when they seized evidence from McDuffie\u2019s car, and then properly obtained a warrant before searching his apartment, there would be no deterrent effect from excluding the evidence found in the apartment. We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s order granting McDuffie\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b647-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
