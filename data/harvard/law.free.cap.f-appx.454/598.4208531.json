Sessions, III, District Judge for the U.S. District Court for Vermont, Burlington, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b621-18\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-19\">Vegan Outreach, Inc. and Nikki Benoit (together \u201cVegan Outreach\u201d) allege violations of their federal and California constitutional rights due to the Free Speech Policies issued by the Los Angeles Community College District (\u201cLACCD\u201d) and enforced against them at East Los Angeles College (\u201cEast\u201d), an LACCD campus. Vegan Outreach appeals the district court\u2019s denial of its request for a preliminary injunction and dismissal of its damages claims against Ms. Chapa by grant of qualified immunity. Because we lack jurisdiction to address the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>qualified immunity grant,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we turn to the preliminary injunction. Vegan Outreach does not satisfy the criteria for standing to seek a preliminary injunction against Ms. Chapa, and, consequently, we dismiss its appeal and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings in accordance with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">We have jurisdiction over appeals of preliminary injunction decisions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). Regardless of whether the issue is properly raised by the parties, we are \u201cobliged\u201d to evaluate standing as a threshold requirement under Article III. <em>Columbia Basin Apartment Assn. v. City of Pasco, </em>268 F.3d 791, 796-97 (9th Cir.2001) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Vegan Outreach lacks standing to seek a preliminary injunction against Ms. Chapa. To establish standing and invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts, a plaintiff must allege: (1) an injury in fact; (2) causation; and (3) \u201ca likelihood that a favorable decision will redress the plaintiffs alleged injury.\u201d <em>Lopez v. Candaele, </em>630 F.3d 775, 785 (9th Cir.2010) (citing <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Here, Vegan Outreach failed to demonstrate that a preliminary injunction against Ms. Chapa, the sole remaining defendant, would likely redress the harm allegedly caused by the Free Speech Policies. To make out a redressable injury for standing purposes, a plaintiff need only show that \u201cit is likely, although not certain, that his injury can be redressed by a favorable decision.\u201d <em>Wolfson v. Brammer, </em>616 F.3d 1045, 1056 (9th Cir.2010). Since plaintiffs must establish standing independently for each remedy sought, <em>Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envt\u2019l Servs. (TOC), Inc., </em>528 U.S. 167, 185, 120 S.Ct. 693, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000), Vegan Outreach was required to show specifically that the preliminary injunction it seeks against Ms. Chapa is likely to redress its injuries caused by the Free Speech Policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">The record, as it stands, leaves too thin a basis to predict that a preliminary injunction is likely to be effective. Vegan Outreach only alleges Ms. Chapa \u201cis an employee of LAC CD in the Student Services Department of [East],\u201d who, \u201cat times, has been assigned to implement LACCD\u2019s Speech Policies at [East\u2019s] campus.\u201d It does not include in its suit any other officials possessed with the authority to enact, modify, or enforce the Free Speech Policies against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">We have held that First Amendment plaintiffs need not sue every official with authority over an injurious law if a favorable result would likely prevent the law from being applied. <em>Wolfson, </em>616 F.3d at 1057. We further have made clear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>even an attenuated causal chain of events initiated by a favorable ruling suffices for redressability purposes, so long as the chain is likely to end in relieving the plaintiffs harm. <em>See e.g., Renee v. Duncan, </em>623 F.3d 787, 798-99 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">We do not find that a preliminary injunction against only one defendant in this case will likely provide redress against <em>all other </em>officials not under the defendant\u2019s control and empowered to apply the same harmful restrictions against the plaintiff. To take that step would go against the \u201c \u2018basic principle of law that a person who is not a party to an action is not bound by the judgment in that action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Leu v. Int\u2019l Boundary Comm\u2019n, </em>605 F.3d 693, 695 (9th Cir.2010) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7\u00a7 34, 62 cmt. a (1982)). <em>See also Glanton ex rel. ALCOA Prescription Drug Plan v. AdvancePCS Inc., </em>465 F.3d 1123, 1125 (9th Cir.2006) (stating standing does not exist when benefits stemming from a favorable ruling \u201cdepend on an independent actor who retains broad and legitimate discretion the courts cannot presume either to control or to predict.\u201d) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">A preliminary injunction would restrain only Ms. Chapa and could not bind East, LACCD, or any official other than Ms. Chapa who is charged with promulgating or enforcing the Free Speech Policies. Accordingly, we cannot find that Vegan Outreach has satisfied the redressability prong to assert Article III standing, and we are required to dismiss its appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">We order Vegan Outreach\u2019s appeal dismissed and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings in accordance with this disposition. '</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">DISMISSED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b621-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-7\">. A grant of qualified immunity is not \"independently interlocutorily appealable.\u201d <em>Krug v. Lutz, </em>329 F.3d 692, 694 n. 2 (9th Cir.2003). <em>See also Sanchez v. Canales, </em>574 F.3d 1169, 1172-73 (9th Cir.2009) (contrasting the availability of interlocutory jurisdiction to review denials of qualified immunity with the general absence of interlocutory jurisdiction to hear appeals from grants of qualified immunity). The district court did not submit a final order resolving all issues in this case, and our ruling today only dismisses Vegan Outreach\u2019s appeal for lack of standing to seek a preliminary injunction against Ms. Chapa. It does not prevent Vegan Outreach from amending its complaint or pursuing the permanent equitable remedies it seeks. As a result, Vegan Outreach\u2019s appeal is interlocutory. Nor is this an exceptional case in which a grant of qualified immunity is \"inextricably entwined with a denial of qualified immunity,\u201d permitting pendant jurisdiction to hear both claims on appeal. <em>Eng v. Cooley, </em>552 F.3d 1062, 1067 (9th Cir.2009) (internal citation omitted). The district court solely dismissed the damages claim against Ms. Chapa on qualified immunity grounds. Since it is an independent, interlocutory issue, we cannot review the district court\u2019s grant of qualified immunity at this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b623-9\">SILVERMAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ase\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">I respectfully disagree that the plaintiffs lack standing to bring suit to enjoin Chapa. Plaintiffs allege that Chapa personally violated their First Amendment rights by enforcing the College\u2019s speech policies, and they seek to enjoin her from doing so again. The fact that plaintiffs <em>did not </em>also sue other possible defendants for <em>their </em>respective roles in the incident reflects on plaintiffs\u2019 tactics, not their standing. I would reach the merits just as the district court did, and would affirm the denial of a preliminary injunction for the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
