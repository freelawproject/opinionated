Mulligan, which denied his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Yun Zhang, </em>No. A088 379 705 (B.I.A. Aug. 25, 2010), <em>aff'g </em>No. A088 379 705 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 12, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See Shunfu Li v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 141, 146 (2d Cir.2008). The applicable standards of review are well established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">Zhang\u2019s asylum claim was based entirely on his wife\u2019s forced abortion. At the hearing before the IJ, Zhang confirmed that his asylum application contained the complete set of facts concerning his claim and that there was nothing else he wished to add. However, we have explained that a woman\u2019s forced abortion does not qualify as <em>per se </em>persecution with respect to her spouse. <em>See Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 309 (2d Cir.2007). Although Zhang argues that he personally suffered emotional harm due to his wife\u2019s forced abortion, we have rejected this argument, noting that the \u201cprofound emotional loss as a partner and potential parent ... does not change the requirement that we must follow the \u2018ordinary meaning1 of the language chosen by Congress, according to which an individual does not automatically qualify for \u2018refugee\u2019 status on account of a coercive procedure performed on someone else.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the agency did not err in finding that Zhang was not eligible for asylum and withholding of removal based on his wife\u2019s forced abortion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">We note that while a spouse\u2019s forced abortion is not <em>per se </em>persecution, applicants may base their claims on \u201cpersecution that they themselves have suffered or must suffer\u201d on account of their \u201cother resistance\u201d to a coercive family planning policy. <em>See Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 308-10; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). Remand for further development of the record is not required, however, because Zhang raises no \u201cother resistance\u201d claim before this Court, nor did so before the agency. <em>See Shu Wen Sun v. BIA, </em>510 F.3d 377, 381 n. 5 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-12\">Similarly, the agency did not err in finding that Zhang failed to establish eligi-' bility for CAT relief. Contrary to Zhang\u2019s argument, the IJ did not err in failing to analyze Zhang\u2019s eligibility for CAT relief independently, as Zhang did not raise any independent CAT claim before the IJ. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 84(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
