Armstrong, and Tateaka Lewis. Alexander\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and state law claims alleging false imprisonment, abuse of process, malicious prosecution, slander, and defamation all arise from Lewis\u2019s allegation that Alexander raped her, which led to Alexander\u2019s arrest and prosecution for rape, sodomy, and false imprisonment. Alexander here challenges the district court\u2019s (1) denial of his motion to remand to state court, (2) vacatur of a default entered against Lewis, (3) dismissal of claims against the County, Armstrong, and Lewis pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), and (4) award of summary judgment in favor of the City and Stonecypher pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-23\">1. <em>Denial of Remand</em></p>\n<p id=\"b29-24\">On <em>de novo </em>review, <em>see Bounds v. Pine Belt Mental Health Care Res., </em>593 F.3d 209, 214 (2d Cir.2010), we uphold the district court\u2019s denial of Alexander\u2019s mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>tion to remand. The City\u2019s and Stonecypher\u2019s notice of removal was timely for the reasons stated by the district court. Alexander\u2019s notice of claim was a condition precedent to the filing of his initial pleading in state court. <em>See </em>N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law \u00a7 50\u2014e(1)(a); <em>Scantlebury v. N.Y. City Health &amp; Hosps. Corp., </em>4 N.Y.3d 606, 607, 797 N.Y.S.2d 394, 395, 830 N.E.2d 292 (2005). It was not itself the initial pleading, the filing of which would have commenced defendants\u2019 time to file their notice of removal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b); <em>Moltner v. Starbucks Coffee Co., </em>624 F.3d 34, 36 (2d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Alexander\u2019s argument that the district court was required to hold an evidentiary hearing pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(c)(5) is without merit, as that statute by its plain terms provides for a hearing only where a defendant removes a criminal prosecution from state to federal court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(c)(1); <em>United States v. White, </em>980 F.2d 836, 841 (2d Cir.1992). Because Alexander raises no challenge on appeal to the district court\u2019s determination that the City and Stonecypher were not required to secure consent from the County, Armstrong, and Lewis before filing a notice of removal, we deem that argument abandoned and do not address it further. <em>See LoSacco v. City of Middletown, </em>71 F.3d 88, 92-93 (2d Cir.1995) (finding that issues not raised in <em>pro se </em>party\u2019s opening brief were abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">2. <em>Vacatur of Default</em></p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">We review the district court\u2019s vacatur order only for abuse of discretion, <em>see Enron Oil Corp. v. Diakuhara, </em>10 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.1993), which we do not identify here given the district court\u2019s reasonable determinations that Lewis, a <em>pro se </em>defendant, established that her default was not willful and that Lewis had colorable defenses to the claims against her. Further, Alexander was not prejudiced by vacatur because the other defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss were pending at the time of Lewis\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">3. <em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) Dismissal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of Alexander\u2019s claims pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) <em>de novo, </em>construing the complaint liberally, accepting all factual allegations therein as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor. <em>See Harris v. Mills, </em>572 F.3d 66, 71-72 (2d Cir.2009). We affirm the dismissal of all claims against the County and Armstrong as well as the malicious prosecution and abuse of process claims against the City and Stoneeypher for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s well-reasoned order. Alexander has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claim alleging that Lewis slandered and defamed him on October 5, 2007, by failing to discuss that allegation in his appellate brief. <em>See LoSacco v. City of Middletown, </em>71 F.3d at 92-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">4. <em>Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b30-11\">Finally, we review the district court\u2019s summary judgment rulings <em>de novo, </em>drawing all reasonable inferences from the record in Alexander\u2019s favor. <em>See Miller v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, LLP, </em>321 F.3d 292, 300 (2d Cir.2003). Like the district court, we conclude that Stoneeypher had probable cause to arrest Alexander because there is no evidence that Stonecypher had reason to question the credibility of Lewis\u2019s rape accusation. <em>See Curley v. Vill. of Suffern, </em>268 F.3d 65, 70 (2d Cir.2001). Though Alexander claims he was wrongfully detained before Stoneeypher knew about Lewis\u2019s accusation, we conclude, like the district court, that it was objectively reasonable for Stoneeypher to believe that he had probable cause temporarily to detain Alexander in order to confirm whether, as Alexander stated upon arriving at the police station, he was want<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>ed as a suspect in a rape case. <em>See Jenkins v. City of New York, </em>478 F.3d 76, 87 (2d Cir.2007). Finally, we conclude that there is no evidence that Alexander was wrongfully detained pursuant to a municipal policy or custom. Thus, Alexander\u2019s claim against the City was properly dismissed. <em>See Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 690, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">We have considered Alexander\u2019s remaining arguments on appeal and conclude that they are without merit. The judgment in favor of defendants is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
