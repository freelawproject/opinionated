Summary judgment was based solely on Jones\u2019 failure to file a petition for a writ of administrative mandamus to challenge the City Council\u2019s decision. The district court concluded that this failure renders the City Council\u2019s decision <em>res judicata. </em>We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-16\">Under California law, a party challenging an administrative decision \u201cmade as a result of a proceeding in which by law a hearing is required to be given, evidence is required to be taken, and discretion in the determination of facts is vested,\u201d is generally required to file a petition for a writ of administrative mandamus in order to challenge that decision. Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 1094.5(a). Orange Cove Municipal Code \u00a7 15.17.070 required the Orange Cove City Council to hold a hearing and take evidence when considering Jones\u2019 appeal. Under California law, if a party fails to file for a writ of administrative mandamus when one is required and, instead, collaterally attacks the administrative decision in court, the administrative decision is final under the doctrine of <em>res judicata. Patrick Media Grp., Inc. v. Cal. Coastal Comm\u2019n, </em>9 Cal.App.4th 592, 11 Cal.Rptr.2d 824, 839-40 (1992). We generally afford collateral estoppel effect to municipal decisions made within California. <em>See Eilrich v. Remas, </em>839 F.2d 630, 633 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-17\">In response to an order that her building be repaired or razed, Jones filed two complaints. In one, Jones sought damages and injunctive relief, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In the second, Jones filed a pleading entitled \u201cWrit of Prohibition.\u201d Despite its title, we conclude that this \u201cWrit of Prohibition\u201d serves the purpose of a writ of administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>tive mandamus. California law provides that when a petition for a writ of administrative mandamus is filed, \u201c[t]he inquiry in such a case shall extend to the questions whether the respondent has proceeded without, or in excess of jurisdiction; whether there was a fair trial; and whether there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion.\u201d Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 1094.5(b). Jones\u2019 \u201cWrit of Prohibition\u201d touches on all three of the inquiries permitted on administrative mandamus. In this pleading, Jones alleges that the City Council lacked jurisdiction for its decision. She also alleges that the City Council\u2019s decision was politically motivated, reasonably prompting an inquiry into whether her trial was fair and whether the City Council abused its discretion. Jones also requests that \u201cthe court issue a peremptory writ ... commanding respondent to refrain from enforcing\u201d the decision that she challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Under California pleading rules, \u201cneither mislabeling nor a defective prayer will bar relief justified by proper allegations and proof.\u201d <em>Peck\u2019s Liquors, Inc. v. Superior Court, </em>221 Cal.App.2d 772, 34 Cal.Rptr. 735, 736 (1963). Thus, where the substance of the petitioner\u2019s argument for relief is misclassified as a petition for the wrong writ, the petition should be treated as a petition for the appropriate writ. <em>See, e.g., Broden v. Marin Humane Soc\u2019y, </em>70 Cal.App.4th 1212, 83 Cal.Rptr.2d 235, 237 &amp; n. 3 (1999). Therefore, Jones\u2019 \u201cWrit of Prohibition\u201d should be treated as a petition for a writ of administrative mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The district court erred in refusing to treat this pleading as a petition for a writ of administrative mandamus. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b624-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
