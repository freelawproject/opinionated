Liab. Litig., </em>418 F.3d 372, 378 (3d Cir.2005). It may be \u201cused to confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>(internal citation and quotation omitted). To demonstrate that mandamus is appropriate, a petitioner must establish that he or she has \u201cno other adequate means\u201d to obtain the relief requested, and that he or she has a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right to issuance of the writ. <em>Madden v. Myers, </em>102 F.3d 74, 79 (3d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Here, there is no basis for granting the petition for a writ of mandamus, as Jordan does not have a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d to the relief requested. First, to the extent that he asks this Court to stay the state court proceedings, state courts are not \u201cinferior courts,\u201d over which we have mandamus power, and we lack the ability to compel action by state courts or officials in connection with state court proceedings. <em>See In re Grand Jury Proceedings, </em>654 F.2d 268, 278 (3d Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Second, Jordan also appears to seek an order compelling the District Court to rule on his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint and/or his motion for a preliminary injunction. Although district courts are generally given discretion to control their dockets, <em>see In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., </em>685 F.2d 810, 817 (3d Cir.1982), an appellate court may issue a writ of mandamus when an undue delay in adjudication is \u201ctantamount to a failure to exercise jurisdiction,\u201d <em>Madden, </em>102 F.3d at 79. At this time, there is no basis for compelling the District Court to act, as the matter appears to be progressing in a timely manner. The District Court granted Jordan\u2019s motion to reopen the proceedings in April 2011, denied his application for counsel in July 2011, and granted his motion to supplement the proceedings in October 2011. Jordan\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction was docketed in April 2011, and thus has been pending for several months. While the decision on this motion may be considered to be delayed, such a delay is not extraordinary. We are confident that the District Court will timely take action. Accordingly, Jordan\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus will be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
