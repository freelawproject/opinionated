Because this appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">In 1989, a jury found Manna guilty of racketeering and related offenses. The District Court subsequently sentenced him to an aggregate term of 80 years and a fine of $250,000.00. This Court affirmed his convictions and sentences on direct appeal, <em>United States v. Manna, </em>919 F.2d 733 (3d Cir.1990) (table), and the United States Supreme Court denied his petition for writ of certiorari. <em>Manna v. United States, </em>499 U.S. 949, 111 S.Ct. 1418, 113 L.Ed.2d 471 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">In April 1997, Manna filed a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. In his motion, Manna claimed that his trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance, and that the police and prosecution had engaged in various forms of misconduct. The District Court denied the motion on its merits. (D.N.J. No. 97-cv-2034.) Manna moved for reconsideration, but the court denied his request. We denied Manna\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability. (C.A. No. 98-5131.)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">Next, in September 2003, Manna filed a motion to compel discovery. In his motion, Manna requested information pertaining to the District Judge\u2019s impartiality during his \u00a7 2255 proceedings. The District Court construed the motion as a second motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2255, and denied it. Upon review, this Court found that the motion instead implicated Rule 60(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but nonetheless denied relief. (C.A. No. 04-4282.) In 2005, Manna filed another Rule 60(b) motion, which essentially repeated the allegations of his first. The District Court again denied relief, and we again denied Manna\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-12\">Meanwhile, Manna filed in this Court an application for authorization to file a second or successive habeas petition. Manna claimed that he had newly discovered evidence that one of the government\u2019s witnesses at trial had been working as a government informant at the time. According to Manna, this information had been concealed from the defense and was not revealed until the witness testified in an unrelated trial in 2006. By order entered June 18, 2007, we denied his request on the ground that his claims did not rest on \u201ca new and retroactive rule of constitutional law or new facts showing a high probability of actual innocence.\u201d (C.A. No. 07-2456, citing <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 530, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005).)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-13\">In March 2009, Manna filed the present habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the District Court alleging that he is innocent of the racketeering and related crimes for which he was convicted. In support of his petition, Manna relies on the same allegations that formed the basis of his previous motions. By order entered October 20, 2009, the District Court dismissed the petition. The present appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2258(a). We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its factual findings. <em>See Ruggiano v. Reish, </em>307 F.3d 121, 126-27 (3d Cir.2002). We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">A federal prisoner can seek relief under \u00a7 2241 only if the remedy provided by \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Cradle v. U.S. ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002). A \u00a7 2255 motion is not \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d merely because the sentencing court has denied relief, <em>Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 539, or because the petitioner cannot meet the gatekeeping requirements of \u00a7 2255, <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">As noted above, Manna has already filed at least one unsuccessful motion pursuant to \u00a7 2255 in the sentencing court, and an application to this Court for permission to file another, both of which essentially raised the same claims he raises here. The fact that Manna cannot prevail under \u00a7 2255 does not render it \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to protect him. <em>See Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 539. Therefore, the District Court properly dismissed Manna\u2019s petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Accordingly, because there is no substantial question presented by this appeal, we will summarily affirm. <em>See </em>Third Cir. LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
