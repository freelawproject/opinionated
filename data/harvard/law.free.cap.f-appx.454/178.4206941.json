He was sentenced to concurrent terms of 180 months in prison. Cobb appealed. In accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Cobb\u2019s attorney has filed a brief certifying that there are no meritorious issues for appeal but questioning the adequacy of Cobb\u2019s Rule 11 hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>ings. Cobb received notice of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has failed to do so. In his pro se notice of appeal, however, Cobb asserted that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during his plea process, and that the district court erred in imposing a sentence above his Guidelines range. We affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">First, Cobb, through counsel, questions whether the district court sufficiently complied with the requirements of Rule 11 when accepting his pleas. Prior to accepting a guilty plea, a district court must conduct a plea colloquy in which it informs the defendant of, and determines that the defendant comprehends, the nature of the charge to which he is pleading guilty, any mandatory minimum penalty, the maximum possible penalty he faces, and the rights he is relinquishing by pleading guilty. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b); <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116 (4th Cir.1991). The court must also determine whether there is a factual basis for the plea. <em>DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d at 120. \u201cIn reviewing the adequacy of compliance with Rule 11, this Court should accord deference to the trial court\u2019s decision as to how best to conduct the mandated colloquy with the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116. In the absence of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea, this court reviews the adequacy of a guilty plea pursuant to Rule 11 for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">We have thoroughly reviewed the record in this case and conclude that the district court substantially complied with the mandates of Rule 11 when accepting both of Cobb\u2019s guilty pleas. The record affirmatively shows there was a factual basis for his pleas, that he understood the constitutional rights he waived in pleading guilty, and that his pleas were knowing and voluntary. Accordingly, we affirm Cobb\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Next, to the extent Cobb seeks to appeal his sentence, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to consider his appeal. The district court sentenced Cobb in accordance with the sentencing agreement that he and the Government reached pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C). The statute governing appellate review of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(c) (2006), limits the circumstances under which a defendant may appeal a sentence to which he stipulated in a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement to claims that \u201chis sentence was imposed in violation of law [or] was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>146 F.3d 796, 797 &amp; n. 1 (10th Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Here, Cobb\u2019s sentence was less than the statutory maximum of twenty years of imprisonment for even a single violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), and his 180-month sentence was precisely what he and the Government agreed was appropriate in his case. Accordingly, review of his sentence is precluded by \u00a7 3742(c), and we dismiss Cobb\u2019s appeals as they relate to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Lastly, we find that Cobb\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not suitable for review on direct appeal. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel generally are not cognizable on direct appeal unless the record conclusively establishes counsel\u2019s \u201cobjectively unreasonable performance\u201d and resulting prejudice. <em>United States v. Benton, </em>523 F.3d 424, 435 (4th Cir.2008). Instead, ineffective assistance claims should be raised in a motion brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2011) in order to promote sufficient development of the record. <em>United States v. Baptiste, </em>596 F.3d 214, 216 n. 1 (4th Cir.2010). The record before us fails <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>to offer any support for Cobb\u2019s allegations regarding his counsel\u2019s performance. We therefore decline to consider his ineffective assistance claim at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Cobb\u2019s convictions and dismiss his appeals to the extent that they challenge his sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Cobb, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Cobb requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Cobb. We dispense with oral argument because the materials before the court adequately presented the facts and legal contentions and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
