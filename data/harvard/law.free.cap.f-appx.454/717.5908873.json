Pacheco argues that the administrative law judge (1) erroneously failed to give controlling weight to statements of Pacheco\u2019s treating psychiatrist, H. Botros-Mikhail, that Pacheco\u2019s major depression disorder prevents him from working; (2) failed to consider Pacheco\u2019s back pain, high blood pressure, or side effects of his medication in assessing his residual functional capacity; and (3) denied him due process. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">We review the decision by the Commissioner \u201cto determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). \u201c \u2018Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1439 (11th Cir.1997)). That review \u201cprecludes deciding the facts anew, making credibility determinations, or re-weighing the evidence.\u201d <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">Substantial evidence supports the decision to discount Botros-Mikhail\u2019s statement in April 2007 that Pacheco\u2019s depression disorder rendered him unable to handle job-related stress or interact socially. Botros-Mikhail\u2019s statement, which was made in a form used to request food stamps, is inconsistent with his medical notes about Pacheco\u2019s mental condition, the opinions of other doctors who evaluated Pacheco, and Pacheco\u2019s testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 1212; <em>Edwards v. Sullivan, </em>937 F.2d 580, 583-84 (11th Cir.1991). Botros-Mikhail recorded in his March, April, and June 2007 medical notes that Pacheco\u2019s depression had subsided with medication. In November 2007, Gerald Mussenden, a psychologist, opined that Pacheco was \u201cemotionally stable,\u201d could recall and complete tasks, could interact socially, and did not suffer from any neurological problems. And Pacheco testified that he interacted four to five days a week with his minister and members of his church, he contacted people regularly to request transportation to appointments, and he cooked, cleaned, shopped, and managed his finances. The administrative law judge had \u201cgood cause\u201d to reject Botros-Mikhail\u2019s April 2007 statement. <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">Pacheco argues that his case should be remanded for the administrative law judge to consider six new exhibits, but Pacheco fails to establish that the exhibits are \u201cnoncumulative\u201d or are \u201cmaterial such that a reasonable possibility exists that the new evidence would change the administrative result,\u201d <em>Falge v. Apfel, </em>150 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.1998). Two letters and two verification forms prepared by Botros-Mikhail are cumulative of evidence already in the record that Pacheco suffers from depression disorder, and the attorney letter and police report do not contain information material to his eligibility for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-13\">The decision \u00f3f the administrative law judge reflects that he considered all of the medical evidence in determining Pacheco\u2019s residual functional capacity. Pacheco argues that the decision failed to account for an injury to his lower back, but the administrative law judge found that Pacheco suffered degenerative lumbar disc disease with chronic back pain, 20 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>\u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(ii), (c), and was limited to sedentary work with restrictions on weight and mobility. That finding is consistent with the medical records of a treating physician, Emma Ocampo, that by April 2005 Pacheco did not require any pain medication for his back and could walk on his heels and with the reports issued by two examiners in March 2006 and a physical therapist in May 2006 that Pacheco was falsely \u201cmagnifying\u201d his pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Pacheco also argues that the administrative law judge decision failed to account for three other conditions, but Pacheco failed to present any medical evidence that these alleged conditions limited his ability to work. Pacheco contends that he suffers from high cholesterol, but the only evidence of that condition is a self-report that Pacheco made to an emergency room physician. Pacheco contends that he has high blood pressure, but Dr. Ocampo recorded in April 2007 that Pacheco\u2019s blood pressure had returned to normal. Pacheco also complains about the side effects of anti-depression medication, but in May 2007, five months after he began taking the medication, Dr. Botros-Mikhail recorded that Pacheco did not report any side effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The administrative law judge did not violate Pacheco\u2019s right to due process. Pacheco was represented at his hearing, and \u201cthe record as a whole reveals that no relevant facts, documents, or other evidence were omitted from ... consideration [by] or [in the] findings\u201d of the administrative law judge. <em>Smith v. Schweiker, </em>677 F.2d 826, 830 (11th Cir.1982). Pacheco submitted numerous records from physicians about his physical and mental conditions, and the hypothetical questions that the administrative law judge posed to the vocational expert revealed that he had considered Pacheco\u2019s medical records as well as his testimony about his ailments. When the vocational expert stated that Pacheco would likely have to satisfy a \u201cpace\u201d requirement to work as a sorter, the administrative law judge referred Pacheco to a psychologist for further evaluation. Pacheco received a full and fair hearing before the administrative law judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">The denial of Pacheco\u2019s application for benefits is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
