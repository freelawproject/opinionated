Davis (Davis) appeals the district court\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>granting Defendants-Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action and denying his motion to amend his complaint. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we do not recount additional facts except as necessary to explain the decision. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 636(c)(3) and 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">\u201cFederal courts must accord a state court judgment the same preclusive effect that the judgment would receive in the rendering state\u2019s courts.\u201d <em>Skysign Int\u2019l, Inc. v. City &amp; Cnty. of Honolulu, </em>276 F.3d 1109, 1115 (9th Cir.2002) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738). \u201cThis rule extends to state administrative adjudications of legal and factual issue[s].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Misischia v. Pirie, </em>60 F.3d 626, 629 (9th Cir.1995)). However, \u201c[t]o have preclusive effect in federal court, the state administrative determination must [also] satisfy the requirements of fairness set out in\u201d <em>United States v. Utah Construction and Mining Co., </em>384 U.S. 394, 86 S.Ct. 1545, 16 L.Ed.2d 642 (1966). <em>Misischia, </em>60 F.3d at 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Hawaii state courts give preclusive effect to an administrative agency\u2019s findings if \u201c(1) the issue decided in the prior action is identical to the issue in the current action, (2) a final judgment on the merits was issued, and (3) the parties in the current action are the same or in privity with the parties in the prior action.\u201d <em>Skysign Int\u2019l, </em>276 F.3d at 1115 (citing <em>Santos v. State, Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>64 Haw. 648, 646 P.2d 962, 965-66 (1982) (per curiam)). \u201c \u2018[A]ll grounds of [a] claim ... [that] might have been properly litigated in the first action but were not litigated or decided\u2019 \u201d are precluded. <em>Kauhane v. Acutron Co., </em>71 Haw. 458, 795 P.2d 276, 278 (1990) (quoting <em>Morneau v. Stark Enters., Ltd., </em>56 Haw. 420, 539 P.2d 472, 474-75 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The requirements of res judicata are satisfied. <em>See Skysign Int\u2019l, </em>276 F.3d at 1115. Davis had the opportunity to litigate the claims asserted in his \u00a7 1983 action before the Hawaii Circuit Court. <em>See </em>Haw.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 91-14(b), (g); <em>HOH Corp. v. Motor Vehicle Indus. Licensing Bd., </em>69 Haw. 135, 736 P.2d 1271, 1275 (1987). Because Davis chose not to appeal the decision of the County of Maui\u2019s Board of Water Supply (the BWS), that decision became final and preclusive. <em>See Misischia, </em>60 F.3d at 629; <em>Kauhane, </em>795 P.2d at 278. The fairness requirements of <em>Utah Construction </em>are met as well. <em>See Misischia, </em>60 F.3d at 629. Therefore, the BWS decision precludes Davis\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">The district court correctly denied Davis leave to amend his complaint because res judicata would bar relief even with his proposed amendments, and, thus, amendment would be futile. <em>See Cervantes v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., </em>656 F.3d 1034, 1041-42 (9th Cir.2011) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">Because all of Davis\u2019s claims are precluded, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision dismissing Davis\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action with prejudice. We need not reach the issue of whether Davis\u2019s procedural due process claim is an impermissible collateral attack, and we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b604-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
