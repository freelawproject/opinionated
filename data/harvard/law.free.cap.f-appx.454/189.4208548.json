The district court sentenced Negrete to eighty-four months of imprisonment, and he now appeals. Appellate counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), questioning whether the district court erred in calculating the advisory Guidelines range. Negrete was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but did not do so. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">On appeal, counsel questions whether the district court erred in refusing to apply a reduction in offense level under the Guidelines for 'Negrete\u2019s minor role in the offense. We review a sentence for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Layton, </em>564 F.3d 330, 335 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. de</em>nied; \u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 290, 175 L.Ed.2d 194 (2009). In so doing, we first examine the sentence for \u201csignificant procedural error,\u201d including \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) [ (2006) ] factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">Moreover, in reviewing the district court\u2019s calculations under the Guidelines, we \u201creview the district court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Manigan, </em>592 F.3d 621, 626 (4th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We will \u201cfind clear error only if, on the entire evidence, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 631 (internal quotation marks, alteration, and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-15\">Under the Guidelines, a defendant who is only a \u201cminor participant\u201d in a criminal activity may have his offense level reduced by two levels. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 3B1.2(b) (2010). This reduction applies to a defendant who is \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant,\u201d \u201cbut whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3B 1.2(b), cmt. n. 3(A) <em>&amp; </em>n. 5. In deciding whether the defendant played a minor role, the \u201ccritical inquiry is thus not just whether the defendant has done fewer bad acts than his co-defendants, but whether the defendant\u2019s conduct is material or essential to committing the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Pratt, </em>239 F.3d 640, 646 (4th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and ci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>tation omitted). The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that he played a minor role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Akinkoye, </em>185 F.3d 192, 202 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">We have thoroughly reviewed the record and conclude that the district court did not err in calculating the advisory Guidelines range. Moreover, the court considered the arguments of the parties and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and thoroughly explained its chosen sentence. <em>See United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 330 (4th Cir.2009) (district court must conduct individualized assessment based on the particular facts of each case, whether sentence is above, below, or within the guidelines range). We conclude, therefore, that the sentence is procedurally reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">We have examined the entire record in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders </em>and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform Negrete, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Negrete requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Negrete. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
