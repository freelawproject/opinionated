INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b841-23\">During the building boom in South Florida in the early 2000s, many within the construction industry played fast and loose with federal and state regulations to maximize profits and minimize taxes. These companies were able to find willing partners in this pursuit, and Juan Rene Caro (\u201cCaro\u201d) was accused of being one of these partners. Caro\u2019s scheme allegedly involved using fictitious or \u201cshell\u201d construction corporations to avoid taxes and insurance costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-24\">Normally, employers withhold from employees\u2019 paychecks monies paid into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>federal treasury; social security and payroll taxes. These legitimate construction companies, however, were trying to avoid these \u201cobstacles,\u201d so that they could employ illegal aliens. One cannot simply write a payroll check to an illegal alien, as such employment is illegal. In addition, these illegal aliens could not open legitimate bank accounts where they could either deposit or cash paychecks.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">If the alleged scheme worked properly, all of these \u201cobstacles\u201d would be overcome. A legitimate construction company would be approached by Caro or an associate and offered an alternative to paying the taxes and insurance costs associated with employees. Rather than pay employees by check, the legitimate construction company would write a check to a shell corporation making it appear that the shell company was a subcontractor and the employer of the legitimate construction company\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The shell corporation would allegedly cash that check at Caro\u2019s check cashing store, or another check cashing store. A percentage of the face value of the check was \u201ccharged\u201d as a fee, with the remaining cash returned to the shell corporation. The shell corporation, in turn, provided the cash to the legitimate construction company. The cash, in its final voyage of the journey, was payed to employees, including illegal aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">In addition to evading payroll taxes, the scheme allegedly allowed the legitimate corporation to avoid the expense of workers\u2019 compensation insurance. This was accomplished when the shell company fraudulently procured workers compensation insurance and permitted the legitimate company\u2019s employees to work under that insurance certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">The shell companies, on the other hand, were then left holding the bag. They were responsible for the payroll taxes and insurance premiums but never paid them. Instead, when all the unpaid taxes and premiums drew scrutiny, usually within a year or eighteen months, the shell company simply dissolved leaving these debts unpaid. Another shell company would quickly be incorporated and the cycle would begin anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">The flaw in Caro\u2019s scheme was underestimating the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d). Financial institutions are required to complete and file with the IRS a currency transaction report (\u201cCTR\u201d) for currency transactions involving more than $10,000. Caro allegedly made material misrepresentations in the CTRs for the transactions with these shell companies, which eventually led to him being investigated by the IRS and being charged in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">II. CHARGES</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">A thirty-three count Superceding Indictment was returned by a federal grand jury based upon this alleged scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-12\">A. Count One-Conspiracy</p>\n<p id=\"b842-13\">Count One charged a conspiracy between Caro, Alfredo Filomeno Gonzalez, Jose Jorge Chaoui, Oscar Alberto Valle, Meylin Maria Morales, as well as Maytemar Corporation, d/b/a La Bamba Check Cashing (\u201cLa Bamba\u201d), and others; in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 871. It was alleged that the conspiracy existed to willfully violate currency transaction reporting requirements; in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5313(a); 5324(a)(2), (d)(2). The purpose of the conspiracy allegedly was to unlawfully enrich the co-conspirators by earning substantial commissions, or \u201cfees,\u201d by cashing checks for these shell corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-14\">In furtherance of the conspiracy, co-conspirators filed CTRs for transactions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>with the shell companies that contained materially false statements and omissions of material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">It was alleged from August 2005 until January 2008, that the co-conspirators used various shell corporations and allowed customers to write checks payable to those shell companies. The advantage of this was to make it appear that the shell company was an actual subcontractor, engaged in construction work, for the legitimate company. These checks were cashed for a \u201cfee,\u201d at La Bamba, or an associated check cashing store, despite not being payable to the person conducting the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Thereafter, Caro and other co-conspirators allegedly caused La Bamba to file CTRs falsely stating that the parties involved \u25a0 in the check cashing transaction were the shell companies and their nominee owners. This misrepresented the true source of the money and the true identities of the individuals conducting the transaction. From August 2005 until January 2008, the co-conspirators filed false CTRs that reflected transactions totaling more that $132.7 million. In addition, Caro payed a portion of the \u201cfee\u201d from the transaction to the co-conspirator as payment for the use of the shell company.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">The Superceding Indictment alleged twenty-one overt acts of the conspiracy. These overt acts listed activities such as: Caro meeting with Miguel Obispo, the owner of an associated check cashing store, and discussing cashing checks in exchange for cash at an agreed fee; filing false CTRs for transactions involving Fast Construction, Group, Inc. (\u201cFast\u201d), Spirit Construction Group Corporation (\u201cSpirit\u201d), SB Construction Group Corporation (\u201cSB\u201d), and PAW Construction (\u201cPAW\u201d); co-conspirator Chaoui\u2019s accepting checks on July 23, 2007, from Obispo payable to the shell companies; and Caro giving Obispo a business card from DJ Construction Group, Inc. (\u201cDJ\u201d) for the purpose of Obispo contacting Valle and becoming a part of this conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">B. Counts Two-Seventeen</p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">Counts Two through Seventeen charged Caro, Gonzalez, Chaoui, Valle, Morales, and La Bamba with causing and attempting to cause a domestic financial institution to file CTRs that contained materially false statements and omissions of material facts; in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5313(a); 5324(a)(2), (d)(2); and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Count Two alleged that Caro and Chaoui, on April 6, 2007, accepted checks payable to Spirit totaling $79,965, and caused and attempted to cause the filing of a false CTR from that transaction stating that Marvin Marroquin had cashed the check.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-14\">Count Six alleged that Caro and Chaoui accepted checks payable to Spirit, on May 18, 2007, in the amount of $233,836, and caused and attempted to cause a false CTR from that transaction to be filed stating that Marvin Marroquin had cashed the check.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Count Eight alleged that on July 12, 2007, Caro accepted checks payable to PAW in the amount of $60,120, and caused and attempted to cause a false CTR to be filed from that transaction stating that Carlos Martinez cashed the check.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Count Nine alleged that on July 31, 2007, Caro accepted checks payable to PAW in the amount of $46,050, and caused and at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>tempted to cause a false CTR to be filed from that transaction stating that Carlos Martinez cashed the check. Count Ten alleged that on August 15, 2006, Caro and Gonzalez accepted checks payable to PAW in the amount of $56,233, and caused and attempted to cause a false CTR to be filed from that transaction stating that Carlos Martinez cashed the check. Count Eleven alleged that on August 16, 2007, Caro and Gonzales accepted checks payable to PAW in the amount of $44,325, and caused and attempted to cause a false CTR to be filed from that transaction stating that Carlos Martinez cashed the check. Count Twelve alleged that on August 22, 2007, Caro and Gonzales accepted checks payable to PAW in the amount of $56,042, and caused and attempted to cause a false CTR to be filed from that transaction stating that Carlos Martinez cashed the check. Count Thirteen alleged that on August 23, 2007, Caro and Gonzales accepted checks payable to PAW in the amount of $41,208, and caused and attempted to cause a false CTR to be filed from that transaction stating that Carlos Martinez cashed the check. Count Fourteen alleged that on September 5, 2007, Caro and Gonzales accepted checks payable to PAW in the amount of $107,812, and caused and attempted to cause a false CTR to be filed from that transaction stating that Carlos Martinez cashed the check.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Count Fifteen alleged that on September 5, 2007, Caro, Valle, and Morales accepted and cashed checks payable to DJ in the amount of $100,288, and caused and attempted to cause the filing of a false CTR that stated that G.V. had cashed the check. Count Sixteen alleged that on September 26, 2007, Caro, Gonzalez, Valle, and Morales accepted and cashed checks payable to DJ in the amount of $72,447, and caused and attempted to cause the filing of a false CTR that stated that G.V. had cashed the check. Count Seventeen alleged that on September 26, 2007, Caro and Gonzales accepted checks payable to PAW in the amount of $55,015, and filed a false CTR from that transaction stating that Carlos Martinez cashed the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">C. Counts Eighteen-Thirty-Three</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">Counts Eighteen through Thirty-Three charged La Bamba with filing false CTRs; in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5313(a); 5322(b); and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. These counts involve the same transactions alleged in Counts Two through Seventeen, in which Caro was a Defendant but not La Bamba.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">III. PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">Caro, Gonzalez, Chaoui, and La Bamba were jointly tried during a lengthy jury trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Vior dire </em>began on November 5, 2008, closing arguments were concluded on January 23, 2009, and the jury returned verdicts on February 9, 2009. The Government\u2019s witness list included 38 witnesses, and its exhibit list contained well over 600 exhibits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> By their verdict, the jury found Caro guilty of Counts One, Two, Six, and Eight through Seventeen. La Bamba was convicted of Counts One, Eighteen, Nineteen, and Twenty-Two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>through Thirty-Three.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The jury could not reach verdicts as to Gonzalez and Chaoui, and the District Court declared a mistrial as to them. They both subsequently plead guilty to other offenses. Caro was sentenced to a 216-month total term of imprisonment, which was below the applicable sentencing guideline range, and La Bamba was placed on five years probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Appellants Caro and La Bamba challenge their convictions on the grounds that the District Court committed multiple errors throughout the trial. Specifically, appellants maintain: there was insufficient evidence to support the convictions; that the District Court permitted the government\u2019s expert witness to impermissibly substitute his own ideal standard for one reflecting \u201creal world\u201d financial operations; that the District Court erred by allowing cross-examination into defense counsel\u2019s violation of the rule of sequestration and the cross-examination of Caro\u2019s industry expert about a 27-year-old felony conviction; the District Court improperly excluded the testimony as to the presence of OSHA inspectors at construction sites; the District Court improperly struck a portion of Caro\u2019s closing argument; the District Court permitted a government witness to testify about Caro\u2019s right to remain silent; that the government committed numerous instances of misconduct; the District Court erred by failing to sever the trial as to the codefendants; that jury deliberations were tainted and the District Court improperly destroyed a partial verdict; and that the District Court improperly instructed the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Appellants also challenge their sentences contending that the District Court erred in calculating the sentencing guidelines by characterizing Caro as an organizer/leader of a fraudulent financial reporting conspiracy, in applying a two-level obstruction-of-justice enhancement, and imposing a 216-month sentence which was procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">We reject Appellants\u2019 attacks on their convictions and sentences and conclude that they should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">IY. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b845-12\">The following evidence was presented at trial in support of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-13\">A. Bank Secrecy Act</p>\n<p id=\"b845-14\">The Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act (\u201cBank Secrecy Act\u201d) enacted in 1970, Pub.L. 91-508, Tit. II, 84 Stat. 1118, delegates to the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to establish regulations for financial institutions. One of those regulations directs that financial institutions must complete and file with the IRS a CTR for currency transactions involving more than $10,000. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5313; old 31 C.F.R. 103.22 (75 FR 65806-01). All financial institutions, including check-cashing stores, are subject to Bank Secrecy Act (\u201cBSA\u201d) regulations and reporting requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-16\">The BSA imposes duties upon financial institutions to keep certain records, obtain particular information, file reports, and establish an effective anti-money laundering compliance program. A financial institution is required to have a compliance officer, who is responsible for the institution\u2019s following all BSA requirements. Although the compliance officer is not required to personally prepare every CTR, that officer is required to sign the CTR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>and oversee the process. A financial institution\u2019s officers and directors must ensure that the BSA\u2019s requirements are fulfilled. Although BSA duties may be delegated, financial institutions retain ultimate responsibility for compliance and no agency relationship may cancel that responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Financial institutions must generate a \u201cpaper trail\u201d to identify potential taxable income and to prevent financial crimes. The Code of Federal Regulations sets forth the instructions for completing and filing CTRs and directions are attached to the form. Within the IRS, the Detroit Computer Center maintains a major database of all CTR information called the Currency Bank Retrieval System (\u201cCBRS\u201d), which is available to law enforcement agencies with jurisdiction to investigate financial crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Peter D. Djinis, a government expert, explained to the jury that the BSA required financial institutions to report currency transactions over $10,000 to the government.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He explained that a CTR must identify the date, transaction amount, the person or entity on whose behalf the transaction took place, and the individual who was physically present at the institution to conduct the transaction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Each CTR consists of three parts. Part 1 is concerned with identities of parties to a transaction; section A requires the financial institution to identify and report the beneficiary of the transaction, meaning the party on whose behalf the transaction is conducted, while section B requires the financial institution to identify and report the actual conductor of the transaction, that is, the party who is either depositing and/or receiving more than $10,000 in currency.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-12\">Part 2 requires the date, the amount of the transaction, and the form of the transaction. If the aggregate amount of different transactions by the same entity during the same day exceeds $10,000 in currency, then a CTR must be filed. This prohibits the structuring of transactions of less than $10,000 to avoid reporting what in actuality is a series of daily transactions that amount to $10,000 or more.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-13\">Part 3 requires the names of the financial institution where the transaction occurred, the person completing the form, and the person approving the completion and filing of the form. The form provides extra pages to list multiple names if more than one entity is involved in the transaction or if multiple financial institutions are involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-14\">Djinis, further, explained that a financial services institution is required to know its customers. An institution must not simply identify its customers, but it has an obligation to understand who the customers actually are and identify the nature of their business and activity. Customers who engage in repeated transactions involving large amounts of cash generate greater risk and exposure for the financial institution and it is these customers who the institution must place under greater scrutiny. Key indicators of risky transactions are amounts, frequency, and volume of a customer\u2019s transactions. Thus, for money services businesses, like check-cashing stores, they must be cautious that they are doing business with the persons who are complying with the CTR requirements rather than trying to avoid them.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>Finally, Djinis hypothesized that if La Bamba handled more than $600 million in transactions, as the government suggested, that volume was \u201cexceptionally high\u201d for the services La Bamba offered to the public. That volume of the checks should have prompted La Bamba to investigate the underlying facts of the transactions and the parties involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">B. IRS Investigation</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">In 2006, an IRS task force began investigating the activities of South Florida check-cashing stores. Information obtained from the CBRS database revealed that hundreds of CTRs for transactions exceeding $10 million had been filed for DNC Construction (\u201cDNC\u201d), Fast, and Spirit. Despite the volume of transactions, these entities did not appear to be engaged in any actual construction work. This anomaly provided the IRS with a starting point for their investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">1. La Bamba</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">Initially, the investigation revealed that La Bamba, a money service business that cashed checks, was a Florida corporation. The main store and corporate offices were located in Miami. La Bamba maintained six branch stores and a fleet of mobile vans that visited construction sites to cash checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">Caro, the Owner and President of La Bamba, oversaw its daily operations. Defendant Chaoui, with over 28 years experience as a bank officer, was La Bamba\u2019s compliance officer. Gonzalez, Caro\u2019s brother-in-law and former licensed contractor, was in charge of supervising the cashing of checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">They were, however, not the only participants in the scheme. Oscar Valle and his wife, Meylin Maria Morales, set up shell companies and functioned as recruiters to bring new \u201cclients\u201d to Caro. Despite being the linchpin that held the scheme together, Caro needed the help of all his co-conspirators because he could not have carried on such a widespread and sophisticated scheme alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-12\">2. Spirit Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">In December 2006, IRS Agent William Rondon interviewed Spirit\u2019s President, Marvin Marroquin. Marroquin cooperated with the government and testified at trial. Marroquin testified that his brother-in-law, Alfredo Ortega, had created Spirit with Marroquin\u2019s driver\u2019s license and social security number. Spirit was created not for construction work, but for the sole purpose of cashing checks to evade taxes. For this reason, Ortega explained to Marroquin that Spirit could remain in existence for about a year and a half, but then Marroquin, as President, should leave the country before the IRS discovered Spirit\u2019s activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-14\">Ortega obtained a workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy for Spirit and had Marroquin sign approximately 40 blank checks for Spirit. At Ortega\u2019s request, Marroquin also obtained a rubber stamp with his signature so that Ortega .could cash checks without Marroquin\u2019s signature, should Marroquin need to leave the country. As Spirit\u2019s President, Marroquin received a percentage of Spirit\u2019s cashed checks as compensation for his part in the scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-15\">A form with Marroquin\u2019s name and signature was found in a La Bamba file, and La Bamba filed CTRs for transactions worth more than over $20.3 million on Spirit\u2019s behalf. Marroquin testified this was not accurate as he had never visited La Bamba, he did not know Caro, Gonzalez, or Chaoui, nor did he authorize La Bamba to cash checks for Spirit.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>3. Cashflow Financing</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Based upon information gleaned from the CBRS database, the IRS also started investigating Cashflow Financing, Inc. (\u201cCashflow\u201d), another check cashing institution. In March 2007, Cashflow was searched and Miguel Obispo, its owner, was detained and interviewed. In the end, Obispo agreed to cooperate with the government in an undercover capacity. Based on that cooperation, the IRS installed cameras and microphones in Cashflow, and Obispo was personally equipped with a recording device.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">According to Obispo\u2019s testimony, Cash-flow had two types of corporate clients\u2014 regular and irregular. The regular clients cashed $5,000 to $7,000 checks every two weeks. The irregular clients cashed checks from $30,000 to $200,000 every week. The irregular clients included: DNC Construction; Fast; Spirit; SAN Construction; WF Construction; Baba Construction; and Four-by-Four Construction. Not surprisingly, these so-called construction clients were not actually engaged in construction work, but were shell companies that could be used as subcontractors for the purposes of cashing checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Over time, 90% of Cashflow\u2019s business was derived from these irregular companies. The only hindrance to Obispo\u2019s growing business was limitations imposed by his bank. The bank established an $180,000 ceiling on Cashflow\u2019s weekly check deposits. This ceiling forced Obispo to seek alternative sources of funds, and he found willing partners in Caro and La Bamba.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">4. La Bamba</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">In April 2005, one of Obispo\u2019s friends introduced him to Caro. Caro agreed to supply Obispo with $100,000 to $150,000 cash weekly, in order to allow Cashflow to cash checks without his bank\u2019s interference. Obispo borrowed the cash from La Bamba on Friday and repaid it, along with 1.5% interest, the following Wednesday.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">Despite Obispo\u2019s cash borrowing arrangement, the bank\u2019s deposit restrictions, mentioned above, continued to curtail Cashflow\u2019s activities. In August 2005, Obispo and Caro further attempted to circumvent these restrictions. No longer would Obispo pick up cash from La Bamba, now he would bring the checks to Caro at La Bamba for deposit and receive cash in return.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">These corporate checks Obispo delivered to La Bamba emanated from the shell companies. While he never explicitly divulged this to Caro, Obispo believed the two had an \u201cunderstanding\u201d based on the amount of currency changing hands. Caro acknowledged the fictitious nature of the companies when he described to Obispo that his companies were \u201cmiquimbin,\u201d meaning phony or fictitious companies.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-13\">Now that Obispo was bringing checks written to the shell companies directly to La Bamba, the CTRs for the transactions were prepared and filed by La Bamba. Obispo understood that La Bamba would prepare the CTRs to remove him. and Cashflow from the paper trial. Instead, the CTRs would be in the name of the shell corporation. Not yet cooperating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>with the IRS, Obispo was intent on actively deceiving the IRS and these false CTRs would facilitate that by indicating the person to whom the check was written was actually withdrawing the money and not Obispo.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Obispo was aware that the CTRs being filed based on his transactions with Caro and La Bamba were inaccurate. To correctly record these transactions, two CTRs should have been filed. One detailing the La Bamba to Cashflow transaction. And a second from Cashflow providing the true identity of the person who received the currency. Instead of following the proper procedure, Obispo provided La Bamba with the information to generate and file a single, false CTR.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">This arrangement between Obispo, as a co-conspirator, and La Bamba lasted from August 2005 to March 22, 2007, when the IRS intervened.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But Obispo\u2019s dealings with Caro and La Bamba were far from over. From April through November 2007, Obispo visited La Bamba in his customary manner; the difference was he was now working for the IRS and wearing a recording device.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">On April 5, 2007, Obispo paid his first visit to La Bamba as an informant, and he brought with him fourteen checks totaling $129,544.58; including checks made payable to Spirit. On April 6, 2010, Obispo again visited La Bamba bringing with him checks totaling $227,079.76.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">Based on these transactions, La Bamba prepared and filed several CTRs.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> One particular CTR, the subject of Count Two of the Superseding Indictment, lists a transaction dated April 6, 2007. This CTR covers the cashing of checks, payable to Spirit, in the amount of $79,965.00. Yet the CTR falsely reflects that Marroquin, Spirit\u2019s President, conducted the transaction. Obispo is not identified on the form and he actually conducted the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">On May 3, 2007, Obispo returned to La Bamba with checks, including some payable to SB. Obispo provided La Bamba the necessary paperwork to make the false CTRs for SB, including a copy of SB\u2019s articles of incorporation, a copy of the driver\u2019s license for Salvador Mata, SB\u2019s corporate officer, and a copy of Mata\u2019s social security card. The CTR La Bamba filed in connection with these checks falsely stated that Mata had conducted the transaction. Again Obispo was eliminated from being identified as part of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-12\">On Obispo\u2019s May 16, 2007, visit to La Bamba, Caro changed the names of the payor on four of Obispo\u2019s checks to avoid bank suspicion. The checks had originally been made payable to La Bamba from Cashflow to avoid bank suspicion. To prevent the need for future alterations, Caro directed Obispo to use different names on the checks and to deliver them sporadically. Caro instructed Obispo to mark his checks with the initials \u201cM.H.\u201d on the back; these initials stood for Obispo\u2019s friend who introduced him to Caro. In that way, Caro knew they were Obispo\u2019s checks. Caro, further, suggested to Obispo that he make the checks payable to Spirit to make it appear that Cashflow had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>given Spirit cash and was depositing the checks at La Bamba. This practice would discourage further bank inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">On May 18, 2007, Obispo returned to La Bamba, bringing $404,204.23 in checks; including two from Cashflow to Spirit. Caro obtained from Obispo the information for the CTRs, and directed Obispo to write the other checks from Cashflow in his own handwriting. When Obispo asked Caro the name of the payee, Caro told him that he could make out the check to \u201cwhichever one you want.\u201d Obispo interpreted this comment to mean any fictitious company he wanted so Obispo chose Spirit.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">At least one CTR was filed by La Bamba with a transaction date of May 18, 2007. That CTR falsely reflected that Marroquin, from Spirit, presented checks for $233,836.00 to La Bamba that day, and is the subject of Count Six.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">In June 2007, Obispo disclosed to Caro that he and a friend had formed PAW Construction. Obispo explained that PAW was \u201cjust like Spirit,\u201d a shell company that could be used to evade taxes and the payment of workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Obispo touted the virtues of PAW, and assured Caro that PAW was insured. Unbeknownst to Caro, PAW was created by IRS agents to further its investigation. PAW was registered under the fictional name \u201cCarlos Martinez;\u201d which was an alias used by IRS Special Agent Charles Torres. Checks would be written to PAW from other IRS \u201cundercover\u201d companies, also created for the investigation. The bank accounts for these undercover companies were funded to ensure that the checks made payable to PAW would clear the payors\u2019 bank accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">Not surprisingly Caro and La Bamba willingly accepted checks made payable to PAW. On July 12, 2007, Obispo presented eight PAW checks to La Bamba. Caro only accepted two of the checks because of his concern about his bank becoming suspicious. For those two checks, however, CTRs were prepared at La Bamba that falsely identified Carlos Martinez, PAW\u2019S corporate officer, as conducting the transaction when it actually was Obispo. The CTR identified the correct amount of the transaction, $60,120, and was signed by Chaoui, and it is the subject of Count Eight.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">Obispo returned to La Bamba, on July 31, 2007, with two more PAW checks. Again, the CTR prepared and recorded by La Bamba falsely stated the transaction had been conducted by Carlos Martinez, not Obispo. This CTR is the subject of Count Nine.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-12\">Obispo repeatedly visited La Bamba with PAW checks from June through November 2007. For all the PAW checks, La Bamba prepared and filed CTRs that falsely identified Carlos Martinez as having conducted the transactions, when in reality it was Obispo.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-13\">On one occasion, Obispo brought PAW checks to La Bamba that intentionally had not been endorsed. In Gonzalez\u2019s presence, Obispo signed them Carlos Martinez. On Obispo\u2019s last trip to La Bamba, on November 8, 2007, the checks to PAW had again not been endorsed and Caro drew that to Obispo\u2019s attention. In Caro\u2019s presence, Obispo signed the checks Carlos Martinez.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-14\">From June to November 2007, La Bamba filed 44 CTRs for PAW involving transactions of $3.5 million. All the CTRs falsely stated that Carlos Martinez, PAW\u2019s corporate officer, conducted the transactions when it was Obispo who had conduet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>ed them. These CTRs from this period are the subject of Count Ten, Eleven, Twelve, Thirteen, Fourteen, and Seventeen.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">During the fall of 2007, Caro offered to purchase Cashflow. While discussing Cashflow\u2019s worth, Caro questioned the profit Obispo realized from the checks he cashed for legitimate companies. Caro estimated Cashflow cashed about $1 million a month in checks, without including the \u201cstrange people.\u201d Caro stated that one could not rely upon the \u201cmiquimbines,\u201d because they are \u201chere today and gone tomorrow.\u201d When Obispo suggested that the \u201cstrange people\u201d possessed some value and that Caro too had \u201cstrange people,\u201d Caro retorted, \u201cNo, I no longer have anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Obispo was perplexed by this comment. Caro was apparently denying having shell companies within his business, but Caro repeatedly accepted Obispo\u2019s checks to them. Caro explained that he had to be careful because his actions were scrutinized under a \u201cmagnifying glass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Later, returning to the subject of the purchase of Cashflow, Caro told Obispo that Obispo would continue delivering checks to Caro. La Bamba would continue preparing the CTRs under the names of the fictitious companies. But in the event of an audit, Obispo would be responsible for any documentation Caro might need.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">During another conversation, Caro and Obispo discussed how La Bamba prepared their CTRs. According to Caro, Chaoui had full responsibility for the CTRs. Elaine Becerra, the person at La Bamba responsible for preparing all the CTRs, may prepare them, but she was supervised by both Caro and Chaoui. Obispo retorted that Caro did not know much about preparing and filing CTRs because Becerra and Chaoui handled them. In response, Caro explained that he had done the job before Chaoui\u2019s arrival, and while Chaoui knew about banks \u201cfrom the inside,\u201d Caro knew more \u201cabout banks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">5. La Bamba\u2019s Internal Operations</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">La Bamba was situated in a two-story building with a customer waiting area, a teller window area, and four offices. Caro\u2019s office was downstairs, while Elaine Becerra and Chaoui\u2019s offices were upstairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-12\">La Bamba had branch offices, but they were not authorized to cash checks in large amounts. If someone presented a large check in one of those locations, the cashier was required to call the main office for approval from Caro, Chaoui, or Gonzalez. The same procedures applied when someone other than the registered representative sought to cash a check at a branch store or a mobile van. No CTRs were prepared at the branch stores or the mobile vans, even if they engaged in transactions over $10,000. In such a case, the information was sent to La Bamba\u2019s main office where the CTR was prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-13\">Before cashing checks, La Bamba\u2019s tellers or cashiers verified that the check was \u201cokay\u201d and that the person who was cashing the check was the proper person to cash the check. This was verified consulting La Bamba\u2019s database, which contained the application that a company\u2019s owner completed when first registering with La Bamba. If anyone other than an authorized person wished to cash a check, a supervisor, such as Caro or Gonzalez, was required to approve the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-14\">Regardless of the where the transaction occurred, from 2004-2008, Elaine Becerra prepared all of La Bamba\u2019s CTRs. An immigrant from Cuba, Becerra had no background in finance or banking. But after receiving training from Teresita <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>Caro, Caro\u2019s sister, on filling out the CTRs, they were Becerra\u2019s responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Becerra was not solely responsible for the CTRs, however. Once they were completed, Becerra submitted them to Chaoui for his approval and signature. Chaoui also served as a resource if she had any questions about her work.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Becerra was never able to observe the actual cashing of checks from her workstation. Instead she relied upon computer programs to assist her in the preparation of the CTRs. When Becerra began working at La Bamba, in 2004, she used a computer system, named Ideal, to create a database to record La Bamba\u2019s customers. In 2005, Ideal was replaced by Power Check, and in 2006 Archive was added. Becerra used these tools simultaneously to retrieve the data that she needed to fill out a CTR. The databases contained a company\u2019s ID number, its address, and the name of the person that cashed the check. Becerra trusted that if the check was payable to a person or company, that was the person or company that actually cashed the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Becerra also relied upon certain pieces of information from the check itself to prepare the CTRs. The Archive computer program scanned the checks and placed them into the system. She relied upon the amount from the check, the date, and the name of the person who cashed the check. Becerra used the name of the person or the company listed as the payee on the check to prepare a CTR, unless she was instructed otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">In gathering the information for the CTRs, Becerra also created her own alphabetical list of check-payees for each day. With this list, Becerra created a master list of the daily transactions. After she calculated the sum of the day\u2019s transactions for each payee, Becerra determined whether the aggregate daily transactions exceeded $10,000, which triggered the reporting requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">Becerra prepared the CTRs on a weekly basis and submitted them to Chaoui. Once signed, Becerra mailed them to the IRS. During her years at La Bamba, no one ever told Becerra that she was not performing her job correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">The flaw in Becerra\u2019s whole procedure was that she \u201ctrusted that the person who was actually cashing the check [was] the person registered with Power Check.\u201d Consequently, the CTRs prepared by Becerra, approved by Chaoui, and filed by La Bamba stated that particular individuals had cashed checks at La Bamba on certain dates, although Becerra was unable to ascertain whether those individuals had actually done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">For example, Becerra\u2019s log for June 29, 2006, reflected that Fast cashed checks amounting to $156,755. The CTR filed by La Bamba stated that the transaction was conducted by Jose Montenegro, Fast\u2019s corporate officer, but Becerra had not seen Montenegro nor could she verify whether he actually cashed those checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-12\">Similarly, Becerra\u2019s log for December 6, 2006, reflected that checks amounting to $102,992 had been cashed for Spirit. The CTR filed by La Bamba stated that Marroquin, Spirit\u2019s corporate officer, had conducted the transaction, although Becerra did not know whether Marroquin had been at La Bamba to cash those checks. She simply assumed it was him.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-13\">During her employment with La Bamba, Becerra participated in training meetings held twice yearly, which were run by Chaoui and Gonzalez. During those meetings it was discussed how important it was to obtain the proper information from people cashing checks to make Becerra\u2019s job easier. Furthermore, Becerra took peri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>odie tests to ensure she understood CTR preparation.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">6. Oscar Valle</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Delvin Ortega<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> was employed by Oscar Valle. Ortega explained to the jury his experience in Valle\u2019s scheme. Oscar Valle created various shell companies, including Tr\u00e9bol Construction (\u201cTr\u00e9bol\u201d), Huber Construction (\u201cHuber\u201d), Mira Construction (\u201cMira\u201d), DJ, and SNF Construction (\u201cSNF\u201d), for the purpose of obtaining workers\u2019 compensation insurance policies and permitting other companies to perform work under the insurance policies for Valle\u2019s companies. Contractor employers wrote checks to Valle\u2019s companies to pay their workers, and these checks were cashed at La Bamba for a fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Like the other shell companies, Valle\u2019s companies did not perform any construction work and Valle\u2019s friends and relatives functioned as their corporate officers.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As with the other shell companies, the addresses listed in state records for Valle created companies were residential addresses that gave no indication that construction business was transacted there.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">Valle\u2019s commissions were placed in an envelope for him at La Bamba. It was Ortega\u2019s responsibility to pick up the commissions for Huber and Mira. From November 2006 until March 2007, Ortega waited at La Bamba, usually on Fridays and sometimes on Saturdays, to pick up the envelopes containing Valle\u2019s 4% commissions. These commissions ranged from $13,000 to $16,000 weekly, but Ortega recalled the largest was $23,000. Ortega received these commissions from either a female employee, Caro or Gonzalez.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">La Bamba filed CTRs for transactions totaling $60,949,702 for Valle\u2019s five shell companies. From March until November 2007, La Bamba filed 157 CTRs for DJ transactions totaling $14.5 million. From September 2006 until November 2007, La Bamba filed 243 CTRs for Huber transactions totaling $16 million. From May 2006 to November 2007, La Bamba filed 211 CTRs for Mira transactions totaling $18.9 million. From October to November 2007, La Bamba filed 13 CTRs for SNF transactions totaling $557,000. From August 2005 until November 2007, La Bamba filed 193 CTRs for Tr\u00e9bol transactions totaling $10.7 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-12\">In July 2007, Obispo confided to Caro that Spirit would be dissolving because its insurance was expiring and it had no useful life without insurance. Obispo asked Caro for a company where he could place some clients. Caro gave Obispo a DJ business card, and told him to contact \u201cOscar\u201d or \u201cTomas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-13\">In response to Obispo\u2019s telephone call to DJ, Valle and Ortega met Obispo at Cash-flow. Valle explained he had spoken with Caro, and that he had three companies with workers\u2019 compensation insurance to offer Obispo. Obispo was told he could write approximately $100,000 in checks to DJ weekly for a 3% commission. The checks would be cashed at La Bamba, and Valle and La Bamba would be responsible for preparing and filing the CTRs. They, further, agreed that the CTRs would falsely list DJ\u2019s corporate officer, Gladys Valle, as receiving the cash from the check, instead of the person who actually received it. Valle assured Obispo that he had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>working with Caro for four years and had never encountered a problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Valle gave Obispo the necessary paperwork for DJ, including a copy of the articles of incorporation, a copy of Gladys Valle\u2019s driver\u2019s license and social security number, and a certificate of workers\u2019 compensation insurance. It was agreed that DJ\u2019s corporate officer would not be present when the checks were cashed and that her signature would be forged.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Obispo delivered checks to La Bamba made payable to DJ Construction. Caro deducted a 5% commission for Obispo\u2019s checks written to DJ; 3% for Valle and 2% for La Bamba.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">From August until October 2007, Obispo brought checks to La Bamba made payable to DJ from undercover IRS companies. Notably, in these transactions the checks were left unendorsed. On one occasion, Caro asked Obispo to make the amounts of the checks smaller. On another occasion, Caro reminded Obispo to write his name on the back of the checks and to mark the checks with the initials \u201cM.H.\u201d as was their custom.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">7. Rodrigo Donad\u00edo</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">Caro and La Bamba cashed checks for more clients than simply Obispo and Cash-flow. One of those clients, Rodrigo Donad\u00edo, a subcontractor who owned the companies, \u201cSecond to None\u201d and \u201cBencomo Artemisa.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">Donad\u00edo had a pre-existing business relationship with Alfredo Ortega. Ortega approached Donad\u00edo and asked how he was paying his workers, some of whom were illegal aliens. Ortega explained a company was available that would allow Donad\u00edo to write checks that could be used to pay his workers in cash. Other companies were doing the same thing, according to Ortega.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">After two weeks, Donad\u00edo asked Ortega about more details. Ortega explained the scheme, including how Donadio\u2019s workers would be covered by workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Donad\u00edo agreed and Ortega gave him the name of DNC to write checks to. After another few weeks, Ortega directed Donad\u00edo to write checks to Fast instead of DNC. Later, Donad\u00edo was directed to write checks to Spirit. Regardless of to whom the checks were written, Donad\u00edo payed a 5% to 6% commission per check, and those checks were cashed at Cashflow. Donad\u00edo testified that he knew the scheme was illegal, but he explained that the benefit of using the shell companies was that he no longer had to pay payroll taxes or be concerned with workers\u2019 compensation insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">After some time, Donad\u00edo contacted Caro and asked if Caro could provide a similar service, but at a reduced rate. Caro was willing to provide the identical service for a 3.5% to 4% per check fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">In early 2007, Caro gave Donad\u00edo the name Mira to write checks to. Caro instructed Donad\u00edo to contact La Bamba for a copy of Mira\u2019s insurance certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-13\">Donad\u00edo wrote checks from Second to None to Mira in amounts ranging from $10,000 to $80,000 every Thursday and sent them by facsimile to La Bamba. Normally, several hours later Chaoui personally delivered the cash to Donad\u00edo. However, on the few occasions when Donadio went to La Bamba to have his checks cashed, this was done directly by Caro.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-14\">Specifically, Donad\u00edo testified about an April 4, 2007, check in the amount of $29,204. Donad\u00edo explained that he signed the check to Mira and delivered it to Chaoui. But Donad\u00edo could not explain the endorsement on the back of the check. It was not his, nor did he know whose it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>Donad\u00edo also began writing checks from his other company, Bencomo Artemisa, to Mira and cashing those checks at La Bamba. After seven to nine months, Donad\u00edo was told by Chaoui to write his checks to another company, DJ. Donad\u00edo again received an insurance certificate from La Bamba for DJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">In March 2008, Donad\u00edo was approached by law enforcement officers. Donad\u00edo cooperated in the investigation and obtained immunity for his statements and was not charged in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">8. Adelino Agostinho</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">Caro also gave Contractor Adelino Agostinho, owner of Silva Builders, the name of DJ to use to pay Silva\u2019s payroll. Previously, Agostinho had employed a similar system with subcontractors who had used the insurance certificates for Valle\u2019s shell companies, Tr\u00e9bol, Mira, Huber, and SNF. Those checks had been cashed at La Bamba for a 6% commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">Eventually, because the illegal aliens he employed had no taxpayer identification numbers, Agostinho arranged with Caro to pay those workers by writing checks to DJ that La Bamba would cash. Once he wrote a check to DJ, Agostinho segregated the payment for those workers from the remainder of his workforce and submitted, by facsimile transmission, an invoice under DJ Construction\u2019s name for the total amount of the check that he needed to pay those workers, in addition to a <em>5% </em>commission. Agostinho had an employee prepare the DJ invoice so that it would appear to be legitimate in the event that it ever came under scrutiny from the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">The check was delivered to La Bamba, along with envelopes marked with each worker\u2019s name and amount that he was to receive. La Bamba cashed the check from Silva Builders to DJ and filled each envelope with the appropriate amount of cash for the workers to pick up at La Bamba on Friday afternoons.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">In January 2008, Agostinho wrote three checks to DJ. These checks were for different subcontractors who did work for Silva. Over a six-month period, Agostinho wrote checks from Silva Builders to DJ for $2,687,668.44. Agostinho was unaware whether La Bamba filed CTRs for those transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">9. Andres Martinez</p>\n<p id=\"b855-13\">Andres Martinez owned Design Builders. He and Mario Edgardo Varela Rivera, who was in charge of personnel and payroll for Design Builders, met Caro in February 2006. Rivera testified that Caro recommended that Design Builders use Mira to pay its workers and avoid payroll taxes and workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-14\">Originally, La Bamba cashed checks for Design Builders\u2019 employees every Friday because most of its workers were illegal aliens. La Bamba loaned the payroll money to Design Builders and permitted the money to be repaid one week later. La Bamba charged Design Builders a commission of <em>2% </em>for employees\u2019 checks and <em>3% </em>for its cash advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-15\">This continued until May 2006, when Caro suggested that Design Builders simply make the checks payable to Mira. Caro explained to Rivera that Design Builders would avoid payroll taxes, and workers\u2019 compensation premiums by making checks payable to Mira.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-16\">Eventually, Martinez, Rivera and Valle met at La Bamba, and Valle offered Mira\u2019s services for a 6% check fee. Valle subser quently provided Design Builders with a copy of Mira\u2019s insurance certificate. Design Builders wrote its first check to Mira in May 2006, and for six or seven months thereafter. Design Builders wrote checks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>to Mira until Valle instructed Rivera to make the checks payable to Huber, Valle\u2019s new company. Design Builders\u2019 checks to Huber were cashed at La Bamba for the same 6% commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">The Huber arrangement continued for another seven or eight months until it was replaced with DJ, yet another one of Valle\u2019s companies. Design Builders\u2019 first check to DJ was written in March 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Design Builders wrote checks for $575,188.20 to-Huber; for $1,071,258.98 to Mira; and for $1,340,180.56 to DJ. No one at Design Builders ever worked for Huber, Mira, or DJ. Design Builders never endorsed the checks made payable to Valle\u2019s companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">10. Joseph Dieppa</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">Contractor Joseph Dieppa was the owner of Advanced Surface Restoration, Inc. (\u201cAdvanced\u201d). Dieppa obtained from Caro the names of shell companies to write checks to so that he could pay his workers in cash, and avoid payroll taxes and workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">In 2005, Dieppa\u2019s company obtained a $60 million contract to construct a condominium building on Fisher Island, a small island off Miami Beach. When Dieppa encountered difficulties in retaining subcontractors, he contacted Caro, who had a reputation for having a connection to subcontractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">Dieppa\u2019s labor shortfall continued prompting him to assemble his own team of workers and to obtain from Caro the name of Morgan Construction (\u201cMorgan\u201d) to write checks to in order to allow the payment of wages to those workers. By writing checks to Morgan, Dieppa was able to pay his workers cash and avoid payroll taxes. Dieppa also avoided the expense of premiums for workers\u2019 compensation insurance because his workers used Morgan\u2019s insurance certif\u00edcate. Still another benefit of Caro\u2019s service, Dieppa hired illegal aliens who could be paid with cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">Caro charged Dieppa a 10% fee per check and gave him copies of Morgan\u2019s articles of incorporation and certificate of insurance. Every two weeks, Dieppa wrote a check to Morgan for the workers\u2019 salaries, adding a 10% commission for Caro. After receiving the amount from Dieppa, Caro personally delivered the cash to Dieppa, at his Fisher Island office. Caro also brought Dieppa invoices on Morgan letterhead. The money Caro delivered to Dieppa was packaged in manila envelopes and boxes. When Caro was not available to bring the cash to Dieppa, Caro\u2019s sister or Chaoui came in his place.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-12\">In 2006, Dieppa assembled his own laborers for another project. Again he used Caro\u2019s services. This time, Caro gave him the name of Mira to write payroll checks to. The Mira scheme operated in the same manner as with Morgan. Caro furnished a copy of Mira\u2019s insurance certificate and delivered Mira invoices to Dieppa, along with cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-13\">In addition to Morgan and Mira, Dieppa wrote his payroll checks to the following shell companies provided by Caro: Huber; SAS; Tr\u00e9bol; GQ; Petrillo Construction; and Aly Trucking.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-14\">Caro also provided Dieppa with false lien releases from the shell payee companies to whom Dieppa had written checks. A lien release indicates that a contractor has been paid; the contractor releases the invoice. Without this signed release, a subcontractor cannot be paid. Caro gave Dieppa releases from the owners of Huber, Mira, and SNF. Dieppa\u2019s business with Caro ended only when Caro was arrested in January of 2008. By that time, Dieppa had written a total of $3.9 million in checks to Caro provided companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>11. Nevin Shapiro</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Caro always sought opportunities to expand his client base. In early 2007, when Caro met Nevin Kerry Shapiro at a Miami Heat basketball game, he offered Shapiro a loan of $7,000 cash with no terms. Shapiro testified that Caro who had the cash on his person, gave the money to Shapiro with only a handshake to seal their agreement. Shapiro was to repay the money with a $500 fee. Shapiro repaid the loan by writing a check for $7,523.28 from his real estate company to Huber, at Caro\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Shapiro then borrowed $50,000 from Caro in October 2007 and repaid the loan by writing a personal check for $52,500 to DNC. The $2,500 represented interest on the loan and Shapiro- did not endorse the check before personally delivering it to Caro.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">The loans from Caro and repayments from Shapiro continued for five more transactions. Caro sent someone to Shapiro\u2019s office to pick up Shapiro\u2019s check or Shapiro gave the check to Caro personally at a Heat game or by visiting La Bamba. To repay the loans, Shapiro wrote checks to AFC Painting and Huber, entities who had never performed any work for him, and finally, to La Bamba. Although Caro insisted that the other companies Shapiro had written the checks to were \u201chis,\u201d Shapiro was uncertain about the others. Caro agreed reluctantly to permit Shapiro to write the final two checks, one for $50,000 and one for $52,000, directly to La Bamba.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">12. Caro and his bank</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">Caro frequently complained about scrutiny from his bank. Madeline Jenkins, Peninsula Bank\u2019s senior compliance officer, testified Caro\u2019s complaints were well founded because Peninsula Bank was constantly reviewing La Bamba\u2019s BSA compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">Jenkins explained that money service businesses, like La Bamba, are one of the highest-risk accounts for a bank. Therefore, the bank monitors those accounts more than the average. Jenkins explained that what made those accounts so risky is a money service business (\u201cMSB\u201d) is responsible for its own due diligence on its customers before processing a check, to maintain its business license. Jenkins explained this as \u201cKnow Your Customer;\u201d or knowing who they are an who they claim to be. If the MSB is not conscientious in knowing its customer, however, the bank can be placed at risk. This risk to the bank could result in closure or bank members being prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">When Peninsula established accounts for La Bamba in 2004, it imposed the conditions that separate accounts be maintained for depositing checks to individuals and corporations. Peninsula also required La Bamba to maintain a certificate of deposit on account as collateral for the other accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">Initially Peninsula limited La Bamba to a maximum of $30,000 an item and $100,000 a company per day. This limitation was meant to prevent fraud. Caro approached Peninsula about increasing these limits. Peninsula, agreed to the increase provided that Caro establish a savings account and deposit $1 million to be used as collateral when he wanted to draw against uncollected funds. This arrangement worked for a few months until Caro requested cash in amounts that exceeded the balances in all La Bamba accounts. Caro also requested to withdraw cash from the $1 million savings account to fulfill his orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-13\">Jenkins wrote Caro seeking an explanation of the changes in La Bamba that necessitated this amount of cash. According to Caro, La Bamba serviced customers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>on the weekends, La Bamba\u2019s mobile units were increasingly being used, and La Bamba had six offices in South Florida. Interestingly, Caro failed to mention La Bamba\u2019s relationship with Cashflow or its increased business with construction companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">After an internal review of its policies, Peninsula began transactional testing. Jenkins testified the bank began looking at the items La Bamba was actually depositing and the pattern of dollars to individuals or corporations. Based on this initiative, Peninsula discovered La Bamba permitted some corporations to use a stamp to endorse checks, and that La Bamba\u2019s exceeded the limits that had been imposed on deposits.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Peninsula attempted to have a special software program installed at La Bamba. This program, for all Peninsula\u2019s MSB clients, looked for patterns in activity. Only after being assured that Peninsula would not be able to remove data from the system, was La Bamba willing to accept the software. Interestingly, when Peninsula received the software\u2019s data from La Bamba, it only included information from La Bamba\u2019s branch stores not the main office. Jenkins questioned Caro about this, and he responded another software system existed at the main store. However, that was never shared with Peninsula.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">In an e-mail, dated May 30, 2007, Chaoui provided Peninsula with a list of La Bamba\u2019s mobile units and La Bamba\u2019s quarterly report. This quarterly report provided the number of checks cashed for the preceding three months, the fees received from cashing checks, and the fees from other services. Absent from this report was any reference to the millions of dollars in transactions it had monthly with Cash-flow.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">Still wanting to strengthen its policies to MSBs, Peninsula retained an attorney to create an agreement for Peninsula\u2019s MSBs to sign and return. Jenkins testified that this agreement required MSBs to: guarantee to the bank that they were fulfilling their responsibilities for their licenses; provide information on their transactions and corporate structure; and warranty use of its collateral. La Bamba failed to return a signed copy of the form.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">Later, Jenkins sought information on the identities of some of the companies listed in La Bamba\u2019s transactions. Chaoui replied that La Bamba had acquired two vendors under La Bamba\u2019s license, but Cashflow was again absent from this list.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">Finally, at the end of October 2007, Peninsula conducted an on-site audit of La Bamba to assess its BSA compliance. This audit concluded that La Bamba needed improvement. A deficiency that was found, according to Jenkins, was La Bamba\u2019s apparent carelessness in filing its CTRs. Although the CTRs were timely filed, about 10% <em>of </em>them, or 300 out of 3,250, were returned \u201cbecause of errors or legibility problems.\u201d The audit recommended that the CTR personnel receive additional training. Moreover, the audit noted that La Bamba was overdue for its annual BSA training. The auditors, further, found La Bamba\u2019s due diligence deficient and recommended that its compliance officer and its staff receive more training. The results of the audit were shared with Caro and La Bamba.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-11\">13. Government Agents</p>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">IRS Agent Rondon testified about his involvement in the investigation into La Bamba, and detailed PAW checks that the IRS provided to Obispo, who in turn delivered them to La Bamba. Rondon specifically testified regarding the circumstances surrounding Counts Eight through Seventeen. Rondon detailed how the IRS pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>vided Obispo these checks, how Obispo took them to La Bamba, and how La Bamba filed false CTRs for those transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Rondon testified that he reviewed approximately 1,500 CTRs filed by La Bamba in connection with this investigation. None of these CTRs were accurate, according to Rondon, because they reported transactions involving shell companies that were not engaged in construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">IRS Agent Vincent Lozowicki explained that Peninsula provided the IRS with monthly statements from La Bamba\u2019s bank accounts. A review of those accounts revealed that in 2006 and 2007, La Bamba deposited a total of over $600 million in checks each year for all sources. Over $400 million of that total were from checks made payable to corporations and business entities. The remaining $200 million were made payable to individuals. La Bamba averaged $50 to $60 million a month in check deposits in 2006 and 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Lozowicki, further, explained that he reviewed some of the checks that La Bamba had deposited for the shell corporations listed in the superseding indictment. He observed that some of these checks had a stamped endorsement, and he described this as unusual.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">Isabel Fleitas, a senior investigative analyst with the IRS, was able to locate all the CTRs filed by La Bamba for the shell companies named in the superseding indictment. From August 2005 to January 18, 2008, La Bamba filed 1,559 CTRs reflecting a total of $132,773,648.47 in transactions from only shell corporations. Fleitas also explained that she determined that all of the companies who filed CTRs filed them for more than $100,000 in a twelve month period.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">14. Termination of Conspiracy</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">On January 18, 2008, agents executed a search warrant at La Bamba\u2019s headquarters and its warehouse. On the same day, agents arrested Caro, Chaoui, and Gonzalez.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">Among the items found in the La Bamba store were client files containing forms and copies of driver\u2019s licenses and articles of incorporation for companies, including the documents for PAW and other fictitious companies; training manuals on BSA compliance and forms showing that such training had been conducted at La Bamba; boxes of business cards for DJ and SNF; and envelopes for commissions for the recruiters of the shell companies, including one with Valle\u2019s name on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-13\">While out on bond following his arraignment, Caro met contractor Dieppa at the Beach Club on Fisher Island. Caro asked Dieppa to \u201cremove\u201d the subcontractors\u2019 releases from his files. Dieppa interpreted this remark to mean, \u201cmake them disappear.\u201d In addition, Caro urged Dieppa to tell the investigators that the work had been performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-14\">Based on this and other evidence, the jury found Caro guilty of Counts One, Two, Six, and Eight through Seventeen. La Bamba was convicted of Counts One, Eighteen, Nineteen, and Twenty-Two through Thirty-Three. The District Court declared a mistrial as to Gonzalez and Chaoui. Both Chaoui and Gonzalez subsequently pled guilty to corruptly endeavoring to obstruct and impede administration of internal revenue laws, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7212(a), and received three-year custodial sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-15\">IV.

To comply with the requirements, check-cashing stores, like La Bamba, must file a CTR detailing these transactions with the IRS. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5313; 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.22 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-13\">It is illegal, according to \u00a7 5324(a)(2), for any person to \u201ccause or attempt to cause\u201d a financial institution to file a report \u201cthat contains a material omission or misstatement of fact.\u201d \u201cThis anti-structuring law aims to prevent people from either causing a bank to fail to file a required report or defeating the government\u2019s efforts to identify large cash transactions by splitting up a cash hoard in a manner that avoids triggering a bank\u2019s reporting requirements.\u201d <em>Vazquez, </em>53 F.3d at 1218 (quotation and citation omitted).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>At trial, the District Court instructed the jury concerning what the evidence must have demonstrated, beyond a reasonable doubt, to convict Caro and the other co-conspirators in Count One.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-4\">What the evidence in the case must show beyond a reasonable doubt is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-5\">First, that two or more persons in some way or manner came to a mutual understanding to try to accomplish a common and unlawful plan, as charged in the indictment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-6\">Second, that the Defendant, knowing the unlawful purpose of the plan, willfully joined in it;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-7\">Third, that one of the conspirators during the existence of the conspiracy knowingly committed at least one of the methods or overt acts described in the indictment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-8\">And, fourth, that such overt act was knowingly committed at or about the time alleged in an effort to carry out or accomplish some object of the conspiracy-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-9\">An overt act is any transaction or event, even one which may be entirely innocent when considered alone, but which is knowingly committed by a conspirator in an effort to accomplish some object of the conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-10\">A person may become a member of a conspiracy without knowing all of the details of the unlawful scheme and without knowing who all of the other members are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-11\">So if a defendant has a general understanding of the unlawful purpose of the plan and knowingly and willfully joins in that plan on one occasion, that is sufficient to convict that Defendant for conspiracy, even though the Defendant did not participate before and even though the Defendant played only a minor part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-14\">(Dkt. 528, pgs. 68-64). As to Counts Two through Seventeen the District Court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-15\">So the Defendants can be found guilty of the counts for which they have been individually charged in Counts 2 through 17 of the superseding indictment only if all of the following facts are proved beyond a reasonable doubt with respect to each count:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-16\">First, that the Defendant had knowledge of the currency transaction reporting requirements;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-17\">Second, that, with such knowledge, the Defendant knowingly caused or attempted to cause a domestic financial institution to file a currency transaction report that continued<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> a material omission or a misstatement of fact;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-18\">And, third, that the purpose of the false report was to evade the transaction reporting requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-19\">A statement is false when made if it is untrue and is then known to be untrue by the person making it.

As for the remaining CTRs, Caro asserts that the evidence failed to prove that he knew of the falsity of the CTRs.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">We reject Caro\u2019s assertions, and conclude there was sufficient evidence for his convictions. The government introduced evidence that Valle, a co-conspirator and co-defendant, set up a number of shell companies through which he filed false CTRs with La Bamba. There was also testimony that Caro referred individuals to Valle to take advantage of his shell companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Other witnesses, including Dieppa and Agostinho, testified they used La Bamba to cash checks through shell companies to avoid taxes. Marroquin, the President of Spirit, testified that he never entered La Bamba, yet La Bamba filed CTRs for millions of dollars that reported him as conducting the transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">Caro was far from an inactive participant in this scheme. In fact, testimony was presented that Caro promoted the scheme. Donad\u00edo testified he received the name of the shell company, Mira, directly from Caro, and Caro specifically instructed him to fax copies of checks payable to shell companies directly to La Bamba, and that cash was then delivered to Donad\u00edo by Chaoui. Agostinho and Rivera explained Caro instructed them to write checks to shell companies to avoid paying taxes. Rivera testified to the same activity and identified Caro as one of the individuals that cashed the checks. Dieppa testified that he agreed with Caro to write checks to shell companies for a fee. Dieppa also testified that Caro prepared and provided to him false invoices for shell companies to circumvent bank scrutiny, and that Caro instructed Dieppa to switch from one shell company to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">In addition, the jury viewed undercover video footage of Caro engaged in a variety of activities. For example, video footage captured Caro structuring deposits to avoid bank detection, openly discussing with the confidential informant whether companies that were cashing cheeks were fictitious, acknowledging that the companies that were cashing checks were fictitious, and making comments suggesting that he was seeking to evade law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">Furthermore, the jury had to look no further than to Caro\u2019s own admission that he knew of the illicit nature of the fictitious companies whose checks he accepted from Obispo. Caro told Obispo he could not rely upon the \u201cmiquimbines,\u201d because they were not reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">Additionally, the jury could consider the. material discovered at La Bamba. Among the items found in La Bamba were client files containing forms and copies of driver\u2019s licenses and articles of incorporation for companies, including the documents for PAW and other fictitious companies; training manuals on BSA compliance and forms showing that such training had been conducted at La Bamba; boxes of business cards for DJ and SNF; and envelopes for commissions for recruiters, including one for Valle.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-12\">It was possible for the jury to view Caro\u2019s lack of oversight of Becerra, in her preparation of the CTRs, as his attempt to shield himself from an appearance of impropriety as to La Bamba\u2019s actions. Becerra was trained on the procedure for filling out CTRs by Caro\u2019s sister. Becerra was also sequestered away from customers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>who were actually cashing checks. The jury could reasonably infer this was done so Becerra could not correctly identify those taking part in the transactions at La Bamba. While Chaoui was Becerra\u2019s supervisor and signed all of La Bamba\u2019s CTRs, Caro\u2019s statement to Obispo that he had done the job before Chaoui\u2019s arrival and knew more \u201cabout banks\u201d than Chaoui contradicted this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Finally, Caro cannot avoid conviction by arguing someone else committed the illegal acts rather than him. Regardless of whether Obispo acted as his agent, the CTRs filed for these transactions by La Bamba contained material misstatements for which Caro can be found guilty as an aider and abetter under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, for causing someone to commit a criminal act on his behalf. Sufficient evidence was adduced at trial that Caro actively participated in the filing, or causing to be filed, false CTRs.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Contrary to Caro\u2019s assertions, the evidence was more than sufficient to allow a reasonable trier of fact to find that Caro purposely evaded the CTR filing requirements by causing La Bamba to omit material information and causing La Bamba to willfully file CTRs knowing that they contained material omissions or misstatements of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">B. Infringement of Fifth and Sixth Amendment Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">Caro contends the District Court erred in allowing certain evidence and testimony at trial. The cumulative effect of all these errors, according to Caro, resulted in him receiving an unfair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">1. Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">Caro argues that the District Court impermissibly allowed government expert witness Djinis to testify regarding a MSB and the BSA obligations. Caro filed a Motion in Limine directed at this testimony and objected to it during trial. After listening to the argument of counsel, the District Court allowed the testimony to be admitted explaining that Fed.R.Evid. 704 permitted an expert witness to testify about an ultimate issue in the case, but not that an action was intentional. This testimony failed, according to Caro, to take into account the actual business practices of check-cashers and led the jury to believe they had a higher burden of compliance with the BSA than the law imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-12\">We review rulings on the admissibility of expert testimony for abuse of discretion. <em>Allison v. McGhan Medical Corp., </em>184 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.l999)(citing <em>General Elec. Co. v. Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136, 142-43, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997)). \u201cThis deferential standard is not relaxed even though a ruling on the admissibility of expert evidence may be outcome-determinative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An expert may offer opinion testimony on an ultimate issue of fact, Fed.R.Evid. 704, although \u201c[a]n expert may not, however, merely tell the jury what result to reach.\u201d <em>Montgomery v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>898 F.2d 1537, 1541 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-13\">There was no abuse of discretion in allowing this testimony. Djinis was the former deputy director of FinCEN, the agency that collects CTRs, compiles them for law enforcement, and provides advice to companies on how to comply with the BSA requirements. Djinis testified as to the content and purposes of the BSA, and the CTR obligations of domestic financial institutions. This was not, as Caro suggests, a witness inappropriately instructing the jury on the law applicable to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-14\">Furthermore, the District Court specifically instructed the jury that they had heard testimony from experts, including Djinis, and that simply because a witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>has given an opinion, the jury was not bound to accept that opinion. (Dkt. 528, pg. 56). It was up to the jury to decide whether to rely upon that testimony. <em>Id. </em>The jury was, therefore, free to reject Djinis\u2019 conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">2. Cross-Examination of Defense Experts</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Caro contends the District Court erred when it permitted the government to question defense witness Tillman about his violation of the sequestration rule and defense witness Diaz-Yabor about his prior felony conviction that was nearly three-decades old.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">a. Tillman Sequestration</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">Caro contends the District Court improperly instructed the jury that it could consider that defense expert Tillman violated the rule of sequestration by reviewing the government witnesses\u2019 testimony; while other witnesses had been barred from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">Ralph Tillman, a former IRS agent, was called by Chaoui as an expert in the area of the BSA. (Dkt. 518, pg. 220). After being cei'tified as an expert, defense counsel Garvin began questioning Tillman about his preparation for formulating an opinion about the CTRs filed by La Bamba. <em>Id. </em>at 222. Tillman was asked if, in this preparation, he had reviewed the trial testimony of Miguel Obispo, Elaine Becerra, and Peter Djinis. <em>Id. </em>at 222-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">Thereupon, the government asked for a side-bar where it was explained that Tillman had reviewed transcripts from the trial. The government moved to strike Tillman\u2019s testimony, and disqualify him for a violation of the rule of sequestration.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> After listening to argument of counsel, the District Court found a violation of the sequestration rule, but one that was neither intentional nor in bad faith. (Dkt. 519, pg. 21). Relying upon <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>248 F.3d 1065, 1104 (11th Cir.2001), the District Court denied the government\u2019s motion, but allowed the government to question Tillman regarding the \u201cnature of the violation.\u201d (Dkt. 519, pg. 22). The District Court also indicated that the jury might be instructed at the close of the trial that they could consider Tillman\u2019s review of the testimony in evaluating his testimony. <em>Id. </em>During cross:examination, the government questioned Tillman about the violation of the sequestration rule. (Dkt. 519, pgs. 67-68).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-14\">At the close of the trial, the District Court instructed the jury, \u201c[y]ou also heard testimony that Ralph Tillman reviewed transcripts of previous testimony provided during this trial while other witnesses were instructed not to do so. In evaluating Mr. Tillman\u2019s testimony, you may consider the fact that he reviewed transcripts of previous testimony before testifying.\u201d (Dkt. 528, pg. 56). Earlier during the charging conference, the parties discussed this instruction with the Court, (Dkt. 521, pgs. 27-28), and after the District Court read the final proposed instruction there was no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-15\">\u201c \u2018[I]t is a cardinal rule of appellate review that a party may not challenge as error a ruling or other trial proceeding invited by that party.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Silvestri, </em>409 F.3d 1311, 1327-1328 (11th Cir.2005)(citing <em>United States v. Ross, </em>131 F.3d 970, 988 (11th Cir.1997)). The invited error doctrine \u201c \u2018is implicated when a party induces or invites the District Court into making an error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number><em>States v. Stone, </em>139 F.3d 822, 838 (11th Cir.1998)). \u201cWhere invited error exists, it precludes a court from invoking the plain error rule and reversing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Ford ex rel. Estate of Ford v. Garcia, </em>289 F.3d 1283, 1294 (11th Cir.2002)). Neither Caro, nor any other defendant, objected to the instruction.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Therefore, we need not review it. Moreover, even if we were to consider the District Court\u2019s jury instruction, such an instruction was not a misstatement of the law and the District Court was completely within its discretion to craft the wording employed. <em>United States v. Jimenez, </em>780 F.2d 975, 981 (11th Cir.1986)(concluding the district court \u201cadequately responded to the possibility of prejudice by specifically instructing the jury\u201d that a violation of the sequestration rule had occurred, and that violation could be used in evaluating the credibility of the witness.). <em>See also United States v. Campa, </em>529 F.3d 980, 992 (11th Cir.2008)(stating that jury instructions are reviewed <em>de novo </em>as to whether they misstate the law, but the District Court is given wide latitude in crafting the language of the instruction).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">b. Diaz-Yabor Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">Caro maintains the District Court improperly allowed the government to question Martin Diaz-Yabor, Caro\u2019s construction industry expert, about a 27-year-old felony conviction. Caro insists that the government failed to give the requisite notice as required by Federal Rule of Evidence 609(b) prior to utilizing the conviction. Caro insists the impeachment of this expert was of critical importance because Diaz-Yabor would be testifying concerning \u201cthe real world business and regulatory environment.\u201d (Blue Brief, pg. 68).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">Diaz-Yabor was called as a witness by Caro. After introductory questions, DiazYabor was asked about his educational background. During questioning by the government, however, Diaz-Yabor admitted to a felony conviction from when he was eighteen or twenty years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">Caro moved for a mistrial for the government\u2019s improper impeachment of the witness through the use of a conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>more than ten years old.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-22\">Ultimately, the District Court concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>that Rule 609(b) and its time limitations on prior convictions did not apply. <em>Id. </em>at 9. Rather, this impeachment evidence fell under Rules 402 and 403, and there are no time limitations applicable here. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>31</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The District Court further concluded, \u201cthis evidence was highly probative of Mr. DiazYabor\u2019s educational background and work experience, two of the indicium forming the basis of his expert opinion. Further, any prejudicial effect on Defendants was minor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>We review a district court\u2019s decision \u201cto admit evidence of prior convictions pursuant to Rule 609\u201d for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Pritchard, </em>973 F.2d 905, 908 (11th Cir.1992). \u201c\u2018[E]videntiary and other non-constitutional errors do not constitute grounds for reversal unless there is a reasonable likelihood that they affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights; where an error had no substantial influence on the outcome, and sufficient evidence uninfected by error supports the verdict, reversal is not warranted.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Christopher, </em>923 F.2d 1545, 1550 (11th Cir.1991) (quoting <em>United States v. Hawkins, </em>905 F.2d 1489, 1493 (11th Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Under Fed.R.Evid. 609, a witness, other than the defendant, may be impeached with a prior conviction if the crime was punishable by more than one year of imprisonment. Fed.R.Evid. 609(a)(1). Evidence of convictions more than 10 years ago, however, are not admissible unless the court determines that the probative value of the conviction substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect and the \u201cadverse party is given sufficient written notice of intent to use such evidence to provide the adverse party with a fair opportunity to contest the use of such evidence.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 609(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">\u201cThis circuit has held that a presumption exists against the use of prior crime impeachment evidence over ten years old and that such convictions \u2018will be admitted very rarely and only in exceptional circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Tisdale, </em>817 F.2d 1552, 1555 (11th Cir.1987) (quoting <em>United States v. Cathey, </em>591 F.2d 268, 275 (5th Cir.1979)). To determine whether exceptional circumstances are present, the district court \u201cmust consider whether the witness has already been impeached, and if so, the probative value of the prior conviction decreases accordingly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">We observe there was no timely contemporaneous objection by Caro to this testimony.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that Caro has waived this issue by failing to raise an objection pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 103. <em>See United States v. Blackshear, </em>568 F.2d 1120, 1121-22 (5th Cir.1978) (finding lack of timely, specific objection waived noncompliance with Rule 609).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">Nevertheless, even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>this issue was not waived, it was harmless. The weight of the evidence against Caro, which included his own statements, the statements of his co-conspirators, was more than sufficient to convict him. Moreover, Diaz-Yabor\u2019s testimony which essentially argued that all the other construction companies were doing this type of activity is no defense at all to the charges. In fact, such testimony contradicted the other testimony about Caro\u2019s actions. The jury was free to disregard Diaz-Yabor\u2019s testimony as they so chose.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">3. Exclusion of Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">The District Court, according to Caro, erroneously sustained a government objection to questions posed during cross-examination of Marvin Marroquin, a government witness. Marroquin, Spirit\u2019s President, was asked whether he, Obispo, and Alfred Ortega discussed the presence of OSHA inspectors at a construction site under Spirit\u2019s insurance certificate. (Dkt. 556, pgs. 85-86). This testimony, accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>ing to Caro, would have supported the reasonable suggestion that the companies he was dealing with were not merely shell corporations but actual construction corporations, and should not have been excluded. The exclusion of this testimony bolstered the government\u2019s \u201cotherwise unsupported deliberate ignorance theory.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">During cross-examination, Caro\u2019s counsel repeatedly sought to ask Marroquin about OSHA inspectors at job sites that Spirit was associated with. During a sidebar, Caro\u2019s counsel argued this testimony was admissible because the government opened the door by asking Marroquin about Spirit\u2019s fictitious nature. (Dkt. 556, pg. 88). This testimony, according to counsel, would have tended to show that Spirit was engaged in legitimate business activities. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">When asked by the District Court why this testimony was not hearsay, Caro\u2019s counsel attempted to justify the questions multiple ways. <em>Id. </em>at 88. First, counsel asserted it was not hearsay because it was part of a recorded conversation. <em>Id. </em>Second, counsel suggested the entire conversation should be admitted under Rule 801(d)(2)(E). <em>Id. </em>at 89. Finally, counsel argued the statements were not being admitted for the truth of the matter asserted, <em>id. </em>at 90, but rather to show the effect upon the listener, Marroquin. <em>Id. </em>at 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">Ultimately, the District Court excluded the testimony and explained it was \u201cnot relevant. Not probative of any defense concerning any of the Defendants. There\u2019s been no indication of any nexus of these conversations that would relate to the Defendants\u2019 knowledge or lack of knowledge as to what Spirit Construction did or did not. And it\u2019s hearsay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">We review a District Court\u2019s evidentiary ruling for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Magluta, </em>418 F.3d 1166, 1177 (11th Cir.2005). A district court\u2019s decision on evidentiary rulings will only be reversed if \u201cthe resulting error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Dodds, </em>347 F.3d 893, 897 (11th Cir.2003). The District Court held that Caro had not shown any connection between the potential appearance of OSHA inspectors at Spirit\u2019s job sites and Caro\u2019s knowledge or lack thereof. This ruling was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">Interestingly, Caro does not now argue that this testimony was not hearsay.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Instead, he maintains that this excluded evidence bolstered the government\u2019s unsupported deliberate ignorance theory. Such an assertion is belied by the evidence against Caro, including Marroquin\u2019s own testimony. Marroquin, Spirit\u2019s President, had previously testified that Spirit was created not for construction work, but for the sole purpose of cashing checks to evade taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-12\">The fact that OSHA inspectors may have come by does not alter the testimony that Spirit was a shell company and not involved in actual construction. Spirit was still a registered corporation in Florida but that does not mean that they were in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>actual construction business. The testimony shows that they were supposed to appear as a legitimate construction company so OSHA inspectors coming by would not change its character.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">4. Defendant\u2019s Closing Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Caro maintains that in striking certain portions of the defense closing argument, the District Court \u201c[fjailed to accurately explain the extent of its ruling and thus left it to the jury to determine how much of the defense closing it would consider.\u201d (Blue Brief, pg. 70). Caro, further, contends that the striking of this argument was particularly harmful because this \u201cevidence that was to be addressed and explained away by defense counsel improperly appeared in the jury room and played a role in deliberations.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>36</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">During closing argument, Caro\u2019s counsel made the following argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-7\">Another red herring was the checks from Carlos Benitez. Again, Mr. Obispo said that the checks from Carlos Benitez were Medicare fraud checks. Well, let\u2019s look at these cheeks. This is Exhibit 486 from the Government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">(Dkt. 527, pg. 38). The government objected claiming that it had been precluded from presenting evidence of Caro\u2019s other ongoing criminal investigations by the District Court\u2019s ruling on a Motion in Limine, the defense was arguing that evidence in closing. <em>Id. </em>at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">The District Court sustained the objection and instructed the jury in the following manner: \u201cI have struck the last few portions of the statements made by Mr. Black. He\u2019s been instructed to go into another area. You are to disregard any statements in this area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 47. This instruction, according to Caro, lacks specificity and created the risk that the jury disregarded more of the argument than necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-12\">A District Court \u201chas broad discretion over the scope of closing argument.\u201d <em>United States v. Gaines, </em>690 F.2d 849, 858 (11th Cir.1982). \u201cAbsent a showing of an abuse of discretion the district court will not be reversed for limiting summation as long as the defendant has the opportunity to make all legally tenable arguments that are supported by the facts of the ease.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b872-13\">We must be clear. Caro is not arguing that he should have been permitted to continue his argument or that the District Court erred in limiting his closing argument. Instead, Caro\u2019s contention is that the language of the limiting instruction left the jury without sufficient guidance on the amount of the closing argument to disregard.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-14\">Under the invited error doctrine, however, we will not consider an argument on appeal when the party making the argument invited or induced the district court into making the alleged error. <em>United States v. Love, </em>449 F.3d 1154, 1157 (11th Cir.2006). Here, Caro committed the error by making an improper argument during closing. Then, once the District Court acted to correct this error, Caro had no objection to the curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-15\">Moreover, the record reflects the sound exercise of discretion by the District Court. Evidence of other criminal investigations into Caro had previously been excluded from the trial, and it was not error to keep this from the jury. Finally, there is no question that this isolated instruction from the District Court did not render Caro\u2019s trial unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>5. Comment on Silence</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Caro asserts that the government elicited testimony from Obispo that compromised his right to remain silent. The following exchange occurred during the government\u2019s direct examination of Obispo:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-6\">Q. And he goes on to say on Page 16, Line 8, \u201cNot counting the strange people.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-7\">What did you understand the reference to the \u201cstrange people\u201d to mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-8\">A. Fictitious corporations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-9\">Q. You asked Mr. Caro, \u201cBut you also have strange people, and that\u2019s worth something,\u201d to which Mr. Caro responds, \u201cNo, Migue. I no longer have anything.\u201d And what did you understand that to mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-10\">A. Well, I tell you what I understand and what I do not understand. I understand that he\u2019s telling me that he doesn\u2019t have these corporations in his\u2014or within his business. But on the other hand, I understand that he accepted the fictitious companies\u2014corporations I bring in to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-11\">Q. And how so?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-12\">A. He knows that all the corporations we were cashing checks for are fictitious corporations. About that, there\u2019s no\u2014 well, I mean, I don\u2019t have the least doubt about that. Well, if he claims that DJ is a legit corporation\u2014that may be one that he may mention\u2014I would say it\u2019s not a\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-13\">(Dkt. 552, pgs. 78-79).<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-14\">At sidebar, Caro\u2019s counsel argued this was a comment on Caro\u2019s right to remain silent. <em>Id. </em>at 79.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The government responded that Obispo was simply commenting on the conversation on the tape recording. <em>Id. </em>at 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-17\">The District Court directed the government\u2019s attorney to clear up any ambiguity with the next question, <em>id., </em>and that was done. The next question and answer given were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-18\">Q. Mr. Obispo, referring you back to Page 17, what did you understand Mr. Caro to mean when he told you, \u201cI no\u201d\u2014 I\u2019m on Line 12\u2014\u201cI no longer have anything\u201d? What was he referring to in this conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-19\">A. He\u2019s making reference to the fact that within his own corporation no shell companies or corporations are in operation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-20\"><em>Id. </em>at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-21\">To determine if there has been an impermissible comment on a defendant\u2019s right not to testify at trial, \u201cthe district court must consider, whether the statement was manifestly intended or was of such character that a jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the'failure of an accused to testify.\u201d <em>United States v. Chastain, </em>198 F.3d 1338, 1351 (11th Cir.1999). In determining the appropriateness of the statement, \u201cthe court must consider the circumstances in which the statement was made.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-22\">This testimony by Obispo was not a comment on Defendant\u2019s right to remain silent, and the District Court cleared up any ambiguities by requiring the government to ask Obispo a follow-up question.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>6. Government Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Throughout the trial, according to Caro, the government engaged in conduct that inappropriately focused the jury\u2019s attention away from the facts of the case and onto character assassination of defense counsel, Caro and Caro\u2019s family. Caro asserts that these \u201cprosecutorial excesses\u201d denied him a fair trial. (Blue Brief, pg. 72).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">We review claims of prosecutorial misconduct <em>de novo </em>because they involve mixed questions of law and fact. <em>United States v. Noriega, </em>117 F.3d 1206, 1218 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cTo establish prosecutorial misconduct, \u2018(1) the remarks must be improper, and (2) the remarks must prejudicially affect the substantial rights of the defendant.\u2019\u201d <em>Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d at 947 (quoting <em>United States v. Eyster, </em>948 F.2d 1196, 1206 (11th Cir.1991)). The substantial rights of a defendant are \u201cprejudicially affected when a reasonable probability arises that, but for the remarks, the outcome of the trial would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>149 F.3d 1298, 1301 (11th Cir.1998)). Nevertheless, if the record reveals \u201csufficient independent evidence of guilt,\u201d the prosecutorial error may be harmless. <em>United States v. Adams, </em>74 F.3d 1093, 1097-98 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">While lengthy, we consider it necessary to review each of the alleged acts of impropriety. Below are the comments Caro complains of from the record.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Some of these comments .are made during argument and others during objections. Caro also complains about other remarks made outside of the presence of the jury, but we need not address these as they would not have impacted the jury\u2019s verdict. Below are the statements, which are delineated in \u201ca through fff,\u201d as reflected in the initial and reply briefs:<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">a. During the cross-examination of Gonzalez by Grimberg, the government asks the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-11\">Whether you physically prepared the CTRs or not, Mr. Gonzalez, you told the agents that you knew that this is how it was being done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-12\">You told them that you knew that the individuals identified in the CTRs were not the individuals coming in to cash those checks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-13\">You told them that, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-14\">(Dkt. 343, pg. 258).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-15\">b. This exchange occurred outside the presence of the jury. (Dkt. 343, pg. 263).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-16\">c. The government asked Agostinho this question: \u201cNow, when Yuri came back after meeting with Mr. Caro, did he have a company that he now miraculously worked for?\u201d Defense counsel interposed an objection and the question was withdrawn. (Dkt. 558, pgs. 173-74).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-17\">d. During the cross-examination of Diaz-Yabor, the District Court hearing argument on an objection. The government stated, \u201cThat\u2019s the real issue in the case, Judge.\u201d (Dkt. 564, pg. 71).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-18\">e. Caro cites to a portion of the record, (Dkt. 344, pgs. 122-23), that does not exist. This transcript (Dkt. 344) only includes pages 1-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-19\">f. Caro cites to a portion of the record, (Dkt. 345, pg. 149), that does not exist. This transcript (Dkt. 345) only includes pages 1-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>g. During rebuttal argument to the jury, the government stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-5\">the day before that this was some sort of competitive event, that I was here to win at all costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-6\">This isn\u2019t a football game. I am not an attorney for hire. I am a' prosecutor who is presenting in a court of law the evidence that the Judge admits and that is presented to the jury and the jury decides whether someone\u2019s guilty or riot guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-7\">And the suggestion that there\u2019s going to be a big parade in my honor when I win this is spurious, to be quite candid with you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-8\">But having said that, I want to walk with you through some of the statements that were made by the defense counsel in the last two days and remind you of some of the evidence that contradicts those statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-9\">The fact that I did a PowerPoint to present my evidence in an organized and quick manner seemed to have aggravated some of the attorneys. So I did another one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">(Dkt. 528, pg. 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">h.

But the reason they\u2019re coming to La Bamba is to not pay the taxes on it. That\u2019s the scheme. And that\u2019s what makes it worthwhile to pay 5 percent of the face value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-20\">I work very hard for my money, as I\u2019m sure you do. You\u2019re going to have to pry 5 percent out of my cold, dead fingers before I\u2019m willing to do that unless there\u2019s some benefit to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-21\">The benefit is you don\u2019t have to pay taxes on it. That\u2019s going to cost\u2014the taxes that you\u2019re going to have to pay\u2014 the\u2014on payroll taxes, on whatever income tax is assessed to you, the cost of workers\u2019 comp, that\u2019s much more expensive than 5 percent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-22\">So it\u2019s sort of a deal. If it wasn\u2019t for, again, that pesky illegal part, it would actually be a very good deal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-23\">The checks that Donad\u00edo wrote to Mira and to DJ were unendorsed when delivered. What does that mean? We kept hearing about endorsed and unendorsed checks, the fact that La Bamba stamps these checks without knowing who these people are, are these people authorized to sign checks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-24\">They have their own little rubber stamp and just flop it on the check.

This is how you. work in construction? You have to create a fake company and then pay someone a kickback in order to use the company? Hmm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-23\">Between all five companies, La Bamba filed false CTRs totaling $60 million. Now, you look at that guy.

This doesn\u2019t end here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-19\">So the idea that these people somehow came to testify\u2014when I say \u201cthese people,\u201d Joseph Dieppa, Rodrigo Donadio, Adelino Agostinho, Mario Varela\u2014 the people who have nothing to do with Mr. Obispo, the people who dealt directly with La Bamba, somehow are getting a pass on this and their testimony is not to be believed is disingenuous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-20\">(Dkt. 528, pg. 28).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-21\">jj. In the rebuttal argument, the government made the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-22\">The IRS doesn\u2019t record, and neither does the FBI. They don\u2019t record interviews because, if the tape machine breaks, the batteries go, you didn\u2019t press the right button, you\u2019ve got nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-23\">And one of the many reasons you don\u2019t do it in this particular case is because they\u2019re at the scene of a search warrant and the agents are getting in and out of the car, back and forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-24\">And then what? Then we\u2019d be here saying, \u201cWell, every time you turned off the tape recorder, you did so so [sic] that he could say something else\u201d or, \u201cWhat he was really saying was....\u201d We\u2019d have that whole series of things. That\u2019s why the agents sit there and they take notes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-27\">And to suggest that there was something nefarious about that, that this is the first criminal case in recorded history that somebody\u2019s confession wasn\u2019t recorded, is disingenuous because he knows that that\u2019s not true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-28\">Let\u2019s talk about Mr. Chaoui\u2019s defenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-29\">Mr. Chaoui\u2019s lawyer says that Mr. Chaoui was not paid under the table.

In the rebuttal argument, the government made the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-6\">We heard from Ralph Tillman. And let me just clarify a couple of things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-7\">The argument was that the Government was angry that Ralph Tillman testified. And, yes, we were angry. We were angry that he was shown the trial transcripts from other witnesses, including Peter Djinis\u2019s, in order to craft his testimony at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-8\">You\u2019re not allowed to do that, and that\u2019s what pissed us off, that you were allowed to read the other expert\u2019s testimony and them come in and figure out what you had to say the opposite of what the other witness said. You don\u2019t do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-9\">We were angry that he was still an IRS agent at the time we were investigating La Bamba, and that\u2019s not right. You compromise\u2014you have to think back and wonder, \u2018Was our investigation compromised in any way?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-10\">We\u2019re not angry at his testimony. He says what he\u2019s going to say. He\u2019s not an attorney. He\u2019s opining about legal issues on agency and things that he\u2019s just simply not qualified to opine on. He\u2019s qualified to opine about IRS matters because he worked there for 34 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-11\">(Dkt. 528, pgs. 39-40).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">11. In the rebuttal argument, the government made the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-13\">So, number one, if you thought that video showed something different, you could have played it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-14\">Number two, I don\u2019t show videotapes. You\u2019re absolutely right. I do not show videotapes of what other people are saying to witnesses. That\u2019s improper. That\u2019s what they did with Mr. Tillman. That\u2019s not what I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-16\">I\u2019m not going to show Monica Ruiz a series of videotapes with other people speaking on them and then have her-influence her testimony and say what I want her to say on the stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-17\">I prepare every single witness that comes in here. I try not to waste your time and the Court\u2019s time. I\u2019m organized. I come in. I meet with all my witnesses. We go through, \u201cHere\u2019s what we\u2019re going to go through.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-18\">I went through with Mr. Obispo all of these tapes. I played the ones that I thought were relevant, that showed illegal conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-19\">But I meet with all of my witnesses. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. And the defense met with their witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-20\">To suggest somehow that I, you know, tampered with the evidence in some way by preparing witnesses for testimony is disingenuous. Everybody does it, and it\u2019s correct. That\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-21\">(Dkt. 528, pgs. 47-48).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-22\">mm. During closing argument, the government made the following comments referring to Tillman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-23\">He had been personally involved with La Bamba when he worked for the IRS. He had examined La Bamba in 1999 and 2001. Both were done under his supervision. Both times he found them to be in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-24\">He testified about his theory on agency, but he acknowledged that it\u2019s his own personal opinion. He acknowledged that there\u2019s no statute, there\u2019s no case, there\u2019s no regulation that he is relying on for this theory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>In fact, he acknowledged that the agency who is in charge of interpreting\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-5\">MR.

GRIMBERG: He acknowledged that the agency that is responsible for interpreting the Bank Secrecy Act, for deciding what is and is not appropriate is FinCen, FinCen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-8\">Remember, Peters Djinis was the former director of FinCen. And Mr. Tillman, of course, could not explain how La Bamba could have been justified in the CTRs that....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">(Dkt. 526, pg. 149).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">nn. During rebuttal argument, the government made the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-11\">The defense says that Peter Djinis agreed with Obispo\u2014that Obispo was an agent of La Bamba. They say that to suggest that there\u2019s a conflict among the experts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-12\">First of all, it\u2019s apples and oranges. You\u2019ve got on the one hand Peter Djinis, who\u2019s an attorney and the former deputy director of FinCEN, the agency that rules over all of this. That\u2019s why he was asked to come and give expert testimony: \u201cHere\u2019s what the law is in this area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-13\">What Mr. Garvin did was, in a hypothetical, suggest that Obispo was a truck driver, just like the La Bamba truck drivers. And in that scenario, the question was, \u201cDo you have to do a CTR-when La Bamba gives money to the people in the truck to go out and spend money, do you need to do a CTR?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2d\">(Dkt. 528, pgs. 41-42).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-14\">oo. During cross examination of defense witness Esther Crespo, the government asked the following questions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-15\">Q. Good morning, Ms. Crespo.

Ms. Crespo, you are a\u2014you\u2019re a certified translator for both the courts and for private hire. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-18\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-19\">(Dkt. 518, pg. 18).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-20\">pp. During rebuttal argument, the government made the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-21\">What about La Bamba\u2019s defenses? \u201cWe only committed a little bit of fraud,\u201d the \u201cneedle in a haystack\u201d argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-22\">The Government charges that 132 million of CTRs filed by La Bamba were done so falsely and it was done so knowingly and willfully, knowing these companies were fictitious, to assist those people in avoiding paying income taxes. It\u2019s limited to those 15 companies, and the total is 132 million.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-23\">That\u2019s what\u2014that\u2019s what La Bamba reported. That\u2019s what the bank records show. That\u2019s what their logs show.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-24\">At no point did the Government suggest that it was $600 million. The indictment says that La Bamba filed $600 million in CTRs in 2006 and 2007. It doesn\u2019t say those were false. It says they filed 600 million. The indictment says 132 million of those were false.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-25\">The defense has come back and presented a chart saying that, \u201cWell, you think that\u2019s bad? We cashed $600 million in 2007 alone.\u201d But that\u2019s not what\u2019s charged in the indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-26\">So why isn\u2019t La Bamba\u2014and you\u2019ll also note in the jury instructions there\u2019s no little bit of fraud exception. If you\u2019ve got a little bit of fraud and a lot of other cases, that somehow makes it better. It\u2019s like being a little pregnant. You either are or you aren\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>So why isn\u2019t La Bamba still in business? You heard six different times during opening and closing statements by the attorneys that 62 employees are out of work, the Government shut La Bamba down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-4\">But did you hear any evidence that the Government shut La Bamba down? That\u2019s because we didn\u2019t. That\u2019s why La Bamba is charged in this indictment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">(Dkt. 528, pgs. 18-19).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">qq.

A lot of times things come out during the process of litigation and sometimes, at that point, it\u2019s too late to-institutionally to deauthorize a case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-24\">Q.

During rebuttal argument, the government made the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-20\">You can evaluate their credibility, their testimony, what their motivation is to lie. I will tell you that I think it takes a special type of person to come into federal court and admit to conspiring and filing millions of dollars in checks and not having paid taxes on them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-21\">So you can take that as you will. What\u2019s their motivation to lie in contrast with the Defendants\u2019 motivation to criticize them and make a story?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-22\">The Government only gave you half of Monica Ruiz\u2019s statement from Alfredo Gonzalez.

She said that he told her when she asked about the commission statements\u2014commission checks, \u201cBetter not to ask.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-23\">I don\u2019t know what Mr. Gonzalez is talking about, because he testified that he doesn\u2019t remember that conversation. So it\u2019s not a matter of whether it was half a conversation or a full conversation. It\u2019s simply he doesn\u2019t remember it. But that\u2019s what Monica told us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-24\">And I\u2019ll talk more about Monica in a second.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-25\">Mr. Alter says that Gonzalez\u2019s confession, now, wasn\u2019t really a confession. Yet, you had\u2014and you, of course, expect someone\u2014what else are you going to say when you\u2019ve got a written confession facing you? You\u2019re going to say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s not really what I meant.\u201d I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-26\">But the facts are that two professional, experienced IRS agents met with him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>the day of the arrest. They sat down in the car and they conducted an interview.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-4\">Each agent took contemporaneous, detailed notes about what was said, which both the notes and the memo that was prepared, based on those notes, were turned over to defense counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-5\">And now\u2014and defense counsel used those notes to cross-examine some of the witnesses. But now, when Mr. Gonzalez takes the stand, \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t say any of that. That\u2019s not really what I said. I\u2019ve been misinterpreted. That\u2019s not really\u201d\u2014and he claims he never actually saw a CTR until after his arrest, but the day of his arrest he admitted that he knew that the people conducting the transactions weren\u2019t the people that are being reported on the CTRs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-6\">But now he\u2019s had a memory lapse, and I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-7\">But the fact that he <em>didn\u2019t\u2014we </em>didn\u2019t record the interview\u2014Mr. Alter\u2019s been doing this for 30 years and he knows better than that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">(Dkt. 528, pgs. 29-31).

Some of the comments may have been unwise, but none of them constituted prosecutorial misconduct and none, sepa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>rately or combined, would have impacted the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">7. Severance Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">According to Caro, the District Court erred in denying his motion for severance because this allowed prejudicial spillover from co-Defendant Gonzalez\u2019s post-arrest statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">Caro and La Bamba filed a Motion to Sever that centered on statements made by Gonzalez to IRS agents on January 18, 2008. In denying the motion (Dkt. 238), the District Court explained there was no <em>Bruton </em>issue because the government \u201cintend[ed] to introduce only those portions of Defendant Gonzalez\u2019s statements that incriminate him alone....\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">IRS Agent Alfonso Herrera testified about Gonzalez\u2019s statement to the IRS. Following that testimony, Caro\u2019s counsel objected and asked for a severance of the trial. Counsel contended that while Gonzalez\u2019s statement did not directly implicate Caro, it pointed to him indirectly. After a sidebar, the District Court gave the following instruction to the jury: \u201c[t]he evidence that you\u2019ve just heard is evidence that is being submitted in the case of the United States versus Alfredo Gonzalez. It is not to be considered by you in any way against any other Defendant.\u201d (Dkt. 563, pg. 119).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">\u201cIt is well settled that defendants who are indicted together are usually tried together.\u201d <em>United States v. Browne, </em>505 F.3d 1229, 1268-1269 (11th Cir.2007). Therefore, we are \u201cgenerally reluctant to second-guess the District Court\u2019s decision on severance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A District Court\u2019s denial of a motion to sever is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>To \u201cshow such an abuse,\u201d a moving party must discharge the \u201c \u2018heavy burden\u2019 of demonstrating \u2018compelling prejudice\u2019 from the joinder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Novaton, </em>271 F.3d 968, 989 (11th Cir.2001)(quoting <em>United States v. Pepe, </em>747 F.2d 632, 651 (11th Cir.1984))). The <em>Browne </em>Court, further, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-13\">[T]he Supreme Court set forth a two-step test to determine whether a defendant is entitled to a new trial due to a district court\u2019s refusal to sever prior to trial or to grant a mistrial once trial has commenced. A defendant must first demonstrate that the joint trial resulted in prejudice to him; and second, must show that severance is the proper remedy for that prejudice. Under this test, [tjhere are only two circumstances in which severance is the only permissible remedy: where there is a serious risk that a joint trial (1) would compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants, or (2) would prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-14\"><em>Browne, </em>505 F.3d at 1268-1269 (internal quotations and citations removed).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-15\">Caro has not met this heavy burden; especially considering the District Court instructed the jury to consider the evidence against no other defendant but Gonzalez.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-16\">8. Extrinsic Evidence and the Jury</p>\n<p id=\"b888-17\">Caro argues the District Court erred in failing to declare a. mistrial where jury deliberations were tainted by extrinsic evidence, consisting of unredacted transcripts of conversations between Caro and Obispo that were not admitted during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>When the jury retired to deliberate, the parties agreed that all the evidence admitted would be given to the jury for their use, with the exception of two CDs for October 31, and November 14, 2007. The conversations on these two CDs had been redacted for use before the jury, but the CDs contained the unredacted parts. The accompanying transcripts for those CDs had been redacted, and those redacted transcripts were given to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">However, less than a week into its deliberations, the foreperson sent a note to the District Court stating that \u201cwe are looking through all the evidence provided. The original transcripts are in there with nothing blacked out. Is this right?\u201d (Dkt. 533, pg. 3). After consultation with the parties, the District Court removed the evidence from the jury room for inspection. (Dkt. 533, pg. 7). During this inspection, it was discovered that two unredacted transcripts had been included in the evidence provided to the jury, along with the two redacted transcripts to use as trial aids. (Dkt. 533, pgs. 8-12).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">The government compared the two versions and identified three matters contained in the unredacted transcripts: (1) payment of \u201cmoney under the table\u201d for Caro\u2019s purchase of Cash Flow; (2) references to another investigation; and (3) the fate of Pronto Cash and its owner who was having a \u201cproblem.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> (Dkt. 533, pgs. 15-17). The parties and the District Court agreed that the inclusion of the unredacted transcripts was unintentional. (Dkt. 533, pgs. 18-21).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">The District Court inquired whether the jurors had read the unredacted transcripts. (Dkt. 533, pgs. 22, 29). The foreperson explained that Juror 12 had read part of the November 14 unredacted transcript and \u201cshe realized what it was.\u201d (Dkt. 533, pg. 38). Juror 12 alerted the foreperson whereupon he wrote the note to the court. <em>Id. </em>at 39. After the note, the jury stopped deliberations and the unredacted transcripts had not been used further as part of the deliberations. <em>Id. </em>at 40. The foreperson was clear that this was the first occasion that any juror examined the box of transcripts. (Dkt. 533, pgs. 42-43).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">Juror 12 was questioned by the District Court. While going through a box of transcripts, she began reading the unredacted transcript. <em>Id. </em>at 44. She did not recall all of the material she was reading from the trial, and noticed the transcript contained no \u201cblacked out\u201d parts. <em>Id. </em>at 44. Juror 12 informed the foreperson of her discovery. <em>Id. </em>Juror 12 recalled that Pronto Check Cashing was discussed in the transcript. <em>Id. </em>at 45-46. She did not discuss what she had read with the other jurors, <em>id. </em>at 46, and Juror 12 was clear that prior to her review of the transcript no other juror had looked at it. <em>Id. </em>at 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">The District Court granted Caro\u2019s motion to strike Juror 12. <em>Id. </em>at 67. The court and the parties then focused on how to proceed. Counsel for Gonzalez asked what would be done with the verdicts the jury had reached on two of the defendants. <em>Id. </em>at 68. The District Court explained, \u201cwhatever happens, whether it\u2019s 11 or whether it\u2019s 12 [jurors], I\u2019m taking the verdicts, destroying them and going to reinstruct them and tell them to begin their deliberations anew....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">The District Court dismissed Juror 12. The remaining eleven jurors were asked whether anyone else had looked at the unredacted transcripts. <em>Id. </em>at 83. The District Court received no response. <em>Id. </em>At that time, the District Court also confiscated the completed verdict forms from the jury, and indicated they would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>read but shredded. <em>Id. </em>Thereupon the jury was excused for a long weekend. <em>Id. </em>at 83-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Upon returning from the weekend, the foreperson provided the District Court with the following note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-5\">Judge Lenard: I originally believed that [Juror 12] was the only juror who read parts of the original November 14th transcript.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-6\">I since became aware that two other jurors also read parts of this transcript. When you called all the jurors into the courtroom and asked if anyone else had read the transcript, I expected them to say something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-7\">I did not feel comfortable pointing them out in front of the whole court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-8\">I should have sent you a note when I first became aware. I cannot, however, remain silent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">(Dkt. 534, pgs. 3-4). With the parties\u2019 agreement, the District Court interviewed the jurors individually and learned that Jurors 7 and 8 had known about the transcript.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> (Dkt. 534, pgs. 10-20, 23-25).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">Juror 7 stated that she had not actually read the transcript, but glanced over Juror 8\u2019s shoulder while he was reading it. <em>Id. </em>at 20. Only the word \u201cPronto\u201d stood out to Juror 7, but she could not tell what it was regarding, nor did she \u201cactually read the transcript.\u201d (Dkt. 534, pg. 20). Juror 8 had not read the transcript, although he had \u201clooked over at it\u201d while Juror 12 was reading it. (Dkt. 534, pg. 21).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">The District Court granted the request to strike Juror 8 and replaced him with an alternate. (Dkt. 534, pgs. 26-27). The District Court noted that although there was no request to strike Juror 7, what she had read was \u201cde minimis\u201d with regard to \u201cPronto,\u201d which, in any event, had not been included in the portion of the Motion in Limine that had been granted. (Dkt. 534, pgs. 27-28, 51-52).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-13\">At this point, Caro requested a mistrial on the ground that heightened attention to the unredacted transcript had created a \u201cpollutive effect on the entire jury.\u201d (Dkt. 534, pg. 29). That motion was denied. (Dkt. 534, pg. 31).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-14\">After determining the two alternative jurors had not engaged in deliberations with the other jurors, the District Court convened the ten remaining jurors, explained that it had dismissed Juror 8, and directed them to begin deliberations anew with the two alternates. (Dkt. 534, pgs. 43-46). The District Court assembled the entire reconstituted jury and instructed them anew. (Dkt. 534, pgs. 53-85). Three days later, the jury returned its verdict. (Dkt. 538, pgs. 8-20).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-15\">A denial of a motion for mistrial is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Emmanuel, </em>565 F.3d at 1334. Moreover, we review \u201cthe denial of a motion for a new trial based on the jury\u2019s exposure to extrinsic evidence for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Ronda, </em>455 F.3d 1273, n. 33 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>\u201cA mistrial or new trial is required only if the extrinsic evidence known by the jury posed a reasonable possibility of prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Ronda, </em>455 F.3d at 1299 (11th Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>748 F.2d 1519, 1533 (11th Cir.1984)). \u201cThe defendant has the burden to show that the jury has been exposed to extrinsic evidence or extrinsic contacts. Once the defendant establishes that such exposure in fact occurred, prejudice is presumed and the burden shifts to the government to rebut the presumption.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">\u201cTo rebut the presumption of prejudice, the government must show that the jurors\u2019 consideration of extrinsic evidence was harmless to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo evaluate whether the government has rebutted that presumption, we consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the introduction of the extrinsic evidence to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1299-1300. \u201cThe factors we consider include: (1) the nature of the extrinsic evidence; (2) the manner in which the information reached the jury; (3) the factual findings in the district court and the manner of the court\u2019s inquiry into the juror issues; and (4) the strength of the government\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The District Court\u2019s conscientious investigation of the extrinsic evidence and the jurors who saw it put that court in the best position to determine whether or not any juror misconduct deprived Caro of his due process right to a fair trial. The District Court individually questioned each member of the jury, and replaced the two jurors who had seen the unredacted transcripts for more than a passing glance. The reconstituted jury was then directed to start deliberations anew.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">The only juror who rendered a verdict who had any contact with the unredacted transcript could not have been affected by her reading the word \u201cPronto.\u201d Therefore, the government met its burden of demonstrating that the unredacted transcript evidence was harmless to Caro, and the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for new trial. We conclude the District Court properly exercised its discretion in finding that Caro\u2019s jury was free of any legitimate taint from the extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">9. Destruction of Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Caro makes one additional claim arising from this extrinsic evidence. Caro claims that the District Court abridged his protection against double jeopardy by disposing of the partial verdict from the original jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">The District Court charged the jury and they began deliberations on Friday, January 23, 2009. (Dkt. 528, pg. 106) On Wednesday, January 28, 2009, the fourth day of deliberations, the jury provided the District Court with the following note: \u201cJudge Lenard, We have reached a verdict on two Defendants on all counts. We have been unable to reach a verdict on the other two Defendants. We are at an impasse. No unanimous decision on Count 1 or any of the substantive charges related to these Defendants.\u201d (Dkt. 531, pgs. 4-5).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-13\">The District Court sought, the advice of counsel since Fed. R.Crim. Proc. 31(b)(1) permits a jury to return a partial verdict at anytime in a multiple defendant case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>(Dkt. 531, pg. 5). Caro\u2019s counsel maintained, \u201cWe see no purpose to be served by taking a verdict at this time as to the two Defendants that they have decided on.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. Caro\u2019s counsel explained, \u201cThe reason that we do not think the verdicts should be taken at this time is the jury always has the right during deliberations to revisit and, if they choose to revisit and they\u2019ve given the verdict over, it may not be\u2014it takes it away from them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">After considering the parties\u2019 positions, the District Court concluded that \u201cI don\u2019t find that it would be appropriate to fully return the verdict at this time, since I\u2019m going to be instructing them to continue to deliberate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. The jury would be instructed that to give verdict forms to the court and they would be sealed. <em>Id. </em>at 9. There were no objections to this course of action. <em>Id. </em>at 9, 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Ultimately, the District Court instructed the jury that she was taking the completed verdict forms and was \u201cgoing to shred them.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> (Dkt. 533, pg. 83). There was no objection to this suggested course of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Under the invited error doctrine, however, we will not consider an argument on appeal when the party making the argument invited or induced the District Court into making the alleged error. <em>Love, </em>449 F.3d at 1157 (declining to consider an argument that a term of supervised release was excessive when the defendant acknowledged in the plea agreement that the term was proper and argued for supervised release at sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Caro\u2019s counsel could have objected to the District Court\u2019s proposed action of shredding the verdict, but chose not to. This failure should not permit Caro to now raise this issue. Moreover, though an initial result on two defendants was delivered to the trial judge, it was not a final verdict published in open court with no juror dissent. <em>See United States v. Acevedo, </em>141 F.3d 1421, 1424 n. 6 (11th Cir.1998). As such, there was no event which terminated the original jeopardy and the jury was free to continue deliberations with a substitute juror, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 24(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">At the time the unredacted evidence issue arose, Caro\u2019s counsel argued that the District Court should not take a partial verdict. Counsel argued to the District Court that the jurors could actually change the verdict during further deliberations, and they wanted the jury to be able to do just that. So, Caro actually asked the court not to accept the partial verdict and wait until the jury had completed all of its deliberations, and take whatever verdict they had reached at that later time. The destruction of the partial verdict by the District Court is exactly what Caro\u2019s counsel requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">10. Instructions to the Jury</p>\n<p id=\"b892-12\">Caro argues that the District Court erroneously denied defense requests for various jury instructions. The instructions that should have been given, according to Caro, were: (1) an instruction on the law of agency; (2) a good faith theory of defense, and reliance on a FinCen advisory opinion; (3) an instruction on specific intent as an element of the substantive CTR filing offenses; and (4) an instruction on \u201cthe relationship between prosecutorial discretion to reduce sentences and potential partisanship or bias by cooperating witnesses\u201d (Blue brief, pg. 77). Caro, addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>tionally, argues that the District Court should not have given a deliberate ignorance instruction.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the correctness of jury instructions. <em>Prather, </em>205 F.3d at 1270. A district court has \u201cbroad discretion in formulating a jury charge as long as the charge as a whole is a correct statement of the law.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez-Tosta, </em>36 F.3d 1552, 1565 (11th Cir.1994). A conviction will not be reversed on this ground \u201cunless we find that issues of law were presented inaccurately or the charge improperly guided the jury in such a substantial way as to violate due process.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">However, a District Court\u2019s refusal to give a requested instruction is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Yeager, </em>331 F.3d at 1222. A denial of a requested jury instruction is reversible error only where the requested instruction: \u201c(1) was correct, (2) was not substantially covered by the charge actually given, and (3) dealt with some point in the trial so important that failure to give the requested instruction seriously impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to conduct his defense.\u201d <em>Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d at 947-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-13\">Nevertheless, a district court \u201cis not bound to use the exact words and phrasing requested by defense counsel in its jury charge.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>975 F.2d 1514, 1517 (11th Cir.1992). When deciding if the difference in the requested instruction and the one actually given is significant, we \u201cneed only ascertain whether the charge, when viewed as a whole, fairly and correctly states the issues and the law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-14\">a. Agency Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b893-15\">Caro requested an instruction on an agency relationship.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The District Court denied the requested agency instruction because it was substantially covered by the agency charge given.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> (Dkt. 524, pgs. 31-32).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-16\">Caro provided the District Court with no binding support for his contention that such an instruction is permissible in a criminal proceeding; nor does he do so now. Accordingly, we conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>b. Good Faith Defense/Reliance on a FinCen Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Caro requested jury instructions on good faith.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> This instruction was premised upon Chaoui\u2019s testimony that he consulted the FinCen website where he locat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>ed FinCen Ruling 2003-3. That ruling, according to Chaoui explained that La Bamba was not required to file a CTR for a money transfer from Western Union to La Bamba.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">The District Court granted Caro\u2019s request (Dkt. 524, pgs. 7-9) and charged the jury on good-faith reliance, according to each defendant\u2019s individual circumstances. (Dkt. 528, pgs. 70-73). The District Court, however, did not rely upon Caro\u2019s proposed instruction, but gave a modified version of the pattern good-faith defense jury instruction.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> A review of these two instructions demonstrates that the District Court fairly and correctly stated the applicable law to the jury. The failure to give the exact instruction requested by Caro was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Furthermore, the absence of an instruction on Caro\u2019s good-faith-reliance on the FinCen opinion was properly rejected because even Chaoui, the only defendant who had raised the defense, had conceded that the FinCen ruling that he had relied on was \u201climited to licensed money-transmitters and their\u2014the transfer of money between licensed money transmitter and their agents,\u201d and was totally divorced from the question how a CTR should be filed by La Bamba, thereby rendering the requested instruction inapplicable to the case. (Dkt. 523, pg. 36).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-13\">The District Court determined that there was no justification for the charge because Chaoui had testified that he had never consulted an attorney or accountant about the regulations and that he made an independent decision about how to prepare and file the CTRs for the cash that La Bamba advanced to Cash Flow based upon the FinCen opinion. (Dkt. 523, pgs. 56-57).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-14\">c. Specific Intent Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b895-15\">According to Caro, the District Court\u2019s failure to give a specific intent instruction prejudiced him. It is Caro\u2019s view that he was charged under \u201ccomplex and ambiguous\u201d regulations that required the District Court to instruct the jury of his actual knowledge of the regulatory burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-16\">The District Court declined to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>Caro\u2019s requested instruction,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> concluding that it incorrectly stated the law. The District Court opted instead to utilize the definition of purposefully from <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>444 U.S. 394, 100 S.Ct. 624, 62 L.Ed.2d 575 (1980). (Dkt. 523, pgs. 10-11).<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Thereafter, counsel for both Caro and La Bamba explained they had no objection to this resolution. (Dkt. 523, pg. 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Under the invited error doctrine we will not consider this argument. <em>Love, </em>449 F.3d at 1157. Even if we were to consider this claim, we reverse a conviction on the basis of a jury instruction only if \u201cwe are left with a substantial and eradicable doubt as to whether the jury was properly guided in its deliberations.\u201d <em>United States v. Puche, </em>350 F.3d 1137, 1148 (11th Cir.2003). The jury was advised adequately of the requisite intent through the inclusion of the \u201cwillingness\u201d instruction. (Dkt. 528, pg. 76).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-15\">d. Prosecutorial Discretion</p>\n<p id=\"b896-16\">Caro requested that the District Court specifically instruct the jury regarding prosecutorial discretion.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The justification for this instruction was that it would accurately describe for the jury the prosecutor\u2019s discretion in seeking the reduction of a cooperative witness\u2019 testimony. The District Court declined to give this instruction, opting instead to rely upon the standard instructions addressing witness bias.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> A review of these instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>demonstrate that the District Court fairly and correctly stated the applicable law to the jury. The failure to give the exact instruction requested by Caro was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">e. Deliberate Ignorance</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Caro maintains the District Court erroneously gave a deliberate ignorance instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">We have explained that for a deliberate ignorance instruction to be proper, \u201c \u2018it must be based upon facts which would point in the direction of deliberate ignorance.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>944 F.2d 1563, 1571 (11th Cir.1991) (quoting <em>United States v. Aleman, </em>728 F.2d 492 (11th Cir.1984)). A deliberate ignorance instruction \u201cis appropriate when \u2018the facts ... support the inference that the defendant was aware of a high probability of the existence of the fact in question and purposely contrived to avoid learning all of the facts in order to have a defense in the event of a subsequent prosecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Alvarado, </em>838 F.2d 311, 314 (9th Cir.1987)). This instruction should not be given when the evidence points only to actual knowledge, <em>id., </em>but \u201c \u2018the evidence supports both actual knowledge and deliberate ignorance, the instruction is properly given.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Arias, </em>984 F.2d 1139, 1143 (11th Cir.1993) (quoting <em>United States v. Ochoa-Fabian, </em>935 F.2d 1139, 1142 (10th Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">In this case, the record is clear that the deliberate ignorance instruction was properly given because there was clear evidence that supported actual knowledge along with deliberate ignorance. A significant part of Caro\u2019s defense was that he relied upon Becerra and other lower-level employees to file the CTR\u2019s for La Bamba.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">Whereas, others testified regarding Caro\u2019s active role in the scheme. The government introduced evidence that Valle, a co-conspirator and co-defendant, set up a number of shell companies through which he filed false CTRs with La Bamba. Other witnesses testified they used La Bamba to cash checks through fictional companies for the purpose of avoiding taxes. Some of the corporate officers of these fictitious companies, for example, Marvin Marroquin and Eduardo Olivar, testified that they were never in La <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>Bamba even though La Bamba filed CTRs for millions of dollars that reported them as being present for the transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Witnesses also testified that they participated in the filing of false CTRs with Caro personally. Rodrigo Donad\u00edo testified that he had received the name of his shell company, Mira, directly from Caro, and received specific instructions from Caro to fax copies of checks payable to shell companies directly to La Bamba, and that cash was then delivered to Donad\u00edo by Chaoui. Adelino Agostinho testified that he worked directly with Caro to write checks to shell companies to avoid paying taxes and workers\u2019 compensation. Mario Edgardo Varela Rivera testified to the same and specifically identified Caro as one of the individuals that cashed the checks. Dieppa testified that Caro prepared and provided to him false invoices for shell companies to circumvent bank scrutiny, and that Caro instructed Dieppa to switch from one shell company to another, because Dieppa had written \u201ctoo many checks\u201d to a particular shell company. Therefore, the District Court properly gave the deliberate ignorance instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">11. Cumulative Error</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">Predictably, Caro contends all the errors discussed above resulted in cumulative error. No cumulative errors exist here. <em>United States v. Waldon, </em>363 F.3d 1103, 1110 (11th Cir.2004)(citing <em>United States v. Allen, </em>269 F.3d 842, 847 (7th Cir.2001)(\u201cIf there are no errors or a single error, there can be no cumulative error.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">VI. SENTENCING ISSUES<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">Caro raises three issues regarding his 216 months sentence. First, Caro alleges the District Court erred in finding that he was an organizer or leader of the conspiracy for which he was convicted, and applying a corresponding four-level enhancement. Next, Caro argues that the District Court similarly erred in applying a three-level enhancement for obstruction of justice for his attempt to have a co-conspirator \u201cremove\u201d certain records from his files, asserting that the District Court failed to (1) consider his motive; and (2) explicitly find that the records were material to his prosecution. Finally, Caro argues that his total sentence was \u2019procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">A. Leadership Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b898-13\">Generally, \u201c[a] district court\u2019s enhancement of a defendant\u2019s offense level based on his role as an organizer or leader is a finding of fact reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Rendon, </em>354 F.3d 1320, 1331 (11th Cir.2003). The government bears the burden of proving applicability of an aggravating role enhancement by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Yeager, </em>331 F.3d at 1226.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">Where \u201cthe defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive,\u201d a four-level enhancement applies. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(a). Thus, two elements must be met: (1) the defendant must be an organizer or leader; and (2) the conspiracy must involve five or more people or be otherwise extensive. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>584 F.3d 1022, 1026 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-16\">Regarding the first element, a \u00a7 3B1.1 enhancement is appropriate as long as the defendant \u201casserted control or influence over at least one other participant in the crime.\u201d <em>Campa, </em>529 F.3d at 1013 (internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>quotation omitted). The commentary to \u00a7 3B1.1 states that, in \u201cdistinguishing a leadership and organizational role from one of mere management or supervision,\u201d the court should consider: (1) the exercise of decision making authority; (2) the nature of participation in the commission of the offense; (3) the recruitment of accomplices; (4) the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime; (5) the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense; (6) the nature and scope of the illegal activity; and (7) the degree of control and authority exercised over others. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment. (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Regarding the second element, a \u201c \u2018participant\u2019 is a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been convicted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment. (n.1); see <em>also United States v. Njau, </em>386 F.3d 1039, 1041 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that the manner of certain individuals\u2019 assistance in distributing counterfeit social security cards evidenced their knowledge of the scheme and made them \u201cparticipants\u201d for sentencing purposes). For a conspiracy to exist, \u201cthere is no requirement that each conspirator participated in every transaction, knew the other conspirators, or knew the details of each venture making up the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>17 F.3d 333, 337 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">The trial record reflects that Caro was personally involved in establishing the shell corporations that were the focus of the conspiracy, training other participants how to fill out the CTRs that misrepresented the nature of the transactions, was sought out by co-conspirators to make decisions, and actively recruited numerous other co-conspirators. In addition, as reflected in the evidence, the conspiracy had far above the requisite five or more participants needed for this enhancement. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not clearly err in applying a four-level .leadership enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">B. Obstruction-Of-Justice Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">We review a District Court\u2019s finding of fact regarding an obstruction-of-justice enhancement for clear error, but review <em>de novo </em>the application of the guidelines to those facts. <em>United States v. Bradberry, </em>466 F.3d 1249, 1253 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">A two-level obstruction-of-justice enhancement is appropriate if \u201cthe defendant willfully obstructed ... the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. The guidelines list numerous forms of conduct that may merit an obstruction enhancement, noting that the list is non-exhaustive. <em>See id. </em>comment (n.4). One form of listed conduct is \u201cdestroying or concealing or directing ... another person to destroy or conceal evidence that is material to an official investigation or judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>comment. (n.4(d)). The guidelines add that if conduct occurred contemporaneously with arrest, it shall not warrant enhancement unless it materially hindered the criminal proceedings against the offender. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">An obstruction enhancement is justified against a defendant who instructs another to manipulate records if the evidence suggests that the ultimate goal was to conceal criminal wrongdoing, regardless of whether the defendant uses words such as \u201cdestroy\u201d or \u201calter.\u201d <em>United States v. Tampas, </em>493 F.3d 1291, 1304 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that defendant\u2019s instructions to \u201creconcile\u201d records in an attempt to conceal his embezzlement warranted an obstruction enhancement as an attempt to produce a false record). Nevertheless, District Courts \u201c \u2018must not speculate concerning the existence of a fact which would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>permit a more severe sentence under the guidelines.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Gupta, </em>572 F.3d 878, 888 (11th Cir.2009)(quoting <em>United States v. Sepulveda, </em>115 F.3d 882, 890 (11th Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">Caro\u2019s challenge to an obstruction enhancement is without merit. Even assuming that his admitted attempt to have a co-conspirator \u201cremove\u201d certain relevant records from his files was done for benign reasons, he cites no authority supporting his proposition that the District Court was bound to find that his motivation excused his obstructive conduct. Nor does he cite any authority to support his argument that the District Court had to explicitly find that the records were \u201cmaterial\u201d to his prosecution. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in applying a three-level obstruction enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">C. Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Where appropriate, we examine a defendant\u2019s sentence for both procedural and substantive reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">\u201cSpecifically, the district court must impose a procedurally and substantively reasonable sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2008). A sentence is procedurally unreasonable if the district court fails to calculate or improperly calculates the guidelines range, treats the guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or fails to explain adequately the chosen sentence, including an explanation for any deviation from the guideline range. <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1091 (11th Cir.2008). A sentence is substantively unreasonable \u201cif it does not achieve the purposes of sentencing stated in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a), the sentencing court shall impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), namely, reflecting the seriousness of the offense; promoting respect for the law; providing just punishment for the offense; deterring criminal conduct; protecting the public from future criminal conduct by the defendant; and providing the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The sentencing court must also consider the following factors in determining a particular sentence: the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; the kinds of sentences available; the applicable guideline range; the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and the need to provide restitution to victims. See <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7). We defer to the district court\u2019s judgment regarding the weight given to each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, unless the district court has made \u201ca clear error of judgment\u201d under the facts of a particular case. <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">\u201c[W]hen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). A sentencing court need only \u201cset forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that [it] ... has a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Livesay, </em>525 F.3d at 1090 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">\u201c[T]he language of the Sentencing Guidelines is to be given its plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>United States v. Garey, </em>546 F.3d 1359, 1361 (11th Cir.2008)(in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>ternal quotations omitted)(holding that the defendant was subject to a 12-level enhancement under the plain language of the applicable guideline and accompanying commentary, despite his attempt to add an element). The guidelines provide that people convicted of knowingly filing false CTRs, as well as other offenses involving the evasion of reporting requirements, are subject to a base offense level of 6, plus the number of offense levels from \u00a7 2B1.1\u2019s table pertaining to theft and fraud corresponding to the value of the funds. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 281.3(a)(2). \u201cFor purposes of this guideline, \u2018value of the funds\u2019 means the amount of the funds <em>involved in the </em>... <em>reporting conduct.\u201d Id. </em>comment. (n.l) (emphasis added). Per the table cross-referenced in \u00a7 2B1.1, if the amount is greater than $100 million, but less than $200 million, 26 offense levels are added. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(N).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Upon careful review of the record and the parties arguments, we affirm Caro\u2019s total sentence in this regard. Insofar as Caro alleged that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable due to the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.3 and the corresponding loss calculation, that guideline explicitly contemplated his offense of conviction, and the District Court calculated the loss according to its plain language.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Substantively, the record reflects that the District Court did not abuse its discretion. Caro\u2019s 216-month sentence was over 6 years shorter than the applicable guideline minimum, and was far less than the potential 130 years he could have received if the District Court chose to run all of the statutory m\u00e1ximums consecutively.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371; 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5324(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">Moreover, the District Court noted the need to impose a sentence of consequence to send a message to the community that white collar crime of the type Caro perpetrated caused real harm by forcing taxpayers to pay more and damaging competition in local markets, and could not be tolerated. (Dkt. 566 pgs. 56-57) <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). To the extent the District Court emphasized these factors, Caro provides no reason why such emphasis represented a clear error in judgment. <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">Furthermore, Caro presented extensive arguments in mitigation and several witnesses, which the district court acknowledged considering. (Dkt. 565, pgs. 68-129; Dkt. 566, pgs. 4-28, 59-60). Its ultimate sentence reflected that the seriousness of the offense and a need to make an impact was tempered in part by Caro\u2019s personal characteristics\u2014namely, his lack of criminal history and respectable work in the community\u2014as well as the unique situation in which two of his employees received three-year sentences after their mistrial and subsequent guilty pleas. (Dkt. 566, pgs. 53-55, 58). Based on these considerations, the District Court exercised a reasoned basis for its decision that a 216-month sentence was sufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Livesay, </em>525 F.3d at 1090; <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191. Accordingly, we hold that Caro\u2019s 216-month total sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">VII. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b901-13\">The convictions of Juan Rene Caro and Maytemar Corporation, d/b/a La Bamba Check Cashing are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b843-8\">. We need not address Count Three as only Chaoui was charged in that count and the jury could not reach a verdict on that count.

However, some of these exhibits like Exhibit 3 contain as many as 200 different CTRs which were bundled into a single exhibit. It appears that while over 600 exhibit numbers were used, many of these contain multiple single page CTRs, like exhibit 12 which contains over 208 different single page CTRs. So for record purposes, what appears to be two exhibits combined they contained in reality in excess of 400 separate transactions which were identified individually by witnesses using a stamped number on each sheet.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b845-7\">.

No source language was identified for this term. However, according to Obispo, \"Miquimbin\u201d was a word in Caro's vocabulary. He explained that \"out in the street, in everyday slang, it means things that come from bad origins or misbegotten things.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b849-9\">. The information consisted of: the tax or employer identification number for the fictitious company; the corporate officer\u2019s driver\u2019s license; the company's articles of incorporation; and its workers\u2019 compensation insurance certificate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b849-13\">.

The District Court explained the government's justification for the use of the conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-37\">[T]he government denies that it knew ahead of time that Mr. Diaz-Yabor had a prior criminal conviction. Instead, the government contends that it thought that the criminal history report it had pulled up on Martin Augusto Diaz, a/k/a Martin Diaz, a/ka [sic] Martin A. Diaz, a/ka [sic] Martin Diaz-Yaber was another person, and the prosecutor was only alerted that this might be the same person as Mr. Diaz-Yabor after he was evasive during questioning of his educational background. Further, the government contends that Mr. Diaz-Yabor\u2019s testimony is essentially irrelevant, that the defense waived any objection to the government\u2019s questioning of Mr. Diaz-Yabor\u2019s background by failing to object at the time, that the government\u2019s questioning of Mr. Diaz-Yabor regarding his criminal history was brief and was limited to addressing his honesty and credibility, and that any harm to the defense through Mr. Diaz-Yabor\u2019s impeachment is minor and can be cured by a limiting instruction by the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-38\">(Dkt. 356, pg. 8).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b870-6\">.

Whereas, the conspiracy instruction that was given to the jury provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-10\">The indictment charges the Defendants with conspiracy to willfully and knowingly committing the following offenses against the United States:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">(a) willfully violating the reporting requirements of Title 31, United States Code, Section 5313(a), and Title 31, Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 103.22 and 103.28, as part of a pattern of any illegal activity involving more than $100,000 in a 12-month period, by filing a report required by Title 31, United States Code, Section 5313(a), specifically, a Currency Transaction Report On Treasury Department, FINCEN Form 104, that contained a material omission and misstatement of fact concerning, among other things, the true identity of the parties involved in the financial transactions and the source of the funds involved, in violation of Title 31, United States Code, Section 5322(b); and</p>\n<p id=\"b894-14\">(b) knowingly and for the purpose of evading the reporting requirements of Title 31, United States Code, Section 5313(a), and regulations prescribed thereunder, causing a domestic financial institution to file a report under Title 31, United States Code, Section 5313(a), and regulations prescribed thereunder, that is, a Currency Transaction Report on Treasury Department, FINCEN Form 104, that contained a material omission and misstatement of fact concerning, among other things, the true identity of the parties involved in the financial transactions and the source of the funds involved, as part of a pattern of illegal activity involving more than $100,000 in a 12 month period, in violation of Title 31, United States Code, Sections 5324(a)(2) and (d)(2), and Title 31, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 103.22 and 103.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-15\">Good faith is a complete defense to the charges in the indictment since good faith on the part of the Defendant is inconsistent with the intent required to prove the Defendants willfully and knowingly conspired to commit the above offenses. The burden of proof is not on the Defendant to prove good faith, of course, since the Defendant has no burden to prove anything. The Government must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant acted with specific intent charged in Count I of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-16\">One who expresses an honestly held opinion, or an honestly formed belief, that currency transaction reports they filed or caused to be filed did not contain a material omission or misstatement of fact concerning, among other things, the true identity of the parties involved in the financial transactions, the source of the funds involved or the location of the transaction, is not chargeable with under Count I even though the opinion is erroneous or the belief is mistaken; and, similarly, evidence which establishes only that a person made a mistake in judgment, or was careless, does not establish that a Defendant knowingly or willfully made material false or material omissions or misstatements of fact on currency transaction reports for the purpose of evading the transaction reporting requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>(Dkt. 337, pgs. 8-9).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b895-8\">.

Caro's requested instruction provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-13\">The law provides that a prosecutor has broad discretion in deciding what, if any, charge to bring or not to bring, against any individual that commits an offense against the United States. The law further provides that a prosecutor has the sole discretion to request reduction of a cooperating witness\u2019s potential or existing sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-18\">(Dkt. 327, pg. 6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"54\">\n<p id=\"b896-19\">. The District Court gave the following instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-20\">Now, in saying that you must consider all of the evidence, I do not mean that you must accept all of the evidence as true or accurate. You should decide whether you believe what each witness had to say, and how important that testimony was. In making that decision you may believe or disbelieve any witness, in whole or in part. Also, the number of witnesses testifying concerning any particular dispute is not controlling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-21\">In deciding whether you believe or do not believe any witness I suggest that you ask yourself a few questions: Did the witness impress you as one who was telling the truth? Did the witness have any particular reason not to tell the truth? Did the witness have a personal interest in the outcome of the case? Did the witness seem to have a good memory? Did the witness have the opportunity and ability to observe accurately the things he or she testified about? Did the witness appear to understand the questions clearly and answer them directly? Did the witness\u2019s testimony differ from other testimony or other evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>You should also ask yourself whether there was evidence tending to prove that a witness testified falsely concerning some important fact; or, whether there was evidence that at some other time a witness said or did something, or failed to say or do something, which was different from the testimony the witness gave before you during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">The fact that a witness has been convicted of a felony offense, or a crime involving dishonesty or false statement, is another factor you may consider in deciding whether you believe that witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">You should keep in mind, of course, that a simple mistake by a witness does not necessarily mean that the witness was not telling the truth as he or she remembers it, because people naturally tend to forget some things or remember other things inaccurately. So, if a witness has made a misstatement, you need to consider whether it was simply an innocent lapse of memory or an intentional falsehood; and the significance of that may depend on whether it has to do with an important fact or with only an unimportant detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-15\">The testimony of some witnesses must be considered with more caution than the testimony of other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-16\">For example, a paid informer, or a witness who has been promised that he or she will not be charged or prosecuted, or a witness who hopes to gain more favorable treatment in his or her own case, may have a reason to make a false statement because the witness wants to strike a good bargain with the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-17\">So, while a witness of that kind may be entirely truthful when testifying, you should consider that testimony with more caution than the testimony of other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-18\">(Dkt. 397, pgs. 5-7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"55\">\n<p id=\"b898-9\">.
