The terms of the plan, as explained by the district court, support the plan administrator\u2019s decision. That decision is the legally correct interpretation of the plan. It certainly provides that the surviving spouse of Leonard Kidder is entitled to the benefits, because there was no waiver as required before the children could be entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-24\">Cajun Industries, LLC has filed this interpleader suit, deposited the funds into the registry of the court, and has been properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-25\">That being the only issue before this court, the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
