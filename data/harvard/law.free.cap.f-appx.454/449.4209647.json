On the day his case was set for trial, Defendant-Appellant Sam Brooks (\u201cBrooks\u201d) requested new counsel. The trial court denied his request. Having unsuccessfully sought relief in state court, Brooks now asks this Court for a writ of habeas corpus. Brooks argues that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by failing to conduct a proper inquiry into whether there was good cause for a substitution of counsel. For the reasons discussed below, we deny his request for habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Brooks was charged with assault with intent to murder, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, felon in possession of a firearm, and other related charges. On September 7, 2004, the day his case was set for trial, Brooks was offered a plea deal. Prior to rejecting or accepting the offer, Brooks requested that the court appoint new counsel. The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">Court: Anything else that you want to talk to me about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-10\">Brooks: Yes. Is it possible that I could get another lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-11\">Court: For what reason?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-12\">Brooks: Because I feel that she\u2019s not representing me right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-13\">Court: Well, I don\u2019t\u2014is that because you\u2019re not getting the offer that you want?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-14\">Brooks: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-15\">Court: Well, Mr.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-16\">Brooks: There are some things that I requested and I haven\u2019t received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-17\">Defense Counsel: Let\u2019s hear what he requested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-18\">Brooks: Oh, my papers that she received, she gave me yesterday. And plus, out of the times I\u2019ve been due in court, I\u2019ve only seen her four times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-19\">Defense Counsel: Judge, I\u2019ve been to see Mr. Brooks. I have a receipt for\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-21\">Brooks: Twice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-22\">Defense Counsel:\u2014back on June 21st, where I gave him the discovery. And I provided him with additional discovery\u2014just so the record is clear\u2014additional discovery. And you know, I\u2019m fully prepared to try this case. I\u2019ve read the transcript, I\u2019ve been in touch with Mr. Jansen and talked to him about the case, and he gave me Investigative Subpoenas and things like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-23\">Although I may not have been sitting in front of Mr. Brooks when those things occurred, I\u2019ve been working on his case, and I\u2019m aware that he might not like my assessment of the evidence, but he should know that any other lawyer is going to make the same assessment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-24\">Court: All right. I would deny your motion to recuse [defense counsel]. I think that\u2014know that if [defense counsel] was not prepared or she felt that there was some kind of issue, she would bring it up to me, because she\u2019s not going to try a case that\u2019s this serious\u2014believe it or not, she cares about you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-25\">She cares about every client she has; I know [her], that\u2019s how she feels. This is very important to her, I guarantee you, she\u2019s prepared.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Brooks rejected the plea offer, waived a jury trial and proceeded with a bench trial. The court found Brooks guilty of assault with intent to murder, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, and felon in possession of a firearm, and imposed a sentence which Brooks does not challenge. Rather, Brooks filed an appeal in state court claiming that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel by not conducting an adequate \u201cgood cause\u201d inquiry following his request for new counsel. The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction and sentence in an unpublished order on December 13, 2005. The Michigan Supreme Court denied Brooks leave to appeal on April 28, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">On September 22, 2006, Brooks filed a habeas petition in federal district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court denied the petition and granted a certificate of appealability on the Sixth Amendment issue now before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) provides federal court remedies for persons held in state custody in violation of the Constitution or federal laws. If a claim was adjudicated on the merits in state court, AED-PA provides that a writ of habeas corpus may only issue if the adjudication resulted in a decision that was either: (1) \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d or (2) \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1)\u2014(2). Brooks does not argue that the trial court\u2019s actions were based on an unreasonable determination of the facts, and we therefore need not address that prong of AEDPA. A state court decision is contrary to clearly established law if the state court \u201carrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme Court] on a question of law,\u201d or arrives at a result opposite to the Supreme Court on materially indistinguishable facts. <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 405, 120 S.Ct. 1495,146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">Brooks claims that the state court violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel when it denied his request for new counsel without a sufficient inquiry into good cause, and that, as a result, he is entitled to habeas relief. We disagree. Supreme Court precedent does not afford Brooks the absolute right to have the counsel of his choosing, and, as explained below, the Sixth Circuit precedent that lends his claim support does not resolve this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">The Sixth Amendment guarantees that \u201cin all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the assistance of Counsel for his defense.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. VI. In <em>Powell v. Alabama, </em>the Supreme Court recognized that \u201ca defendant should be afforded a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice.\u201d 287 U.S. 45, 53, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158 (1932). The Sixth Amendment also guarantees \u201ca defendant the right to be represented by an otherwise qualified attorney whom that defendant can afford to hire, or who is willing to represent the defendant even though he is without funds.\u201d <em>Caplin &amp; Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, </em>491 U.S. 617, 624-625, 109 S.Ct. 2646, 105 L.Ed.2d 528 (1989). However, \u201cthe right to choose one\u2019s own counsel is circumscribed in several important respects.\u201d <em>Wheat v. United States, </em>486 U.S. 153, 159, 108 S.Ct. 1692, 100 L.Ed.2d 140 (1988). The Supreme Court has held that \u201cwhile the right to select and be represented by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>one\u2019s preferred attorney is comprehended by the Sixth Amendment, the essential aim of the Amendment is to guarantee an effective advocate for each criminal defendant rather than to ensure that a defendant will inexorably be represented by the lawyer whom he prefers.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">In order for Brooks to prevail, he must demonstrate that the state court decision was contrary to clearly established law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). For the purposes of AEDPA, however, the clearly established law does not indicate that the trial court had a duty to conduct a good cause inquiry before determining whether to grant or deny Brooks\u2019s request for new counsel. Indeed, the Supreme Court has held that the Sixth Amendment \u201cguarantees defendants in criminal cases the right to adequate representation, but those who do not have the means to hire their own lawyers have no cognizable complaint so long as they are adequately represented by attorneys appointed by the courts.\u201d <em>Caplin &amp; Drysdale, </em>491 U.S. at 624, 109 S.Ct. 2646. Brooks, therefore, had a right to be represented by the counsel of his choice only if he could afford to hire that counsel, or if that counsel was willing to represent him regardless of his inability to pay. Here, Brooks made no mention of having retained or planning to retain counsel on his own. Instead, he requested that his court appointed lawyer be replaced. Given these facts, the new counsel Brooks sought would have been, in all likelihood, court appointed. To the extent that Brooks would invoke <em>Caplin </em>because his representation was inadequate, we are unpersuaded. Nothing before us suggests that Brooks\u2019s counsel did not represent him \u201cadequately.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Brooks sought a new attorney because he did not receive discovery materials in a manner he found timely and because his attorney did not meet with him as often as he would have liked. These allegations do not implicate the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction that those with no means to hire counsel do, indeed, have just cause for constitutional complaint if their representation is subpar and they suffer prejudice as a result. <em>See Evitts v. Lucey, </em>469 U.S. 387, 395-96, 105 S.Ct. 830, 83 L.Ed.2d 821 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Brooks directs us to <em>Benitez v. United States, </em>in which we stated that once a defendant wishing to substitute counsel brings \u201cany serious dissatisfaction ... to the attention of the district court,\u201d the court \u201cis obligated to inquire into the defendant\u2019s complaint and determine whether there is good cause for the substitution.\u201d 521 F.3d 625, 632 (6th Cir.2008) (internal quotations and citations omitted). True though this may be, and regardless whether the district court\u2019s inquiry was sufficient under <em>Benitez, </em>we are not permitted to base our decision on that case. Rather, as we have explained, Brooks\u2019s habeas petition rises or falls on the existence of clearly established law as determined by the Supreme Court. Because Brooks offers no such law supporting his claim, and we are unaware of any such law, he has not shown that he is entitled to relief under AEDPA. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we .AFFIRM the denial of Brooks\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
