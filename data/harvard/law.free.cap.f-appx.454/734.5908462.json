After review, we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-18\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b757-19\">In 2002, Rodriguez-Lopez was listed as a derivative beneficiary on his father\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). After a hearing, an Immigration Judge denied all requested relief. The BIA affirmed. In 2006, this Court denied the subsequent petition for review. <em>See Rodriguez Posada v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>179 Fed.Appx. 612 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-20\">In late 2009, Rodriguez-Lopez filed a series of three motions to reopen his removal proceedings, arguing that: (1) due to changed country conditions, he feared future persecution in Colombia; and (2) his father\u2019s counsel had provided ineffective assistance because the counsel did not file a separate asylum application for Rodriguez-Lopez based on his fear of future persecution. Rodriguez-Lopez contended that he feared forced conscription by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Colombian Army or being kidnapped for ransom by guerilla groups who target those returning from the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">In August 2010, the BIA denied all three motions to reopen because, among other things, the motions to reopen did not demonstrate prima facie eligibility for relief. Specifically, the BIA concluded that the motions to reopen did not link either feared harm to a protected ground. Because Rodriguez-Lopez was not prima facie eligible for relief, he did not show he was prejudiced by his father\u2019s counsel\u2019s representation. Rodriguez-Lopez did not petition for review of these rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Instead, Rodriguez-Lopez filed a motion to reconsider in September 2010. Rodriguez-Lopez\u2019s motion argued that, because military service in the Colombian Army is compulsory, Rodriguez-Lopez feared he would be either: (1) imprisoned and tortured as a military deserter; or (2) required to serve and would be targeted by guerilla groups, who think soldiers have taken the government\u2019s side politically. The BIA denied Rodriguez-Lopez\u2019s motion to reconsider on March 22, 2011. Rodriguez-Lopez then filed this petition for review of only the March 22, 2011 denial of his motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">\u201cA motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(6)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C). A motion to reconsider that merely restates arguments that the BIA previously rejected provides no reason for the BIA to change its prior decision. <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cTherefore, merely reiterating arguments previously presented to the BIA does not constitute \u2018specifying ... errors of fact or law1 as required for a successful motion to reconsider.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1)) (alteration in original). Moreover, \u201c[a] motion to reconsider based on a legal argument that could have been raised earlier in the proceedings will be denied.\u201d <em>In re O-S-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 56, 58 (BIA2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Rodriguez-Lopez\u2019s motion to x*econsider. With respect to Rodriguez-Lopez\u2019s persecution claims, Rodriguez-Lopez\u2019s motion to reconsider did not point to any errors in the BIA\u2019s earlier rulings. Rather, the motion to reconsider reasserted Rodxiguez-Lopez\u2019s fear of being forced to serve in the Colombian Army or being kidnapped or harmed by guerilla groups. Rodriguez-Lopez\u2019s motion to reconsider argued that the evidence he submitted with his earlier motions to reopen was sufficient to show changed country conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-12\">We do note, however, that Rodriguez-Lopez\u2019s motion to reconsider, for the first time, alleged two new grounds for his fear of persecution: that he would be required to serve in the Colombian Army and targeted by guerrilla groups or, if he did not serve, he would be imprisoned and tortured by the government as a military deserter. Although Rodriguez-Lopez has not alleged any past persecution, his new arguments seek to tie Rodriguez-Lopez\u2019s fear of future persecution to either imputed political opinion or membership in a particular social group. One px\u2019oblem for Rodriguez-Lopez is that he did not make these nexus arguments in his three mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>tions to reopen. Because, as to his persecution claims, Rodriguez-Lopez\u2019s motion to reconsider reiterated old arguments or raised new ones he could have made earlier in proceedings, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion to reconsider.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The BIA also did not abuse its discretion in denying Rodriguez-Lopez\u2019s motion to reconsider with respect to his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Rodriguez-Lopez\u2019s argument that the BIA applied the wrong standard of review in denying his motions to reopen lacks merit. The BIA properly assessed whether any alleged error by Rodriguez-Lopez\u2019s former counsel was prejudicial and whether Rodriguez-Lopez had shown prima facie eligibility for asylum. <em>See Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that an alien must show prejudice when he advances an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and that \u201c[pjrejudice exists when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney\u2019s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different\u201d); <em>Li v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 1371, 1374-75 (11th Cir.2007) (stating that the BIA may deny a motion to reopen for, <em>inter alia, </em>failure to establish prima facie eligibility for asylum). If, as the BIA concluded, Rodriguez-Lopez\u2019s three motions to reopen did not demonstrate prima facie eligibility for asylum, then he could not demonstrate prejudice from his prior counsel\u2019s failure to interview him or advise him to file his own asylum application apart from his father.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">Finally, to the extent Rodriguez-Lopez\u2019s petition for review challenges any decision other than the BIA\u2019s March 22, 2011 denial of his motion to reconsider, we dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A motion to reconsider does not toll the time for filing a petition for review of the underlying order. <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1543-44, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 242(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (requiring petition for review to be filed within thirty days of final order of removal). And, a petition for review of a motion to reconsider does not permit review of other orders that were not timely included in the petition. <em>Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 405-06, 115 S.Ct. at 1549; Fed. R.App. P. 15(a)(2)(C). Thus, we lack jurisdiction to review Rodriguez-Lopez\u2019s arguments regarding the January 6, 2004 denial of his father\u2019s asylum application, the original May 13, 2005 removal order and the August 31, 2010 denial of Rodriguez-Lopez\u2019s three motions to reopen. Insofar as Rodriguez-Lopez challenges these rulings, we dismiss his petition for review for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-8\">. \"We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Calle v.
