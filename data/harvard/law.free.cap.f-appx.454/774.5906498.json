In its brief,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Crowther challenges four of the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u2019s\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> findings of fact: (1) that Foreman Herrera had actual knowledge of Melendez\u2019s and Valencia\u2019s failure to use fall protection, in violation of \u00a7 1926.501(b)(11); (2) that Crowther\u2019s supervisors had constructive knowledge of the violations; (3) that Crowther\u2019s training and enforcement program was insufficient; and (4) that Crowther\u2019s insufficient enforcement of its Tie-Off Rule evidenced its knowledge of Melendez\u2019s Valencia\u2019s violation. We reject Crowther\u2019s challenges to these findings on the ground that they are supported by substantial record evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-14\">In addition to these challenges, Crowther argues that the ALJ erred in imputing Herrera\u2019s knowledge of the \u00a7 1926.501.(b)(ll) violations to Crowther. The ALJ erred, according to Crowther, because \u201cHerrera, who held the title of foreman, was not on the roof at the time that [Melendez and Valencia] were observed by OSHA to be violating fall protection rules and so he had no knowledge of the violation which could be attributed to Crowther.\u201d We find no error. Among other things, Herrera was responsible for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>directing the work of the line workers, including ensuring that the workers complied with the company\u2019s Tie-Off Rule. Crowther also argues that the ALJ erred in rejecting its affirmative unpreventable employee misconduct defense. Again, we find no error. To establish its defense, Crowther had to prove that it had (1) established work rules designed to prevent the violations; (2) adequately communicated those rules to its employees; (3) taken steps to discover violations; and (4) where it had discovered violations, had effectively enforced the rules. As the Commission properly conceded, Crowther carried its burden with respect to the first two elements of the defense. The record, however, fully supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Crowther failed to prove the third and fourth elements. As for the third element, Crowther\u2019s own records indicated hundreds of OSHA violations over the preceding five years and 100 violations in the first eight months of 2010, fifty five of which related to fall protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">We find no merit in any of Crowther\u2019s challenges, and inasmuch as substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision, the decision is</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-9\">. We state the substance of the issues Crowther's brief lays out. Four question the sufficiency of the evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact; two raise legal errors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b797-15\">. The Commission elected not to review the ALJ\u2019s decision. The ALJ's decision therefore became the Commission\u2019s final order for review. The ultimate question we must decide is whether the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
