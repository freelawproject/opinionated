Cromwell faced charges on account of robberies on May 9, June 13, July 22, and August 6. Morsley was involved only in the May 9 robbery. Cromwell and Morsley were convicted following a jury trial and sentenced to 1272 and 396 months\u2019 imprisonment, respectively. In these consolidated appeals, Cromwell asserts the district court erred in failing to require the presence of a particular law enforcement witness at the suppression hearing. Morsley argues that the district court erred in denying his Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 and 33 motions. Both Cromwell and Morsley challenge the reasonableness of their sentences. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Cromwell argues that the district court\u2019s refusal to require the presence of Special Agent Vorndran at the suppression hearing deprived him of his constitutional right to confront the witness. A district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Basham, </em>561 F.3d 302, 325 (4th Cir.2009). \u201cDecisions as to the admission or exclusion of evidence are within the province of the district court, and any error in such decisions is subject to review under the harmless error test.\u201d <em>United States v. Pendergraph, </em>388 F.3d 109, 112 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Cromwell\u2019s argument is without merit. To the extent he claims a violation of the Confrontation Clause, his claim must fail because \u201cthe confrontation right pertains only to adverse witnesses offering testimony at trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Soriano-Jarquin, </em>492 F.3d 495, 504 (4th Cir.2007). Here, the Government neither called Vorndran as a witness nor introduced any statements by him. Additionally, Cromwell cannot show his right to compulsory process was violated because \u201cthe Sixth Amendment does not by its terms grant to a criminal defendant the right to secure the attendance and testimony of any and all witnesses: it guarantees him \u2018compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal, </em>458 U.S. 858, 867, 102 S.Ct. 3440, 73 L.Ed.2d 1193 (1982) (quoting U.S. Const. amend. VI). Cromwell offered the district court no reason to believe that Vorndran had information material to his defense, instead merely speculating that Vorndran\u2019s testimony would be inconsistent with that of a witness who did testify. <em>See United States v. Rivera, </em>412 F.3d 562, 570 (4th Cir.2005) (rejecting claim that compulsory process rights were violated where defendant provided no reason to believe absent witnesses had information material to his defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">Morsley challenges the sufficiency of the evidence against him. He contends that his conviction is based on the uncorroborated and contradictory testimony of two unreliable witnesses. Morsley alleges several inconsistencies in the testimony between the two witnesses. He argues the district court erred in denying his motions for acquittal and for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a Rule 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal de novo and the denial of a Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>451 F.3d 209, 216 (4th Cir.2006). A defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence faces a heavy burden. <em>United States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir.1997). The verdict of a jury must be sustained \u201cif, viewing the evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>the light most favorable to the prosecution, the verdict is supported by \u2018substantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith, </em>451 F.3d at 216 (citations omitted). Substantial evidence is \u201cevidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he jury, not the reviewing court, weighs the credibility of the evidence and resolves any conflicts in the evidence presented.\u201d <em>Beidler, </em>110 F.3d at 1067 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cReversal for insufficient evidence is reserved for the rare case where the prosecution\u2019s failure is clear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Here, the jury\u2019s verdict was supported by substantial evidence. Despite some inconsistencies, the witnesses\u2019 testimony was largely in agreement. Each witness testified that Morsley participated in the robbery and was armed with a shotgun. Video surveillance images were consistent with the witnesses\u2019 accounts. The questions of credibility Morsley raises were resolved by the jury. <em>See id. </em>Because Morsley\u2019s motion for a new trial was similarly based on the sufficiency of the evidence, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. <em>See Smith, </em>451 F.3d at 216-17 (\u201cUnder the applicable legal principles, a trial court should exercise its discretion to award a new trial sparingly, and a jury verdict is not to be overturned except in the rare circumstance when the evidence weighs heavily against it.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Turning to the sentences imposed by the district court, we review those sentences for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Diosdado-Star, </em>630 F.3d 359, 363 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2946, 180 L.Ed.2d 236 (2011). Our review requires consideration of both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of a sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">In determining procedural reasonableness, we consider whether the district court properly calculated the defendant\u2019s advisory Guidelines range, considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors, analyzed any arguments presented by the parties, and sufficiently explained the selected sentence. <em>Id. </em>Once we determine that there was no procedural error, we next assess the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. Our inquiry requires us to review \u201cwhether the District Judge abused his discretion in determining that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors supported [the sentence] and justified a substantial deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56,128 S.Ct. 586. The court must take \u201c \u2018into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Morace, </em>594 F.3d 340, 346 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 307, 178 L.Ed.2d 199 (2010). We afford within-Guidelines sentences a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Mendoza-Mendoza, </em>597 F.3d 212, 216-17 (4th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">Cromwell contends that the district court did not give adequate consideration to the sentencing factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553. We disagree. The district court considered Cromwell\u2019s criminal history, Cromwell\u2019s role in the robberies, and the need to impose a sentence sufficient but no greater than necessary to meet the goals of \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The district court recognized that, given Cromwell\u2019s age, his sentence would effectively be life imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>ment. Nevertheless, the district court stated that the sentence was necessary to deter and rehabilitate Cromwell and to protect the public. The district court was not required to \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection,\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006), and we conclude that the district court adequately explained its basis for the sentence imposed. We thus find no procedural error in the imposition of Cromwell\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Nor is Cromwell\u2019s sentence substantively infirm. Cromwell asserts that \u201cin light of his age, health, family ties and lack of injury to any victim in this case, the district court should have imposed a sentence which is reasonable, necessarily far lower than Appellant received.\u201d We conclude, however, that Cromwell has failed to overcome the presumption of reasonableness this court affords to within-Guidelines sentences. Cromwell\u2019s lengthy sentence was a result of his repeated decision to commit armed robberies and Congress\u2019s decision that an offender who carries a firearm during a crime of violence is subject to mandatory consecutive terms of imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Morsley argues that the district court did not give adequate consideration to the \u00a7 3553 sentencing factors. He notes that he took part only in the May 9 robbery, that no one was injured in that robbery, and that he neither used nor brandished a weapon. He states that he is fifty-two years old and his 396-month sentence is the equivalent of a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Here, the district court considered the nature and circumstances of the offense, Morsley\u2019s criminal history, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. The court stated that Morsley was \u201cnot as culpable\u201d as Cromwell and recognized that, given Morsley\u2019s age, a sentence at the bottom of the Guidelines range could amount to a life sentence. The district court nevertheless concluded that \u201cthe Guidelines are not far off in this case,\u201d and imposed a sentence of 396 months\u2019 imprisonment, within Morsley\u2019s 360 months to life Guidelines range. The court stated the sentence was necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing and to protect the public. We conclude that the district court adequately discharged its responsibility to explain the sentence imposed with sufficient detail to allow meaningful appellate review. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 359, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Morsley\u2019s sentence is also substantively reasonable, as the district court imposed a within-Guidelines sentence based on a careful consideration of the sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Morsley and Cromwell\u2019s convictions and sentences. We deny Cromwell\u2019s motion for leave to file a pro se supplemental brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
