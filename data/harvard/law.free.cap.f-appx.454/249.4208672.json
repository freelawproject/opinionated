In addition, he was convicted of conspiring to contribute funds to the Taliban. On appeal, Mirza raises numerous arguments challenging his convictions. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">Mirza, a citizen of Pakistan, arrived in the United States on August 24, 2001 on a student visa. After arriving, he enrolled at Houston Community College. Later that year, Mirza met James Coates and Kobie Williams at a meeting of a local Muslim group.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">In 2004, Coates was interviewed by Customs and Border Control officials after he and Williams were stopped at Big Ben National Park in an automobile containing weapons. After receiving a phone call from these officials, the FBI proceeded to interview Coates. Based on this interview, the FBI opened an investigation targeting Mirza and Williams. This investigation was assigned to John McKinley. According to McKinley, the goal of this investigation was to \u201cdetermine Mr. Mirza\u2019s and Mr. Williams\u2019 intent based on the information [the FBI] received and then try to substantiate those allegations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-18\">In September 2005, Coates introduced an undercover agent named Malik Mohammad to Mirza. Mohammad then became part of a \u201cjamaat,\u201d or group, that included Mirza, Williams, and Coates. Mohammad\u2019s role within the group was to teach \u201chand-to-hand tactics.\u201d According to Mohammad, the intent of the group was to \u201cgo through Pakistan to eventually get into Afghanistan and/or Iraq.\u201d At trial, Mohammad also testified that the group was \u201ctrying to go and hook up with, essentially, anybody fighting against the Americans, but that entailed the Mujahadeen, the Taliban, al-Qaeda.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-19\">In preparation for its intended trip overseas, the group trained at a \u201ccamp\u201d in Willis, Texas. On September 16, 2005, Mohammad participated in his first training camp with the group. During these camps, the group would shoot weapons and engage in military-type tactical training. Photographs presented at trial showed Mirza shooting targets shaped as human silhouettes. Mohammad testified that he also participated in two other training camps with the group. Along with these training camps, the group also went to a shooting range on two occasions. At trial, Mohammad stated that \u201call these things [the group was] doing [was] for the purpose of the jamaat as a group, and it was for the end goal of us being able to go over to the Middle East and fight against the American Coalition.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-20\">In addition to training, the group also discussed getting money \u201cto the people fighting.\u201d According to Mohammad, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>group was trying to get money to Afghanistan and, specifically, to the Mujahadeen groups and the Taliban. Because of the difficulties in getting money to the fighters in Afghanistan, the group discussed an alternative route, which consisted of sending the money to the fighters\u2019 families in Pakistan. The group also discussed tunneling the money to the \u201cpeople on the battlefields\u201d through a doctor working at a hospital in the region. Mohammad testified at trial that the group\u2019s goal was \u201cto support the people fighting against the American forces the best we could\u2014whatever path that took.\u201d To achieve the group\u2019s objective, Mirza took money from Coates and Williams and gave it to another individual with the intent that the money go to support the families of the Taliban or Mujahadeen fighters in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">After Williams informed Mirza that the FBI was interested in talking to him, Mirza met with FBI agents on November 8, 2006. According to McKinley, who was one of the agents at the meeting, Mirza told them about the training camps and what the group did during these camps. McKinley also testified that Mirza told him that the group\u2019s plan was \u201cto travel to Afghanistan, figure out which side was right and then join that side and assist them militarily.\u201d During this meeting, Mirza also indicated that it was his intent to send money to the families of the fighters. Notably, when asked whether he was employed, Mirza stated that he was working. Later this same day, Mirza met up with McKinley and another FBI agent to turn over a shotgun he possessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Based on information she received from the FBI indicating that Mirza was working, Jessica Gilbeau, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, visited Mirza at a Houston business on November 22, 2006. At trial, Gilbeau testified that Mirza admitted to being employed and earning $870 monthly consolidating data for oil companies. In addition, during this interview Mirza stated that he had been working for a year and a half. Because he was employed without permission from the Department of Homeland Security, Gilbeau testified that Mirza had violated the terms of his student visa. According to Gilbeau, this violation established that Mirza was unlawfully present in the United States since May 2005. Six days later, Mirza was taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">On August 19, 2009, the government filed a superseding nine count indictment against Mirza. The indictment charged Mirza with the following: (1) conspiring to unlawfully possess one thousand rounds of ammunition and five firearms while he was unlawfully present in the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371 and 922(g)(5)(A) (Count 1); conspiring to contribute funds to the Taliban, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 and 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1705 (Count 2); possessing firearms while he was unlawfully present in the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(5)(A) (Counts 3, 5-9); and possessing ammunition while he was unlawfully present in the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(5)(A) (Count 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">Mirza\u2019s four-day trial began on May 24, 2010.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the beginning of the second day of trial, Mirza, during the government\u2019s ease-in-chief, moved under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 to dismiss Count 2. According to Mirza, the testimony presented on the first day of trial failed to establish that he intended to support the Taliban. On the third day of trial, Mirza <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>moved for a judgment of acquittal on all counts in the indictment after the government rested. The district court denied both motions. On May 27, 2010, the jury eonvicted\u2019Mirza on all counts. The district court subsequently sentenced Mirza to 180 months imprisonment and three years supervised release. Mirza filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Mirza presents numerous arguments attacking his convictions. After addressing his challenges to his Count 2 conviction, we will proceed to consider Mirza\u2019s arguments with respect to his weapons and ammunition convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Mirza contends that there are three grounds for reversing his Count 2 conviction. We consider each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">He begins his attack on this conviction by challenging the sufficiency of the evidence. \u201cA challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence that is procedurally preserved, as this challenge was, is reviewed <em>de </em>novo.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>United States v. McElwee, </em>646 F.3d 328, 340 (5th Cir.2011) (citation omitted). Under this standard of review, we must \u201cdetermine whether ... a rational jury could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. We are concerned only with whether the jury made a rational decision, not with whether its verdict was correct on the issue of guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>United States v. Alarcon, </em>261 F.3d 416, 421 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In making this determination, we review the evidence, both direct and circumstantial, in the light most favorable to the government with all reasonable inferences and credibility choices made in support of a conviction. <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>559 F.3d 348, 353 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Miller, </em>146 F.3d 274, 280 (5th Cir.1998). If the evidence would permit a rational fact finder to find every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, we must affirm. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (\u201cIEEPA\u201d), which was enacted in 1977 and is codified at 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701 <em>et seq., </em>gives the President certain powers to \u201cdeal with any unusual and extraordinary threat ... to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States\u201d that \u201chas its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States[.]\u201d 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701(a). If the President declares a national emergency with respect to such a threat, he. may \u201cunder such regulations as he may prescribe, by means of instructions, licenses, or otherwise,\u201d regulate certain types of economic activity. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1702(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-14\">In the wake of the September 11 attacks, President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13,224, which blocked the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>property of certain groups and individuals. <em>See </em>Exec. Order. No. 13,224, 66 Fed.Reg. 49079 (Sept. 23, 2001). This Executive Order also provided the following: \u201cany transaction or dealing ... in property or interests in property blocked pursuant to this order is prohibited, including but not limited to the making or receiving of any contribution of funds, goods, or services to or for the benefit of those persons listed in the Annex to this order or determined to be subject to this order[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although not originally listed, the Taliban was added to the Annex on July 2, 2002. <em>See </em>Exec. Order. No. 13,268, 67 Fed.Reg. 44751 (July 2, 2002). Pursuant to 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1705(a), it is unlawful for a person to conspire to violate any order issued under the IEEPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">In Count 2 of the indictment, the government alleged that Mirza conspired \u201calong with others known and unknown to the Grand Jury\u201d to \u201cwillfully and unlawfully make a contribution of funds ... to and for the benefit of the Taliban.\u201d Mirza challenges his Count 2 conviction on the grounds that there was \u201cno evidence whatsoever that [Mirza] aided [the] Taliban.\u201d We are unpersuaded by his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">As a threshold matter, we note that contrary to what Mirza suggests, he was not charged with aiding the Taliban. Rather, the indictment charged him with conspiring to contribute funds to benefit the Taliban. Once his charge is properly characterized, it is clear that the evidence presented at trial was enough for a rational jury to have found Mirza guilty of conspiring to contribute funds to benefit the Taliban.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">It is well-established that \u201c[c]onspiracy is characterized by an agreement between two or more people for the purposes of promoting or committing a crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Mendez-Casarez, </em>624 F.3d 233, 240 (5th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cConspiracy is an inchoate offense, the essence of which is an agreement to commit an unlawful act.\u201d <em>Iannelli v. United States, </em>420 U.S. 770, 777, 95 S.Ct. 1284, 43 L.Ed.2d 616 (1975). The agreement necessary to convict a defendant of conspiracy \u201cneed not be shown to have been explicit. It can instead be inferred from the facts and circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 777 n. 10, 95 S.Ct. 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">To be clear, Mirza could not have entered into a conspiratorial agreement to contribute funds to benefit the Taliban with either Mohammad or Coates. <em>See Sears v. United States, </em>343 F.2d 139, 142 (5th Cir.1965) (holding that there \u201ccan be no indictable conspiracy with a government informer who secretly intends to frustrate the conspiracy\u201d); <em>United States v. Corson, </em>579 F.3d 804 (7th Cir.2009) (\u201cA defendant is not liable for conspiring solely with an undercover agent or a government informant.\u201d). Rather, based on the evidence presented at trial and the reasonable inferences that can be drawn from that evidence, a rational jury could have found that Mirza entered into such an agreement with either Williams or the individual Mirza used to get money to the families of the Taliban or Mujahadeen fighters in Afghanistan. For example, the inferences that can be drawn from McKinley\u2019s testimony, combined with audio tapes presented at trial and the accompanying testimony from Mohammad, provided a rational jury with a sufficient evidentiary basis to conclude that Mirza had an agreement with Ayub Adat, the individual who received $1,000 from Mirza to send overseas to the families of the fighters. Given this conclusion, we determine that there was sufficient evidence to support Mirza\u2019s IEEPA conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">Next, Mirza contends that his Count 2 conviction is invalid because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>statute upon which it was predicated is unconstitutional. Specifically, he argues that the IEEPA is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to the President. \u201cA constitutional challenge to a federal statute is a question of law that this court reviews <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Palazzo, </em>558 F.3d 400, 403-04 (5th Cir.2009) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The Constitution provides that \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States.\u201d U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 1. \u201cFrom this language the Supreme Court has derived the nondelegation doctrine: that Congress may not constitutionally delegate its legislative power to another branch of Government.\u201d <em>Touby v. United States, </em>500 U.S. 160, 165, 111 S.Ct. 1752, 114 L.Ed.2d 219 (1991). \u201cThe nondelegation doctrine is rooted in the principle of separation of powers that underlies our tripartite system of Government.\u201d <em>Mistretta v. United States, </em>488 U.S. 361, 371, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The Supreme Court has \u201clong recognized that the nondelegation doctrine does not prevent Congress from seeking assistance, within proper limits, from its coordinate Branches.\u201d <em>Touby, </em>500 U.S. at 165, 111 S.Ct. 1752 (citation omitted). \u201cThus, Congress does not violate the Constitution merely because it legislates in broad terms, leaving a certain degree of discretion to executive or judicial actors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cSo long as Congress \u2018lay[s] down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [act] is directed to conform, such legislative action is not a forbidden delegation of legislative power.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>J. W. Hampton, Jr., &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>276 U.S. 394, 409, 48 S.Ct. 348, 72 L.Ed. 624 (1928)).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">In applying this \u201cintelligible principle\u201d test to congressional delegations, the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisprudence has been \u201cdriven by a practical understanding that in our increasingly complex society, replete with ever changing and more technical problems, Congress simply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general directives.\u201d <em>Mistretta, </em>488 U.S. at 372, 109 S.Ct. 647 (citations omitted). \u201cThe Constitution has never been regarded as denying to the Congress the necessary resources of flexibility and practicality, which will enable it to perform its function.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Accordingly, the Supreme Court \u201chas deemed it \u2018constitutionally sufficient if Congress clearly delineates the general policy, the public agency which is to apply it, and the boundaries of this delegated authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372-73 (quoting <em>Am. Power &amp; Light Co. v. SEC, </em>329 U.S. 90, 105, 67 S.Ct. 133, 91 L.Ed. 103 (1946)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">Three circuits have rejected nondelegation challenges to the IEEPA\u2019s delegation of authority to the Executive branch to criminalize certain conduct. <em>See United States v. Amirnazmi, </em>645 F.3d 564, 575-77 (3d Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Dhafir, </em>461 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>F.3d 211, 215-17 (2d Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Arch Trading Co., </em>987 F.2d 1087, 1092-94 (4th Cir.1993). Because the IEE-PA sets forth an \u201cintelligible principle\u201d along with several other limitations on the President\u2019s exercise of power, we follow suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">After considering the Supreme Court\u2019s nondelegation jurisprudence, we conclude that the IEEPA contains an \u201cintelligible principle\u201d that constrains the exercise of power delegated to the Executive branch. The statutory language stating that \u201c[a]ny authority granted to the President by section 1702 ... may be exercised to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial party outside the United States\u201d is enough to satisfy the \u201cintelligible principle\u201d requirement. <em>Cf. Touby, </em>500 U.S. at 165, 111 S.Ct. 1752 (holding that a statute\u2019s \u201cimminent hazard to the public safety\u201d standard was an \u201cintelligible principle\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Not only does the IEEPA contain an \u201cintelligible principle,\u201d but it also has several other limitations on the President\u2019s power. First, the authorities delegated to the President are explicitly defined and limited. <em>See </em>50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1702. Second, the President is to, if possible, consult with Congress before exercising the power conferred by the IEEPA. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1703(a). Moreover, whenever the President exercises any of the powers granted by the IEE-PA, he is required to immediately transmit to Congress a report specifying, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe authorities to be exercised and the actions to be taken in the exercise of those authorities to deal\u201d with the unusual and extraordinary threats which triggered the national emergency. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1703(b). This reporting requirement is subject to periodic follow-up reports to Congress. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1703(c). Third, the power granted to the President by the IEEPA can be eliminated by Congress\u2019s termination of the declaration of emergency. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1701(b), 1706. These limitations, combined with the \u201cintelligible principle\u201d set forth in the statute, establish that the IEEPA is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. Mirza\u2019s attempt to undermine his conviction on nondelegation grounds is therefore unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Mirza also argues that his IEEPA conviction violates the Due Process Clause. Specifically, he contends that the term \u201cTaliban\u201d is impermissibly vague under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cA conviction fails to comport with due process if the statute under which it is obtained fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2705, 2718,177 L.Ed.2d 355 (2010) (citation omitted). \u201cWe consider whether a statute is vague as applied to the particular facts at issue, for \u2018[a] plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2718-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-12\">According to Mirza, he lacked notice of which \u201cforeign nationals were subject to economic prohibitions under [the] IEEPA.\u201d Moreover, he maintains that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>term \u201cTaliban\u201d is vague because \u201cfor many people throughout the planet\u201d the term \u201cTaliban\u201d means \u201cstudents.\u201d We reject both assertions. Our inquiry is focused on whether a person of ordinary intelligence would have fair notice of what is prohibited.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Given the ten years that have passed since the Taliban entered the public consciousness through the initiation of the war in Afghanistan, we conclude that a person of ordinary intelligence, in the post 9/11 context, would have fair notice of what group the term \u201cTaliban\u201d refers to. Contrary to Mirza\u2019s assertion, the meaning a person of ordinary intelligence would assign to the term \u201cTaliban\u201d is certainly not \u201cstudent.\u201d Mirza\u2019s vagueness argument therefore falls flat.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Mirza also presents several challenges to his weapons and ammunition convictions. We consider each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Mirza contends that his weapons and ammunition convictions should be reversed because the statutory provision upon which they were predicated, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(5)(A), is unconstitutional. He specifically contends that this provision violates the Second Amendment. We review <em>de novo </em>the constitutionality of federal laws. <em>Anderson, </em>559 F.3d at 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Section 922(g)(5)(A) provides that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for any person ... who, being an alien ... illegally or unlawfully in the United States ... to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(5)(A). Earlier this year, we rejected a Second Amendment challenge to this very provision. <em>See United States v. Portillo-Munoz, </em>643 F.3d 437, 442 (5th Cir.2011). In doing so, we stated that \u201c[wjhatever else the term means or includes, the phrase \u2018the people\u2019 in the Second Amendment of the Constitution does not include aliens illegally in the United States.\u201d <em>Id. Portillo-Munoz </em>therefore requires us to conclude that the rights conferred by the Second Amendment do not extend to individuals like Mirza who are unlawfully in the United States. Because he does not possess a right to keep and bear arms, he is foreclosed from arguing that his weapons and ammunition convictions violate his Second Amendment rights. His Second Amendment challenge to his convictions under Section 922(g)(5)(A) is therefore unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-13\">After presenting his Second Amendment challenge, Mirza goes on to argue that his weapons and ammunition convictions violate his \u201crights to Substantive Due Process, to Procedural Due Process, and to Equal Protection under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d Because he fails to develop any discernible Due Process arguments with respect to these convictions, he has waived any challenge on these grounds. <em>E.g., Stalnaker, </em>571 F.3d at 440-41. We will therefore focus our attention on Mirza\u2019s argument to the extent it is based on the Equal Protection component of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. Under this component, Mirza argues that Section 922(g)(5)(A) is unconstitutional because it impermissibly discriminates based on alienage. Again, we review <em>de novo </em>the constitutionality of federal statutes. <em>Anderson, </em>559 F.3d at 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>\u201cWe apply the deferential rational basis test to federal statutes that classify based on alienage[.]\u201d <em>United States v. Santos-Riviera, </em>183 F.3d 367, 373 (5th Cir.1999); <em>accord Madriz-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 321, 332 (5th Cir.2004) (\u201cIn light of Congress\u2019s plenary power to pass legislation concerning the admission or exclusion of aliens, it is clear that no more searching review than that of rational basis is appropriate.\u201d). \u201cUnder rational basis review, differential treatment \u2018must be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.\u2019 \u201d <em>Madriz-Alvarado, </em>383 F.3d at 332 (citation omitted). In applying rational basis review, we are to presume the constitutionality of the statute, and the burden is on the party attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it. <em>Heller v. Doe, </em>509 U.S. 312, 320, 113 S.Ct. 2637, 125 L.Ed.2d 257 (1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Mirza has not carried his burden of showing that there is not a rational relationship between the challenged classification and some legitimate government purpose. In prohibiting individuals who are unlawfully in the United States from possessing firearms, Congress could have conceivably concluded that a subset of these individuals, like others who have broken the law, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), may pose a risk to public safety. Admittedly, in seeking to further public safety, Congress used broad generalizations about those who are unlawfully in the United States. Of course, there are many individuals who are unlawfully in this country who pose no risk to public safety. Despite this reality, we \u201care compelled under rational-basis review to accept a legislature\u2019s generalizations even when there is an imperfect fit between means and ends. A classification does not fail rational-basis review because it is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality.\u201d <em>Heller, </em>509 U.S, at 321, 113 S.Ct. 2637 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c\u2018The problems of government are practical ones and may justify, if they do not require, rough accommodations\u2014illogical, it may be, and unscientific.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Metropolis Theater Co. v. Chi., </em>228 U.S. 61, 69-70, 33 S.Ct. 441, 57 L.Ed. 730 (1913)). Accepting Congress\u2019s conceivable generalizations, we conclude that there is a rational relationship between Section 922(g)(5)(A) and a legitimate government purpose. Accordingly, we reject this challenge to his weapons and ammunition convictions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Mirza also challenges these convictions on the grounds that they violated his \u201cconstitutional right to substantive due process, to procedural due process, and to equal protection to face criminal charges!.]\u201d As the factual basis for these purported constitutional violations, Mirza avers that not only did he fail to receive notice that the government believed he was out of status, but that he was denied the \u201copportunity to rebut the allegation that he was out of status beginning at a certain point in time.\u201d He does not, however, provide any relevant case law to support his argument that the government\u2019s inaction or his criminal proceedings violat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>ed the Constitution. The only case Mirza cites in this portion of his brief supports the proposition that an individual on a student visa who fails to comply with federal regulations is \u201c \u2018without authorization to remain in this country,\u2019 and [is] \u2018in the same position legally as the alien who ... enters the United States without permission.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Bazargan, </em>992 F.2d 844, 848 (8th Cir.1993) (quoting <em>United States v. Igbatayo, </em>764 F.2d 1039, 1040 (5th Cir.1985)). Needless to say, this proposition does not further Mirza\u2019s argument. As such, we reject this attempt to undermine his weapons and ammunition convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Mirza\u2019s three remaining arguments are also futile. First, Mirza contends that his weapons and ammunition convictions are invalid because he did not violate the terms of his student visa. Because this is simply an attempt to revive an argument rejected by the jury, we see no reason to reverse his convictions on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Second, Mirza asserts that his weapons convictions are invalid because he possessed a valid hunting license. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(y)(2)(A), Section 922(g)(5)(B) does not apply to \u201cany alien who has been lawfully admitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant visa, if that alien is ... in possession of a hunting license or permit lawfully issued in the United States.\u201d Mirza, however, was not charged with violating Section 922(g)(5)(B). This exception is therefore unavailable to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Finally, he contends that the lack of a heightened mens rea requirement for charges brought under Section 922(g)(5)(A) violates the Due Process Clause. Specifically, he contends that a conviction under Section 922(g)(5)(A) should require proof that he knew that it was illegal for him to possess a firearm. In support of this argument, Mirza relies upon the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lambert v. California, </em>355 U.S. 225, 78 S.Ct. 240, 2 L.Ed.2d 228 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">In <em>Lambert, </em>the petitioner challenged a Los Angeles Municipal Code ordinance that prohibited convicted felons from remaining in the city for longer than five days without registering with the police. Notwithstanding the general rule that ignorance of the law does not excuse illegal behavior, the Supreme Court held that the ordinance gave such insufficient notice that due process was violated. <em>Lambert, </em>355 U.S. at 229-30, 78 S.Ct. 240. Two factors persuaded the Court: (1) the prohibited conduct was \u201cwholly passive\u201d; and (2) there was an absence of \u201ccircumstances that should alert the doer to the .consequences of his deed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228, 78 S.Ct. 240. After noting these factors, the Court held that \u201cactual knowledge of the duty to register or proof of the probability of such knowledge and subsequent failure to comply are necessary before a conviction under the ordinance can stand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229, 78 S.Ct. 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">We have previously considered <em>Lambert\u2019s </em>applicability in the context of Section 922(g). On each occasion we have encountered this question, we have rejected <em>Lambert </em>challenges to convictions under Section 922(g). <em>E.g., United States v. Shelton, </em>325 F.3d 553, 563-64 (5th Cir.2003) (rejecting <em>Lambert </em>challenge to conviction under Section 922(g)(9)); <em>United States v. Emerson, </em>270 F.3d 203, 215-16 (5th Cir.2001) (rejecting <em>Lambert </em>challenge to conviction under Section 922(g)(8)). This occasion will be no different. As we stated in <em>Shelton, </em>the <em>Lambert </em>due process exception is inapplicable where the conduct involved is not passive. Here, as in <em>Shelton, </em>we conclude that the <em>Lambert </em>exception does not apply because possession of a firearm is not a passive activity. <em>See Shelton, </em>325 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>F.3d at 564. <em>Lambert </em>therefore cannot support Mirza\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Mirza\u2019s contention that a higher mens rea requirement is necessary under Section 922(g)(5) also fails on a separate ground. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2) provides that the required mens rea under Section 922(g) is knowledge. Contrary to what Mirza suggests, the term \u201cknowingly\u201d as used in the Section 924(a)(2) does not require knowledge that his possession of weapons was illegal. Rather, unless the statute of a language dictates a different result, \u201cthe term \u2018knowingly\u2019 merely requires proof of knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense,\u201d not knowledge of the legal import of those facts. <em>Bryan v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 184, 191-93, 118 S.Ct. 1939, 141 L.Ed.2d 197 (1998); <em>accord Emerson, </em>270 F.3d at 216 (\u201c \u2018Knowingly\u2019\u2014 in contrast to at least some uses of \u2018wilfully\u2019\u2014does not require that the defendant know that his actions are unlawful, but only that he know he is engaging in the activity that the legislature has proscribed.\u201d). We therefore reject Mirza\u2019s effort to graft a higher mens rea requirement onto Section 922(g)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM Mirza\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b273-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-21\">. The government also established that Mirza purchased approximately one thousand rounds of .223-caliber ammunition at a gun show on December 31, 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b274-6\">. At trial, the government introduced various audio recordings of conversations involving Mirza.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b275-11\">. Although we apply a <em>de novo </em>standard of review, we note that the record does not reflect that Mirza moved for a judgment of acquittal after presenting his case. As we have stated before, \"[wjhere a defendant moves for a judgment of acquittal after the government rests but fails to renew the motion after presenting his case, this failure to renew the motion generally constitutes a waiver, and our review of his sufficiency of the evidence claim is normally limited to whether there was a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Resio-Trejo, </em>45 F.3d 907, 910 n. 6 (5th Cir.1995). Bec\u00e1use the transcript cuts off portions of the proceedings after the conclusion of Mirza's case, we are not certain that he failed to preserve this challenge. Given the ultimate futility of this challenge even under the <em>de novo </em>standard of review, we will consider this challenge procedurally preserved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b277-7\">. The Supreme Court has expressly refrained from deciding whether Congress must provide more specific guidance than a mere \u2018\u2018intelligible principle\u201d when authorizing the Executive \"to promulgate regulations that contemplate criminal sanctions.\u201d <em>Touby, </em>500 U.S. at 165-66, 111 S.Ct. 1752. Mirza has not raised this issue, so we need not decide this question. <em>United States v. Valdiosera-Godinez, </em>932 F.2d 1093, 1099 (5th Cir.1991) (applying the rule that \"any issue not raised or argued in the appellant\u2019s brief are considered waived and will not be entertained on appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b277-13\">. Notably, the Supreme Court has used the nondelegation doctrine to strike down a federal law only twice in its history. <em>See Pan. Ref. Co. v. Ryan, </em>293 U.S. 388, 55 S.Ct. 241, 79 L.Ed. 446 (1935); <em>A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 495, 55 S.Ct. 837, 79 L.Ed. 1570 (1935).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b278-6\">. Mirza also presents three other Due Process deficiencies with his Count 2 conviction. Because these arguments are presented in a conclusory fashion, we will not consider them. <em>E.g., United States v. Stalnaker, </em>571 F.3d 428, 440-41 (5th Cir.2009) (concluding that undeveloped arguments that lacked citations to relevant law were waived for inadequate briefing). While Mirza does cite case law for two propositions, the cases he relies upon are either inapposite or have been expressly rejected by this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b279-10\">. Mirza does not argue that the statute is \u201cis so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.\u201d His contention focuses on a lack of notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b280-5\">. Mirza also raises Ex Post Facto and Tenth Amendment challenges to these convictions. Like the various other undeveloped and conclusory arguments that litter his brief, these contentions have been abandoned on appeal. <em>See Dardar v. Lafourche Realty Co., Inc., </em>985 F.2d 824, 831 (5th Cir.1993) (\"Questions posed for appellate review but inadequately briefed are considered abandoned.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
