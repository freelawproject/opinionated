Stanback raises five arguments on appeal. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-16\">Stanback first seeks reversal of the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 29 motion for a directed verdict, based on his argument that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of any of the charged counts. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 29. Stanback contends that the conflicting testimony of his two co-defendants, Frederick Clay and Carmilla Davis, weighed in his favor because Davis\u2019s testimony that Stanback participated in the bank robbery was not credible, while Clay\u2019s contradictory testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>mony was.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Stanback further disputes the sufficiency of evidence regarding the location of his arrest and the government\u2019s DNA analysis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">We review the \u201csufficiency of evidence to support a conviction <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and drawing all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>480 F.3d 1025, 1026 (11th Cir.2007). Our review does not change \u201cregardless of whether the evidence is direct or circumstantial....\u201d <em>United States v. Mieres-Borges, </em>919 F.2d 652, 656-57 (11th Cir.1990). Further, we ordinarily will not review a factfinder\u2019s credibility determination. <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>20 F.3d 412, 413 (11th Cir.1994). In fact, testimony is incredible as a matter of law only when it is \u201cunbelievable on its face\u201d\u2014that is, it offers \u201cfacts that [the witness] physically could not have possibly observed or events that could not have occurred under the laws of nature.\u201d <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>775 F.2d 1559, 1561 (11th Cir.1985) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The testimony against Stanback is not incredible as a matter of law. Davis\u2019s detailed testimony of Stanback\u2019s participation in the armed bank robbery, including his brandishing of a firearm during that incident, was corroborated by multiple witnesses and exhibits. The testimony of these witnesses also supports the conviction for felony possession, when combined with the parties\u2019 stipulations that Stanback was a convicted felon at the time of the robbery and that the pertinent firearms were involved in interstate commerce. The other evidence Stanback impugns\u2014 the location of his arrest and the testimony of a DNA expert\u2014only supports the jury\u2019s conclusion that he was guilty of these offenses. We conclude that the evidence supporting Stanback\u2019s convictions was sufficient and, consequently, the district court did not err in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">Second, Stanback argues that the court erred in admitting into evidence his ID card from the Georgia Department of Corrections, because it showed he was a convicted felon. \u25a0 Stanback asserts that his identity and place of residence were never disputed, rendering the ID card superfluous. Evidence showed that after the bank robbery, Stanback and his co-defendants fled to his sister\u2019s house. During the subsequent investigation, the FBI searched that residence and recovered several items from the robbery in a back bedroom, including a large sum of dye-stained money, firearms, a stun gun, and ski masks. Agents also discovered in the bedroom a metal storage box containing dye-stained money and Stanback\u2019s corrections ID card.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-12\">Stanback claims that the district court should have excluded the ID card under Fed.R.Evid. 403, since the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighed the ID card\u2019s probative value. He also argues for the first time that the ID card was \u201cused to reinforce the fact that [he] was a convicted felon\u201d and was, therefore, inadmissi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>ble character evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">All relevant evidence is admissible unless the Federal Rules of Evidence provide otherwise. Fed.R.Evid. 401, 402. Rule 408 allows the trial judge to exclude relevant evidence when the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs its probative value. Fed.R.Evid. 408; <em>see also United States v. Edouard, </em>485 F.3d 1324, 1344 (11th Cir.2007). Under Rule 403, district courts have broad discretion to admit probative evidence, but limited discretion to exclude it. <em>United States v. Terzado-Madruga, </em>897 F.2d 1099, 1117 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), \u201c[ejvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or other acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 404(b)(1). However, evidence of other criminal activity falls entirely outside Rule 404(b)\u2019s ambit if it is \u201cnot extrinsic.\u201d <em>Edouard, </em>485 F.3d at 1344 (quotations marks omitted). Evidence is <em>\u201cnot </em>extrinsic\u201d when it is of \u201c(1) an uncharged offense that arose out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the charged offense (2) necessary to complete the story of the crime or (3) inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1205 n. 9 (11th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The .district court did not err under Rule 403 or Rule 404(b). The ID card was recovered in a metal storage box that also contained dye-stained money. Even though dye-stained money had already been found in the house where Stanback was staying, its proximity to the ID card directly linked Stanback\u2014as opposed to others in the house\u2014to money from the robbery. Thus, admitting the ID card into evidence \u201ccomplete[d] the story of the crime\u201d by placing Stanback in the room with the evidence. <em>Id. We </em>also accept that the ID card was \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d\u2014indeed, it was locked in a metal box\u2014\u201cwith the evidence regarding the charged offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These specific facts place the Department of Corrections ID card outside Rule 404(b)\u2019s scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">In an event, Stanback has not shown how admission of the ID card (which did not specify any crime for which he had previously been convicted) had an unfairly prejudicial impact on his right to a fair trial. He had already stipulated that he was a convicted felon. We have no basis to conclude that a jury would accord greater weight to the card showing that Stan-back had been incarcerated than to the fact of his felony conviction. We therefore conclude that the district court committed neither an abuse of discretion, nor plain error, in admitting the ID card.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-13\">Stanback next argues that the district court erred by submitting to the jury a verdict form that, in addition to asking whether Stanback was guilty or not guilty of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), allowed the jury to make an independent finding as to whether Stanback \u201ccarried, possessed, or brandished\u201d a firearm. Stanback asserts that the form\u2019s repeated use of the terms \u201cfirearm\u201d and \u201cdefendant\u201d unduly influenced the jury to find him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-14\">We apply a deferential standard of review to special interrogatory verdict forms, asking only whether the form was suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>cient so that the jurors understood the issues and were not misled. <em>McNely v. Ocala Star-Banner, </em>99 F.3d 1068, 1072 (11th Cir.1996). We confirm, through <em>de novo </em>review, that the verdict form accurately reflects the law; but we give the trial judge wide discretion as to the style and wording employed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Stanback objects only to the wording of the verdict form. He correctly claims that the jury could have found him guilty, regardless of whether it specified that he carried, brandished, or possessed a firearm. Nevertheless, we conclude that the form was not unfairly prejudicial. The verdict form was neither confusing nor misleading. Indeed, the wording of the verdict form essentially tracked the statute upon which the minimum mandatory sentence for the offense depended.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district judge is certainly entitled to use interrogatories to the jury to aid him in his sentencing decision, particularly in light of the discretion we afford district judges in this area. For these reasons, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Stanback also argues that the district court erred in assessing a two-level aggravating role enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We review the sentencing court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo, </em>and the court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>419 F.3d 1189, 1192 (11th Cir.2005). In the district court, the government bears the initial burden of \u201cproving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had an aggravating role in the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Yeager, </em>331 F.3d 1216, 1226 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">Stanback asserts that there was no evidence to indicate that he recruited accomplices, claimed a larger share of the proceeds, or arranged a getaway vehicle. He also argues that it was irrelevant to the leadership assessment that his gun worked while his co-defendant\u2019s gun did not. Nevertheless, there was ample evidence to support the district court\u2019s finding that Stanback asserted control and influence over his co-defendants in the course of planning and carrying out the bank robbery, as well as in subsequent efforts to avoid arrest. This evidence includes testimony that Stanback: planned the robbery; distributed weapons to his co-defendants; instructed Clay to hurry up and to leave the money that had fallen out of the bag after the dye-pack exploded; and made the decision to flee to Pensacola, Florida, since he had a friend there.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">Based on this, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that a preponderance of the evidence demonstrated Stanback\u2019s leadership role in the robbery, warranting application of the \u00a7 3B1.1(c) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-13\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-14\">Last, Stanback claims that the district court erred by departing upward from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>sentencing guidelines range. He argues that his total sentence is unreasonable and that a sentence within the guideline range would have been sufficient but not greater than necessary under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Stanback \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both the record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). He has provided no authority or evidence in support of his argument. Indeed, the district judge demonstrated that he \u201cconsidered the parties\u2019 arguments and ha[d] a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority\u201d by enumerating his reasons for finding that a sentence above the guideline range was appropriate and necessary to achieve the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). We see no basis for disturbing the district court\u2019s sentencing decision, and we therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b765-7\">. Specifically, Stanback argues that Davis was effectively impeached due to her inconsistent statements, as well as the fact that she had cooperated with the government in order to reduce her sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b765-8\">. Stanback claims that the DNA found on the masks allegedly used in the robbery proved that he \u201ccould not have participated in the robbery.\u201d He bases this argument on the DNA expert\u2019s testimony that it was \"hypothetically\u201d possible that another individual was a match for one of the masks. We are mindful that the expert also testified that Stanback's DNA was found on the other mask used in the robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b766-7\">. We review a district court's evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Perez-Oliveros, </em>479 F.3d 779, 783 (11th Cir.2007). Objections or arguments not raised in the district court, such as Stanback\u2019s 404(b) argument, are reviewed for plain error. See <em>e.g., United States v. Evans, </em>478 F.3d 1332, 1338 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b767-8\">.
