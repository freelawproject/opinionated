For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-28\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-29\">In March 2010, Lorah commenced a civil action alleging employment discrimination pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e. In her June 22, 2010 amended complaint,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> she alleged that her former employer, Home Helper\u2019s Inc. Delaware Respite, discriminated against her based on her age, sex, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>race, and national origin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lorah was employed by the defendant from May 2007 to June 2009 as a care-giver/homemaker. On April 10, 2009, Lorah was injured at work. She sought medical treatment for her injury but told her manager, Krista Gaul, that she did not need therapy or to file a workers\u2019 compensation claim. Lorah\u2019s amended complaint also asserted that she was molested by a patient on May 20, 2009.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She contends that she was forced to resign after the molestation because her hours were significantly reduced. She therefore submitted a letter of resignation, stating that she could not continue to work six-to-eight hours per week and that she could not \u201cwithstand the condition[s] of her employment concerning sexual harassment and an injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Lorah thereafter sought unemployment compensation from the State of Delaware. The Delaware Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board denied her claim after finding that she quit her job without good cause. Lorah appealed from this decision to the Delaware Superior Court and the Delaware Supreme Court, both of which affirmed the administrative agency\u2019s decision. <em>See Lorah v. Home Helpers Inc., </em>21 A.3d 596 (Del.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Lorah also wrote a letter to the State of Delaware Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d) seeking an \u201cadministrative remedy,\u201d and apparently requesting legal representation. In a July 16, 2009 letter, the DOL advised her that it was unable to assist her but stated that it was authorized to \u201cnegotiate a settlement in an open case.\u201d It noted, however, that in her \u201cmatters, the employers did not agree to participate in settlement discussions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">On September 27, 2011, the District Court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint and declined to give Lorah another opportunity to amend her complaint. The District Court determined that: (1) it lacked jurisdiction over Lorah\u2019s claim of injury that occurred while she was employed; (2) Lorah\u2019s claim regarding the denial of her unemployment benefits was barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine; and (3) Lorah failed to exhaust the remedies necessary to raise a Title VII claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-12\">Lorah now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-14\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because this appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. 3d Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-15\">The District Court\u2019s memorandum opinion is thoughtful and comprehensive, and we see no reason to discuss Lo-rah\u2019s claims in any detail here. All counts in the amended complaint were properly dismissed by the District Court. The District Court appropriately dismissed Lo-rah\u2019s claims as unexhausted under Title VII,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as she failed to attach a right-to-sue letter to her amended complaint and provided no indication that she filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5; <em>Anjelino v. New York Times Co., </em>200 F.3d 73, 93 (3d Cir.1999) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>(\u201cThe preliminary step of the filing of the EEOC charge and the receipt of the right to sue notification are essential parts of the statutory plan, designed to correct discrimination through administrative conciliation and persuasion if possible, rather than by formal court action.\u201d) (internal citation omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additionally, the District Court did not abuse its discretion by denying Lorah\u2019s requests to further amend her complaint because the proposed amendments were, as the District Court noted, \u201ceither frivolous or advance[d] a claim that [wa]s legally insufficient on its face.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a); <em>Oran v. Stafford, </em>226 F.3d 275, 291 (3d Cir.2000) (discussing standard for determining whether to grant or deny a motion for leave to amend a complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">We will therefore summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b51-17\">. The District Court dismissed Lorah\u2019s initial complaint in May 2010 pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, but gave her an opportunity to amend. The District Court's memorandum order specified that the amended complaint must set forth more fully her \"allegations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>discrimination\u201d and attach a \u201dright-to-sue letter from the EEOC.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b52-7\">. Lorah is a Caucasian female over the age of 50.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b52-8\">. Lorah filed a police complaint regarding the alleged assault in October 2009.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b52-9\">. To the extent, if any, that Lorah was attempting to raise a claim involving a work-related injury, or to appeal the state-court unemployment litigation to federal court, the District Court was correct in refusing to review these claims. <em>See </em>19 Del. C. \u00a7 2304 (stating that the Delaware Worker's Compensation Act is exclusive remedy for work-related accidental injuries); <em>Great Western Mining &amp; Mineral Co. v. Fox Rothschild LLP, </em>615 F.3d 159 (3d Cir.2010) (explaining the application of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b53-15\">. We note that although Lorah is proceeding pro se, she should be well-acquainted with the requirements for filing a Title VII claim. <em>See, e.g., Lorah v. Tetra Tech Inc., </em>541 F.Supp.2d 629 (D.Del.2008); <em>Lorah v. Dep't of Natural Res. &amp; Envtl. Control, </em>Civ. No. 06-cv-539-SLR, 2007 WL 2049908 (D.Del. Jul.16, 2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
