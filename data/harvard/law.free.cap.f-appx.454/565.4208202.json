Appellants appeal the district court\u2019s order denying Appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Generally, denial of a motion to dismiss is not an appealable final order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>Confederated Salish v. Simonich, </em>29 F.3d 1398, 1401-02 (9th Cir.1994). \u201cA district court\u2019s decision is appealable under \u00a7 1291 only when the decision \u2018ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1401 (quoting <em>Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., </em>485 U.S. 271, 275, 108 S.Ct. 1133, 99 L.Ed.2d 296 (1988)). A final decision is one that is \u201ca full adjudication of the issues at bar, and clearly evinces the judge\u2019s intention that it be the court\u2019s final act in the matter.\u201d <em>In re Slimick, </em>928 F.2d 304, 307 (9th Cir.1990). The court\u2019s January 25, 2010 order did not evince the district judge\u2019s intention that it be the court\u2019s final act in the matter. To the contrary, the possibility of further action by the district court was apparent, given its concerns about the pace of post-judgment proceedings in the CNMI Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-15\">Appellants further contend that the district court\u2019s issuance of a limited, 60-day stay pursuant to <em>Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, </em>424 U.S. 800, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976), is an appealable final order. \u201c[T]he usual rule [is] that a stay is not ordinarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>a final decision for purposes of \u00a7 1291, since most stays do not put the plaintiff effectively out of court.\u201d <em>Moses H. Cone Mem\u2019l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 10 n. 11, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). An abstention-based stay, however, is appealable under \u00a7 1291 where the effect is to deprive parties of a federal forum. <em>Id.; see also Lockyer v. Mirant Corp., </em>398 F.3d 1098, 1102 (9th Cir.2005). Although, the district court applied <em>Colorado River </em>when issuing the temporary stay, <em>Moses H. Cone </em>is inapplicable because the parties will not be deprived of a federal forum. The district court clearly foresaw, and indeed intended on issuance, that proceedings would resume after the temporary stay expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The stay is also not appealable under the collateral-order exception to \u00a7 1291. \u201cTo be included among \u2018the small class of decisions excepted from the final-judgment rule by <em>[Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949) ]\u2019 an order \u2018must (1) conclusively determine the disputed question, (2) resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and (3) be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lockyer, </em>398 F.3d at 1103 (quoting <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 468, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978)). Here the district court did not determine any disputed question or resolve any issue. In fact, it is clear to us that the district court intended to continue the litigation after gauging the progress of the post-judgment proceedings in the Superior Court. Thus, the temporary stay entered here does not fall within the limited class of decisions appealable under the collateral-order exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">Lastly, the temporary stay is also not appealable pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 as the parties did not seek permission from the district court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) to permit this interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">Costs are awarded to the appellees. The appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b588-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
