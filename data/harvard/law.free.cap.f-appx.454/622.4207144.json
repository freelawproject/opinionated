We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-19\">McKenzie contends that his constitutional right to due process was violated when, during voir dire, the judge stated that he would have the discretion to grant probation and the prosecutor stated that the court could reduce the offense to a misdemeanor. Because McKenzie does not show that the California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision rejecting McKenzie\u2019s contentions was contrary to or an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent, the district court did not err in denying the petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Further, McKenzie\u2019s trial was not \u201cso fundamentally unfair\u201d that it denied McKenzie due process under <em>Donnelly v. De-Christoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 645, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b644-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
