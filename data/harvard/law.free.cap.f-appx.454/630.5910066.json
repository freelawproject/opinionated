Moreover, West seeks to expand the scope of the Certificate of Appealability granted by the district court. Because the history and facts of the case are familiar to the parties, we need not recount them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">This court reviews the denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 <em>de novo. Dows v. Wood, </em>211 F.3d 480, 484 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The standard of review by federal courts of state court decisions governed by AED-PA is a \u201chighly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings, which demands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.\u201d <em>Woodford v. Visciotti, </em>537 U.S. 19, 24, 123 S.Ct. 357, 154 L.Ed.2d 279 (2002) (per curiam) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). As per the AEDPA, the Nevada Supreme Court\u2019s decision must have been an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent to warrant a writ of habeas corpus. <em>See Sims v. Rowland, </em>414 F.3d 1148, 1151 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of West\u2019s petition for habeas corpus. In <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>the Supreme Court provided the standard for determining the sufficiency of the evidence at a criminal trial. 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). The Court explained that \u201cthe relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781 (citing <em>Johnson v. Louisiana, </em>406 U.S. 356, 362, 92 S.Ct. 1620, 32 L.Ed.2d 152 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">West\u2019s primary argument focuses on the indeterminancy of the medical evidence. That argument, however, overlooks other circumstantial evidence relied on by the Nevada Supreme Court including: the manner in which the victim\u2019s body was found, the plastic bag tied over her face, evidence of the unhealthy relationship between West and the victim, and evidence indicating that West fabricated a story of moving the victim to California even before she disappeared. Viewing the facts in this case in the light most favorable to the prosecution, this Court cannot say that the Nevada Supreme Court\u2019s decision to uphold West\u2019s conviction was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">Because the Nevada Supreme Court\u2019s decision comports with the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), West\u2019s petition was appropriately denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">As to West\u2019s request to expand the Certificate of Appealability to include two other issues, the Court finds that no reasonable jurist could debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s ruling on these issues. Accordingly, the Court declines to expand the certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">The district court\u2019s denial of West\u2019s petition for habeas corpus is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b652-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
