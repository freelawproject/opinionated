Forester, United States Senior District Judge for the Eastern District of Kentucky, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b495-10\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">Shan Dong Lin, who is represented by counsel, petitions for review of a decision by the Board of Immigrations Appeals vacating an Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) grant of asylum and ordering him removed to China. The parties have waived oral argument, and this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 84(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">Shortly after Lin\u2019s wife was subjected to a second forced abortion, Lin fled China for the United States. Because he entered the country illegally, on February 8, 2008, the Department of Homeland Security charged Lin with removability and issued him a Notice to Appear. On the grounds that he and his wife violated China\u2019s one-child policy, Lin filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-15\">In January 2009, Lin visited friends in New York City for the Chinese New Year and learned about the China Democracy Party (CDP). Because the CDP criticizes China\u2019s communist government and fights for human rights, Lin joined the CDP at its \u201cUSA Headquarters\u201d in New York. During his New York visit, Lin participated in CDP demonstrations and distributed CDP fliers. At his February 11, 2009, removal hearing, Lin supplemented his application with a claim that he will be persecuted in China for his membership in the CDP. In light of Lin\u2019s testimony and documentary evidence, the IJ granted Lin asylum, but denied his request for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture. Noting the various ways that the Chinese government \u201ckeeps tabs on people,\u201d the IJ concluded that Lin had established a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that he would be persecuted in China for his association with the CDP. The government appealed the IJ\u2019s grant of asylum to the Board. Lin did not cross-appeal the denial of his requests for withholding of removal and for relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-16\">The Board found Lin\u2019s asylum claim \u201cunpersuasive.\u201d The Board noted that Lin had not established a connection between the CDP he joined in New York and the CDP mentioned as the subject of persecution in the State Department\u2019s Country Report on China. The Board also found that Lin had failed to show that \u201cthe Chinese authorities are or will likely become aware of his involvement\u201d with the CDP in New York and that Lin \u201cha[d] not presented evidence that anyone involved in the [CDP in New York] has returned to China and faced problems based on such activity in the United States.\u201d The Board rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>soned that \u201c[Lin] has not established a well-founded fear of persecution on account of his mere membership in the CDP USA.\u201d The Board therefore vacated the IJ\u2019s grant of asylum and ordered Lin removed to China. Lin filed a timely petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">\u201cWhen the [Board] issues its own opinion rather than summarily adopts the findings of the IJ, this Court reviews the decision of the [Board] as the final agency determination.\u201d <em>Bi Xia Qu v. Holder, </em>618 F.3d 602, 605 (6th Cir.2010). Administrative factual findings are upheld unless we conclude \u201cthat \u2018any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606 (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B)). We review de novo any legal issues. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The parties dispute the standard of review that governs this ease. Lin contends that our review is de novo because he is challenging the Board\u2019s application of the law to the facts and is arguing that the Board held him to an improper burden of proof. The government, in contrast, asserts that \u201cit is well-established that the substantial evidence standard applies to the agency\u2019s well-founded fear determination.\u201d We agree with Lin and apply the de novo review standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The Board\u2019s \u201c \u2018application of legal principles to undisputed facts, rather than its underlying determination of those facts or its interpretation of its governing statutes,\u2019 \u201d is an issue that we review de novo. <em>Mapouya v. Gonzales, </em>487 F.3d 396, 405 (6th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Dorosh v. Ashcroft, </em>398 F.3d 379, 381 (6th Cir.2004)). The de novo review standard also applies to \u201cwhether the [Board] used the correct standard in reviewing the IJ\u2019s decision and whether [the Board] assigned to [Lin] the correct burden of proof.\u201d <em>Tran v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 937, 943 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Congress has provided the Attorney General with \u201cdiscretion to grant asylum to a refugee who shows that [he] has suffered past persecution \u2018on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,\u2019 or that [he] has a well-founded fear of future persecution on these grounds.\u201d <em>Qu, </em>618 F.3d at 606 (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)). To establish \u201ca well-founded fear of future persecution,\u201d the asylum applicant must demonstrate: 1) \u201c \u2018a fear of persecution in [his] home country on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,\u2019 \u201d 2) \u201c \u2018a reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution if [he] were to return to that country,\u2019 \u201d and 3) \u201c \u2018[he] is unable or unwilling to return to that country because of such fear.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>398 F.3d 396, 401 (6th Cir.2005)) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Withholding of removal, in contrast, entails a higher burden of proof than asylum. To be granted withholding of removal, the applicant \u201cmust demonstrate \u2018that there is a clear probability that he will be subject to persecution if forced to return to the country of removal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Singh, </em>398 F.3d at 401 (quoting <em>Pilica v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 941, 951 (6th Cir.2004)). \u201cThe \u2018clear probability\u2019 standard asks more of the applicant than the \u2018reasonable possibility1 standard for obtaining asylum because it requires the applicant to show that \u2018it is more likely than not\u2019 that his life or freedom would be threatened by persecution if he returned to his home country.\u201d <em>Pablo-Sanchez v. Holder, </em>600 F.3d 592, 594 (6th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 573, 178 L.Ed.2d 414 (2010) (quoting <em>Al-Ghorbani v. Holder, </em>585 F.3d 980, 993-94 (6th Cir.2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">Lin argues that the Board improperly applied the law governing \u201ca well-founded fear of persecution\u201d because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>imposed an inappropriate burden of proof on his claim. Although the IJ explicitly recognized the difference between the two standards when he granted Lin asylum, but denied him withholding of removal, the Board\u2019s decision is unclear which burden of proof it applied to Lin. In citing <em>Matter of A-M- </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 737, 740 (BIA 2005), the Board stated that: \u201cThe Immigration Judge erred by concluding that [Lin] met his burden of proof for asylum.\u201d However, the asylum application in <em>Matter of A-M- </em>was denied as untimely, <em>id. </em>at 738-39, and the applicant\u2019s \u201cfear of future persecution\u201d was analyzed in the context of his request for withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>at 740-41. The Board\u2019s specific citation to its discussion regarding the burden of proof for entitlement to withholding of removal in <em>Matter of A-M-, </em>indicates to us that the Board most likely erred in holding Lin to the higher \u201cclear probability\u201d standard for withholding removal, rather than the lesser \u201creasonable possibility\u201d standard for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The Supreme Court has instructed that when the Board fails to conduct a proper analysis, \u201c \u2018[a] court of appeals is not generally empowered to conduct a <em>de novo </em>inquiry into the matter being reviewed and to reach its own conclusions based on such an inquiry.\u2019\u201d <em>Gonzales v. Thomas, </em>547 U.S. 183, 186, 126 S.Ct. 1613, 164 L.Ed.2d 358 (2006) (quoting <em>INS v. Orlando Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002)); <em>see also Qu, </em>618 F.3d at 609. Rather, \u2018\u201cthe proper course, except in rare circumstances, is to remand [the case] to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thomas, </em>547 U.S. at 186, 126 S.Ct. 1613 (quoting <em>Ventura, </em>537 U.S. at 16, 123 S.Ct. 353) (citation omitted); <em>Qu, </em>618 F.3d at 609. Because the Board\u2019s decision regarding the burden of proof it applied to Lin is, at best, unclear, a remand is appropriate in this case to allow the Board to clarify its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Accordingly, Lin\u2019s petition for review is granted. We vacate the Board\u2019s decision and remand the case to the Board for reconsideration of Lin\u2019s asylum application.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
