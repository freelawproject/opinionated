Davidson, Senior District Judge for the U.S. District Court for Northern Mississippi, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b649-19\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-20\">Appellant Robert R. Galarza (\u201cGalarza\u201d) challenges the district court\u2019s decision upholding the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s determination that Galarza was not disabled for purposes of disability and Social Security Insurance benefits eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-21\">Before the hearing, the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) denied Galarza\u2019s attorney Stephanie Simpson\u2019s (\u201cSimpson\u201d) request that the ALJ recuse himself based upon perceived bias towards counsel. Bias must be shown within the context of an individual case. <em>See Rollins v. Massanari, </em>261 F.3d 853, 858 (9th Cir.2001). As evidence of the ALJ\u2019s bias, Simpson only cited to a previous unpublished memorandum disposition, <em>Bronson v. Barnhart, </em>56 Fed.Appx. 793, 793-94 (9th Cir.2003) (unpublished), in which this court found that the ALJ had exhibited bias against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>Simpson. Since Simpson provided no evidence of bias within the context of this case, her request was appropriately denied. <em>Rollins, </em>261 F.3d at 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">At the hearing, the ALJ found that Galarza did not present credible evidence regarding his inability to work. In addition, the ALJ found that Galarza does not have an impairment or combination of impairments that makes him eligible for benefits and had not suffered a \u201cdisability\u201d as defined by the Social Security Act at any time through the date of the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Subjective complaints of pain are subject to an ALJ\u2019s credibility assessment. <em>See Rollins, </em>261 F.3d at 856-57. In making an adverse credibility finding, the ALJ properly considered the factual inconsistencies between Galarza\u2019s testimony and the medical report, and the inconsistencies within Galarza\u2019s testimony itself. <em>See Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 604 n. 5 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The ALJ\u2019s statements regarding the conflicting medical opinions, Galarza\u2019s sporadic treatment history, and inconsistencies in Galarza\u2019s testimony regarding his pain provide a specific and legitimate basis to determine that Galarza does not have a severe impairment under step two of the five step sequential process. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(h), 416.920(a)(4)(h) (2010). The ALJ correctly applied the law and his decision was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Thomas v. Barnhart, </em>278 F.3d 947, 957 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"AqT\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
