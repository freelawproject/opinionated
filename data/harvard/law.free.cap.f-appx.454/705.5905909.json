On appeal, Ramos-Yanac argues that the district court erred by failing to afford him legal counsel and that he was misled by promises of a substantial assistance sentence reduction from law enforcement agents, his defense attorney, and the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-29\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s authority under Rule 35(b) to reduce a sentence. <em>United States v. Orozco, </em>160 F.3d 1309, 1310, 1312-13 (11th Cir.1998). Pursuant to Rule 35(b), \u201c[u]pon the government\u2019s motion made within one year of sentencing, the court may reduce a sentence if the defendant, after sentencing, provided substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b)(1). As the language of the rule indicates, the district court may only reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to Rule 35(b) upon the government\u2019s motion. <em>United States v. Howard, </em>902 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>F.2d 894, 897 (11th Cir.1990). The Supreme Court has held that this rule gives the government \u201ca power, not a duty, to file a motion when a defendant has substantially assisted.\u201d <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 1843, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). We have previously explained, however, that \u201cjudicial review <em>is </em>appropriate when there is an allegation <em>and </em>a substantial showing that the prosecution refused to file a substantial assistance motion because of a constitutionally impermissible motivation, such as race or religion.\u201d <em>United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1502 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">After careful review, we affirm. First, Ramos-Yanac did not did not have a right to assistance of counsel in filing his Rule 35(b) motion. The Sixth Amendment guarantees defendants a right to counsel \u201cduring those critical stages of a criminal prosecution where substantial rights of a criminal accused may be affected.\u201d <em>United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 794 (11th Cir.2009). But a Rule 35(b) motion is not a critical stage of the prosecution. <em>Cf. United States v. Jackson, </em>923 F.2d 1494, 1496-97 (11th Cir.1991) (holding that a criminal defendant\u2019s presence is not required at a remedial sentence reduction under Rule 35(b) because that is not a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of criminal proceedings.\u201d). Therefore, we reject his argument that the district court erred in failing to provide him with counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Second, because there was no specific agreement requiring the government to file a Rule 35(b) motion, here the district court was authorized to review the government\u2019s refusal to file a substantial assistance motion only if it found that the refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive, such as race or religion. <em>See Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. at 1843-44. While Ramos-Yanac contends that he should have received a lesser sentence and that he was misled by false promises, he does not allege that the government\u2019s refusal to file a Rule 35(b) motion was based on an unconstitutional motive, as described in <em>Wade. See id. </em>Accordingly, we affirm the denial of the Rule 35(b) motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-20\">. Ramos-Yanac argues for the first time on appeal that he is entitled to safety-valve relief, but we find that he has forfeited his claim by not presenting it to the district court. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. </em>Sw. <em>Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004) (issue not raised in the district court and raised for the first time on appeal is forfeited).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
