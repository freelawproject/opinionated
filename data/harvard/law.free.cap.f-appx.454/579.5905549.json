Huff, District Judge for the U.S. District Court for Southern California, San Diego, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b602-20\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-21\">San Francisco Aesthetics and Laser Medicine, Inc. and Dr. Jeannie Tsai appeal the district court\u2019s judgment enforcing a settlement agreement. We affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the history of the cases, we need not recount it here. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and consider the issues presented in both cases. <em>See Litchfield v. Spielberg, </em>736 F.2d 1352, 1355 (9th Cir.1984) (\u201cAn appeal from a final judgment draws in question all earlier, non-final orders and rulings which produced the judgment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b602-23\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to enforce a settlement agreement for abuse of discretion. <em>Doi v. Halekulani Corp., </em>276 F.3d 1131, 1136 (9th Cir.2002). The district court did not abuse its discretion in enforcing the settlement by entering judgment in accordance with the terms of the Amended Stipulated Judgment. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>parties orally settle a dispute in open court, the terms of their written agreement need not be \u201cfully spelled out at the settlement hearing\u201d so long as they are \u201cin full accord with the terms of agreement stated in open court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1139.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Here, where the parties could not distill their oral settlement into a written agreement, the district court adopted most of The Presidio Trust\u2019s written proposed stipulated judgment because it \u201caccurately reflect[ed] the substance of the parties\u2019 settlement agreement as orally recorded.\u201d <em>Report and Recommendation re Motion and Cross Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement </em>at 10, <em>San Francisco Aesthetics v. The Presidio Trust, </em>No. CV 07-05170 (N.D.Cal. June 3, 2009); <em>Judgment, San Francisco Aesthetics v. The Presidio Trust, </em>No. CV 07-05170 (N.D.Cal. Aug. 14, 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Under our deferential standard of review, and considering the record as a whole, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the Amended Stipulated Judgment was in accord with the terms of the parties\u2019 oral settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in calculating the amount due under the Amended Stipulated Judgment. The settlement agreement provided that the court would resolve any dispute over the calculation of the amount due. In calculating this amount, the court determined that The Presidio Trust did not waive its damages claims. Several provisions in the Amended Stipulated Judgment support this finding. The court also determined that The Presidio Trust was entitled to collect late payment penalties and interest. This was also permitted under the Amended Stipulated Judgment and authorized by law. <em>See </em>36 C.F.R. \u00a7 1011.5(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">San Francisco Aesthetics contends that late payments and default interest are illegal under California law. However, under the federal enclave doctrine, California law is inapplicable in this case because it is inconsistent with federal law. <em>James Stewart &amp; Co. v. Sadrakula, </em>309 U.S. 94, 99-100, 60 S.Ct. 431, 84 L.Ed. 596 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b602-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
