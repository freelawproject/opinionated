We affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the history of this case, we need not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-19\">The sole issue raised in this appeal is whether the district court erred in denying Bear\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized from a post-arrest search at a tribal detention facility.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She was searched after an officer observed her on a closed-circuit monitor twice reaching into her co-defendant\u2019s bra and pulling an object out. She was taken by female officers to a private space, where she was asked to remove her clothes, and then squat and cough. At that point, a small, white packet dropped from her body. Later testing demonstrated that the packet contained methamphetamine. A subsequent body cavity search produced a green, leafy substance, which did not form the basis of the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-20\">Reasonable suspicion justifies the use of visual body cavity searches. <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 559-60, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). Bear was arrested for a drug offense and was ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>served to take a concealed packet from a co-defendant at the detention center. Thus, the visual body cavity search was justified by reasonable suspicion. The discovery of the contraband during the visual body cavity search justified the subsequent digital body cavity search.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b572-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.

At oral argument, defense counsel asserted that she was also raising issues pertaining to the constitutionality of the search of Amber\u2019s co-defendant\u2019s purse at the initial traffic stop. However, she did not distinctly raise and argue that issue on appeal, and it is therefore waived. <em>Padgett v.
