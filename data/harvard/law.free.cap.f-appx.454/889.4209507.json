Henderson\u2019s correspondence concerning the timeliness of her petition for review as a motion for reconsideration of the court\u2019s previous rejection of her petition for review as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-36\">On November 3, 2009, the Merit Systems Protection Board issued a final decision in <em>Henderson v. Department of Defense, </em>No. SF-0752-09-0244-I-1, 113 M.S.P.R. 25 (2009), specifying that its decision was final and that any petition for review must be received by this court within 60 calendar days of receipt of the Board\u2019s decision. The Board\u2019s records reflect that Henderson received the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>on November 10, 2009. The court received Henderson\u2019s petition for review 64 days later, on January 13, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">A petition for review of a Board decision must be filed within 60 days of receipt of the decision. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1). The 60-day filing period is \u201cstatutory, mandatory, [and] jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Monzo v. Dept. of Transp., </em>735 F.2d 1335, 1336 (Fed.Cir.1984); <em>see also Oja v. Department of the Army, </em>405 F.3d 1349, 1360 (Fed.Cir.2005) (\u201c[cjompliance with the filing deadline of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1) is a prerequisite to our exercise of jurisdiction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Henderson states that she faxed her petition to the court on January 6, 2010. However, a petition for review may not be filed by facsimile. <em>See </em>Fed. Cir. R. 25(b) (\u201cNo document other than a motion, response to a motion, reply to a response, or letter may be filed or served by facsimile transmission\u201d). Further, documents other than briefs and appendices are not timely filed unless received by the clerk \u201cwithin the time fixed for filing.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 26(a)(2)(A). Thus, Henderson\u2019s petition was not filed until it was received by the clerk on January 13, 2010. Because Henderson\u2019s petition for review was not timely filed, this court must dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">Henderson\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the clerk\u2019s rejection of her petition for review is denied. The petition for review is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
