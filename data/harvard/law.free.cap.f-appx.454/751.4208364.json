Coleman raises three arguments on appeal. First, she asserts that the record does not support the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) findings that J.R.C. was not markedly limited in his ability to acquire and use information, his ability to attend and complete tasks, or his ability to interact and relate to others. She contends that the ALJ\u2019s decision violated Social Security Ruling (\u201cSSR\u201d) 98-1p. Second, Coleman argues that the ALJ erred by failing to consider the cumulative effect of all of J.R.C.\u2019s impairments. Finally, Coleman asserts that the Appeals Council should have remanded her case so that the ALJ could consider a new psychological report prepared after the ALJ\u2019s initial decision. She argues that the Appeals Council\u2019s decision not to remand was contrary to SSR 82-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">We review the Commissioner\u2019s factual findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Social Sec. Admin., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1260 (11th Cir.2007). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Bloodsworth v. Heckler, </em>703 F.2d 1233, 1239 (11th Cir.1983). In reviewing the Commissioner\u2019s decision, we do not \u201cdecide the facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the [Commissioner].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\"><em>A </em>child under the age of 18 is considered disabled if he has a \u201cmedically determinable physical or mental impairment, which results in marked and severe functional limitations.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(C)(i); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.906. The Social Security regulations establish a three-step process for determining whether a child is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924(a). Under the first step, the ALJ considers whether the child has engaged in any substantial gainful activity. <em>Id. </em>At step two, the ALJ considers whether the child has an impairment or combination of impairments that is severe. <em>Id. </em>At step three, the ALJ must decide whether the child\u2019s impairment meets, medically equals, or functionally equals a listed impairment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">In determining whether an impairment functionally equals a listed impairment, the ALJ must consider the child\u2019s ability to function in six different \u201cdomains\u201d: (1) acquiring and using information; (2) attending and completing tasks; (3) interacting and relating with others; (4) moving about and manipulating objects; (5) \u201ccaring for yourself;\u201d and (6) health and physical well-being. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(b)(1). If the child has \u201cmarked\u201d limitations in two of these domains, or an \u201cextreme\u201d limitation in any one domain, then his impairment functionally equals the listed impairments, and he will be found to be disabled. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.926a(d). A \u201cmarked\u201d limitation is one that seriously interferes with the child\u2019s ability to initiate, sustain, or complete activities. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.926a(e)(2)(i). An extreme limitation is one that \u201cvery seriously\u201d interferes with the child\u2019s ability to initiate, sustain, or complete activities. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.926a(e)(3)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">Relevant to this appeal, the domain of acquiring and using information measures the child\u2019s ability to learn. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(g). One consideration is whether the child is able to use language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>to communicate ideas. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(g)(iii) and (iv) (noting that preschool-age children should be able to use language to communicate, and school-age children should be able to discuss topics such as history and science). Under the domain of attending and completing tasks, the ALJ must evaluate whether the child is able to focus and maintain attention on the task at hand, and whether the child is able to begin, carry through, and finish his activities. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(h). Under the domain of interacting and relating with others, the ALJ considers how well the child initiates and sustains emotional connections with others, develops and uses language skills, cooperates with others, complies with rules, responds to criticism, and respects and takes care of the possessions of others. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Moreover, under SSR 98-lp, a child with marked limitations in his cognitive functioning and speech is considered to have a combination of impairments that medically equals Listing 2.09, the adult listing dealing with speech impairments. <em>See </em>SSR 98-1p. A child has a marked limitation in his cognitive functioning if his score on standardized intelligence tests is two or more standard deviations below the norm for that test. A child is markedly limited in his ability to speak if he is intelligible no more than one half to two thirds of the time. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Here, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that J.K.C. was not markedly limited in his ability to acquire and use information. Although J.K.C. had some speech problems, the record shows that his communication skills improved over time. J.K.C. did have some problems with reading and math, but on the whole, the record supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that J.K.C. was not markedly limited in his ability to learn.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">The record also supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that J.K.C. had no limitation in his ability to attend and complete tasks. Although J.K.C. had some difficulty completing tasks correctly during his first year of kindergarten, by the following year, his teacher reported that he was able to finish his work on time. In her own testimony, Coleman did not describe any specific problems with J.HC.\u2019s focus or concentration. The ALJ\u2019s conclusion that J.K.C. was not limited in this area was consistent with the findings of the state agency medical consultants.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">In addition, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that J.K.C. did not have a marked limitation in his ability to interact and relate with others. Although J.K.C. had a speech problem, his ability to communicate improved over time. J.K.C. played with other children in his neighborhood, got along well with his classmates and family, and did not have any specific behavioral problems. J.KC.\u2019s kindergarten teacher reported that his social skills were improving. Finally, SSR 98-lp did not apply to this case because J.K.C. was not markedly limited in his cognitive functioning or his ability to speak. Thus, we affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">Under the Social Security regulations, an ALJ must consider the cumulative effect of all of claimant\u2019s impairments in determining whether he is disabled. <em>Jones v. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., </em>941 F.2d 1529, 1583 (11th Cir.1991). A reference to the claimant\u2019s \u201ccombination of impairments\u201d is adequate to demonstrate that the ALJ considered the cumulative effect of the claimant\u2019s impairments. <em>Id. </em>(quotation and emphasis omitted); <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1224-25 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>The ALJ\u2019s finding that J.K.C. had a severe impairment or combination of impairments that did not meet or equal a listed impairment sufficed to show that the ALJ considered the cumulative effect of all of J.K.C.\u2019s impairments. Thus, Coleman has failed to demonstrate error with respect to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">A claimant may present new evidence during any stage of a Social Security proceeding. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.900(b). \u201cThe Appeals Council must consider new, material, and chronologically relevant evidence and must review the case if \u2018the administrative law judge\u2019s action, findings, or conclusion is contrary to the weight of the evidence currently of record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1261 (quoting 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.970(b)). The Appeals Council may deny review if the new evidence does not show the ALJ\u2019s decision to be erroneous. <em>See id. </em>at 1262. Notably, SSR 82-54, which described the standardized test requirements for evaluating disability in mental retardation cases, has been rescinded as obsolete. Notice of Rescission of Social Security Ruling (SSR) 82-54, Titles II and XVT: Mental Deficiency\u2014Intelligence Testing, 58 Fed.Reg. 16,545, 16,546 (Mar. 29, 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The Appeals Council was not required to grant review of Coleman\u2019s case or to remand to the ALJ for further proceedings because the new psychological report does not establish that the ALJ\u2019s decision was erroneous. The report indicated that J.K.C. had borderline low-end intelligence, but it did not establish that he was markedly limited in his ability to learn and acquire new information. Moreover, Coleman failed to establish error with respect to the ALJ\u2019s compliance with SSR 82-54 because that ruling has been rescinded. Accordingly, we affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
