Barlow alleges that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to investigate and introduce evidence of third-party culpability in his trial was ineffective assistance of counsel. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253, and we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-16\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition de novo and reviews its factual findings for clear error. <em>Robinson v. Schriro, </em>595 F.3d 1086, 1099 (9th Cir.2010). Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cADE-PA\u201d), Barlow would be entitled to habeas relief if he demonstrated that the state court\u2019s denial of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). The standard for evaluating ineffective assistance of counsel was established in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), which requires that the petitioner show both that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-17\">Even assuming Barlow\u2019s trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective, the California Supreme Court\u2019s denial of Barlow\u2019s habeas petition is not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, <em>Strickland </em>because Barlow fails to satisfy <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice prong. Specifically, Barlow fails to show he could have called Brian Bridges to testify, when the testimony of Bridges was the sole piece of evidence before the California Supreme Court implicating William Devore as the killer. <em>See Cullen v. Pinholster, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 1398, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011) (\u201c[R]eview <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) is limited to the record that was before the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits.\u201d). Because Barlow has not shown prejudice, he is not entitled to habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b608-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
