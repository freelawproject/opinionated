In our first opinion, we affirmed the District Court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment to the defendants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on Viola\u2019s First Amendment claim, but remanded for further proceedings on his due process claim. On remand, ruling on cross-motions seeking summary judgment, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants on Viola\u2019s due process claim. We will affirm the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-17\">J. <em>Background Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-18\">We write primarily for the benefit of the parties and recount only the essential facts. Viola, a police officer with the Borough of Throop, was suspended, with pay, effective June 9, 2006.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following a hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>ing on July 11, 2006, Viola was suspended for 10 days, without pay. He sought redress for these suspensions through litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\n<em>II. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The District Court had jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. We have jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">We review the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment de novo. <em>Azur v. Chase Bank, USA, Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n, </em>601 F.3d 212, 216 (3d Cir.2010). \u201cTo that end, we are required to apply the same test the district court should have utilized initially.\u201d <em>Chambers ex rel. Chambers v. Sch. Dist. of Phila. Bd. of Edue., </em>587 F.3d 176, 181 (3d Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, \u201c[w]e may affirm the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment on any grounds supported by the record.\u201d <em>Nicini v. Morra, </em>212 F.3d 798, 805 (3d Cir.2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">On remand,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the District Court followed our instructions, analyzed Viola\u2019s due process claim in light of our decision in <em>Dee v. Borough of Dunmore, </em>549 F.3d 225 (3d Cir.2008), and applied the factors set forth in <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). The District Court\u2019s opinion is thorough and well-reasoned. There is no due process violation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b75-13\">We will affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b74-9\">. Defendants are the Borough of Throop, Tom Lukasewicz, Stanley Lukowski, Neil Furiosi, and Tony Chazan (collectively, \"Defendants\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b74-10\">. Counsel insists that Viola's initial suspension was without pay. This claim is without foundation. <em>(See, e.g., </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. 10 (\"Here, there is no dispute Viola was suspended without pay ... The fact that Throop ended up reversing its decision, does not wipe away the fact that the original suspension was without pay.\u201d).) The record is clear\u2014the suspension initiated by the June 9, 2006 letter was with pay. (Letter from Mayor Stanley Lukowski and Council President Thomas J. Lukasewicz to Officer Eric Viola (June 9, 2006), attached as exhibit 30B6G to Defendants\u2019 Statement of Material Facts as to Which No Genuine Issue Remains to be Tried (\"The purpose of this correspondence is to notify you that you are hereby suspended with pay, effective immediately, from the Throop Police Department for neglect or violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>an official duty.\").) An administrative error\u2014deducting sick leave\u2014subsequently corrected, does not convert that suspension with pay to one without pay. More important, it does not create a constitutional violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b75-11\">. Contrary to Viola\u2019s position before this Court, our prior decision returned the summary judgment motion to the District Court for additional analysis. <em>See </em>18B Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 4478.3 (2d ed.) (\u201d[I]t is the court of appeals that has authority to determine what it meant [in its remand decision].\u201d) Viola\u2019s argument that no motion filed by the Defendants was pending before the District Court is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
