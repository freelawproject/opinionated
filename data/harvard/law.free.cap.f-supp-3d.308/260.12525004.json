BATES, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before the Court is [10] plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. Plaintiff seeks to enjoin defendants SP Funding 452, LLC and Snowpoint Capital, LLC (collectively, the \"lender defendants\") from proceeding with a foreclosure sale of the property located at 2150 Florida Avenue NW in Washington, D.C. (\"the property\"), of which plaintiff is a joint owner. Plaintiff alleges that the security interest on which the lender defendants seek to foreclose was invalidly transferred by defendant Evelina Lekser-plaintiff's daughter and the other joint owner of the property-using a forged power of attorney. For the following reasons, the Court will grant plaintiff's motion and preliminarily enjoin the foreclosure sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In October 2008, plaintiff and defendant Lekser purchased the property as joint tenants with right of survivorship for $800,000. They did so with the intention of renovating the property and ultimately \"flipping\" it for a profit. Verified Compl. [ECF No. 1] \u00b6\u00b6 16-17. They financed the purchase by acquiring a $417,000 loan from Bank of America, which was secured by a first mortgage on the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. Because plaintiff is a resident of Russia and was not present in the United States at the time of the purchase, he executed a limited power of attorney that authorized defendant Lekser to execute documents related to the Bank of America loan and mortgage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Between 2008 and 2015, plaintiff allegedly invested hundreds of thousands of dollars to make repairs and improvements to the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23, 28. Plaintiff alleges that on or around March 30, 2015, he informed defendant Lekser that he wished to list the property for sale to recover his capital investment and an agreed-upon share of the net proceeds from the sale.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. According to plaintiff, defendant Lekser responded by perpetrating a fraudulent scheme to withdraw equity from the property for her own personal gain.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant Lekser allegedly carried out the scheme, along with several co-conspirators also named as defendants, by fraudulently obtaining an $800,000 hard money loan from the lender defendants in November 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31, 77. She allegedly provided false information to the lender defendants, and utilized a fraudulent power of attorney that purported to give her authority to act on plaintiff's behalf, in order to obtain the commercial loan and refinance the then-outstanding Bank of America mortgage encumbering the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 78-79. Approximately half of the proceeds of the $800,000 loan were utilized to pay off the Bank of America mortgage, while the remaining funds were allegedly misappropriated by defendant Lekser and her co-conspirators.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 101, 103, 123. The last payment on the $800,000 loan was made in June 2016, and the loan matured on December 1, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In June 2016, plaintiff sued defendant Lekser in a related action pending before this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shvartser v. Lekser\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-cv-1199-JDB (D.D.C. filed June 20, 2016) [hereinafter \"\n   <em>\n    Shvartser I\n   </em>\n   \"]. In July\n   2017, this Court granted plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment in\n   <em>\n    Shvartser I\n   </em>\n   , and provided plaintiff with the ability to access the property, to complete any necessary repairs, to retain a licensed realtor to sell the property, and to deposit all proceeds from the sale with the Clerk of Court pending the outcome of the litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   July 5, 2017 Order,\n   <em>\n    Shvartser I\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 87].

Along with the verified complaint, plaintiff concurrently filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\"). Mot. for Temporary Restraining Order [ECF No. 3]. The Court held a TRO hearing on the afternoon of February 28, 2018, and granted plaintiff's motion the following day.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 1, 2018 Order [ECF No. 6] at 2. The Court set a briefing schedule for plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction and permitted the parties to serve a limited number of interrogatories and document requests in connection with the briefing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.

Plaintiff has also identified numerous \"irregularities\" on the face of the document, which allegedly call into question its authenticity. A comparison between the 2008 power of attorney-which plaintiff concedes is valid-and the challenged 2015 power of attorney provides further evidence that the later document is not authentic. For example, unlike the 2008 document, the 2015 power of attorney contains no language that is specific to the subject transaction.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Aug. 2008 Power of Attorney (Ex.

At the outset, the lender defendants have not asserted a counterclaim against plaintiff for equitable subrogation.

Defs.' Opp'n to Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at 30. But that is speculative, and any fears about a lengthy delay or the expiration of the foreclosure mediation certificate are mitigated by plaintiff's willingness to proceed to a trial on the merits expeditiously, as permitted under the federal rules.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Here, plaintiff contends that \"the Public Interest is served by permitting the Plaintiff to continue trying to expose the underlying fraud in this case.\" Pl.'s Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at 23.

Opp'n to Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at 30. As to the other defendants, Ms. Lekser indicated during the TRO hearing that she supports plaintiff's motion (though she disputes that the power of attorney was fraudulent), while the remaining defendants have no colorable interest in the property. The Court concludes that the public has an interest in seeing that an innocent property\n   owner is not deprived of his or her interest in real property by fraud. Granting the requested injunction will provide plaintiff with an opportunity to prove his quiet title claim, while denying the injunction will allow the foreclosure sale to occur before plaintiff has an opportunity to prove that his interest was extinguished by fraud. And although the lender defendants have expressed concern about the house remaining empty, plaintiff has represented in his briefing and at the TRO hearing that he intends to move forward promptly with the sale of the property. The Court notes that plaintiff should in fact do so, as he has provided no basis to wait until this action is resolved on the merits to complete the sale of the property, in accordance with the Court's July 5, 2017 Order in\n   <em>\n    Shvartser I\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction.
