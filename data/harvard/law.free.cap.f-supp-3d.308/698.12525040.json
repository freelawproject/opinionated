However, other than making this conclusory assertion, Dejana fails to articulate gross deficiencies permeating Plaintiff's billing records nor does he set forth particularized reasons why the overall fee requested by Plaintiff is patently unreasonable in light of the almost four (4) years of litigation that ensued in this case. In addition, to the extent Dejana relies on\n   <em>\n    Badalamenti\n   </em>\n   to advocate for the use of the percentage of the fund approach, such reliance is misplaced. In\n   <em>\n    Badalamenti\n   </em>\n   , the court would have preferred to utilize the lodestar approach but declined to do so only because of the \"unreliable and contradictory information submitted by plaintiff's counsel ... which includes fees for matters that are clearly not compensable and fluctuating rates and hours, [making] it [ ] impossible to calculate a lodestar in these circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Badalamenti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201862854\">\n    2015 WL 1862854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. In contrast, having reviewed the contemporaneous billing records submitted as part of Plaintiff's fee application, the Court harbors no such concerns. Likewise, Dejana does not assert that these billing records are unreliable or otherwise contradictory to such an extent that calculation of the lodestar would be a futile exercise. Therefore, the concerns at issue in\n   <em>\n    Badalamenti\n   </em>\n   are not present here. Finally, to the extent Dejana's argument can be interpreted to\n   suggest that a reasonable fee must be proportional to the recovery obtained, such a notion has been rejected by courts within this Circuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Badalamenti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201862854\">\n    2015 WL 1862854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (\"[T]he Court is mindful that it is ordinarily inappropriate for an award of attorneys' fee be proportional to the damages recovered under ERISA.\");\n   <em>\n    Mason Tenders Dist.
