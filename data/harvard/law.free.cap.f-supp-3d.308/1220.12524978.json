Utah Mar. 22, 2018) (disagreeing with\n   <em>\n    Driscoll\n   </em>\n   and holding under\n   <em>\n    Shady Grove\n   </em>\n   that plaintiffs' claims brought under state law containing opt-in provision were subject to opt-out notice requirement under Rule 23 ). With no controlling precedent, the Court will analyze NMMWA's \"collective action\" requirement under\n   <em>\n    Shady Grove\n   </em>\n   's two-step process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Is Rule 23 in direct conflict with the NMMWA \"collective action\" provision?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the NMMWA contains no express opt-in requirement similar to the FLSA and the\n   <em>\n    Armijo\n   </em>\n   case does not mention an opt-in requirement. Plaintiff contends that there is no inherent conflict between applying the ad hoc two-step process and also using an opt-out standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Unlike the NMMWA, the FLSA expressly states that no employee will be a party plaintiff \"unless he gives his consent in writing to become such a party....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). In\n   <em>\n    Armijo\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals adopted the following two-tiered approach: (i) a court makes an initial notice stage determination of whether there are substantial allegations that the putative class members were together the victims of a single decision, policy or plan; and then (ii) after discovery and/or a motion to decertify the class, the court revisits its initial determination using a stricter standard of similarly situated.\n   <em>\n    Armijo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3692793\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/142/557/\">\n    2007-NMCA-120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 48,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3692793\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/142/557/\">\n    142 N.M. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3692793\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/142/557/\">\n    168 P.3d 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, although\n   <em>\n    Armijo\n   </em>\n   suggests it will look to FLSA cases for guidance, it did not expressly adopt an opt-in or opt-out procedure in the case. Defendants nonetheless contend that New Mexico state trial courts have construed\n   <em>\n    Armijo\n   </em>\n   to mean that NMMWA collective actions must proceed as opt-in collective actions, like their FLSA counterparts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court need not decide whether the New Mexico appellate courts would interpret the NMMWA as requiring an opt-in procedure because, even assuming a judicially created opt-in requirement exists under the NMMWA, the Court concludes\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   that the opt-in collective action rule is procedural in nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Does the opt-in collective action requirement function to define the scope of the state-created right?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendants argue that the opt-in collective action requirement is part of New Mexico's framework for substantive rights or remedies because it \"substantively confers rights on employees to have their claims litigated only if they have affirmed their intent to be bound, and for employers the collective action provision affords the right not to be sued in representative actions by any employee who has not affirmatively chosen to sue.\" Defs.' Mot. 11, ECF No. 12. Defendants argue that, unlike the New York provision in\n   <em>\n    Shady Grove\n   </em>\n   , the collective action provision applies only to NMMWA cases, not more broadly to other law, demonstrating it is intertwined with NMMWA's substantive rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Unlike the New York law class action limitation at issue in\n   <em>\n    Shady Grove\n   </em>\n   , which was located in the procedural code and applied broadly to claims based on New York, federal, or other state laws, the \"collective action\" provision, and any judicially construed opt-in requirement, is limited to claims brought under the NMMWA. According to Justice Stevens' reasoning, the fact that the collective action opt-in requirement applies to NMMWA claims and is not a generally applicable procedural rule to other laws weighs more in favor of finding the right to be substantive. The Court, however, does not find this factor dispositive of the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The ad hoc two-step process for conditional certification and the opt-in requirement are the processes by which a similarly situated person joins in a collective action. Whether a similarly situated person must affirmatively act to join a suit or is automatically in the suit unless he opts out does not determine the substantive rights and remedies potentially available to that person. As such, an opt-in provision functions very differently from a state law provision restricting class actions, which more directly defines the scope of the state-created right. The Court finds the nature of the opt-in collective action rule more significant to the analysis than the fact that it is a process applied only in NMMWA cases. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the opt-in collective action requirement is not substantive in nature to the rights and remedies created by the NMMWA.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Knepper v. Rite Aid Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3751552\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/675/249/#p264\">\n    675 F.3d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 264-65 (3d Cir. 2012) (concluding, based on analysis of\n   <em>\n    Shady Grove\n   </em>\n   , that permitting opt-out class action for violation of state wage laws to proceed alongside separately-filed FLSA opt-in action does not violate Rules Enabling Act because regulation of class relief under \u00a7 216(b) is procedural);\n   <em>\n    Lindsay v. Government Employees Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3455474,6045778\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/416/\">\n    448 F.3d 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 424 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (describing the difference \"between the opt-in procedure under section 216(b) and the opt-out procedure under Rule 23(c)(2)(B)\" as \"a mere\n   <em>\n    procedural\n   </em>\n   difference\") (pre-\n   <em>\n    Shady Grove\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Furthermore, Justice Stevens also looked to legislative history and legislative intent. The fact that an opt-in requirement is not explicitly set forth in the NMMWA undermines the argument that legislators intended to define the scope of NMMWA substantive right through the opt-in procedural vehicle. Defendants have pointed to no legislative history in the adoption of the NMMWA that suggests a different result. The legislative silence indicates that an opt-in requirement is not so intertwined with the state right or remedy that it functions to define the scope of the right under the NMMWA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants have not satisfied the high bar for finding a Rules Enabling Act problem. The Court therefore concludes that Rule 23 and its opt-out notice provision apply to Plaintiff's NMMWA claim brought on behalf of himself and others similarly situated.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roberts v.

Utah Mar. 22, 2018) (holding that Rule 23's opt-out notice requirement applies to plaintiff's Utah Consumer Sales Practices Act (\"UCSPA\") claim, even though the UCSPA explicitly provided for opt-in notice, because the UCSPA \"establishes substantive consumer rights and corresponding remedies, but a potential UCSPA class member's entitlement to those rights do not change based on whether the process for joining a suit entails opt-in or opt-out notice of the proceeding\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Individual and Class Claims (\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 12\n   </strong>\n   ) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The only case to rely on\n    <em>\n     Pritzker\n    </em>\n    is a district court case from the Western District of Oklahoma, which Defendants cite in their reply and in which the court concluded the following allegations insufficient to state a claim: \"[f]or some time during his employment, [plaintiff] worked in excess of 50 to 60 hours a week\" and at all times his employer failed to pay overtime compensation.\n    <em>\n     Bradshaw v.
