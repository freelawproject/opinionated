COLLYER, United States District Judge\n   The Competitive Enterprise Institute, a public policy research and education organization, filed two identical Freedom of Information Act requests with the United States Department of the Treasury seeking all \"copies of any and all record(s) ... using the word 'carbon' which were produced, sent or received by the Office of the Deputy [sic] Sercretary for Environent and Energy [and the Office of Legislative Affairs] during 2012, from January 1, 2012 until the date you process this request.\" Abigail Demopulos Decl. [Dkt. 30-3] \u00b6 3. Dissatisfied with Treasury's response, CEI has sued. Treasury moves for summary judgment, which CEI opposes. For the reasons stated below, the Court will grant Treasury's motion in part and deny it in part. For a subset of records, Treasury will be required to produce further information concerning the \"deliberative\" nature of the proceedings for which it claims an exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On August 8, 2012, CEI sent two materially similar FOIA requests to two constituent components of Treasury: (1) the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Environment and Energy (Environment and Energy); and (2) the Office of Legislative Affairs (Legislative Affairs). Am. Compl. [Dkt. 8] \u00b6\u00b6 23, 24. These requests sought any and all records \"using the word 'carbon' \" produced, sent, or received between the offices during the calendar year 2012 up until the date the FOIA requests were processed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After negotiations, the parties agreed to limit CEI's search request to the following terms: \"carbon tax\"; \"carbon levy\"; \"carbon fee\"; \"carbon charge\"; \"carbon cap\"; \"price on carbon\"; and \"tax on carbon.\" Joint Status Report [Dkt. 15].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Using those search terms, Treasury electronically searched the hard drives, email accounts, and shared drives of all employees in Environment and Energy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Demopulos Decl. [Dkt. 30-3] \u00b6 7. This search located 4,163 pages of responsive records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Treasury also searched the hard drives, email accounts, and shared drives of employees in Legislative Affairs whose assigned responsibilities, as Treasury determined, made it likely the employee might have responsive records. Gail Harris-Berry Decl. [Dkt. 30-4] \u00b6 6. Treasury manually searched a number of PDF files whose format made electronic searching impossible. The combined searches in Legislative Affairs returned no unique, non-duplicative records when compared to the 4,163 located in Environment and Energy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. Of the 4,163 responsive pages, 2,464 pages were released, in whole or in part. Treasury withheld 1,699 pages in their entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   CEI filed its initial Complaint in this case on November 13, 2012, and filed an Amended Complaint November 27, 2012. After negotiations over search terms, searches, and production, Treasury moved for summary judgment on November 2, 2015. In a Minute Order dated July 1, 2015, the Court denied Treasury's initial motion for summary judgment and ordered Treasury to prepare a more detailed\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vaughn v.

Treasury has now filed a Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment [Dkt. 30] that includes a revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index.

Agency deliberations may be necessary to determine whether it has authority to promulgate a particular tax or policy. Even if CEI correctly describes Treasury's authority, the need for staff to speak candidly and confidentially is perhaps most important when the discussion concerns unmapped and unexplored terrain at the border of agency authority. The Court cannot conclude, based on CEI's submissions, that Treasury is categorically unable to assert Exemption 5 for records that discuss a carbon tax.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    The remaining issues concern CEI's objections to the adequacy of Treasury's\n    <em>\n     Vaughn\n    </em>\n    Index.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Vaughn\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3592114,238373\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/484/820/\">\n     484 F.2d at 826\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The question, then, is not whether an agency's\n    <em>\n     Vaughn\n    </em>\n    Index is flawless, but rather whether the agency has \"supplied the [Court] with sufficient information to allow [it] to make a reasoned determination that [the agency was] correct.\"\n    <em>\n     Coastal States Gas Corp. v.

CEI objects that Treasury \"fails to list all senders and recipients of withheld documents, rendering its withholdings facially inadequate.\" Opp'n at 2. Similarly, CEI objects to certain withheld records on the grounds that Treasury has not established that such records are actually \"intra\" or \"inter-agency\" records. Because Treasury has not identified all senders and recipients, CEI argues, it is impossible to determine whether some of these records actually reflect the kind of \"internal deliberations\" Exemption 5 is meant to exempt.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Such omissions are not as problematic as CEI contends. Treasury has submitted supporting affidavits that attest to the fact that such communications were intra- or inter-agency.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Demopulos Decl. \u00b6 11 (\"In all cases, exemption (b)(5) was applied solely to intra-agency or intra-governmental communications; none of these communications\n    [was] with third parties outside of the federal government.\"). These declarations are entitled to a presumption of good faith and CEI has not given any reason to question that presumption here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    CEI next complains that Treasury based its claims of deliberative process privilege on \"vague, boilerplate\" language, and \"unjustifiably withholds documents without tying them to policy at all.\" Opp'n at 9, 26. CEI's arguments here raise some greater concerns. Treasury is correct in asserting that an agency need not \"identify a specific decision in connection with which a memorandum is prepared.\"\n    <em>\n     NLRB v.

However, that exception simply acknowledges the reality that not every deliberative agency action will result in a definable agency decision, nor will every agency employee know ahead of time which of his statements will result in a decision.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Access Reports v.

At the time of writing the author could not know whether the decisionmaking process would lead to a clear decision, establishing the privilege, or fizzle, defeating it.\"). The fact that information may be exempt from FOIA disclosure under Exemption 5 even if no specific \"decision\" resulted does not mean that an agency is entitled to withhold otherwise non-exempt information to identify a specific decision or policy determination that is known.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    However, for the most part Treasury's\n    <em>\n     Vaughn\n    </em>\n    Index provides sufficient information to allow the Court to find that it properly claimed applicability of Exemption 5. For example, Treasury withheld a large number of \"draft memorand[a] consist[ing] of [a] policy proposal that was prepared at staff level and was never finalized,\" as well as email discussions of those drafts.\n    <em>\n     See Vaughn\n    </em>\n    Index [Dkt. 29-1] at 1. This description makes clear that agency staff were sharing their individual views concerning a predecisional agency action in a deliberative process.
