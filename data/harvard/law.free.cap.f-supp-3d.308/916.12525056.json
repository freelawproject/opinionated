Plaintiffs seek payment of response costs arising from investigation and cleanup of contamination at Plaintiffs' refineries, contending that the United States exercised control over the refineries before and during World War II. Am. Compl., ECF No. 1. Plaintiffs did not initially serve the Complaint on Defendant, but filed an Amended Complaint on July 5, 2017, which was served on Defendant. Am.

Corp. Aff., ECF No. 5. Plaintiffs collectively own twelve refinery sites (the Sites) located in Michigan, Oklahoma, Kansas, Tennessee, Illinois, Texas, and California. With one exception, Plaintiffs did not own the refineries during WWII, but acquired the refineries afterward. Plaintiffs allege that before and during WWII, the Government controlled the operations of the refining industry. Am. Compl. at 5. Pursuant to Executive Order 9276, President Roosevelt established the Petroleum Administration for War (PAW), and vested PAW with broad discretionary authority to carry out the national plans, policies, and objectives for the petroleum industry.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. The PAW divided the nation into districts, and implemented the national policy at a regional and refinery level by orders and directives controlling operations and refinery yields.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8. The executive order provides, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   There is established a Petroleum Administration for War, at the head of which shall be a Petroleum Administrator who shall be directly responsible to the President ... The Administrator shall: a. Subject to the provisions of this order, establish basic policies and formulate plans and programs to assure for the prosecution of the war the conservation and most effective development and utilization of petroleum in the United States and its territories and possessions, issue necessary policy and operating directives to parties engaged in the petroleum industry ... c. (1) Obtain from the Departments of War and the Navy, the Office of Lend-Lease Administration, the Department of State and the Board of Economic Warfare, the several divisions and branches of the War Production Board, and such other Federal departments and agencies as may be appropriate, estimates of the amounts of petroleum which will be required from the United States, its territories and possessions, to meet direct and indirect military, and essential industrial and civilian, requirements; and compile and analyze such estimates and submit them to the War Production Board with recommendations for the allocation of petroleum to meet such requirements. (2) Prepare and recommend to the War Production Board estimates of the quantities and kinds of material needed by the petroleum industry to produce, refine, store, distribute (excluding transportation), or otherwise make available the amount of petroleum recommended by the Administrator for allocation by the War Production Board.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Exec. Order No. 9276, 7 FR 100912 (1942).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In their common allegations of fact, Plaintiffs allege that PAW proceeded to operate the nation's refineries by directing and controlling, at the refinery level: \"(i) the allocation-by time and amount-of crude oil and other feed stocks ...; (ii) the procurement priorities to obtain services, equipment and parts ...; (iii) the types and specifications of war-related products to be manufactured; (iv) the levels of production for each of those products; (v) the price of the products and profits made; and (vi) to whom the products would be\n   sold within the Government-controlled supply chain.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Plaintiffs allege that by serving as the \"de facto operator\" of the refineries, the Government released hazardous wastes into the environment and disposed, or intentionally arranged for the disposal, of hazardous waste streams into the environment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. Plaintiffs also allege that the Government specifically exercised control over the hazardous waste management process itself by controlling approval of war-time construction projects, denying approval for some projects \"relating to pollution control that were deemed non-essential to the war effort\" while approving other projects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   With respect to specific refineries, Plaintiffs allege that the Government controlled day-to-day operations at each refinery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31, 38, 46, 54, 62, 65, 70, 78, 85, 91, 101, 115, 121. Plaintiffs' amended complaint further alleges that the Government's control of all inputs and outputs necessarily impacted the hazardous waste profile of their refineries. For example, at eight of the twelve refineries, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant dictated that the refineries would be allocated \"sour\" crude, whereas the refineries were only equipped to process \"sweet\" crude.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32, 39, 47, 55, 63, 71, 79, 86. \"Due to its higher sulfur content, sour crude was highly corrosive and caused leaks and other problem in equipment that was designed at the time to process sweet crude oil.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Government also controlled the outputs, and issued directives prohibiting refineries from manufacturing certain products (such as civilian gasoline), and specifically directing them to manufacture other products such as kerosene, 100-octane aviation gas (avgas), avgas components (i.e. codimer), 80-octane all-purpose gasoline, and 7-0-2 Navy diesel, among others.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 87, 93, 102, 116, 122. The Government also \"oversaw\" or \"dictated\" the amount and type of wastes generated and released at each refinery and tracked these production loss statistics.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35, 43, 51, 59, 67, 75, 82, 89, 98, 118, 124. Refinery operations and/or facilities had to be converted to accommodate the Government's demands.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33, 41, 49, 57, 65, 73, 80, 88, 96, 107, 117.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In sum, the Government did everything other than \"manually turn the levers and valves.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. Thus, Plaintiffs contend that the level of control exercised by PAW was \"well beyond the Government's regulatory role,\" and that the Government is appropriately responsible as an operator and as an arranger under CERCLA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. As such, Plaintiffs contend the Government must pay its share of response costs that Plaintiffs have incurred and continue to incur to dispose of hazardous waste arising from the Government's operation of their refineries during the wartime period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs' first claim for relief seeks response cost recovery under CERCLA section 107(a), codified at 42 U.S.C. 9607(a). Plaintiffs assert a second claim for relief arising under CERCLA section 113(g)(2), codified at 42 U.S.C. 9613(g)(2), and the declaratory judgment act, 28 U.S.C. 2201(a), seeking a declaratory determination binding the Defendant in subsequent actions to pay response costs or damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' allegations regarding wartime regulatory authority do not state a claim for operator liability at 11 of the 12 refineries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mot. at 10-11. Defendant characterizes the Government's\n   control over petroleum inputs, products, prices, and purchasers as \"general procurement activities\" insufficient to give rise to operator liability under CERCLA. Mot. at 12-14. Defendant contends that Plaintiffs' remaining allegations concerning the Government's control over hazardous waste generation, release, and disposal are conclusory and not entitled to a presumption of truth because they require an unsupported inferential leap.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-16. Defendant argues that Plaintiffs have not specifically alleged that the Government \"manage[d], direct[ed], or conduct[ed] ... operations having to do with leakage or disposal of hazardous waste, or decisions about compliance with environmental regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 (citing\n   <em>\n    Bestfoods\n   </em>\n   , 524 U.S. at 61,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181373\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/51/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant further contends that Plaintiffs have failed to allege a nexus between the alleged control exercised by the Government and the hazardous waste released at each refinery.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181373\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/51/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant also argues that Plaintiffs have not stated a claim for arranger liability, as Plaintiffs have not alleged that the Government owned or possessed hazardous waste, nor have Plaintiffs alleged that the Government took intentional steps to dispose of hazardous waste.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-21. Finally, Defendant contends that Plaintiffs have not pled facts demonstrating that the costs incurred are necessary and consistent with the national contingency plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the allegations of pervasive Government control over refinery operations including inputs, outputs, prices, and purchasers, are all that is required to state a claim for operator liability. Resp. at 9. Plaintiffs contend those allegations, taken as true, show that the Government managed, directed, and controlled operations having to do with pollution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs argue that they have gone above and beyond their pleading requirement by further alleging: 1) that Government-controlled operations utilized equipment and processes that leaked hazardous waste, 2) that the Government tracked losses and maintained authority over construction projects, 3) that the Government directed immediate changes to refinery yields, altering waste profiles at the refineries, and 4) that the Government allocated corrosive \"sour crude\" which the refineries were not equipped to process, further contributing to the waste profile of the refineries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Plaintiffs question Defendant's reliance on the\n   <em>\n    Exxon\n   </em>\n   case from the Southern District of Texas, which Plaintiffs argue imposes a new requirement of \"day-to-day\" decision making regarding waste disposal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18. Plaintiffs argue that this is inconsistent with the standard set forth by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Bestfoods\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the Government is also an arranger based on its \"constructive possession\" of waste in its control.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20. Plaintiffs contend that the Government's \"final review, approval, and authorization of plans submitted by the Refineries for equipment and process designs that necessarily included waste disposal\" support an inference that the Government intended and planned for the disposal of wastes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. Finally, with respect to cost necessity and compliance with the national contingency plan, Plaintiffs argue that this is a fact intensive inquiry which, under applicable law, is neither a matter to be considered at the 12(b)(6) stage nor is it an element of Plaintiffs' prima facie case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"To establish a prima facie case for cost recovery under \u00a7 107(a), a plaintiff must prove four elements: (1) the site is a \"facility\"; (2) a release or threatened release of hazardous substance has occurred; (3) the release has caused the plaintiff to\n   incur \"necessary costs of response\" consistent with the NCP; and (4) the defendant falls within one of the four categories of potentially responsible parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Franklin Cty.

(emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Much of the dicta from\n   <em>\n    Exxon\n   </em>\n   also reveals that the court was applying a novel standard altogether: \"the Government's role focused on allocating scarce materials, not on deciding\n   <em>\n    whether, when, or how\n   </em>\n   Exxon's predecessors should dispose of wastes at either facility.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 528. This reveals that\n   <em>\n    Exxon\n   </em>\n   based its decision in part on an overly restrictive view of the type of control required by CERCLA and\n   <em>\n    Bestfoods\n   </em>\n   , one which this Court declines to adopt. CERCLA imposes liability on any person who operates a facility at which hazardous substances are \"disposed\" of.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209607\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). The\n   <em>\n    Exxon\n   </em>\n   court clearly regarded \"disposal\" as an intentional task akin to remediation; i.e. the processes by which an operator ameliorates the pollution generated at its facilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The statute, however, does not adopt such a restrictive definition. CERCLA's definition of \"disposal\" borrows from the Solid Waste Disposal Act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n    42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 9601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (29). The Solid Waste Disposal Act, in turn, defines \"disposal\" as \"discharge, deposit, injection, dumping,\n   <em>\n    spilling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    leaking\n   </em>\n   , or placing of any solid waste or hazardous waste into or on any land or water so that such solid waste or hazardous waste or any constituent thereof may enter the environment or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters, including ground waters.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206903\">\n    42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3) (emphasis added). Thus, \"disposal\" includes both intentional activities such as \"depositing,\" \"dumping,\" and \"placing\" waste, as well as unintentional activities such as \"spilling,\" and \"leaking\" waste. This undermines any notion that operator liability is limited to intentional decision making concerning \"whether, when, and how\" waste is disposed of. Spilling and leaking can occur regardless of whether an operator \"decides\" it will happen or is even aware of its occurrence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Nor does\n   <em>\n    Bestfoods\n   </em>\n   support\n   <em>\n    Exxon's\n   </em>\n   notion that intentional decision making concerning the \"whether, when, and how\" of waste disposal is a requirement for operator liability. Rather,\n   <em>\n    Bestfoods\n   </em>\n   provides that control over operations \"having to do with leakage or disposal of hazardous wastes,\" gives rise to operator liability.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Furthermore, the \"decision making\" requirement\n   <em>\n    Exxon\n   </em>\n   identifies maps onto the second avenue for liability recognized by the\n   <em>\n    Bestfoods\n   </em>\n   definition of \"operator\", namely \"decisions about compliance with environmental regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    Bestfoods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181373\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/51/\">\n    524 U.S. at 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181373\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/51/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   No such decision making requirement attaches to the first avenue for liability identified by\n   <em>\n    Bestfoods\n   </em>\n   , namely managing, directing, or conducting \"operating having to do with leakage or disposal of hazardous waste.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181373\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/51/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Bestfoods\n   </em>\n   \"employed broad, passive language\" here.\n   <em>\n    Litgo New Jersey Inc. v.

This requirement is misplaced in the context of\n   <em>\n    operator liability.\n   </em>\n   Rather, this requirement is much more closely associated with\n   <em>\n    arranger liability\n   </em>\n   , which attaches to a party who has \"\n   <em>\n    some intent to make preparations for the disposal of hazardous waste\n   </em>\n   ...\"\n   <em>\n    GenCorp, Inc. v.

CERCLA sets forth operator liability and arranger liability as two independent avenues for a person/entity to be found liable for waste remediation costs. In order to give effect to that statutory intent, it is important to interpret those two avenues so as to give each of them independent meaning, and not to blur their requirements together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Statutory intent also weighs in favor of rejecting\n   <em>\n    Exxon's\n   </em>\n   formulation of the operator liability standard. Imposing operator liability only where the Government exercises specific, intentional control over the time, manner, and method of waste remediation is inconsistent with the purpose of the statute. Such a focus would reward the Government for deliberate indifference or ambivalence to waste remediation matters. This would enable them to control production activities of polluting facilities with impunity, resulting in waste generation and leakage. Under\n   <em>\n    Exxon's\n   </em>\n   standard, they would nonetheless be absolved of operator liability so long as they take no position on whether or how any efforts are undertaken at those facilities to ameliorate the waste. Such a standard would undermine, rather than advance, CERCLA's goal of holding responsible parties strictly liable for remediation of hazardous substances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CPC Int'l, Inc. v. Aerojet-Gen. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7398056\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/731/783/#p791\">\n    731 F.Supp. 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 791 (W.D. Mich. 1989). (\"by imposing strict liability on broad categories of Defendants, Congress also evidence its intent to make the responsible parties pay for the costs of the cleanup.\"). The remedial purpose of CERCLA encourages operators of facilities at which hazardous substances are generated to properly ameliorate that waste.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7398056\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/731/783/#p791\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"the purpose of CERCLA is certainly to encourage remedial and removal actions.\"). The failure to take any action with respect to that waste cannot be the very fact that absolves an entity of operator liability when that entity has otherwise asserted substantial control over production operations at polluting facilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In sum,\n   <em>\n    Bestfoods\n   </em>\n   did not explicitly disturb the holding of\n   <em>\n    FMC\n   </em>\n   . It did, however \"sharpen\" the definition of an \"operator\" for CERLCA purposes by focusing the \"actual control\" inquiry on control over \"operations having to do with leakage or disposal of hazardous waste, or decisions about compliance with environmental regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    Bestfoods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181373\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/51/\">\n    524 U.S. at 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181373\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/51/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The definition of \"operator\" offered by\n   <em>\n    Bestfoods\n   </em>\n   cannot be interpreted, as\n   <em>\n    Exxon\n   </em>\n   does, to transform the standard for operator liability into one that would be indistinguishable from arranger liability, and would be altogether inconsistent with CERCLA's text and remedial purpose. Nor should the definition of \"operator\" offered by\n   <em>\n    Bestfoods\n   </em>\n   be read in a vacuum. Rather, it should be considered\n   alongside other dicta from the opinion which help to elucidate the principles\n   <em>\n    Bestfoods\n   </em>\n   established:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   The question is not whether the parent operates the subsidiary, but rather whether it operates the facility,\n   <em>\n    and that operation is evidenced by participation in the activities of the facility\n   </em>\n   , not the subsidiary ....\n   <em>\n    The critical question is whether, in degree and detail, actions directed to the facility by an agent of the parent alone are eccentric under accepted norms of parental oversight of a subsidiary's facility.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   As explained above, Plaintiffs allege that the Government exercised an eccentric degree of control over the operations of their polluting facilities which extended to control over waste generation, leakage, and disposal. These allegations are sufficient to state a claim for operator liability. A key factual question in this case is whether and to what extent the Government's alleged control of inputs, outputs, conversion of facility operations, and constructions projects, was specifically brought to bear on operations having to do with leakage or disposal of hazardous waste. Another key question will be whether such coercive \"control\" existed at all, or whether the operations at Plaintiffs' polluting facilities were the result of voluntary contractual arrangements (as was the case in\n   <em>\n    Exxon\n   </em>\n   ). The answers to these questions must be developed during discovery. At the pleading stage, Plaintiffs need not provide exhaustive descriptions of every fact that might support operator liability. They have plead sufficient facts to support a reasonable inference that Defendant was an operator of their polluting facilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Plaintiffs have not stated a claim for arranger liability under \u00a7 107(a)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In contrast to operator liability, which attaches to any person who operates a facility at which hazardous substances were disposed of, arranger liability attaches to persons who specifically arrange for the disposal of that hazardous waste.

Notably, the court in\n   <em>\n    GenCorp\n   </em>\n   observed the following additional facts in support of its finding of arranger liability:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   the TDI Committee (whose membership included equal numbers of representatives from Olin and GenCorp) discussed TDI residue disposal; (2) GenCorp Committee members in particular researched and recommended waste disposal locations; (3) the TDI Committee approved methods to reduce the volume of waste sent offsite (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   to the Big D landfill) through capital improvements to the plant; and (4) Olin and GenCorp both funded research aimed at further reducing the volume of residue waste that needed to be disposed offsite.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.

Thus,\n   <em>\n    GenCorp\n   </em>\n   was intimately involved in decisions relating to specific waste disposal processes. The only allegation Plaintiffs make in the instant case concerning approval of design specifications or waste disposal processes is the allegation that the Government controlled approval of war-time construction projects, denying approval for some projects \"relating to pollution control that were deemed non-essential to the war effort.\" Am.

Even when coupled with Defendant's knowledge of the waste generated, this does not resemble the level of intentionality GenCorp exercised with respect to waste disposal plans and processes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   With respect to the \"possession\" or \"ownership\" requirement, Plaintiffs again cite to\n   <em>\n    GenCorp\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that constructive ownership or constructive possession is sufficient to support arranger liability. Resp. at 21. The\n   <em>\n    GenCorp\n   </em>\n   court found that GenCorp had constructive ownership and possession of the waste where it \"had an active interest in the facility through its option to buy the plant, secured by its 'earnest money'-its contribution of one half of the construction costs.\"\n   <em>\n    GenCorp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9140596\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/390/433/#p446\">\n    390 F.3d at 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court first noted that the counterclaimant had \"not alleged that it offered an opportunity for public comment or that its response resulted in a CERCLA-quality cleanup\" and further noted that \"[i]n recent years, several courts have dismissed CERCLA claims containing conclusory allegations of consistency with the NCP.\"\n   <em>\n    Hobart Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203773146\">\n    2017 WL 3773146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7.

After observing that initial investigation and monitoring costs need not comply with the NCP, the court observed as follows: \"There are, however, other pleading deficiencies that are not so easily overcome. As Plaintiffs note, DP &amp; L does not allege\n   <em>\n    why, when, or under what circumstances\n   </em>\n   it conducted its own groundwater sampling and monitoring ...\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203773146\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original).
