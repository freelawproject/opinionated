ST. EVE, District Court Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The present consolidated lawsuits are based on a tragic incident that took place at Defendant Northwestern Medicine Delnor Hospital (hereinafter \"Delnor Community Hospital\") in Geneva, Illinois, where a Kane County Correctional Officer lost control of pretrial detainee Tywon Salters, who then took nurses hostage at gunpoint and physically assaulted two of the nurses. After a three-hour hostage standoff, Kane County S.W.A.T team members shot and killed Salters. Four nurses, two of their husbands (\"Doe Plaintiffs\"), and two hospital patients, Victoria Weiland and Deanna Chrones (\"Patient Plaintiffs\"), have brought claims against Defendants Delnor Community Hospital, Kane County, Kane County Correctional Officer Shawn Loomis, and Apex3 Security based on their Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process right to bodily integrity and common law negligence pursuant to the Court's original and supplemental jurisdiction.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1367(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In particular, in their Second Amended Complaint, the Jane Doe Plaintiffs bring the following claims: (1) substantive due process against Defendant Loomis (Counts I, VII, XI, XIV); and (2) common law negligence against Apex3 Security (Counts III, IX, XII, XV). The John Doe Defendants bring loss of consortium claims based on their wives' substantive due process claims (Counts II and VIII) and common law negligence claims (Counts IV and X). The Doe Plaintiffs also bring indemnification claims against Kane County in the remaining counts pursuant to 745 ILCS 10/9-102. Similarly, in their First Amended Complaint, the Patient Plaintiffs bring: (1) a substantive due process claim against Defendant Loomis (Count I); (2) a negligence claim against Defendant Apex3 Security (Count II); and (3) a negligence claim against Defendant Delnor Community Hospital (Count III). The Patient Plaintiffs also bring an indemnification claim under 745 ILCS 10/9-102 against Kane County (Count IV).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Before the Court are Defendants' motions to dismiss brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). For the following reasons, the Court grants in part Defendant Kane County's motion to dismiss in relation to the John Doe constitutional loss of consortium claims alleged in Counts II and VIII of the Second Amended Complaint, along with the John Doe Plaintiffs' indemnification claims related to their constitutional loss of consortium in Counts VI and X. The Court denies the remainder of Defendant Kane County's motions to dismiss. Further, the Court denies Defendant Loomis' and Defendant Apex3 Security's motions to dismiss in their entirety. Last, the Court grants Defendant Delnor Community Hospital's motion to dismiss Count III of the Patient Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"A motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) challenges the viability of a complaint by arguing that it fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\"\n   <em>\n    Camasta v.

(R. 24, Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16; R. 57, First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.) Less than five months later, on March 11, 2017, law enforcement officers arrested Salters and booked him into the Kane County Jail on felony charges related to his receiving and possessing a stolen vehicle. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 17; First Am. Compl. \u00b6 13.) Based on Salters' violent past, the Kane County State's Attorney successfully argued against any bond reduction that would allow Salters out of custody. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 19.) At that time, Kane County Correctional Officers knew that Salters took medications for his mental conditions and that Salters was a member of the Black Disciple street gang. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15, 20; First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 7, 2017, while in custody, Salters ingested hydrogen peroxide, after which Kane County Correctional Officers transported him to Delnor Community Hospital, and once released, Kane County officials placed him on suicide watch at the Kane County Jail. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-23; First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.) The next day, Salters ingested a jail-issued sandal and liquid cleaner, and, once again, Kane County Correctional Officers transported him to Delnor Community Hospital for medical treatment. (Second Am.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 24-25, First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.) On May 9, 2017, the hospital transferred Salters to the medical-surgical unit on the third floor of the hospital where he stayed until the incident that took place on May 13, 2017. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26-27; First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.) Plaintiffs assert that during that time period, Kane County Correctional Officers were aware that Salters was combative, uncooperative, and manipulative. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 32; First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.) Further, Plaintiffs state that Kane County Correctional Officers, including Defendant Loomis, were aware that Salters was a flight risk and posed a serious danger to the hospital staff, nurses, and patients. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 33; First Am. Compl. \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that pursuant to the polices of the Kane County Sheriff's Office, Kane County Correctional Officers were required to protect hospital staff, nurses, and patients from Salters while he was at Delnor Community Hospital. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 42; First Am. Compl. \u00b6 37.) Also, armed Kane County Correctional Officers were to guard and maintain control over Salters at all times while he was a patient, including that Salters' leg was to remain shackled to his hospital bed. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 37-39; First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32-34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On May 8, 2017, while in the emergency room of Delnor Community Hospital, Salters asked to use the bathroom, at which time the Kane County Correctional Officer guarding him released Salters from his shackles, vacated the room, and left Salters alone with a nurse while he used the toilet. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 46; First Am. Compl. \u00b6 41.) The hospital notified the Kane County Sheriff's Office and Apex3 Security of this incident. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 46; First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 41-42.) On both May 11 and May 12, 2017, Correctional Officers unshackled Salters and allowed him to walk unrestricted through the hallways on the third floor of the hospital. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 51, 52; First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 47, 48.) Correctional Officers also allowed Salters' unrestricted use of the telephone in his hospital room. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 49; First Am. Compl. \u00b6 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On the morning of May 13, 2017, nurses observed Kane County Correctional Officers sitting in Salters' hospital room using their electronic devices while Salters was unshackled. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 53-54; First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.) Sometime thereafter, Correctional Officer Defendant Loomis began guarding Salters and removed Salters' leg shackle more than once so that Salters could use the toilet. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 57, 59; First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 51-52.) After unshackling Salters, Defendant Loomis did not restrain or shackle Salters after he used the bathroom. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 58, 60; First Am. Compl. \u00b6 53.) Instead, Defendant Loomis allowed Salters to remain unshackled and without any restraints in his hospital room for at least thirty minutes. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 62; First Am. Compl. \u00b6 53). Jane Doe III then entered Salters' hospital room and observed him sitting unrestrained on the side of his hospital bed, after which she asked Defendant Loomis why Salters was not restrained. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 61.) Defendant Loomis did not respond. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After Jane Doe III left, Salters grabbed Defendant Loomis' 9mm handgun and ran out of his hospital room onto the third floor despite Defendant Loomis' duty to protect and holster his firearm so that no one would be unable to gain access to it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 63-64; First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 43, 54-55.) Furthermore, Plaintiffs allege that after Defendant Loomis lost control of Salters, he did not protect or warn hospital staff, nurses, or patients. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 65-66; First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 56-57.) Rather, Plaintiffs\n   allege that Defendant Loomis ran from the situation and purposely hid in another hospital room. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 64; First Am. Compl. \u00b6 55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the meantime, Salters went to an office where he took Jane Doe I hostage, forced her to remove her clothes, threatened her, and physically and verbally abused her while holding her at gunpoint. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 67; First Am. Compl. \u00b6 58.) Jane Doe II then entered the office, at which time Salters took her hostage at gunpoint forcing her to go to a \"decontamination room\" on the first floor of the hospital. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 68, 69.) While forcing Jane Doe II at gunpoint, Jane Doe IV came upon Salters and Jane Doe II. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70.) Thereafter, Salters held Jane Doe II hostage in the decontamination room for over three hours at gunpoint, during which he repeatedly beat her, forced her to remove her clothes, violently raped her, threatened her life, and verbally abused her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.) For part of this time period, Jane Doe III was in close proximity to the hostage situation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In the interim, a standoff ensued between Salters and Kane County S.W.A.T. team members while Salters was holding Jane Doe II hostage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.) At approximately 4:00 p.m. on May 13, 2017, the S.W.A.T. team members shot and killed Salters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.) The bullet that struck and killed Salters also struck Jane Doe II. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After Defendant Loomis lost control of Salters, Patient Plaintiff Weiland was able to hear screams from staff members whom Salters was holding hostage and then she called 911. (First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 59, 61.) Plaintiff Weiland remained in her windowless room on the third floor of the hospital for over an hour without knowing any information about her safety. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.) Plaintiff Chrones was in a nearby hospital room on the third floor, could hear hostage negotiations, and had a direct line of sight to the S.W.A.T. team members-although hospital staff eventually moved her to another room during the standoff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61-63.) The Patient Plaintiffs assert that they have suffered post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of these events. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66.) Plaintiff Weiland specifically alleges that she has been afraid to return to any medical facilities since the hostage standoff and Plaintiff Chrones alleges that she has suffered health problems based on her anxiety resulting from the incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67, 68.) Similarly, the Jane Doe Plaintiffs allege that they suffered emotional, as well as physical injuries, as a result of the hostage situation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 79, 87, Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 83, 93, 111, 121, 139, 147, 160, 168.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs further contend that during the relevant time period, Defendant Apex3 Security was a private Illinois security company responsible for the safety, security, and well-being of Delnor Community Hospital's staff and patients. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 34; First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.) Specifically, Delnor Community Hospital hired Apex3 Security to provide security for those on the hospital's premises. (First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26, 27.) According to Plaintiffs, Apex3 Security voluntarily provided security measures for those who were lawfully on the premises and was also tasked with monitoring inmates admitted to the hospital. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 35-36; First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.) As part of the contract with Delnor Community Hospital, Apex3 Security was to ensure that the Kane County Correctional Officers followed proper security protocols. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 36; First Am. Compl. \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Specifically-in the context of Defendant Loomis' awareness that Salters was combative, manipulative, a flight risk, and that he posed a serious danger to the hospital staff and patients-while guarding Salters, Defendant Loomis unshackled him on more than one occasion and allowed Salters to use the bathroom unshackled and unsupervised. After leaving Salters unrestrained for approximately thirty minutes, Salters grabbed Defendant Loomis' gun. At that point, Defendant Loomis lost control of Salters. Plaintiffs allege that thereafter Defendant Loomis ran from the situation and purposely hid in another hospital room. Based on these allegations, Defendant Loomis' affirmative conduct of unshackling Salters for a substantial period of time provided Salters with the opportunity to grab his 9mm handgun and escape. Thus, unlike the facts in\n   <em>\n    Buchanan-Moore\n   </em>\n   , Salters was in custody when he escaped, whereas the perpetrator of the crimes in\n   <em>\n    Buchanan-Moore\n   </em>\n   had been released from custody and was on the Milwaukee streets when he committed the violent crimes at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buchanan-Moore v.

Also, that Defendant Loomis was indifferent to Jane Doe III's question about Salters not being restrained and that Defendant Loomis failed to warn the hospital staff after he lost control of Salters does not vitiate Plaintiffs' allegations of Defendant Loomis' affirmative actions. In other words, Defendants' characterization of Defendant Loomis' conduct as merely \"standing by and doing nothing\" cannot prevail at this procedural posture where the Court construes all facts and reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs' favor. Moreover, the fact that other Kane County Correctional Officers unshackled Salters and left him unrestrained for periods of time does not make Defendant Loomis' affirmative actions any less egregious. As such, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that Defendant Loomis' affirmative actions propelled them into a danger that they would not have otherwise faced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    W.

Plaintiffs' allegations also reflect that the geography and range of the victims was small, mainly, nurses who had treated Salters and were in close proximity to Salters after Defendant Loomis lost control of him, as well as patients on the same floor as Salters-as opposed to the public at large. Therefore, unlike the facts in\n   <em>\n    Buchanan-Moore,\n   </em>\n   the range of potential victims and the particularized setting of the hospital do not amount to \"a generalized, amorphous zone of danger.\"\n   <em>\n    Buchanan-Moore,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3663785\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/570/824/#p825\">\n    570 F.3d at 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Illinois Appellate Court in\n   <em>\n    St. Mary of Nazereth\n   </em>\n   , however, did not hold as such. In fact, the Court could not find any legal authority supporting Apex3 Security's theory that only the County can be liable under the circumstances pursuant to the Illinois County Jail Act or otherwise. Apex3 Security's argument that \"[j]ust because an inmate like Salters is admitted to a hospital for emergency medical treatment, as required by federal and state law, does not mean that the hospital and its security staff voluntarily accepted or undertook any duty\" is also untethered from any legal authority.

Further, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Apex3 Security voluntarily contracted to monitor the detainees and inmates admitted to the hospital and to ensure that the Kane County Correctional Officers followed proper security protocols. Plaintiffs maintain that Apex3 Security was on notice that the Kane County Correctional Officers violated certain policies by leaving Salters unshackled and unattended on at least one occasion. These allegations-viewed in Plaintiffs' favor-plausibly state that Apex3 Security had a duty to protect Plaintiffs from harm, including Salters' criminal conduct, based\n   on Apex3 Security's voluntary undertaking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a complaint is plausible on its face when plaintiff alleges \"factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\").
