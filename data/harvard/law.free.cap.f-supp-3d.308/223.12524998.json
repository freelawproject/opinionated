Mehta, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Before the court is Plaintiff Congressional Hunger Center's Motion for Default Judgment against its former employee, Defendant Mohamed H. Gurey. Plaintiff brought this suit after discovering what it alleges was Defendant's years-long embezzlement scheme. Defendant was properly served but failed to respond to Plaintiff's three-count complaint. In response, Plaintiff obtained an entry of default and filed this Motion for Default Judgment, seeking damages in the amount of $1,202,334.00.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Clerk's Entry of Default as to Mohamed H. Gurey, Dec. 8, 2017; Mot. for Default J., ECF No. 10. The court now enters judgment in favor of Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Mohamed H. Gurey worked for Plaintiff Congressional Hunger Center for 15 years, most recently as Plaintiff's Director of Finance. Compl. \u00b6 4. His job duties included preparing Plaintiff's financial statements, monitoring payroll, preparing records for Plaintiff's annual audits, and overseeing Plaintiff's cash disbursements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. In addition, Defendant gave information to Plaintiff's executive director about the organization's finances, which, in turn, were used by Plaintiff's Board of Directors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After an organizational restructuring in 2012, Plaintiff's executive director was responsible for supervising Defendant.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-19. Beginning in September 2015, that position was held by Shannon Maynard.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. Soon after the start of her tenure, Maynard slimmed the organization's budget, including by eliminating the position of Payroll &amp; Benefits Coordinator and outsourcing financial duties to an outside vendor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. Defendant \"vocally opposed\" the outsourcing of Plaintiff's payroll operations and offered to perform those tasks himself.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Maynard agreed to assign these tasks to Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Maynard took leave from work from June 2016 to September 2016, during which time Defendant was supervised by Plaintiff's Chief Operating Officer, Kristin Anderson.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. When Maynard returned, she noticed problems with Defendant's work, including that he was failing to meet deadlines and had multiple, unexplained absences.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. When she met with Defendant on November 2, 2016, to discuss the organization's upcoming audit, Defendant told Maynard that he had not yet completed the necessary reports.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. After learning this, Maynard pushed back the audit to the second week of December.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At this same meeting, Defendant asked Maynard for 17 days of paid time off during the month of November-time off, he said, that he needed in order to complete courses that would allow him to maintain his Certified Public Accountant license.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. Maynard refused his request, explaining that the time off was too close to the audit and because Defendant had not given advance notice.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. Undeterred, Defendant called the Treasurer of the Board of Directors, Wolfgang von Maack, and asked permission to take leave.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. Plaintiff did not receive approval for his request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   About a week after Maynard's meeting with Defendant, on November 10, 2016, she met with Defendant for his annual performance review, in which she gave Defendant a critical evaluation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. In the review, Maynard identified as areas of improvement the timeliness of Defendant's quarterly and monthly financial reports.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On November 14, 2016, Maynard gave Defendant a \"Warning and Performance Improvement Plan,\" which reflected those deficiencies and contained a list of key tasks to be performed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant failed to show up for work on December 7, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. Later that day, Maynard found in her company mailbox a letter from Defendant in which he \"requested\" vacation time from December 7 to December 15.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. In the letter, Defendant said he planned to return on December 16 to assist with the audit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Maynard decided to fire Defendant for taking leave without permission.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff discovered Defendant's theft of organization funds when cutting off Defendant's access to its bank accounts.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. When Maynard logged into the accounts to deactivate Defendant, she discovered that the balances were \"dramatically lower\" than that reported on a financial statement Defendant had prepared.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Per Defendant's report to Maynard, Plaintiff, as of November 23, 2016, had $715,252 on hand.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In actuality, the accounts contained only $137,526-not even enough money to cover the organization's expenses for December.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The discovery spurred a review of Plaintiff's financial records. When reviewing the organization's transactions in 2015 and 2016, Maynard discovered \"a number of suspicious checks,\" made out to Defendant, of amounts of more than $1,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. At the time, the Plaintiff's accounting policies required that any check for more than $1,000 be signed by two members of the\n   organization, either Anderson and Defendant or Anderson and Maynard.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. The checks to Defendant all bore Defendant's signature and Anderson's signature.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. Anderson's signature, however, was determined to be forged.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The checks were dated on days when Anderson was on leave, and Anderson confirmed that she had not signed them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-41. In an investigation that followed, Plaintiff discovered Defendant had been writing unauthorized checks to himself since 2010 by forging the signature of other organization signatories.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ultimately, Plaintiff's investigation revealed that Defendant had stolen more than $1,100,000 from the organization.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In addition to forging checks, Defendant also had made repeated withdrawals of organization funds at a Maryland casino, using his company debit card.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42-43. To cover his tracks, Defendant falsified entries in documents and failed to record transactions.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54, 56. Defendant's theft also jeopardized Plaintiff's financial standing with lenders. The organization was unable to repay a line of credit it had previously opened by the maturity date of February 1, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49-53. To avoid default, Defendant had to renegotiate the terms of the line of credit, resulting in additional costs to Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This action followed. On November 8, 2017, Plaintiff filed a three-count complaint against Defendant alleging: (1) breach of fiduciary duty; (2) conversion; and (3) fraud.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57-74. Plaintiff claimed that it had lost more than $1.1 million as a result of Defendant's actions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62, 67, 74. Plaintiff served Defendant with the Complaint on November 14, 2017, but he never filed a responsive pleading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Return of Service/Affidavit of Summons &amp;Complaint Executed, ECF No. 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(1)(A)(i). In turn, Plaintiff sought and received from the Clerk of the Court an entry of default against Defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Clerk's Entry of Default, ECF No. 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On January 19, 2018, Plaintiff filed the Motion for Default Judgment that is now before the court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. for Default J., ECF No. 10. Defendant has not responded to the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Rule 55 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure sets forth the two-step process by which a party can secure a default judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a). First, the plaintiff must ask the Clerk of the Court to enter a default against a party who has \"failed to plead or otherwise defend\" itself against the action. Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a). After the entry of default has been entered on the docket, the plaintiff must move for an entry of default judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b). District courts have discretion to enter a default judgment upon a party's motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2). Such motions may be granted \"only when the adversary process has been halted because of an essentially unresponsive party.\"\n   <em>\n    Boland v.

Whether an Entry of Default Judgment is Appropriate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The court begins with examining whether Defendant is liable to Plaintiff and, thus, whether an entry of default judgment is appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that the facts alleged in Plaintiff's Complaint, when taken as true, sufficiently support Plaintiff's claims. Plaintiff therefore is entitled to a default judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff's first claim alleges that Defendant breached the fiduciary duty he owed to his employer, Plaintiff. To state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under District of Columbia law, a plaintiff \"must allege facts sufficient to show (1) the existence of a fiduciary relationship; (2) a breach of the duties associated with the fiduciary relationship; and (3) injuries that were proximately caused by the breach of the fiduciary duties.\"\n   <em>\n    Kemp v.

A defendant is liable for conversion if the plaintiff shows that he \"participated in (1) an unlawful exercise, (2) of ownership, dominion, or control, (3) over the personal property of another, (4) in denial or repudiation of that person's rights thereto.\"\n   <em>\n    Gov't of Rwanda v.

To support its damages claim, Plaintiff provides declarations from Anderson and Maynard; copies of Plaintiff's monthly bank statements between August and December 2016; and copies of the cancelled checks that Defendant forged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot., Attach. 1, ECF No. 10-2 [hereinafter Anderson Decl.]; Pl.'s Mot., Attach. 2, ECF No. 10-3 [hereinafter Maynard Decl.]; Maynard Decl., Ex. 2, ECF No. 10-5 [hereinafter Pl.'s Checks]; Maynard\n   Decl., Ex. 3, ECF No. 10-6 [hereinafter Pl.'s Bank Statements].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The declarations and attachments substantiate Plaintiff's claimed losses. First, Maynard identifies 98 cancelled checks, totaling $1,050,489.80, as the checks that Defendant wrote to himself, without authorization.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maynard Decl. at 4-9; Pl.'s Checks. Anderson states that 58 of the checks contain her forged signature,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Anderson Decl. at 3-6; the other 40 checks contain the forged signatures of two former employees who were check signatories for the organization,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Maynard Decl. at 3-4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Checks. Copies of these checks corroborate Maynard's and Anderson's statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Checks. In addition, Maynard identifies 36 different transactions involving the use of Plaintiff's organization debit card, totaling $151,844.04, which she states were unauthorized. Maynard Decl. at 9-11. Plaintiff's monthly bank statements reflect those transactions, all of which took place between August and December 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Bank Statements. Thus, the court is satisfied that Plaintiff has proven its claimed damages of $1,202,334.00 \"to a reasonable certainty.\"\n   <em>\n    Boland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186161\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/763/64/#p67\">\n    763 F.Supp.2d at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
