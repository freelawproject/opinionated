Kentucky has two federal districts, comprising ten different dockets, but the Government specifically asks this Court to transfer the case to Frankfort, which has only one judge.

The Enrollees challenge the approval of Kentucky HEALTH, which has an obvious connection to that state. But it mischaracterizes their case to assert that their \"\n   <em>\n    sole\n   </em>\n   interest in this matter arises solely from their residency in the Commonwealth and their enrollment in Kentucky's State Medicaid program.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4127027\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/58/2/#p6\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4127027\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/58/2/#p6\">\n    at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). In addition to mentioning Kentucky HEALTH, Plaintiffs argue that CMS's letter to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   state Medicaid Directors supporting and encouraging Section 1115 waivers with a work-eligibility requirement violated the APA. This is not a case where the agency only rubber-stamped a proposal from its local office. On the contrary, D.C.-based agency officials drafted, signed, and disseminated the letter to state Medicaid directors, and those same agencies worked with Kentucky to develop, and ultimately approve, Kentucky HEALTH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendants' selective citation only buttresses this point.

Medicaid is a cooperative program between federal and state governments. A challenge to HHS's decision to approve a state plan is thus almost always predicated on events that had their genesis in a state. To buy Defendants' argument would mean that Medicaid challenges only belong in courts of the relevant state. That simply is not so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Not only did the claims arise here, but they also have a strong nexus to D.C.

The Government cannot reasonably claim to be inconvenienced by litigating in this district; after all, this is its home forum. Defendants nevertheless argue that this factor should lean towards transfer because Kentucky would be a more convenient forum to decide whether to certify a class.

If anything, this Court has more experience with APA cases, which would weigh against transfer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tuttle v.

The caseload disparity between the two courts, moreover, is not great enough to have an effect on the transfer analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Transfer at 22 n.9 (noting pending cases per judge is 382 in Kentucky versus 263 in the District). Absent a showing that either court's docket is \"substantially more congested\" than the other, this factor weighs neither for nor against transfer.\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Ass'n of Home Builders v.

Local Interest\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   This brings the Court to the final and arguably \"most important\" of the public-interest factors: the local interest in having local controversies decided at home.\n   <em>\n    Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance v.

Because the Court finds that this a case of national, rather than local, significance, this factor tips sharply against transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendants first mention that their preferred forum is \"experienced with the laws in the Commonwealth that may be relevant to the review of Plaintiffs' claims,\" Mot. to Transfer at 22, but a federal court need not wade into any particulars of state law to decide whether the Secretary can, under federal laws and regulations, permit certain state Medicaid proposals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilderness Soc'y\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11202411\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/104/10/#p13\">\n    104 F.Supp.2d at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"no reason to transfer\" case challenging agency decision to start oil and gas leasing because it would not involve state law).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Government's stronger argument is that \"Kentucky has a substantial interest in the resolution of the claims of this lawsuit\" because it is \"the citizens of Kentucky who will directly feel the effects of\" Kentucky HEALTH.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Transfer at 17. The central question, however, is not \"whether the\n   <em>\n    people of [Kentucky]\n   </em>\n   have an interest-even a strong one-in the outcome of this case. Instead, the Court must determine whether this is a 'question[ ] of national policy or national significance.' \"\n   <em>\n    Oceana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4127027\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/58/2/#p6\">\n    58 F.Supp.3d at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Oceana v.

While this suit has an undeniable connection to Kentucky and may affect the lives of many people there, it also carries national consequences, particularly in light of CMS's invitation to other states to use Section 1115 waivers in a similar way. Indeed, Plaintiffs ask the Court to enjoin not only Kentucky HEALTH but also all \"practices purportedly authorized by\" the letter to state Medicaid Directors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 76. In other words, the Enrollees' challenge to the Secretary's use of Section 1115 waivers has \"potential impacts\" that will likely be felt \"locally\" in Kentucky, but also broadly across the nation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Transfer at 20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Preservation Soc'y\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277935\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/893/49/#p53\">\n    893 F.Supp.2d at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"a facial attack on the statutes and regulations at issue ... might have the kind of national impact that would weigh against transfer\" but declining to reach issue because plaintiffs only challenged decision made by local agency office) (emphasis omitted). Those effects are already spilling out past Kentucky, as several other states have similar waiver applications pending, and the Secretary recently approved Indiana's work-eligibility Medicaid requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendants' reliance on cases where a\n   <em>\n    local\n   </em>\n   federal-agency office made a decision involving local resources that are located entirely in a proposed transferee district does not change the outcome.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Transfer at 20-21 (citing cases);\n   <em>\n    Preservation Soc'y\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277935\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/893/49/#p53\">\n    893 F.Supp.2d at 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding challenge was local controversy because \"a clear majority of the events took place within the District of South Carolina,\" and \"challenged action was taken by Charleston District of the [U.S. Army] Corps\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    Airport Working Grp. of Orange Cty., Inc. v.
