The complaint lists the defendants as \"U.S. White House, U.S. Secret Service White House Police, Police Officer Adelsperger Badge # 0572\" and \"Second District Police, Station Property Unit,\" and it demands a judgment of $190,000,000 [Dkt. # 1-1 at 2]. The United States Secret Service removed the case to this court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201442\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and 1446.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Not. of Removal [Dkt. # 1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending are the Secret Service's motion to dismiss [Dkt. # 7] and plaintiff's motion for a writ of attachment [Dkt. # 9]. Although plaintiff was informed about the negative consequences of failing to respond to a motion to dismiss,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Nov. 17, 2017 Order, he has not filed an opposition. In support of dismissal, the Secret Service asserts (1) that plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), and (2) that the remainder of the complaint is \"legally incoherent.\" Mot. at 1. Failure to exhaust a claim under the FTCA is a jurisdictional defect. So, for the reasons explained below, the Court will grant the Secret Service's motion, deny plaintiff's motion, and dismiss this case without prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the Complaint filed on May 1, 2017 [Dkt. # 1-1 at 2], plaintiff alleges in a single paragraph that when defendant Adelsperger asked him \"for ID for the Law Enforcement Holy War Special Agent Shield\" he was wearing, he gave the officer \"all the ID he needed\" but was arrested nonetheless on a misdemeanor charge of impersonating a police officer, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-1406\">\n    D.C.

Plaintiff's shield and ID were taken \"for evidence.\" He \"was released the next day, no charges.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The arrest report attached to defendant's motion identifies the arresting officer as Aaron Adelsperger of the U.S. Secret Service, adds that the incident occurred on April 28, 2017, \"in close vicinity to the White House,\" and confirms that no charges were filed against plaintiff.
