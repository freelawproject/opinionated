The government alleges these photographs show the existence of a prostitution conspiracy between A.A. and Mr. Brown. The government asserts that the messages are between A.A. and Mr. Brown and between A.A. and the undercover police officer who was posing as a customer of A.A. Mr. Brown objects, claiming that the text messages contain impermissible hearsay to which there is no exception, that their introduction would violate his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, and that they are otherwise not authenticated. The government responds by asserting that the photographs of the text messages are not hearsay because Mr. Brown's coconspirator made them during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Thus, the text messages authored by A.A.-to both the undercover agent and Mr. Brown-are not hearsay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The text messages authored by the undercover agent to A.A., however, may or may not be hearsay. The undercover agent is not a coconspirator, making Rule 801(d)(2)(E) unavailable to admit his messages directly. Nevertheless, certain of the undercover agent's messages may be admissible if it is shown that a coconspirator-A. A.-adopted the undercover officer's statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Therefore, Defendant's Motion in Limine to Exclude Photographs of Text Messages (ECF No. 70) is DENIED as stated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Previous Backpage.com Postings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Mr. Brown seeks to exclude an assortment of Backpage.com posts from June through September 2015, six to nine months before the incident alleged in the indictment. Mr. Brown asserts that these ads are irrelevant under Rule 401, unfairly prejudicial under Rule 403, and represent impermissible character evidence under Rule 404(b). The government counters that this evidence is \"intrinsic to the crime\" charged and therefore admissible, and that it is not impermissible under Rule 404(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Moreover, it is not permissible Rule 404(b) evidence because this remote evidence does not have a \"special relevance\" to any issue to be decided in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

It argues that the only possible ground for admitting the transcript would be as a prior inconsistent statement, and that the text messages and her statement are consistent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The transcript, or portions of it, may be admissible under either Rule 106 or 806, but the Court cannot make that determination pretrial. If the evidence is such that the transcript \"in fairness ought to be considered at the same time,\" then it will be admissible under Rule 106. If the transcript\n   presents evidence that tends to attack the credibility of A.A. or proves to be inconsistent with a matter presented at trial concerning A.A., then the transcript will be admissible under Rule 806.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Therefore, the government's Motion in Limine to Exclude A.A.'s Statement (ECF No. 80) is DENIED as stated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Photographs of Mr. Brown with A.A. and Another\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Mr. Brown objects to the government's introduction of a photograph showing Mr. Brown with A.A. and another woman. The government seeks to introduce the photograph to show that Mr. Brown knew A.A. Mr. Brown objects, asserting that the photograph would play into racial stereotyping about African American men as \"sexual exploiters\" of white women, and thus, would be unfairly prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Federal Rule of Evidence 403 allows the Court to \"exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury ... or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\" The photograph here is unfairly prejudicial to Mr. Brown because of its sexualized and potentially racial nature. The government has charged him with a crime that involves sex and the photograph could inappropriately prejudice him on this topic. Moreover, the government has other non-prejudicial ways of proving its assertion that Mr. Brown and A.A. knew each other, including testimony from police officers that the officers saw them in the car together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Therefore, Defendant's Motion in Limine to Exclude Photographs of A.A. with Another (ECF No. 75) is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    More Specific Response From the Government\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Mr. Brown asks the government to be more specific in its identification of certain items of evidence.

The government again did not respond within the time ordered by the Court. On December 8, 2016,\n   fifty-two days after Mr. Brown's first request for discovery, \"the government made the first of many discovery disclosures to the defendant through DOJ's cloud-based platform.\" ECF No. 84 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   After the Court sent out its first trial notice (ECF No. 12), Mr. Brown requested a continuance (ECF No. 13), in part to allow \"additional time ... to confer with the government following the defense's review [of] the discovery.\" The Court granted this request as well as subsequent requests the following two months.

ECF Nos. 52, 56, 59, 62. On February 9, 2018, the Court sent out a trial notice notifying the parties that trial would begin in March 2018. ECF No. 67;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Text Order, Feb. 28, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   At some point, the government learned that Detective Grasso was unavailable to testify at trial, and it had Cranston Detective William Palmer reimage Mr. Brown's phone and prepare a new report, which the government sent to Mr. Brown on February 23, 2018. ECF No. 84 at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On March 6, 2018, the government provided Mr. Brown's attorney another new Cellebrite report on Mr. Brown's cellphone. ECF No. 83-1. This new report was different from its predecessors. As the government explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   About February 28, 2018, the government spoke to an experienced Warwick Police Detective, Timothy Grant. Det. Grant has performed hundreds of Cellebrite extractions and explained that the reports that had been previously generated (by Dets. Grasso and Palmer) were \"Logical\" reports as opposed to \"Physical\" reports. Neither the prosecutors nor the agents working on the case were aware of such a distinction. Det. Grant explained that the \"Physical\" report is more comprehensive, and would account for a bit-for-bit reproduction of the data on the phone. Det. Grant prepared such a report from the defendant's phone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   ECF No. 84 at 3 (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The government points out that this new Cellebrite report captured much more than the previous report, including extensive data on Mr. Brown's location, cell tower locations, text messages, Facebook conversations, and web browsing history.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    at 3-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

R. Crim. P. 16(d)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The central issue here is whether the late produced \"physical\" Cellebrite report should be excluded. However, the late disclosure of this report must be taken in the context of a history of discovery from the government that was at best slow, sporadic, and untimely. For example, five days after the Court arraigned Mr. Brown, he sent a letter to the government requesting discovery. ECF No. 85-1. Instead of responding within the five days ordered by the Court (ECF No. 5), the government responded fifty-two days later. ECF No. 84 at 1. Additionally, this response does not appear to have included the first cellphone report conducted by the Warwick Police in March 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 84-1 at 138-39. This response was neither timely nor complete. Moreover, it violated this Court's order on timeliness. The government does not explain the incomplete or late disclosure, or why it ignored this Court's order concerning when its disclosures were due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The late disclosures continued. About three months later-and a year after the alleged incident occurred-the government disclosed another round of information to Mr. Brown, now including the report extracted from Mr. Brown's phone over a year earlier. Then, six months later, and two days before the Court's pretrial conference, on September 12, 2017, the government turned over a further batch of discovery, this time including another forty-one-page analysis of Mr. Brown's cellphone. Understandably, Mr. Brown's frustration led him to file a motion to compel, including for the phone report, which Mr. Brown argues he never received. The government subsequently re-produced all of the discovery to Mr. Brown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Now, in March of this year, the government-for the first time-disclosed an in-depth \"physical\" report of the phone which contained extremely detailed information not previously disclosed. Although the government argues that it did not have this report in its possession any earlier, it most certainly had Mr. Brown's phone, and had every opportunity over the preceding two years to conduct this analysis. Although there is no evidence the government acted intentionally or in bad faith in producing this report, this late production comes at the end of a long series of late disclosures, concerns evidence that the government admits is crucial to its case, and runs contrary to the purpose of Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The timely disclosure requirement of Rule 16 is only effective if the government timely analyzes and tests the evidence it has in its possession. This is the only way to ensure that the discovery process proceeds\n   fairly, justly, and effectively. Due diligence on the part of the government is an implicit requirement of Rule 16. If the government were allowed to sit on evidence, and wait until the last minute to analyze the evidence, and then claim the results just came into their possession, it would blow a huge hole in the government's disclosure obligation under the rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Mr. Brown's phone had been in the possession of the government for two years. The government knew it needed to extract information from the phone in order to prove its case; it describes the information contained in the phone as central to its case. However, the government failed to run the proper test on the phone in a timely fashion. While the government argues that the original two police officers simply failed to do a full analysis of the phone, that does not relieve the government of its responsibility to act with due diligence in obtaining the evidence necessary to prove its case in a timely fashion and turning it over to the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Considering the government's lack of diligence in timely analyzing the evidence in its possession, the history of late disclosures in this case, the defendant's right to discovery under Rule 16, as well as the defendant's right to have his charges expeditiously adjudicated, the Court concludes that the \"physical\" Cellebrite report recently disclosed to the defendant should be excluded under Rule 16(d)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   1.
