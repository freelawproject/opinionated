It is not the first lawsuit brought by the doctor in connection with these events. In this case, plaintiff brings a plethora of claims against multiple defendants. Specifically, plaintiff alleges that defendants 1) violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), 2) conspired to violate RICO,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), 3) violated the Sherman Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 7, 4 ) committed fraud, 5) tortiously interfered with contract, 6) committed trespass to chattels and 7) violated his civil rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition, plaintiff seeks declaratory judgments and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the Court are five motions to dismiss filed by various combinations of defendants and plaintiff's motion for entry of default. For the reasons that follow, defendants' motions to dismiss will be allowed and plaintiff's motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Bharanidharan Padmanabhan, MD, PhD, resides in Massachusetts and practiced medicine as a neurologist at the Cambridge Health Aliance (\"CHA\") Whidden Hospital. In November, 2010, plaintiff's medical privileges were suspended. The Board revoked them following a January 2011 Fair Hearing at CHA. Plaintiff has unsuccessfully challenged that revocation in state and federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In October, 2014, Dr. Padmanabhan filed a complaint in Massachusetts Superior Court for Norfolk County.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Padmanabhan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    City of Cambridge et al.\n   </em>\n   , Norfolk CA. NO. 1482CV01410 (\"\n   <em>\n    Padmanabhan I\"\n   </em>\n   ). That complaint asserted 12 counts against 73 defendants. The claims included various torts, fraud, violations of Massachusetts state law and violations of plaintiff's Constitutional rights. Padmanabhan accused BORIM of conspiring with CHA and asserted that BORIM's conduct constituted \"corrupt collusion and racketeering\". In July, 2017, the Superior Court allowed defendants' motions to dismiss, holding that plaintiff's claims were time-barred. Plaintiff appealed that decision, which is currently pending in the Massachusetts Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In September, 2015, Padmanabhan filed a complaint in this Court against a handful of state officials, alleging that they violated federal law by improperly accessing the Prescription Monitoring Program computer database in order to obtain information about his patients and to accuse him falsely\n   of Medicaid fraud. This session allowed defendants' motion to dismiss, holding that plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Padmanabhan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Healey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4328600\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/159/220/#p226\">\n    159 F.Supp.3d 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 226 (D.

An evidentiary hearing took place before a Division of Administrative Law Appeals (\"DALA\") magistrate in early 2015, and the magistrate issued a recommended decision in August, 2015. In January, 2016, BORIM remanded the case to the magistrate with orders to clarify and explain parts of his decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In March, 2016, plaintiff filed a petition for certiorari in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") asserting that the BORIM proceedings violated his constitutional rights and requesting that the August, 2015, decision be deemed final pursuant to 801 C.M.R. \u00a7 1.01(1l)(c)(3). After that petition was denied by a single justice of the SJC, plaintiff appealed to the full SJC. While that appeal was pending, the DALA magistrate issued an amended recommended decision in August, 2016. That decision found that plaintiff had acted below the standard of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 11, 2017, BORIM issued a decision that adopted, in large part, the magistrate's findings. On May 15, 2017, plaintiff filed an emergency motion in the SJC to stay the suspension of his license. The SJC denied that stay on May 18, 2017, and issued an opinion on the matter on June 27, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Padmanabhan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Registration in Med.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451961\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/1026/\">\n    477 Mass. 1026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20N.E.3d%20312\">\n    77 N.E.3d 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (\"\n   <em>\n    Padmanabhan III\n   </em>\n   \"). The court noted that it did not \"condone the lengthy disciplinary process to which Padmanabhan has been subjected\" and that it had \"serious concerns\" about the \"repeated resettings of the 180-day clock pursuant to 801 C.M.R. \u00a7 1.01(11)(c)(2).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20N.E.3d%20312\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20N.E.3d%20312\">\n    at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nonetheless, the Court noted, plaintiff's finality argument was unavailing.

In January, 2018, the case was reassigned to this session pursuant to Local Rule 40.1(g)(5). On February 2, 2018, plaintiff filed an emergency petition for a writ of mandamus in the First Circuit Court of Appeals (\"First Circuit\"), contesting that reassignment. On February 12, 2018, the First Circuit denied that petition, finding that plaintiff failed to demonstrate \"a clear entitlement to the relief requested.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Padmanabhan\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-1159 (1st Cir.

Many of those paragraphs recount the same events detailed in plaintiff's previous complaints in other cases. He states ten claims for relief against 26 defendants. Most of the defendants have been sued in prior actions. Two, Maura Tracey Healey and James Paikos, are named defendants in plaintiff's previous cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Padmanabhan II\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Padmanabhan IV\n   </em>\n   .

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants have filed motions to dismiss for failure to state claims upon which relief can be granted. To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \"state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.

R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). That low standard is not met in this case.

Most of plaintiff's claims are barred by claim preclusion and all are barred by the applicable statutes of limitations. An opportunity to amend will not cure those fundamental shortcomings. Although plaintiff has not yet amended his complaint in this suit, this case is his fourth sortie into court. Once again, his complaint is unavailing. The complaint will be dismissed in its entirety, with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   For the foregoing reasons,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   1) the motion to dismiss of Lucian Leape (Docket No. 11) is\n   <strong>\n    ALLOWED\n   </strong>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   2) the motion to dismiss of Joseph Gesmundo, Carul Hulka and Rachel Nardin (Docket No. 15) is\n   <strong>\n    ALLOWED\n   </strong>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   3) the motion to dismiss of George Abraham, Adele Audet, Robert Bouton, Nan Browne, Chris Cecchini, Loretta Kish Cooke, Gerard Dolan, Marianne E.
