Plaintiff alleges that Officer Onoja assaulted and falsely arrested him. Plaintiff also alleges that, after his arrest, Officer Onoja fabricated evidence incriminating Plaintiff for crimes that he did not commit. Plaintiff asserts several common law causes of action, as well as claims under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-9\">\n     Presently before the Court is Defendants' [32] Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings as to Plaintiff's Fifth Amendment Claim, and the District's Partial Motion for Summary Judgment. The District moved for summary judgment on Plaintiff's constitutional claims against it on the grounds that Plaintiff has not adduced sufficient evidence of the District's municipal liability. Both Defendants also moved for judgment on the pleadings on Plaintiff's Fifth Amendment fabrication of evidence claim on the grounds that it \"merges\" with Plaintiff's Fourth Amendment claims.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-10\">\n     Upon consideration of the pleadings,\n     <footnotemark>\n      1\n     </footnotemark>\n     the relevant legal authorities, and the record as a whole, the Court shall DENY both motions. The District's Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED because it is MOOT. After this motion was filed, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his municipal liability constitutional claim against the District (Count 8). Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings as to Plaintiff's Fifth Amendment claim (Count 7)-which, as a result of Plaintiff's voluntary dismissal of his constitutional claims against the District, is now argued only on behalf of Defendant Onoja-is also DENIED. Defendant Onoja concedes that a fabrication of evidence claim can be actionable under the Fifth Amendment. However, he contends that, on the particular facts of this case, such a claim \"merges\" with Plaintiff's Fourth Amendment claims because all of these claims are premised on the execution of Plaintiff's arrest. As discussed in more detail below, the Court disagrees with Defendant's interpretation of the relevant case law and his characterization of Plaintiff's claims. Because the alleged fabrication of evidence that underlies Plaintiff's Fifth Amendment due process claim is separate and distinct from his arrest, the Court finds that \"merger\" is not necessary or appropriate.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-11\">\n     <strong>\n      I.

DISCUSSION\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-18\">\n     There are two motions before the Court, but one need only be addressed briefly. The District has filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's constitutional claims against it, arguing that Plaintiff has not adduced sufficient evidence of the District's municipal liability. The District's Motion for Summary Judgment has been rendered moot. After that motion was filed, the parties agreed to dismiss Plaintiff's municipal liability claim (Count 8) against the District with prejudice.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Joint Praecipe of Partial Dismissal Only as to Municipal Liability Claim (Count 8), ECF No. 34. That claim is DISMISSED, and the District's Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED as MOOT.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-19\">\n     Accordingly, all that is left for the Court to consider at this time is Defendant Onoja's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings on Plaintiff's Fifth Amendment claim (Count 7). At the threshold, the Court notes that Plaintiff makes several arguments in his opposition to this motion that Defendant Onoja does not appear to dispute. First, Plaintiff argues that he has pled sufficient facts to put Defendant on notice of his Fifth Amendment claim. Pl.'s Opp'n at 2-3. Defendant concedes this point. Def.'s Reply at 3. Second, Plaintiff argues that fabrication of evidence claims are generally cognizable under the Fifth Amendment. Pl.'s Opp'n at 4. Defendant concedes this as well. Def.'s Reply at 3 (\"Defendant Onoja does not contend that a fabrication of evidence claim can never be pursued under the Fifth Amendment.\"). Finally, Plaintiff argues that an individual\n     need not have been convicted on the basis of false evidence in order to be able to state a due process claim for fabrication of evidence. Pl.'s Opp'n at 5-6. Defendant has not argued that Plaintiff's Fifth Amendment claim must be dismissed because Plaintiff was not ultimately convicted. Regardless, although it is not aware of any authority from this Circuit on the issue, the Court agrees with Plaintiff that the \"majority view\" is that conviction is not required.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Cole v.

Defs.' Mot. at 5. More specifically, Defendant argues that \"Plaintiff's Fifth Amendment claim ... is properly analyzed under the Fourth Amendment, as the claim is predicated exclusively upon allegations of an alleged false arrest and fabrication of evidence related to that arrest.\"\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4353209\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/835/358/#p369\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-21\">\n     The Court disagrees. Plaintiff's fabrication of evidence claim is appropriately asserted under the Fifth Amendment, and no \"merger\" is required. The two Supreme Court opinions Defendant cites, when carefully read, do not actually support Defendant's position in this case. The first of those opinions is\n     <em>\n      Graham v. Connor\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/\">\n      490 U.S. 386\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/\">\n      109 S.Ct. 1865\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/\">\n      104 L.Ed.2d 443\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (1989). In that case, the Supreme Court held that a claim for excessive force in the context of an arrest or investigatory stop is properly analyzed under the Fourth Amendment's \"objective reasonableness\" standard, not a Fifth Amendment substantive due process standard.\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/\">\n      at 388\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/\">\n      109 S.Ct. 1865\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . The plaintiff in\n     <em>\n      Graham\n     </em>\n     alleged that police officers used excessive force while making an investigatory stop.\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/\">\n      at 390\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/\">\n      109 S.Ct. 1865\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . The Supreme Court was asked to decide what standard should be applied to that claim. The Court stated that \"\n     <em>\n      all\n     </em>\n     claims that law enforcement officers have used excessive force-deadly or not-in the course of an arrest, investigatory stop, or other 'seizure' of a free citizen should be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment and its 'reasonableness' standard, rather than under a 'substantive due process' approach.\"\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/\">\n      at 395\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/\">\n      109 S.Ct. 1865\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (emphasis in original).

Unlike in\n     <em>\n      Graham\n     </em>\n     , Plaintiff does not ask this Court to apply a Fifth Amendment substantive due process standard to an excessive force claim. Plaintiff's Fifth Amendment claim is not based on Officer Onoja's alleged use of excessive force (or other improper conduct) before or during Plaintiff's arrest. And unlike in\n     <em>\n      Albright\n     </em>\n     , Plaintiff does not assert a general substantive due process right to be free from prosecution without probable cause. Plaintiff's claim is not based on his generally having been prosecuted absent probable cause, but instead on Plaintiff's allegation that Officer Onoja\n     <em>\n      purposefully\n     </em>\n     created false evidence incriminating Plaintiff to be used in his prosecution. Plaintiff asserts no Fourth Amendment claim based on these particular facts. Neither\n     <em>\n      Graham\n     </em>\n     nor\n     <em>\n      Albright\n     </em>\n     address this situation, and several courts have held that Fifth Amendment claims based on similar facts are indeed actionable.\n     <em>\n      See, e.g.,\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Cole\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342584\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/802/752/#p768\">\n      802 F.3d at 766\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (affirming district court's refusal to dismiss due process fabrication of evidence claim against police officer who allegedly lied and concealed evidence to protect other officers accused of using excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment, noting that\n     <em>\n      Albright\n     </em>\n     did not preclude such a claim, and citing cases).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-25\">\n     The district court opinions from this Circuit that Defendant relies upon are similarly distinguishable.\n     <footnotemark>\n      2\n     </footnotemark>\n     Defendant primarily relies on\n     <em>\n      Matthews v.

Such Fifth Amendment claims are foreclosed by\n     <em>\n      Graham\n     </em>\n     . This case is different.

Accordingly, Plaintiff is not, as Defendant argues, getting a \"second bite at the constitutional apple\" by asserting both Fourth Amendment claims and a Fifth Amendment substantive due process claim based on the same set of facts.
