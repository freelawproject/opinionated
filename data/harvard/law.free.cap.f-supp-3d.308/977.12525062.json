Trahan has now filed this putative class action,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   on\n   behalf of himself and others similarly situated, against both companies and Interactive's board of directors (\"the Directors\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"the Exchange Act\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78a\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , for issuing a false and misleading proxy solicitation statement (\"the Proxy Statement\") in connection with Interactive's shareholders' approval of the Merger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Now before the Court are motions to dismiss Trahan's\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 32, under Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P., filed by the Directors, Dkt. 39, and by Interactive and Genesys, Dkt. 41, which join the Directors' motion and argument in whole. We therefore consider the two motions together as one. For the reasons below, the motions are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factual and Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Trahan's\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   alleges the following, which we take as true for the purposes of the instant motions. Interactive was a technology company that \"provide[d] unified business communications solutions for call centers, enterprise IP telephony, and business process automation.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 34. Interactive cultivated three main business lines: its \"Customer Interaction Center ('CIC') business[,]\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35, its \"Communications as a Service ('CaaS') business[,]\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36 and a \"next generation cloud communication platform\" called \"PureCloud.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. As of 2015, Interactive's CIC and CaaS businesses were \"legacy\" businesses,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44, for which Interactive did not anticipate substantial future growth, in view of changing technological and market conditions. In view of these same conditions, however, Interactive hoped the PureCloud business would show \"explosive,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 78, \"tremendous,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 43, 93, \"huge,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45, \"extraordinary,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97, \"meteoric\" growth.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   PureCloud was announced by press release in June 2014. The first PureCloud product was released in January 2015. By January 2016, PureCloud was \"the focal point of Interactive's business.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. On a February 1, 2016, earnings call,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Brown explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [W]e believe we can package all of [PureCloud's features] at price points that our competitors can't touch, deploy [them] in timeframes that they can't match, and yet do so at 70 to 80 point margins that will make us nicely profitable in the years ahead.... We are ready to ... dominate our industry.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. Interactive's industry indeed responded favorably to PureCloud, honoring it for excellence and innovation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-52, 55. The market's response was favorable as well. In an August 1, 2016, press release, Brown pointed to a 13 percent year-on-year increase in total revenues and accelerating growth in the PureCloud customer base. Interactive \"had 24 PureCloud customers at the end of [2015]. Six months later we had well over 300[,]\" including 204 new customers in the second quarter of 2016 alone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Interactive had occasionally considered \"strategic partnership[s]\" with other firms since 2011,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58, but for various reasons those plans had not come to fruition. In\n   mid-2015, however, merger discussions with Genesys began in earnest. \"Over the next 15 months, representatives of Interactive and Genesys held numerous discussions about a potential merger.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63. Interactive retained Union Square Advisors (\"Union Square\") as its financial advisor on the deal. In August 2016, Interactive and Genesys concluded an agreement whereunder Genesys would acquire Interactive in a cash-out merger at the price of $60.50 per share, subject to the approval of Interactive's shareholders. Union Square supplied a fairness opinion finding the price was fair from a financial point of view to such shareholders. The Merger was announced publicly on August 31, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Proxy Statement\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   was filed on October 4, 2016, announcing a special shareholders' meeting on November 9, 2016, for a vote on the Merger and soliciting the shareholders' favorable proxies. Chairman Brown's introductory statement affirmed that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [a]fter consideration of, and based upon, the unanimous recommendation of a special committee of the board of directors consisting entirely of independent and disinterested directors ..., the [Directors] ha[ve] unanimously approved the [M]erger ..., determined that the transactions contemplated by the [M]erger agreement are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of [Interactive] and its shareholders and resolved to recommend that [Interactive] shareholders vote in favor of the [Merger].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Dkt. 40 Ex. 2, at 5-6;\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (introductory statement of Interactive CFO) (\"fair to, advisable and in the best interests of [Interactive] and its shareholders\"), 43 (Directors' recommendation) (\"fair to, advisable and in the best interests of [Interactive] and its shareholders\"). The Directors' stated reasons for this determination included consideration of\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [t]he value represented by the [M]erger relative to other alternatives [Interactive] might pursue, taking into account ... the risks and uncertainties associated with continuing to operate as an independent public company, including with respect to succession planning and the execution of [Interactive's] strategic plan (particularly the difficulties associated with [Interactive's] transition as an independent public entity to becoming a leading provider of cloud solutions), and [Interactive's] likely ability and timeframe to achieve valuations superior to the proposed transaction[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55 (\"Reasons for [the Directors'] Recommendation to Vote in Favor of the Merger\"). The Directors further justified their recommendation by pointing to the 36 percent premium represented by the $60.50 share price relative to \"the closing price of $44.49 per share on July 28, 2016, the last full trading day before media reports regarding a potential transaction [appeared].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Proxy Statement included a section presenting \"Certain [Interactive] Unaudited Prospective Financial Information,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   which the Proxy Statement referred to as \"the Forecasts,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 59, and which Trahan's complaint refers to as \"the financial projections.\"\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   Am.

We refer to them as \"the Management Forecasts.\" These consisted of \"certain non-public unaudited prospective financial information prepared by [Interactive] management ... updated in the third quarter of 2016.\" Dkt. 40 Ex. 2, at 59. The Management Forecasts were presented to the Directors in evaluating the Merger and to Union Square in preparing its fairness opinion. The Proxy Statement summarized the Management Forecasts in table form, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-24\"><strong>Calender Year Ending</strong> <strong> 6 Months Ending</strong> <strong>December 31,</strong> <strong> December 31, 2016</strong> <strong> 2016</strong> <strong>2017</strong> <strong>2015</strong> <strong>(dollars in millions)</strong> <strong>Revenue</strong> $ 221.9. $ 430.0 $ 469.6 $ 551.5 Adjusted E&amp;IDA (non-GAAP)(1) $ 23.4 $ 28.0 $ 58.8 $ 111.7 <em>Less:</em> Derpeciation $ 10.6 $ 19.1 $ 16.9 $ 13.8 <em>Less:</em> Amoritization of Capitalized software $ 3.9 $ 7.7 $ 6.9 $ 6.3 Adjusted EBIT (non-GAAP)(2) $ 8.9 $ 1.2 $ 35.0 $ 91.6 <em>Less:</em> Amoritization of Intangibles $ 1.2 $ 3.7 $ 2.5 $ 2.5 <em>Less:</em> Share-based Compensation $ 9.7 $ 18.8 $ 20.3 $ 22.7 <em>Less:</em> Other Adjustments $ 0.0 $ (1.3) $ 0.0 $ 0.0 EBIT (non GAAP)(3) $ 2.0 $ (20.1) $ 12.2 $ 66.4 Unlevered Free Cash Flow(4) $ 8.2 $ 7.7 $ 26.1 $ 72.5.</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Proxy Statement also included a section presenting the \"Opinion of [Interactive's] Financial Advisor,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Union Square.

The Directors are not charged with knowledge of any fact that would undermine the accuracy of the Management Forecasts; rather, Trahan charges the Directors with knowledge that the Management Forecasts would have been rosier if extended farther out and if PureCloud's \"explosive\" success were assumed as an input in the projection model. That is not a misleading omission of a material fact, it is a failure to state a tautology, and not a basis for false-statement liability under federal securities law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    3.

Identified as Forward-Looking with Cautions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   First, the Management Forecasts were clearly identified as forward-looking statements. A \"Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\" prefaced the Proxy Statement as a whole, Dkt. 40 Ex. 2, at 35, explaining that forward-looking statements \"relate[ ] to future plans, events, or financial condition or performance\" and \"can generally be identified by the use of words such as ... 'forecast' [and] ... 'project' ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%202319936\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Management Forecasts were referred to as \"the Forecasts\" in the Proxy Statement,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 59, and were characterized as \"projections of ... future financial performance....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58. Dispelling any room for doubt, the Proxy Statement was explicit: \"The [Management] Forecasts are forward-looking statements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59 (referring reader to \"Cautionary Statement,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Second, the Management Forecasts were accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements. The \"Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\" explained that forward-looking statements \"involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to vary materially\" from those predicted by the forward-looking statement, including \"[t]he risk of not fully realizing expected benefits and synergies\" from the Merger, \"[w]orldwide economic conditions and their impact on customer purchasing decisions[,]\" \"[r]apid technological changes and competitive [industry] pressures ...[,]\" and \"[t]he fact that [Interactive's] shareholders would forgo the opportunity to realize the potential long-term value of the successful execution of [Interactive's] current strategy as an independent public company[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Still, \" 'boilerplate' warnings won't do; cautions must be tailored to the risks that accompany the particular projections.\"\n   <em>\n    Asher v.

Obligingly, the Proxy Statement prefaces the Management Forecasts by noting \"[i]mportant factors that may affect actual results and cause the [Management] Forecasts not to be achieved ...[,]\" to wit: \"the mix of actual premise [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , CIC] and cloud [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , CaaS and PureCloud] orders, volume and timing of cloud orders, margins on cloud orders, general economic conditions, accuracy of certain accounting assumptions, changes in actual or projected cash flows, competitive pressures, and changes in tax laws.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59. Notably, the Proxy Statement provides cautions relating directly to Trahan's case concerning the unpredictable nature of the success or failure of Interactive's cloud-based business and the shareholders' forfeiture of a stake in the future success (if any) of Interactive's long-term business strategy should the Merger be approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   b. Made Without Actual Knowledge of Falsity\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Moreover, Trahan has not pleaded facts as would permit a plausible inference that the Management Forecasts were presented with actual knowledge of their false or misleading nature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part I.A.2\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .

Compl. \u00b6 78 (\"regardless of whether any longer-range projections existed\"). If no additional projections existed, it is implausible that the Directors were actually aware of the false or misleading nature of their omission. It is implausible to charge a person with knowingly concealing what they do not possess. The Proxy Statement itself notes that Interactive \"[did] not, as a matter of course, develop ... long-term projections or internal projections of its future financial performance revenues [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ], earnings, financial condition or other results due to ... the uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and estimates.\" Dkt. 40 Ex. 2, at 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    B. Omission of Separate Financial Projections for Each Business Line from Management Forecasts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Trahan next faults the Management Forecasts for failing to \"disclose[ ] [Interactive's] financial projections by product line. By not doing so, [the Directors] misled stockholders about the true nature of Interactive's prospects for growth.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 95. That is, Interactive's \"three businesses feature[d] markedly different financial attributes and radically different growth profiles.

Materiality\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   While financial projections, as noted above, may be material to cash-out merger decisions in general, Trahan's complaint does not permit the plausible inference that per-business-line projections were substantially likely to have been viewed by a reasonable Interactive shareholder as having significantly altered the total mix of information available with respect to the Merger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   First, Interactive's shareholders, of course, held stock in the entire enterprise, and were faced only with the decision whether to divest from the entire enterprise. There is no allegation that there was talk of selling off the legacy businesses only while keeping Interactive as a going concern focused on PureCloud. Second, unlike the case to which Trahan points, here, there is no allegation that the enterprise-level number was concealing losses in the legacy businesses under cover of PureCloud's greater success,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   or, more to the point, that PureCloud's success was being dragged down in the enterprise-level number by losses in the legacy businesses. The\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   in fact alleges nothing at all about the actual performance of Interactive's CIC and CaaS businesses;\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   it alleges only that they were \"lower margin\n   products\" and that PureCloud was \"high-margin....\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 94. Third, as explained above with respect to longer-range projections,\n   <em>\n    mutatis mutandis\n   </em>\n   , the only basis for Trahan's expectation of high margins and high profitability was the Directors' own public statements of optimism. That the Directors hoped PureCloud would succeed was already at the time of the Merger well within the total mix of information available to reasonable investors. The Directors did not omit any material fact when they failed to supply figures such as Trahan would deem commensurate with their puffing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    2.

The Union Square Analysis is clearly a forward-looking statement within the meaning the PSLRA. In respect of the DCF analysis, the Union Square Analysis is a projection of value or future economic performance,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-5(i)(1)(A), (C), the accuracy of which could not be determined until after the projection period (assuming the Merger had not closed and Interactive were still an independent entity).

Identified as Forward-Looking with Cautions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Union Square Analysis was clearly, though less succinctly than were the Management Forecasts, identified as a forward-looking statement. The \"Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\" explained that forward-looking statements \"relate[ ] to future... financial condition or performance\" and \"can generally be identified by the use of words such as ... 'estimate,' ... 'forecast,' ... 'opinion,' [and] 'project'....\" Dkt. 40 Ex. 2, at 35. The Union Square Analysis was prefaced by a declaration that, \"[i]n performing [its] financial analysis and arriving\n   at its\n   <em>\n    opinion\n   </em>\n   ,\" Union Square relied on the Management Forecasts, or \"certain financial\n   <em>\n    projections\n   </em>\n   provided by [Interactive's] management ...[,]\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 63 (emphasis added), specifically in conducting its DCF analysis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67. The Union Square Analysis noted further that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   [w]ith respect to the financial\n   <em>\n    forecasts\n   </em>\n   ... provided to Union Square by [Interactive] management, for the purposes of Union Square's\n   <em>\n    opinion\n   </em>\n   , Union Square assumed that such financial\n   <em>\n    forecasts\n   </em>\n   were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available\n   <em>\n    estimates\n   </em>\n   and good faith judgments ... as to the\n   <em>\n    future\n   </em>\n   competitive, operating and regulatory environments and related financial performance of Interactive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62 (emphasis added). In context, we find the above sufficient to identify the Union Square Analysis, specifically in respect of the DCF analysis, as forward-looking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Further, the Union Square Analysis was accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements. As already noted, the \"Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\" explained that forward-looking statements \"involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to vary materially\" from those predicted by the forward-looking statement, including \"[t]he risk of not fully realizing expected benefits and synergies\" from the Merger, \"[w]orldwide economic conditions and their impact on customer purchasing decisions[,]\" \"[r]apid technological changes and competitive [industry] pressures...[,]\" and \"[t]he fact that [Interactive's] shareholders would forgo the opportunity to realize the potential long-term value of the successful execution of [Interactive's] current strategy as an independent public company[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36. Moreover, the Union Square Analysis explained that, in performing its DCF analysis, it \"made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters.... Any estimates ... are not necessarily indicative of future results ..., which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   b. Made Without Actual Knowledge of Falsity\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Just as Trahan failed to allege facts suggesting Union Square's DCF analysis was performed in bad faith, Trahan has failed to allege facts suggesting that it was presented with actual knowledge of its false or misleading nature. As Union Square explained, the derivation of terminal values is a matter of \"professional judgment and experience\" with room for reasonable disagreement, Dkt. 40 Ex. 2, at 67;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bachrach Clothing, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4155521\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/480/820/#p872\">\n    480 B.R. at 872-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and Trahan has alleged no plausible factual support for the conclusion that Union Square or the Directors knew that perpetuity growth rates would present a false or misleading picture of Interactive's prospects. Again, Trahan relies entirely on his supposition that the Directors' publicly expressed hopes for PureCloud demanded more optimistic figures and, Trahan must presume, whatever inputs are necessary to generate those figures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <em>\n    D. Directors' Opinions Recommending the Merger\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In the Proxy Statement, the Directors communicated their opinion that the Merger was \"fair to, advisable and in the best interests of [Interactive] and its shareholders ...[,]\" Dkt. 40 Ex. 2, at 43, because, among other considerations, the Directors professed a favorable view of \"[t]he value represented by the [M]erger relative to other alternatives [Interactive] might pursue, taking into account ... the risks and uncertainties associated with continuing to operate as an independent public company, including ... the execution\n   of [Interactive's] strategic plan ... and [Interactive's] likely ability and timeframe to achieve valuations superior to [the Merger.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55. Trahan attacks these statements as materially false or misleading with sufficient particularity to satisfy the PSLRA's pleading standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   But because Trahan has pleaded no facts permitting a plausible inference that this opinion and its supporting reason were not given in good faith and with a reasonable basis, this theory must fail. Trahan advances no grounds for the subjective and objective falsity of these statements other than the three respects above considered and rejected on multiple grounds, including, in each case, lack of materiality and lack of subjective and objective falsity. At the risk of repetition\n   <em>\n    ad nauseam\n   </em>\n   , Trahan is persuaded that the Directors\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   that Interactive would be more valuable as a going concern than the value embodied in the Merger because the Directors expressed public\n   <em>\n    hopes\n   </em>\n   that PureCloud would be successful. And, because the Proxy Statement failed to express the same optimism, in Trahan's view, the Directors must have concealed that knowledge from the shareholders. Trahan's speculation on these points is unfounded by any plausible factual allegation in the\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Trahan's\n   <em>\n    Omnicare\n   </em>\n   claim too necessarily fails. First,\n   <em>\n    a priori\n   </em>\n   no reasonable investor would view as material an inquiry into facts he did not consider material. Because Trahan has failed to show that the omissions from the Management Forecasts he complains of were material, he has necessarily failed to show that the omission of those omissions (that is, the Proxy Statement's failure to disclose those omissions) was material. Second, and more to the point, the Proxy Statement did not fail to disclose the Directors' investigation into the value represented by the Merger, but in fact discloses it-as Trahan's own pleading bears out in relying entirely on the Proxy Statement. Put differently, all of Trahan's supposed investigative defects were patent on the face of the Proxy Statement. It cannot, therefore, be said that facts as to how the Directors formed their opinions were contrary to what a reasonable investor would expect, but not stated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <em>\n    E.

Thus enjoying the benefit of a full airing of potential problems with the Proxy Statement before drafting either of his two complaints in this matter, Trahan has had ample opportunity to craft a plausible allegation of a securities-law violation, but has not done so.

Accordingly, dismissal shall be with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Under the PSLRA, \"upon final adjudication of the action, the court shall include in the record specific findings regarding compliance ... with each requirement of Rule 11(b)[, Fed.
