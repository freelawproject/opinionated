Limited, the owner of the M/V Orient Dispatch (the \"Vessel\"), commenced this in rem admiralty and maritime action against defendant 25,001.078 metric tons of fly ash (the \"Cargo\") seeking to enforce and foreclose a maritime lien against Spartan Materials, LLC and Spartan Materials of Albany, LLC (collectively \"Spartan\"), the charterer of the Vessel, for outstanding demurrage and other costs and expenses due and owing under the terms of a November 20, 2017 charter-party contract (the \"Charter Agreement\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 6, 2018, this Court issued an Order (1) directing the Clerk of the Court to issue a Warrant of Arrest in rem against the Cargo pursuant to Rule C of the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty or Maritime Claims and Asset Forfeiture Actions (\"Admiralty Rule C\") and (2) appointing the Master of the Vessel and Coeymans Recycling Center, LLC (\"Coeymans Recycling\") as substitute custodians pursuant to Rule E of this District's Local Rules of Procedure for Admiralty and Maritime Cases (\"Admiralty Local Rule E\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 10, 2018, Spartan moved under Admiralty Rule E(4)(f) to partially vacate the arrest of the portion of the Cargo discharged from the Vessel as of April 6; i.e., the approximately 17,000 metric tons of fly ash discharged before the issuance of the Warrant of Arrest in rem. The motion has been fully briefed and oral argument was heard on April 17, 2018 in Utica, New York. Decision was reserved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Spartan contends Norden improperly asserted its maritime lien over\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the Cargo. According to Spartan, Norden cannot assert a valid lien over the portion of the Cargo discharged from the Vessel prior to the issuance of the Warrant of Arrest in rem because it was\n   <em>\n    unconditionally\n   </em>\n   delivered to the Port of Coeymans as part of a settlement agreement between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Spartan's request for partial vacatur of the arrest is based on Admiralty Rule E(4)(f), which provides in relevant part that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Whenever property is arrested or attached, any person claiming an interest in it shall be entitled to a prompt hearing at which the plaintiff shall be required to show why the arrest or attachment should not be vacated or other relief granted consistent with these rules.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"At a Rule E(4)(f) hearing, a defendant may attack 'the complaint, the arrest, the security demanded, or any other alleged deficiency in the proceedings.' \"\n   <em>\n    Maersk, Inc. v.

According to Spartan, the parties had settled their ongoing dispute over the total amount that was then due under the Charter Agreement by negotiating certain up-front cash payments and additional security deposits into a trust account held by Spartan's maritime counsel to cover the amounts owed up to midnight on March 9, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Norden acknowledges Spartan made certain cash payments and deposited other amounts as security but vehemently denies that these actions evince Norden's intent to unconditionally discharge any portion of the Cargo. To the contrary, Norden argues that Spartan has repeatedly dragged its heels during various aspects of the parties' business relationship and as a result has run up a large-and-still-increasing tab under the terms of the Charter Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As Norden tells it, the parties reached an agreement on payments that would satisfy certain past due amounts, but demurrage and other charges continued to accrue under the terms of the Charter Agreement. Norden asserts that although Spartan has made efforts to \"top-up\" the amount held in trust as security in satisfaction of these accruing costs, it has repeatedly fallen behind on this obligation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Unger Decl. Ex.

To begin, Norden's verified complaint and attached exhibits make clear that the terms of the Charter Agreement explicitly permitted Norden to place a lien on the Cargo for unpaid demurrage and other expenses. And on February 27, 2018, Norden transmitted to Spartan a Notice of Lien in which it invoked this right under the Charter Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To be sure, this initial Notice of Lien indicated that it would \"remain in place and the cargo will not be discharged\" until payment was made, language which might fairly suggest that any Cargo later discharged by Norden would be released unconditionally. But the course of the parties' subsequent dealings, and in particular the Notices of Lien transmitted on March 13, 2018 to P &amp; M Brick, LLC, the stevedoring company with which Spartan had contracted at Coeymans to discharge the Cargo (\"P &amp; M Brick\"), and to Coeymans Recycling, the entity with which Spartan had entered into an agreement to store the Cargo, indicate that a completely satisfactory arrangement for the provision of substitute security was never reached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   These March 13 Notices of Lien advised that Norden intended the lien to remain in place once the Cargo was discharged ashore, and were transmitted six days before any discharge operations ever began. Even assuming the parties' settlement agreement (and its accompanying \"top-up\" provision) was intended by the parties to secure the unconditional discharge of at least some portion of the Cargo, the presently available record indicates Spartan never managed to make good on the entirety of even those modified obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Norden's decision to nevertheless proceed with an attempted discharge of the Cargo is best understood as a conditional delivery borne of exigent circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Indeed, a review of the parties' submissions makes clear that Norden chose to take aggressive action to empty the Vessel itself after Spartan failed to hit important milestones: first, under the Charter Agreement, and then later, under the partial settlement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re 4,885 Bags of Linseed\n   </em>\n   , 66 U.S. at 114 (\"[I]t would be a serious sacrifice of his interests if the ship was compelled, in order to preserve the lien, to remain day after day with her cargo on board, waiting until the consignee found it convenient to pay the freight, or until the lien could be enforced in a court of admiralty .... if the cargo cannot be unladen and placed in the warehouse of the consignee, without waiving the lien, it would seriously embarrass the ordinary operations and convenience of commerce, both as to the ship-owner and the merchant.\"). Accordingly, Spartan's motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Norden has carried its burden under Admiralty Rule E(4)(f) of showing why the seizure should not be vacated and therefore Spartan's motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Therefore, it is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   ORDERED that\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Claimants Spartan Materials, LLC and Spartan Materials of Albany, LLC motion to partially vacate the Warrant of Arrest in rem is DENIED.

Among other things, Spartan's submissions detail its belief that these entities repeatedly tried to take advantage of a complicated situation by breaching certain written agreements they executed with Spartan. Whether or not Spartan's accusations are accurate, they do little to help answer the limited question presented here; i.e., whether or not Norden's discharge of part of the Cargo prior to April 6 was unconditional. If anything, this additional evidence would suggest it was not-Norden would likely want to hold tight to its maritime lien under these uncertain circumstances to ensure it could recoup any losses arising from further delays.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
