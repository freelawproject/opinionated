Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c), Mount Sunapee moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the liability release printed on Miller's lift ticket bars his claim. Miller argues that the release is unenforceable under New Hampshire law and inapplicable on its face.

Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following a large 2015 snowfall, Miller visited Mount Sunapee with his brother and father for a day of skiing. Miller was skiing ahead of his companions through fresh powder on the left side of the Beck Brook trail\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   when he struck an unmarked \"snow gun holder\" that was concealed by snow. The \"holder\"-essentially a steel pipe protruding from the ground-is a mounting post for snow-making guns. The post remains embedded in the ground after the guns are removed. There was no snow-making gun in the holder at the time of this accident. Miller suffered serious leg injuries in the collision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In order to ski at Mount Sunapee, Miller first purchased a lift ticket. The ticket has a self-adhesive backing, which the skier affixes to his zipper tab or similar visible location. In order to attach it, the skier must first remove it from a peel-off backing. Printed on the back of the peel-off backing of the Mount Sunapee lift ticket was the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   STOP\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [a red octagon image similar to a traffic-control \"stop sign\"]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   YOU ARE RELEASING THIS SKI AREA FROM LIABILITY\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   By removing this peel-off backing and using this ticket, you agree to be legally bound by the LIABILITY RELEASE printed on the other side of this ticket.

He alleges that Mount Sunapee failed to mark or warn skiers of the pipe, or otherwise mitigate its danger to skiers, by, for example, padding it or making it visible to skiers. In addition, Miller alleges that Mount Sunapee breached its duties to create a safe environment for guests, and to perform in-season trail maintenance work. Finally, Miller claims that Mount Sunapee is liable because it failed to comply with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.H.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20225\">\n    N.H.

Therefore, he concludes, applying the release to the allegedly hidden snow gun holder would allow Mount Sunapee to impermissibly evade this statutory responsibility. As a general proposition, Miller is correct that a release can not excuse a ski area's statutory violation.\n   <em>\n    Harper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2290792\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/140/770/#p775\">\n    140 N.H. at 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=674%20A.2d%20962\">\n    674 A.2d 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nutbrown v.

However, Miller's argument here is built on a faulty premise-that\n   \u00a7 225-A:24, denoted \"Responsibilities of Skiers and Passengers\"-imposes an affirmative duty on ski areas to mark or make visible snow-making equipment. The court rejects this argument for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   First, Miller attempts, without legal support, to create an affirmative duty out of the text of \u00a7 225-A:24 where none exists. Section 225-A:24\"is an immunity provision for ski area operators.\"\n   <em>\n    Cecere v.

One of the inherent \"risks, hazards, or dangers which the skier ... assumes as a matter of law\" is \"plainly marked or visible snow making equipment.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.H.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20225\">\n    N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -A:24, I. Miller argues that because\n   <em>\n    un\n   </em>\n   marked or\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   visible snow-making equipment is not \"an inherent risk\" enumerated by the statute, ski areas therefore have a statutory duty to mark them or make them visible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This argument is both contrary to the language of the statute and unsupported by any legal authority. While the language of the statutory immunity provision-enumerating a \"Skier's Responsibilities\"-arguably does not bar Miller's claim\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   that he struck an unmarked and not visible piece of equipment, it likewise creates no affirmative duties for ski areas. Stated differently, while New Hampshire law may\n   <em>\n    allow\n   </em>\n   ski area liability for injuries resulting from collisions with unmarked equipment, it does not logically follow that New Hampshire law\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   the marking of such equipment. The statute sets forth no such obligation or legal duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   To avoid the plain language of \u00a7 225-A:24, Miller argues that\n   <em>\n    Rayeski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , imposes an affirmative duty on Mount Sunapee when read in conjunction with \u00a7 225-A:23. In that case, the New Hampshire Supreme Court, invoking \u00a7 225-A:24, upheld the dismissal of a skier's claim for injuries sustained in a collision with an unmarked light pole.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"380814\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/146/495/#p497\">\n    146 N.H. at 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=776%20A.2d%201265\">\n    776 A.2d 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Rayeski\n   </em>\n   argued that the light pole collision was similar to a collision with unmarked snow-making equipment, which the statute \"implies ... is not an inherent risk of skiing\" by not barring such a claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 498,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=776%20A.2d%201265\">\n    776 A.2d 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the course of finding that the pole collision\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   an inherent risk of skiing (despite not being specifically enumerated as such in the statute), the Court distinguished between poles and snow making equipment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   We conclude that the legislature's explicit reference to \"plainly marked or visible snow making equipment\" was intended to balance the immunity granted to ski area operators under RSA 225-A:24 with their\n   <em>\n    duty under RSA 225-A:23, II(b) (2000) to warn skiers of snow making or grooming activities by denying immunity to ski area operators who breach a statutorily imposed safety responsibility\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=776%20A.2d%201265\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Based on the emphasized language, Miller argues that \u00a7 225-A:23 required Mount Sunapee to mark or make visible the snow gun holder he struck. This argument ignores the plain language both of\n   <em>\n    Rayeski\n   </em>\n   and the statute. The\n   <em>\n    Rayeski\n   </em>\n   opinion referred only to \"snow making or grooming\n   <em>\n    activities\n   </em>\n   ,\" and made no reference to marking equipment. And the statute, captioned \"Base Area; Information to Skiers and\n   Passengers,\" requires that a ski area operator \"warn skiers and passengers\n   <em>\n    by use of the trail board, if applicable\n   </em>\n   , that snow grooming or snow making\n   <em>\n    operations\n   </em>\n   are routinely in progress on the slopes and trails serviced by each tramway.\" (Emphasis added). Thus, contrary to Miller's argument, this section imposes no requirement to \"mark or make visible\" the snow gun holder at issue in this case. Instead, the statute requires the ski area to post \"\n   <em>\n    at the base area\n   </em>\n   \" a warning concerning\n   <em>\n    grooming and snowmaking operations\n   </em>\n   , if applicable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nardone v.

First, plaintiff's argument is premised on his assertion that Mount Sunapee is trying to avoid liability for a statutory violation. The court has already rejected plaintiff's premise as an untenable reading of \u00a7\u00a7 225-A:23 and 24. Next, the State enforcement criterion was not dispositive in\n   <em>\n    McGrath\n   </em>\n   , as the Court found that the liability waiver did not contravene public policy because, \"\n   <em>\n    [i]rrespective of the statute\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff has voluntarily agreed not to hold the ski area, or its employees, liable for injuries resulting from negligence so that she may obtain a season ski pass.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.H.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20215\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.H.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20215\">\n    at 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=969%20A.2d%20392\">\n    969 A.2d 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). In addition, even if the court read\n   <em>\n    McGrath\n   </em>\n   to\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   a state law enforcement vehicle to protect the public interest, the New Hampshire ski statutes do in fact provide one.

First, the letter is not properly part of the summary judgment record. According to its terms, it was sent in response to plaintiff's counsel's request for documents concerning the enforcement of \u00a7 225-A:26. However, \"[i]n opposing a motion for summary judgment, a plaintiff must proffer\n   <em>\n    admissible\n   </em>\n   evidence that could be accepted by a rational trier of fact as sufficient to establish the necessary proposition.\"\n   <em>\n    Gomez-Gonzalez v.

The letter itself is inadmissible hearsay, as it is being offered to prove the truth of the matters asserted with respect to enforcement of \u00a7 225-A:23 and 24.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Moreover, although apparently issued by a government office (the plaintiff made no effort to lay such a foundation), the letter is not admissible under the Public Records hearsay exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 803(8) (requiring, for admissibility, the evidence in question to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , set out the public office's activities and involve a matter observed while under a legal duty to report). It is true that some forms of evidence, such as affidavits and declarations, may be considered on summary judgment, even if they would not be admissible at trial, so long as they \"set out facts that would be admissible in evidence\" if the affiant or declarant testified to them at trial. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4). The letter in question, however, is neither an affidavit nor a declaration. In addition to being an unsworn letter, it fails to show how the letter writer is expressing \"personal knowledge,\" and fails to show that she is \"competent to testify on the matters stated,\" as required by Fed.

Under New Hampshire administrative law, however, as set forth under its Administrative Procedure Act, the letter in question is not a rule, and thus lacks such force. It is simply a letter answering a question posed by the plaintiff's lawyer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.H.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    N.H.

That observation misses the point, however, as \u00a7 225-A:26 does not limit enforcement of \u00a7 225-A to the Tramway Board. To the contrary, the statute holds \"any person\" \"guilty\" of a violation or misdemeanor for violations of \"this chapter,\" i.e., the entirety of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.H.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20225\">\n    N.H.

Thus, the letter contradicts the plain language of the statute by inaccurately portraying the applicability of \u00a7 225-A:26 as limited to \"operating a tramway without it first being registered.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under New Hampshire law, \"[r]ules adopted by administrative agencies may not add to, detract from, or in any way modify statutory law,\"\n   <em>\n    Elementis Chem.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8422803\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/152/794/#p803\">\n    152 N.H. at 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=887%20A.2d%201133\">\n    887 A.2d 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the letter's pronouncement, even it were a duly adopted Rule, would be invalid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Appeal of Gallant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8710292\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/125/832/#p834\">\n    125 N.H. 832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 834,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=485%20A.2d%201034\">\n    485 A.2d 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984) (noting that agency regulations that contradict the terms of a governing statute exceed the agency's authority and are void). The statute penalizes not only failing to register, but also \"violating\n   <em>\n    this chapter or\n   </em>\n   rules of the [Tramway Safety] board.\" (emphasis added). In effect, the plaintiff is asking the court to ignore the plain language of the statute in favor of a letter which is neither properly before the court nor is a valid administrative rule and which fails to address the issue before the court-the scope of \u00a7 225-A:26. The court is not free to ignore the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, New Hampshire's Administrative Procedure Act,\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   or the plain language of New Hampshire's ski-related statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Accordingly, the court finds that New Hampshire statutory law provides no support to plaintiff's public policy argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Plaintiff cites no authority for this argument, but instead relies on various provisions in the lease between Mount Sunapee and the State of New Hampshire. None of these provisions establish or support the proposition that public policy prohibits the enforcement of the release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For example, the lease requires the property to be used for \"public outdoor recreational uses,\" \"for the mutual benefit of the public and the Operator,\" and \"as a public ski area ... for the general public.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the ski area operator is\n   required to \"allow public access,\" \"maintain the Leased Premises in first class condition,\" and \"undertake trail maintenance.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even assuming, arguendo, that the lease theoretically establishes public policy, the plaintiff makes no coherent argument how the release in question runs afoul of any of its provisions. Instead, plaintiff argues, strenuously but without authority, that condoning Mount Sunapee's requirement that a skier agree to the release as a condition of skiing there \"effectively sanctions the conversion of public land by Mount Sunapee.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also argues, again without authority, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   \"[p]rivate operators of public lands, to which the public must be allowed access, cannot be allowed to limit access to such lands to those individuals who are willing to forego their\n   <em>\n    statutory rights\n   </em>\n   by exculpating the private operators from the consequences of their own negligence. To hold otherwise, would mark the first step toward eliminating public access to public lands at the expense of the general public.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   (Emphasis added). Initially, the court reiterates its finding,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Part III.A.1, that the language at issue in this case does not implicate plaintiff's statutory rights. Moreover, whatever persuasive force his policy-based arguments hold, plaintiff cites no authority-in the form of cases, statutes or regulations-upon which the court can rely to accept them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As a final public-interest related matter, the parties dispute the import of liability releases used at Cannon Mountain, a state-owned and operated ski area. In its motion, Mount Sunapee cited those releases to demonstrate that New Hampshire's public policy does not generally disfavor liability releases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff, however, points out that because the Cannon release does not use the word \"negligence,\" it may, in fact, not release Cannon from its own negligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4412660\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/128/102/#p106\">\n    128 N.H. at 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=509%20A.2d%20151\">\n    509 A.2d 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"the [exculpatory] contract must clearly state that the defendant is not responsible for the consequences of his negligence.\"). Therefore, plaintiff suggests, Sunapee's release may have exceeded what public policy (as articulated in the Cannon release) permits. Regardless of the Cannon release's enforceability-a matter on which the court offers no opinion-the court finds that Mount Sunapee has the better of this argument. New Hampshire's public policy is likely best expressed by its legislative enactments, particularly\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.H.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20225\">\n    N.H.

Such legislatively-enacted immunity from negligence undercuts Miller's argument that the Cannon release demarcates the outer boundary of New Hampshire public policy.

The Court in\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   held that a release which first noted the \"inherent hazards\" of horseback riding \"obscured\" the later following exculpatory clause, part of which resembled the one employed here by Mount Sunapee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 170,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=663%20A.2d%201340\">\n    663 A.2d 1340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   , the exculpatory clause purporting to release the defendant from \"any and all\" liability began with the phrase \"I therefore release...\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=663%20A.2d%201340\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).

The factual allegations in this case fall far short of recklessness. First, as previously noted, the grooming report on which plaintiff relies is remote both in time and location. Next, the conduct alleged here is significantly less egregious than the allegations in\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   , where ski area employees allegedly ignored a nearby passenger already in danger of falling from a lift chair, or the conduct in\n   <em>\n    Migdal\n   </em>\n   , where the defendant parents, one day after their son had exhibited mental instability, ransacked the family home, and exhibited dangerous tendencies, failed to seek treatment for him and to secure multiple firearms and ammunition. As in\n   <em>\n    Brush\n   </em>\n   , the most that can be said here is that Mount Sunapee failed to take a step that-while not legally required,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 III.A.1-might have prevented plaintiff's accident.

Wanton and positive misconduct\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In an attempt to characterize his claims in such a way to avoid the language of the release, plaintiff's Amended Complaint describes them as \"wanton and positive acts of misconduct,\" that is, more culpable than negligence, but not intentional.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court, however, has already determined that the Complaint alleges no more than ordinary negligence, so this argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    3. Potential certification\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   If the court had found that the facts alleged by the plaintiff could constitute conduct more culpable than negligence, it would have considered certifying an unresolved question to the New Hampshire\n   Supreme Court: whether conduct more culpable than negligence, but less than intentional could be the subject of a release like the one at issue here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.H. Sup. Ct. R. 34. In the absence of such allegations, certification is unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     IV. Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The undisputed factual record shows that plaintiff purchased and affixed to his clothing a lift ticket at Mount Sunapee that unambiguously released the ski area from liability from its own negligence, that such a release does not violate public policy, and that plaintiff's signature was not required to effectuate its terms. Furthermore, there is no material factual dispute that plaintiff had the opportunity to read both the cautionary language on the ticket's peel-off backing and the release language itself, that he would have understood that language to constitute a release and that a reasonable person in his position would have understood that the release exculpated Mount Sunapee from its own negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   As plaintiff has alleged only that Mount Sunapee's negligence caused his injuries, and that the facts he alleges do not constitute conduct more culpable than negligence, the court finds that plaintiff's claims fall within the ambit of the Mount Sunapee release and that the release is enforceable against the plaintiff. Therefore, defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, having been converted to a motion for summary judgment\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   is GRANTED.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Counsel for both parties assented to the conversion in an on-the-record telephone conference with the court on July 14, 2017.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Rule 12(d) provides that \"[i]f, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c), matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.

The discussion of Miller's opportunity to read the release-a significant factor under New Hampshire law-provides another example of the difficulty between Mount Sunapee's counsel and the plaintiff over seemingly evident issues such as the plaintiff's opportunity to read a lift ticket that was indisputably in his hand, and which he attached to his clothing using both hands. The plaintiff suggested that his opportunity to read the release was somehow negated by his decision to quickly affix it to his clothing. The following exchange took place:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n    Q: You would agree that you would have had the opportunity to review this full lift ticket, both the language on the ticket itself and the peel-off backing, correct?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n    A: No. Because I peeled off the back and I put it on my pants immediately.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n    Q: Was anybody telling you you had no ability and didn't need to and couldn't read this language before putting that ticket on your clothing?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n    A: Nobody told me that, no.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n    Q: Okay, so you had the opportunity.
