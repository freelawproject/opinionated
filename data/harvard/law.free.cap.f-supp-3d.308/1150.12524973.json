(# 25) For the reasons that follow, the Court GRANTS Jara's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Jara is charged with Illegal Reentry having been ordered removed from the United States on two prior occasions. Jara's original order of removal occurred in February, 1998 following convictions for two misdemeanors, Unlawful Use of a Weapon and Attempted Assault I in Multnomah County (1995) and a felony Possession of a Controlled Substance plus a misdemeanor DUII in Wasco County (1997). In 2011, Jara's 1998 removal order was reinstated and he was again ordered removed. This motion focuses on the 1998 removal order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Jara's first substantive hearing before an immigration judge (IJ) occurred on November 21, 1997, prior to his guilty pleas in the Wasco County case. (# 26-2) IJ Warren advised Jara, a lawful permanent resident who appeared without a lawyer, that because his Multnomah County convictions were not aggravated felonies, he should apply for cancellation of removal under INA \u00a7 240A(a). The government agreed with IJ Warren who then instructed Jara how to apply for cancellation of removal. (# 26-2, pp. 6-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Jara applied for cancellation of removal (# 26-5) and, on February 25, 1998, attended a hearing on his application. This hearing took place after Jara's guilty plea in Wasco County, Oregon to Felony Possession\n   of a Controlled Substance. A different immigration judge, IJ Ayala, presided and Jara again appeared without a lawyer. Jara presented evidence about becoming a lawful permanent resident, his continuous residency in the United States, his seven United States citizen children, and his employment history including the payment of income taxes for 12 years. IJ Ayala requested documents concerning Jara's convictions. When Jara gave IJ Ayala the information about the Wasco County conviction, IJ Ayala denied Jara's application for cancellation of removal. He ruled that the Wasco County felony drug possession conviction constituted an \"aggravated felony\" under Section 101A (43)(B) of the Immigration Nationality Act, and, as such, disqualified Jara from cancellation of removal. After announcing his decision, IJ Ayala advised Jara of his right to appeal the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals and instructed Jara how and when to file a notice of appeal. Jara did not appeal and was deported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thereafter, Jara returned to the United States and was charged with Illegal Reentry (# 1). Jara filed this motion to dismiss claiming that the prior deportation proceeding violated his right to due process of law and that he suffered prejudice as a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

To sustain a collateral attack under \u00a7 1326, a defendant must demonstrate that (1) he exhausted all administrative remedies available to him to appeal his removal order, (2) the underlying removal proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived him of the opportunity for judicial review, and (3) the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).

Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Jara contends that IJ Ayala erroneously advised him that he was an aggravated felon and therefore not eligible for cancellation of removal. Because of this erroneous advice, Jara argues that his removal order was fundamentally unfair and so he should be excused for his failure to exhaust administrative remedies. So, the first issue I must determine is whether IJ Ayala erroneously advised Jara that his state\n   felony conviction was an \"aggravated felony.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During the removal hearing, IJ Ayala acknowledged that Jara's conviction for possession of a controlled substance, a felony under Oregon law, would have only qualified as a misdemeanor had it been prosecuted in federal court. (# 26-2, p.17) IJ Ayala then misapplied the holding in\n   <em>\n    Matter of L-G-\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2089\">\n    21 I. &amp; N.

(# 26-2, p.17)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Without conceding that IJ Ayala's ruling was erroneous, the government points out that after IJ Ayala issued his ruling, he fully instructed Jara as to Jara's right to appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Judge: Sir, you have heard the decision of the court. If you feel that the court made an error in the testament of the facts of the case or in the conclusion of law you have the right to appeal this decision to the board of immigration appeals in Falls Church, Virginia for further review. In the alternative, sir, if you are satisfied with the decision you may accept the decision but if you do you will not be able to change your mind at a later date. What do you wish to do?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Jara: Well, I don't know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Judge: Okay, well you have 30 days sir to decide what you wish to do. In that 30 day period if you do decide to appeal the case you must submit the notice of appeal directly to the board of immigration appeals in Falls Church Virginia. That notice of appeal, sir, must be received by the board of immigration appeals within that 30 day period. You cannot wait until the 30\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day to mail it to see if it gets there the next day because then it would not be timely. In the notice of appeal, sir you must identify the error of fact or law that you believe the court committed in deciding your case. If you do not have the funds necessary to pay the appeal fees you can submit a paupers affidavit to that affect so that the board can consider whether or ot to accept it without the payment of fees. Do you understand that sir?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Jara: Yes, I understand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (# 26-2, p. 17-18)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The government argues that Jara received his full due process rights and should not be excused from failing to exhaust his administrative remedies by appealing IJ Ayala's ruling to the Board of Immigration Appeals. At the first hearing, IJ Warren informed Jara regarding his right to cancellation of removal. At the second hearing, Jara was given an opportunity to present his case and seek relief. After Jara received an adverse decision, IJ Ayala explicitly advised Jara of his right to appeal. After hearing the ruling, Jara did not waive his right to appeal. Nothing was said to prevent Jara from appealing the decision. Rather, he chose not to appeal IJ Ayala's ruling and in so doing, failed to exhaust all his administrative remedies. Had he appealed his decision, the Board of Immigration Appeals would have had the\n   opportunity to review and possibly reverse the decision. But Jara chose not to exhaust his administrative remedies and cannot now try to revisit that choice. The government urges that Jara received his full due process rights and to rule otherwise would eviscerated the first requirement of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) that an alien must demonstrate that he \"exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I would be inclined to agree with the government in their argument, but for the Ninth Circuit's ruling in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ochoa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276295\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/1010/\">\n    861 F.3d 1010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2017) and cases cited therein. In\n   <em>\n    Ochoa\n   </em>\n   , the defendant pled guilty to conspiracy to export defense articles without a license in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202778\">\n    22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While in federal prison, Ochoa was served with a notice to appear, charging him with removability on the grounds that his conviction was an aggravated felony and a conviction of a firearms offense.\n   <em>\n    Ochoa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276295\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/1010/\">\n    861 F.3d at 1013-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the hearing before an IJ, Ochoa appeared without a lawyer. The IJ offered Ochoa more time to obtain representation and also advised him that he could appeal any decision rendered. The IJ also provided Ochoa with a document correctly explaining his appellate rights.\n   <em>\n    Ochoa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276295\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/1010/\">\n    861 F.3d at 1014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After reviewing the certified indictment and judgment and talking to Ochoa about the conviction, the IJ found Ochoa was removable due to his aggravated felony and firearm convictions. The IJ concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   I don't see that there is any relief available to you ... Now, you can accept that decision but if you disagree with it, you would have 30 days to appeal it. Did you want to accept my decision or reserve your right to appeal?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Ochoa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276295\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/1010/\">\n    861 F.3d at 1014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ochoa accepted the decision and did not appeal. After serving the remainder of his federal prison sentence, Ochoa was removed to Mexico. A number of years later, federal agents discovered Ochoa in California and he was indicted for illegal reentry. Ochoa moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the underlying removal proceeding had violated his due process rights because his prior convictions constituted neither an aggravated felony nor a firearms offense. The district court denied the motion and Ochoa appealed. The Ninth Circuit ruled that Ochoa's conviction could not serve as a proper predicate for removal as either an aggravated felony or a firearms offense. The Court then reversed the district court ruling \"under our circuit's law, if [Ochoa] was not convicted of an offense that made him removable under the INA to begin with,\n   <em>\n    he is excused from proving the first two requirements [of\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d).\n   </em>\n   ]\"\n   <em>\n    Ochoa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276295\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/1010/\">\n    861 F.3d at 1015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because the conviction was not an aggravated felony, it could not serve as a proper predicate for Jara's removal. Applying the ruling in\n   <em>\n    Ochoa\n   </em>\n   to the present case, I see no other option than to find that Jara is excused from proving that he exhausted all administrative remedies, as well as that he was deprived of an opportunity for judicial review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Prejudice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   To succeed in collaterally attacking his underlying proceeding, Jara must\n   demonstrate that the 1998 removal order was fundamentally unfair.

IJ Warren believed Jara was eligible for cancellation of removal based on his representations to her and instructed Jara how to apply. (# 26-2, p. 4) At the second immigration hearing, Jara submitted the cancellation of removal application showing that he had entered the United States in 1979 at the age of 14, become a permanent resident in 1989, and resided continuously in the United States since entering. (# 26-2, p. 4) As previously discussed, IJ Ayala erroneously determined that Jara had been convicted of any aggravated felony, when, in fact, his drug possession conviction did not qualify as a federal felony. Although Jara's misdemeanor convictions work against his application, his favorable equities are significant.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Georgiu v.

Jara's application showed significant work history, from 1985 to 1998 with only a brief 18 month hiatus. (# 26-5, p. 3) He filed income tax returns for all the years he was employed. (# 26-5, p. 3) He had substantial familial ties to the United States; his permanent resident wife and seven United States citizen children ranging in age from seven months to thirteen years relied on him as their sole financial supporter.
