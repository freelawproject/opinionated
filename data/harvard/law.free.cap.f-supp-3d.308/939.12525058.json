In\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the United States Supreme Court held that the residual clause of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(ii), the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), was unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Due Process Clause. Petitioner further asserts that he was \"adjudged a career offender\" pursuant to the residual clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) ; that the residual clause in \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) is identical to the residual clause in ACCA that was declared void for vagueness in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ; and that the residual clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) must therefore be void as well. Petitioner further argues that his convictions for violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) do not constitute crimes of violence under the elements or enumerated clauses of \u00a7 4B1.2(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On May 13, 2016, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals decided\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In that case the Sixth Circuit applied the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   to invalidate the residual clause in \u00a7 4B1.2(a).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055576\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/902/#p902\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, when the Government responded to Petitioner's motion on June 20, 2016, it was forced to concede that under Sixth Circuit precedent, Petitioner's bank robbery convictions could not constitute crimes of violence pursuant to the residual clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a). The Government nevertheless maintained that Petitioner's bank robbery convictions constituted crimes of violence under the elements and enumerated clauses of \u00a7 4B1.2(a). (ECF No. 20.) On June 27, 2016, however, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in\n   <em>\n    Beckles v.

On July 6, 2016, the Government moved to hold this action in abeyance pending a ruling in\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   because\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   would conclusively resolve whether the residual clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a) was invalidated in light of the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 6, 2017, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   , holding\n   that the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   did not invalidate the residual clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a), thereby overruling the Sixth Circuit's contrary holding in\n   <em>\n    Pawlack.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beckles v.

The Supreme Court explained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [u]nlike the ACCA ... the advisory Guidelines do not fix the permissible range of sentences.... they merely guide the exercise of a court's discretion in choosing an appropriate sentence within the statutory range. Accordingly, the Guidelines are not subject to a vagueness challenge under the Due Process Clause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609931\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/886/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609931\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/886/\">\n    at 892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For that reason, Petitioner's claim that his bank robbery convictions cannot be considered crimes of violence pursuant to the residual clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a) fail. Indeed, the Sixth Circuit has subsequently explained that \"\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   made clear that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   -like relief is not available to individuals raising void-for vagueness challenges to sentences imposed pursuant to the residual clause contained in the prior version of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a).\"\n   <em>\n    Harris v.
