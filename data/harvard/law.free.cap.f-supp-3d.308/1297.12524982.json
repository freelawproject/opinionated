Commerce's citation to prior Turkish cases fails to clarify the applicable standard. In\n   <em>\n    OCTG from Turkey\n   </em>\n   , for example, the agency granted the adjustment when \"[e]ach respondent demonstrated that when it opened the DIIBs,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   it documented 1) projected quantities of imports, which qualify based on an 8-digit level HTS [\"Harmonized Tariff Schedule\"] number (which include API-5CT coil used for OCTG) ....\"\n   <em>\n    OCTG from Turkey\n   </em>\n   , I &amp; D Mem. at Cmt. 1; I &amp; D Mem. at 5 n.16.

So too here, \u00c7olakoglu provided information for each IPR documenting what appear to be HTS codes (referred to as \"GTIP\" codes) for the imported slab and corresponding exports.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \u00c7olakoglu Third Suppl. \u00a7 BC QR Part II, Ex. SBC-13a (IPR 2923, p.6). \u00c7olakoglu also demonstrated the Turkish Government's approval of each IPR on the basis that the duty free imports were used to produce the exported material.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2054%2C965\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (IPR 2923, p.1).

The Government further stated that \u00c7olakoglu's documentation failed to apprise Commerce of certain metallurgical characteristics or otherwise indicate that the imported slabs were the types of slabs used to produce hot-rolled steel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Oral Arg. at 1:20:15-1:28:15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Government's oral presentation suggests that Commerce's references to the actual use of imported slab in exported hot-rolled steel were mistaken and should be understood as speaking to the suitability of the imported slab. The court may not accept \"\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   rationalizations for agency action,\" and may only sustain the agency's decision \"on the same basis articulated in the order by the agency itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Burlington Truck Lines,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"451399\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/156/#p168\">\n    371 U.S. at 168-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"451399\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/156/#p168\">\n    83 S.Ct. 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
