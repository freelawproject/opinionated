BATES, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   If a defendant refuses on principle to appear in court, things usually do not end well for the defendant. But suppose we add two complicating factors. First, the lawsuit is clearly untimely under governing law. And second, the defendant is the Islamic Republic of Iran. Should a court rule against Iran in absentia? Or should the court consider the suit's timeliness on its own initiative? That is the question before this Court in all three of the above-captioned cases, in which plaintiffs seek judgments against Iran for supporting al Qaeda's 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in East Africa. Generally, it is up to the defendant to raise a timeliness defense. However, the Court finds that respect for other sovereign nations, the Court's duty to independently assess claims of state-sponsored terrorism, and the practical effect of ignoring the statutory deadline weigh against granting default judgments against Iran on plainly untimely claims. Hence, for the reasons explained below, the Court will set aside the defaults and dismiss the claims against Iran in all three cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 7, 1998, two truck bombs detonated outside the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The bombs killed more than two hundred people and injured thousands more. Beginning in 2001, several groups of plaintiffs began to sue Iran and Sudan, alleging that they had provided material support to the al Qaeda terrorists who had carried out the attacks. (The Court will refer to these suits collectively as the \"\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   cases.\") The plaintiffs relied on the \"terrorism exception\" embedded in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201602\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 11, which eliminates immunity in cases seeking damages against designated state sponsors of terrorism for (among other things) providing \"material support or resources\" for acts of \"extrajudicial killing.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201605\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(7) (2006).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After initially defending in the first of the\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   cases, Sudan defaulted. Iran, meanwhile, never appeared, and so also defaulted. Following an ex parte hearing under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), the Court concluded that neither country was immune from suit, and that both were liable to the victims of the bombings.\n   <em>\n    Owens v. Republic of Sudan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3976359\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/826/128/#p157\">\n    826 F.Supp.2d 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 157 (D.D.C. 2011). The Court then referred the\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   cases to a number of special masters, who spent the next several years assessing what damages each of the hundreds of individual plaintiffs should be\n   awarded. Between March and October 2014, this Court entered final judgments in the\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   cases, awarding a total of over $10 billion in compensatory and punitive damages. On appeal by Sudan-which sought to reenter the cases after judgments were entered-the D.C. Circuit affirmed most of this Court's judgments against Sudan, but vacated the punitive damages award and certified a question of District of Columbia law to the D.C. Court of Appeals.\n   <em>\n    Owens v. Republic of Sudan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275860\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/751/#p825\">\n    864 F.3d 751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 825 (D.C. Cir. 2017). Because Iran never appeared, the judgments against it were not appealed; thus, the Court's 2014 decisions remain final as to Iran.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The three instant cases are nearly identical to the\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   cases, but were filed more than thirteen years later, in December 2014 (\n   <em>\n    Sheikh\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kinyua\n   </em>\n   ) and June 2015 (\n   <em>\n    Chogo\n   </em>\n   ). According to the allegations in the complaints, which the Court for now assumes are true, plaintiffs Farhat Mahmood Sheikh, Moses Magothe Kinyua, and Caleb Ndeda Chogo were victims of the Nairobi embassy bombing. Sheikh worked for the U.S. government and was killed in the blast. Compl. [\n   <em>\n    Sheikh\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1] \u00b6 9. Sheikh's estate, joined by his widow and children (all British citizens), alleged that Sudan and Iran were responsible for the bombing and are liable for Sheikh's death, his family's emotional distress, and their loss of Sheikh's society.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-22, 70-85. Kinyua also worked for the U.S. government and was killed in the blast. Compl. [\n   <em>\n    Kinyua\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1] \u00b6 9. Kinyua's brothers, sisters, and informally adopted son (all Kenyan citizens) alleged that Sudan and Iran were responsible for the bombing and are liable for their emotional distress and loss of Kinyua's society.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-24, 74-77. Chogo likewise worked for the U.S. government and was injured in the attack. Compl. [\n   <em>\n    Chogo\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1] \u00b6 9. He and forty-seven other alleged victims bring suit on their own behalf, along with ten family members of other alleged victims, alleging that Sudan and Iran were responsible for the bombing and are liable for assault and battery, emotional distress, aiding and abetting terrorism, and civil conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-66, 69-75, 150-168.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   By the time plaintiffs filed these cases, Sudan had begun participating in the various FSIA suits against it. After learning of the\n   <em>\n    Sheikh\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kinya\n   </em>\n   suits, Sudan moved to dismiss them both as untimely. The Court granted Sudan's motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sheikh v. Republic of Sudan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345626\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/172/124/#p132\">\n    172 F.Supp.3d 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 132 (D.D.C. 2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Iran, by contrast, has never appeared in any of the cases arising out of these bombings, including these three. The Court asked all three sets of plaintiffs to show cause why their claims against Iran should not also be dismissed as untimely,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Order [\n   <em>\n    Chogo\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 11]; Order [\n   <em>\n    Kinyua\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 29]; Order [\n   <em>\n    Sheikh\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 30], and plaintiffs in all three cases responded,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mem. Per Court's Mar. 24, 2016 Order to Show Cause Why This Action Should Not Be Dismissed (\"\n   <em>\n    Chogo\n   </em>\n   Mem.\") [\n   <em>\n    Chogo\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 12]; Pls.' Supp. Br.

Plaintiffs have also filed default judgment motions against Iran and the Iranian Ministry of Information and Security.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot. for Judicial Notice and for Entry of Default J. Against Iranian Defs. [\n   <em>\n    Chogo\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 24] [\n   <em>\n    Kinyua\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 27] [\n   <em>\n    Sheikh\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 28]. Those motions are fully briefed and ripe for joint decision, the issues in all three cases being effectively identical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Before it can reach the merits of plaintiffs' default judgment motions, the Court must determine whether it will consider the timeliness of their lawsuits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statute of limitations for claims brought under the terrorism exception to foreign sovereign immunity is codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(b). That provision reads, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   An action may be brought or maintained under this section if the action is commenced, or a related action was commenced under section 1605(a)(7) (before the date of the enactment of this section) ... not later than the latter of-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    (1)\n   </strong>\n   10 years after April 24, 1996; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    (2)\n   </strong>\n   10 years after the date on which the cause of action arose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(b). Thus, an action is timely if either the action itself is timely or a \"related action\" was timely. If the statute of limitations has run, but the defendant has not entered an appearance, the Court must decide whether to raise the timeliness issue sua sponte.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. These Actions Were Not Timely\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To be timely in their own right, these actions must have been commenced not later than either (1) April 24, 2006, or (2) \"10 years after the date on which the cause of action arose.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(b). The three actions were filed in December 2014 and June 2015, long after the April 24, 2006 deadline. Moreover, \"the plaintiffs' causes of action arose on August 7, 1998, the date of the embassy bombings\"; therefore, \"the last day to file a new action under \u00a7 1605A was August 7, 2008, ten years after the bombings.\"\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275860\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/751/#p825\">\n    864 F.3d at 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because plaintiffs did not file these actions until more than six years after that deadline, none were timely under \u00a7 1605A(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Nor were any of the cases related to another timely action. The FSIA allows plaintiffs to hitch their wagons to another suit that was timely filed under the predecessor provisions to the NDAA if the cases \"aris[e] out of the same act or incident,\" and if plaintiffs filed \"within 60 days of the entry of judgment in the original action or of the enactment of the NDAA, whichever was later.\"\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275860\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/751/#p825\">\n    864 F.3d at 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting NDAA \u00a7 1083(c)(3) ). Plaintiffs in all three actions point to the\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   cases as the ones to which these actions are \"related.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sheikh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345626\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/172/124/#p132\">\n    172 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   131 ; Chogo Mem. at 11. The instant cases arise out of the same incident as did the\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   cases: the 1998 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. However, the Court has already determined that the\n   <em>\n    Sheikh\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kinyua\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs did not file within sixty days of the judgments in any of the\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   cases that had themselves been filed under the relevant predecessor provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sheikh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345626\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/172/124/#p132\">\n    172 F.Supp.3d at 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Chogo plaintiffs, meanwhile, filed their suit seven months after\n   <em>\n    Sheikh\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kinyua\n   </em>\n   , even further from the sixty-day deadline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the\n   D.C. Circuit denied Sudan's attempt to vacate the\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   judgments, there is no new judgment on which plaintiffs can hang their hats.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Chogo Mem. at 11 (\"If the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia agrees with Sudan, then a new judgment will be entered, thereby making the complaints filed in this case timely under Section 1083(c)(3).\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Because none of the instant cases are either timely in their own right or related to timely-filed actions, all three run afoul of the FSIA's statute of limitations. The question remains: what, if anything, should be done about that?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Court Will Exercise Its Discretion to Dismiss the Claims Against Iran\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Statutes of limitations are affirmative defenses, meaning that normally a defendant must explicitly raise the issue early on.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Hence, the\n   Court's unusual gatekeeper role supports looking at the statute of limitations here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Finally, there are good practical reasons for bringing up timeliness sua sponte. The Worley court declined to exercise its discretion to dismiss sua sponte because it felt that Iran had to \"take the consequences\" of its choice not to appear.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231991\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/75/311/#p331\">\n    75 F.Supp.3d at 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs argue that the same logic should apply here, given that Iran is perfectly happy to litigate cases that do not involve terrorism charges. Chogo Mem. at 7-11; Kinyua Mem. at 3-4; Sheikh Mem. at 5-6. But plaintiffs in FSIA cases are making conscious strategic decisions as well. And without some policing of time limits, plaintiffs may seek to exploit prior default decisions finding nations liable for certain conduct to later pursue large damages awards decades after the fact. Worley itself illustrates this concern. The plaintiffs in that case sued Iran in December 2012 for its role in the October 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut-a twenty-nine-year gap between injury and complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Worley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231991\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/75/311/#p331\">\n    75 F.Supp.3d at 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To find liability, the court relied on evidence from a case decided a decade earlier.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231991\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/75/311/#p331\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231991\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/75/311/#p331\">\n    at 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In this way, plaintiffs can continue piggybacking off of older decisions for decades to extract multimillion dollar judgments from absent sovereigns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For how long should such claims be allowed? From the standpoint of the judicial branch, only two principled time limits present themselves: either the ten-year statute of limitations Congress has imposed, or no time limit at all. After all, if a sixteen-year (or a twenty-nine-year) gap is acceptable, there is little reason to prohibit suits brought forty, fifty, or more years after the fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The claimants could easily glean evidence of a defendant's culpability by dusting off old volumes of the Federal Supplement.

The possibility of nearly endless litigation takes on a new and more troubling dimension when paired with the murky foreign policy consequences of enabling untimely judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Ultimately, considering the timeliness of an FSIA claim sua sponte is a discretionary determination, and it is justified in this instance. The Court's decision today ignores neither \"the fundamental rule that statutes of limitations are generally treated as affirmative defenses that may be waived,\" nor \"Congress's determination that the statute of limitations is not a requirement for exercise of subject matter jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Worley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231991\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/75/311/#p331\">\n    75 F.Supp.3d at 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, it leavens those concerns with a respect for Congress's choice to set time limits on other sovereigns' liability-and, more generally, for the delicate balance Congress has struck in the FSIA between comity and culpability.

Like all state sponsors of terrorism, Iran is liable to American victims of the crimes it has committed or abetted. Yet as long as it remains a state, Iran is entitled to a certain baseline of respect from American courts. Particularly given the fraught relationship between the United States and Iran, courts must take seriously both the comity due between nations and the duty to independently scrutinize default judgment claims under the FSIA. Hence, for the reasons explained above, the Court will deny plaintiffs' motions for default judgments and instead dismiss the claims against Iran as untimely in all three cases. Because the Court has already dismissed the Sheikh and Kinyua plaintiffs' claims against Sudan, their actions will be dismissed with prejudice. The Chogo plaintiffs have yet to receive return of service from Sudan nearly two years after serving process, perhaps because of prior confusion among Sudan's counsel over who was to be served.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice Per\n   Court's Feb. 16, 2018 Order. The Chogo plaintiffs therefore will have one month to serve process once more, either through Sudan's counsel or directly to Sudan itself. A separate order to this effect will issue in each of these cases.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Congress later amended this exception, codifying the new version at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A.
