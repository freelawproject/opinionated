In order to properly assess Plaintiffs' claims and Defendants' arguments, the court begins with a discussion of the history of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield organization and the trademarks (the \"Blue Marks\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the Great Depression, the majority of the population was medically underserved because most people simply could not afford hospital and medical care. (Docs. # 1349 at 11; 1431 at 14; 1435 at 10, n. 4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, local hospitals and medical societies developed prepaid plans to serve Americans' healthcare needs in local areas. (Docs. # 1349 at 11; 1431 at 14; 1435 at 10). On occasion, a subscriber prepaid at one hospital but desired services from a different hospital at the time of illness. To remedy this problem, multi-hospital plans became the norm. (Docs. # 1349 at 11; 1431 at 15; 1435 at 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   By 1939, the American Hospital Association (\"AHA\") issued \"Standards for Non-Profit Hospital Service Plans.\" (Doc. # 1350-13). Under these standards, approval by the AHA's Commission on Hospital Service gave a Plan \"permission to identify the plan by using the seal of the American Hospital Association superimposed upon a blue cross.\" (Docs. # 1350-13 at 5-6; Doc. # 1353-19 at 6). The approval program for Blue Cross Plans was controlled by the Blue Cross Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Doc. # 1353-5 at 11-12). The AHA standards discouraged the establishment of new Plans where the community was already being \"adequately served by existing Blue Cross Plans.\" (Doc. # 1353-5 at 14). The Blue Cross Commission promoted one Plan per service area to reduce administrative costs through economies of scale, as well as to reduce health care costs by obtaining participation of hospitals on more favorable terms to the Plans. (Doc. # 1431-29 at 13-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The American Medical Association (\"AMA\") also approved the concept of prepayment plans, and promulgated approval standards for such plans. (Docs. # 1349 at 12; 1431 at 15; 1435 at 13). The AMA set up the Associated Medical Care Plans (\"AMCP\") \"to administer the approval program\" for Blue Shield Plans. (Doc. # 1353-7 at 84-85). Medical care plans that met the AMA/AMCP's standards likewise could use a blue shield emblazoned with a caduceus. (Docs. # 1353-20 at 16; 1431 at 15; 1435 at 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The taxation of excess profits and the freezing of wage rates during World War II stimulated employer participation in paying the cost of hospitalization and other medical protection for employees. This change enabled employers to give a small wage increase to their employees at very little net cost to themselves by paying part or all of the cost of group health insurance. (Doc. # 1353-4 at 76). After the war, the Taft-Hartley Act established health benefits as a condition of employment (Doc. # 1353-7 at 93), and the National Labor Relations Board ruled that health insurance was \"a mandatory subject of collective bargaining.\"\n   <em>\n    Cross, W.W., &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20N.L.R.B.%201162\">\n    77 N.L.R.B. 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1948).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 1947, in an effort to better compete with commercial insurance companies for employer-sponsored plans, Plans started experimenting with syndicates. (Doc. # 1353-7 at 94). Under these arrangements, a Plan in a state where a company's home office was located negotiated benefits at a certain price. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plans in other regions or states where the company had operations were given the details of the arrangement, and those Plans could choose to participate in the arrangement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The \"Home\" Plan guaranteed full delivery to the company and accepted all or part of the underwriting risk, depending on the cooperating Plans' agreed participation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"Within five years, some 250 syndicates were providing coverage to about 1.2 million people.\" (Doc. # 1353-7 at 94). By working together, Plans were able to service national accounts, including the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program. (Doc. # 1353-1 at 16; 1431 at 18; 1435 at 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 1972, the AHA transferred ownership of the Blue Cross Marks to the Blue Cross Association. (Doc. # 1349-1 at 32). On a separate track, the AMA-sponsored AMCP changed its name to the Blue Shield Medical Care Plans, then it became the National Association of Blue Shield Plans, and then later the Blue Shield Association. (Doc. # 1349-1 at 32-33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At some point in the 1970s, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Associations concluded that the Blue System needed cohesive national unity, which they believed could be achieved by working together. (Doc. # 1353-55 at 2). The staffs of the two associations began to consolidate in 1977 or 1978 (Doc. # 1349-1 at 33), but the associations did not legally merge until 1981 or 1982. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The associations merged in order to reduce duplication, increase efficiency, reduce administrative costs, enjoy economies of scale, and achieve greater coherence in the Blue Cross and Blue Shield system. (Doc. # 1353-10 at 80). At that time, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and Marks were brought under the control of one\n   organization, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association (\"the Association\"), which was governed by its Member Plans. (Doc. # 1352-43 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   By the early 1980s, the Blue System was suffering from declining reserves, increasing financial instability, decreasing customer satisfaction, and declining business volume. (Doc. # 1349-7 at 9-24). According to the 1982 Long-Term Business Strategy, the Blue Plans viewed \"collective strength\" as their \"only real defense\" against business declines. (Doc. # 1349-7 at 23-24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. History of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Marks\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In 1934, the St. Paul hospital Plan began using a blue cross symbol. (Docs. # 1349 at 11; 1431 at 15; 1435 at 11). The first use of the Blue Shield Service Mark was by the Western New York Plan, located in Buffalo, New York, in 1939. (Doc. # 1350-35 at 2). Other Plans began using these same symbols as well. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Docs. # 1349 at 11; 1431 at 15; 1435 at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Both the St. Paul and Buffalo Plans acquiesced in, and even encouraged, other Plans to use the Cross and Shield Marks during this time period. (Docs. # 1349 at 11; 1431 at 15; 1435 at 12). The St. Paul Plan allowed Plans in every bordering state (North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Iowa) to use the Blue Cross Marks. (Doc. # 1353-4 at 29-30). The Buffalo Plan allowed Plans in Syracuse and Rochester (locations close to Buffalo) as well as other Plans in New York to use the Blue Shield Mark. (Doc. # 1353-5 at 38).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Between 1939 and 1947, the Shield Mark was used by various organizations for intrastate non-profit prepaid medical plans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In 1946, the Commission of Associated Medical Care Plans was formed by certain medical plans. (Doc. # 1350-35 at 2). The Blue Shield Medical Care Plans is the successor to AMCP. (Doc. # 1432 at 15). On December 13, 1947, the Blue Shield Medical Care Plans (the \"National Organization\") formally adopted the Shield Mark as the official service mark for the Organization. (Docs. # 1350-35 at 2; 1353-48). Thereafter, in 1950, Blue Shield Medical Care Plans applied for federal registration of the Blue Shield Marks. (Docs. # 1353-46; Doc. # 1353-48). The Blue Shield Medical Plans had permission from the first user, the Buffalo Plan, to apply for registration. (Docs. # 1353-101; 1436-11 at 135-40). After the application for federal registration, on December 1, 1952, the users of the Shield Mark entered into an Agreement (the \"1952 Agreement\") relating to the Collective Service Mark \"Blue Shield.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. # 1352-227 at 24). Although the Plans \"recogni[zed] that the words 'Blue Shield' and the identifying symbol\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   the property of the National Organization,\" the 1952 Agreement is silent as to the assignment of any rights in the Shield Mark to the National Organization. (Doc. # 1353-48 at 3) (emphasis added). It is also silent as to the creation and/or existence of any exclusive service areas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Under the 1952 Agreement, the Blue Shield Plans were granted \"permission\" to use the Blue Shield Marks in interstate and foreign commerce. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Previously, in 1947 and 1948, the AHA applied for and received federal registrations for the Blue Cross Marks, stating that it had adopted and was using the Marks. (Docs. # 1350-40, 1530-41, and 1530-42). However, at that time, the AHA did not have an assignment from the first user, the St. Paul Plan, and did not receive a formal assignment of the rights to the Blue Cross Mark until 1954. (Doc. # 1436-11\n   at 56-57). After registering the Blue Cross Mark, the AHA had existing Plans sign License Agreements. (Doc. # 1353-11 at 7-8).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The License Agreements for four Plans-Connecticut, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Rockford, Illinois-were subject to exceptions. (Docs. # 1353-11 at 8; 1353-101). Those Plans retained the right to their state registrations of the Blue Cross name and Mark. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Hospital Service Corporation of Alabama, the predecessor to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama, first used the Blue Cross Mark in 1939. (Doc. # 1431-91 at 98). It first used the Blue Shield Mark in 1947. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Structure of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Organization\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At present, the Blue Plans are 36 independent companies and each company sells health insurance. (Docs. # 1351 at 10; 1432 at 17). The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association itself does not underwrite any insurance policies. (Docs. # 1351 at 11; 1432 at 17; 1556 at 9). The governance structure of the Association is set out in its bylaws, which were approved by a vote of the Member Plans. (Docs. # 1351 at 11; 1432 at 17; 1556 at 9; 1532-6). The Plans are governing members of the Association. (Docs. # 1352-39 at 46-47; 1352-6 at 12-14). The Plans may amend or repeal the bylaws and adopt new bylaws. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Each Member Plan has also agreed to be bound by the Association Rules. (Docs. # 1350 at 12; 1432 at 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Association's bylaws recognize that each of its Member Plans is autonomous in its operations. (Docs. # 1351 at 10; 1432 at 17; 1556 at 9; 1532-6). The Plans are financially independent entities. (Docs. # 1556 at 9; 1352-6 at 7). The Blue Cross and Blue Shield License Agreements provide, \"Nothing herein contained shall be construed to constitute the parties hereto as partners or joint venturers....\" (Doc. # 1350-4 at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Association is led by a Chief Executive Officer and President who, together with an executive team, are responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Association. (Docs. # 1352-39 at 46-47; 1352-6). The Association's Board of Directors is comprised of the CEO of each of the Member Plans plus the CEO of the Association. (Docs. # 1432 at 18; 1352-6). By majority vote, the Association Board of Directors elects the President of the Association on an annual basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Association Board may also remove the President of the Association by majority vote. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Blue Plan CEOs have fiduciary responsibilities to both their individual Plan and the Association. (Docs. # 1352-41 at 29-30; 1436-75 at 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Membership Standards of the Association are adopted and amended by an affirmative vote of three-fourths of Plans and an affirmative vote of three-fourths of the total then current weighted vote of all Plans (a \"double-three-quarters\" vote). (Docs. # 1432 at 11, 19; 1352-127 at 11). The Member Plans may also amend the Association bylaws (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), and the Association's Rules can be eliminated, by a double-three-quarters vote of the Plans. (Doc. # 1432 at 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In 1972, the AHA transferred ownership of the Blue Cross Marks to the Blue Cross Association. (Docs. # 1353-57 at 2; 1432 at 15-16). Blue Cross Plans then signed a license agreement with the Blue Cross Association. (Doc. # 1353-11 at 8). Those 1972 license agreements provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The rights hereby granted are exclusive to Plan within the geographical area served by the Plan on the effective date\n   of this License Agreement, except that BCA itself reserves the right to use the Licensed Marks and Licensed Name in said area, and except to the extent that said area may overlap the area or areas served by one or more other licensed Blue Cross Plans on the effective date of this License Agreement, as to which overlapping areas the rights hereby granted are non-exclusive as to such other Plan or Plans only.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (Doc. # 1353-100 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In 1982, the Blue Shield Association (the successor to Blue Shield Medical Care Plans) and the Blue Cross Association merged into the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. (Doc. # 1432 at 16). As a result of the merger, the Association now owns the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and Marks (the \"Blue Marks\"), and it in turn grants licenses to the Member Plans to use the Blue Marks. (Doc. # 1352-41 at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Today, each Plan has signed a License Agreement with the Association. (Docs. # 1352-49 through 1352-128). Each of these License Agreements identifies an exclusive \"service area\" where a Member Plan may use the Blue Marks. (Docs. # 1352-49 through 1352-128; 1432 at 11, 19-20). The Association has a \"Map Book\" which memorializes the Plans' defined service areas. (Docs. # 1432 at 20; 1352-164 at 52-53, 241-46, 270). Under the License Agreements, subject to certain exceptions related to National Accounts and Government Programs, the Plans agreed that a \"Plan may not use the Licensed Marks and Name outside the Service Area ....\" (Docs. # 1432 at 11, 20; 1352-127; 1352-49 through 1352-128).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Under the License Agreements, the Association may impose monetary fines on a Plan that uses the Blue Marks outside its service area. (Docs. # 1351 at 19; 1432 at 21). After thirty days' written notice and an opportunity to be heard, on a double-three-quarters vote, a Plan's License Agreement may be terminated for continued use of the Marks outside the Plan's service area. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The License Agreements themselves can be modified or terminated by a \"double-three-quarters\" vote of the Plans. (Docs. # 1352-49 through 1352-128).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Also under the License Agreements, the Association's rules, or both, a Plan generally may not develop a provider network or contract with a healthcare provider outside its service area for services to be provided under the Blue Marks. (Docs. # 1350 at 12; 1432 at 11). However, a Plan may contract with a healthcare provider in a county contiguous to the Plan's service area under certain defined conditions and for limited purposes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). A Plan may also contract with certain types of providers nationwide, such as laboratories, durable medical equipment providers, and specialty pharmacies, but medical professionals, hospitals, and outpatient facilities are not among these types. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    D. History of Service Areas\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   There have been efforts to enforce exclusivity of the Plans' service areas, but some competition between Plans has been a fact of life from the earliest days of the Blues' organization. (Doc. # 1353-4 at 50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Since in the 1940s, the service areas of each Plan have been recorded, initially in three-ring binders called service manuals. (Doc. # 1352-164 at 52-53, 241-46, 270). The three-ring service manuals have been replaced by Map Books. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The 1976 version of the Map Book, for example, notes that the area served by the Blue Shield Plan in Alabama was the entire state of Alabama. (Doc. # 1433-7 at 2). These Map Books are not public record. They are considered by the Association to be \"highly sensitive,\" are not distributed to the Plans, and are distributed only to a\n   limited number of employees. (Doc. # 1553-3 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The majority of the Plans' service areas are exclusive,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , they do not overlap with another Plan's service area. (Doc. # 1432 at 11). In some cases, however, Blue Plans have overlapping service areas. For example, the following overlaps exist:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \u2022 Anthem Blue Cross offers Commercial Health Insurance Coverage across California, in the same geographic region as Blue Shield of California.

(Docs. # 1436-79 at 8; 1436-81 at 11).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   There have been other instances of overlapping service areas for the Blue Cross Mark (at least for some periods of time) in Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia. (Docs. # 1350-27 &amp; 1350-28). There have been other instances of overlapping service areas for the Blue Shield Mark (again, at least for some periods of time) in Illinois, Ohio, and Wisconsin. (Docs. # 1350-27 &amp; 1350-28). Currently, in California, Idaho, and Pennsylvania, different Plans have the right to use different Marks, one the Cross and the other the Shield. In Washington, Plans have licenses to use different Marks, except in one county where two Plans have licenses to use the Shield Mark. In New York, there are fourteen counties with multiple licensees, but in half of those counties, the rights are to different Marks. In Georgia and Ohio, one Plan has a statewide license to use the Blue Marks, and another has a license in a small number of counties. (Doc. # 1432 at 12-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In September 1985, Community Mutual Insurance Company (\"CMIC\") began marketing and selling health insurance under the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Marks in Ohio. (Doc. # 1429-9 at 21). The Association filed a Complaint against CMIC seeking\n   to enjoin CMIC's marketing and sales outside of its exclusive service area (\"ESA\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Although a temporary restraining order was issued, after an evidentiary hearing, the Association's request for a preliminary injunction against CMIC was denied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Ohio Attorney General intervened in the lawsuit and asserted a counterclaim alleging that the Association's system of allocating ESAs violated antitrust laws. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Association agreed to dismiss its claims against CMIC if the counterclaim against it was dismissed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). As a condition of that settlement, the Association agreed, for a period of time, not to pursue litigation seeking to enforce the ESAs against any of the Ohio Plans. (Doc. # 1429-9 at 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In the 1980s, the Attorney General of Maryland also sued the Association, alleging that its use of ESAs violated federal and state antitrust laws. (Doc. # 1350-21 at 2). The Association agreed to a settlement that allowed two Plans to compete using the Blue Marks throughout the State of Maryland until \"completion of the Assembly of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans\" or January 1, 1991, whichever was later. (Doc. # 1350-21 at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Prior to January 1988, West Virginia had two Blue Plans which were licensed in mutually exclusive service areas in West Virginia. (Doc. # 1551 at 12). These Plans violated the terms of their License Agreements by competing in each other's service areas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Neither Plan objected to the competition. (Doc. # 1431-4 at 2). Nevertheless, the Association considered various options to address the situation, including a merger between the Plans. (Doc. # 1431-4 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   CEOs of the various Blues have had occasion to address ESAs. For example, a summary of conversations with four Blue CEOs in 1986 recognized that \"[t]he major advantage of an exclusive franchise area was seen in the lessening of competition as well as the opportunity to discuss plans and proposals with companies in the same industry knowing that those ideas would not be used against you.\" (Doc. # 1436-12). And in interviews conducted by the Association in which questions about ESAs were asked, Plan CEOs stated that ESAs create \"[l]arger market share because other Blues stay out and do not fragment the market\" (Doc. # 1350-22 at 3), and allow for aggressive bargaining. (Doc. # 1350-23 at 3). \"In turn, national accounts enjoy local discounts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). One CEO reported that \"Plans benefit from the exclusive service areas because it eliminates competition from other Blue Plans\" and that without service areas, \"there would be open warfare.\" (Doc. # 1350-24 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The discovery to this point in the case, while broad, has focused particularly on Alabama. As of 2016, nine Plans, other than Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama (\"BCBSA\"), had at least 10,000 members who resided in Alabama: Anthem (150,912); HCSC (97,497); Highmark (45,234); BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee (37,111); Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan (29,579); USAble Mutual Insurance Company (Arkansas) (22,705); BCBSM (Minnesota) (16,834); Horizon Healthcare Services (New Jersey) (11,357); and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina (10,192). In total, these Plans had in excess of 400,000 members residing in Alabama. (Docs. # 1350 at 17-18; 1432 at 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    E. History of Blue Rules\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Over the past three decades, the Blue Plans and the Association have adopted several strategies and Association rules that are relevant to the Sherman Act claims at issue in this MDL. The court discusses certain of these strategies below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    i. 1982 Long-Term Business Strategy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   At the Association's 1982 annual meeting, a \"Long-Term Business Strategy\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   was presented to the Plans. (Docs. # 1350-15 at 3; 1352-164 at 80-84). In his presentation at the meeting, the Chairman of the Joint Executive Committee, who was appointed to work on an integrated business strategy, reported that \"he would try to persuade members that they could not sustain the status quo and that fundamental change is the only realistic option.\" (Doc. # 1350-15 at 3). The Plans adopted several recommendations contained in the Long-Term Business Strategy, including requiring consolidation and allowing only one Plan per state. (Docs. # 1350-15 at 3; 1352-164 at 80-84). Proposition 1.1 of the Strategy was approved in November 1984 and provided that \"[a]ll Plans to be joint Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans, except when needs dictate otherwise, by the end of 1985.\" (Docs. # 1350-15 at 3; 1350-18 at 3; 1352-164 at 80-84). Proposition 1.2 of the Strategy, which was also adopted, stated that there should be \"[o]nly one Plan per State, except when the Association Board of Directors agrees that business needs dictate otherwise, by the end of 1985.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. 1985 Assembly of Plans\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Assembly of Plans sought to examine and redefine the relationship among the various Plans as well as between the Plans and the Association. (Doc. # 1349-10 at 11-12). In 1990, the Assembly of Plans made recommendations to the Blue Plans regarding Service Marks and ESAs. (Doc. # 1349-8 at 3). Those recommendations included the proposal that the Blue Cross License Agreements and the Blue Shield License Agreements be revised to be essentially identical. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The proposal would involve supplementation of the Blue Cross License Agreement. (Doc. # 1349-8 at 31). But the Blue Shield Agreement was to be essentially replaced with the Blue Cross Agreement, rather than supplemented, as the earlier Shield version \"was prepared at a stage when licensing was in its infancy.\" (Docs. # 1349-8 at 31-32; 1353-48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The revised 1991 Blue Cross License Agreements resulting from the Assembly of Plans contain the following provision regarding service areas:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   The rights hereby granted are exclusive to Plan within the geographical area(s) served by the Plan on June 30, 1972, and/or as to which the Plan has been so granted a subsequent license, which is hereby defined as the \"Service Area,\" except that BCBSA reserves the right to use the Licensed Marks and Licensed Name in said Service Area, and except to the extent that said Service Area may overlap the area or areas served by one or more other licensed Blue Cross Plans as of said date or subsequent license, as to which overlapping areas the rights hereby granted are nonexclusive as to such other Plan or Plans only.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   (Docs. # 1349-8 at 7, 1349-11 at 5). The new Blue Shield License Agreement resulting from the Assembly of Plans contains a virtually identical provision. (Doc. # 1349-8 at 54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   After the advent of the LTBS and AOP, the number of Blue Plans decreased from 114 in 1980, to 77 in 1990, and stands at 36 today. (Doc. # 1350-19 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. The Development of the BlueCard Program\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In 1992, the BlueCard program was developed to, at least in part, address inefficiencies in the cooperative methods employed by the Blue Plans, including the lack of a uniform process, dissatisfaction of providers with their receivables, and customer confusion. (Docs. # 1348-6 at 20-21; 1353-53 at 156-68). Under BlueCard, Plans were required to make their local provider discounts available to all Blue Members, even if they lived in another Plan's service area. (Doc. # 1352-44 at 56).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In 1995, Member Plans adopted a license standard requiring all Plans to participate\n   in BlueCard. (Doc. # 1352-44 at 56). Following the adoption of BlueCard, Blue enrollment ceased declining and started increasing. (Doc. # 1353-68 at 12). BlueCard allowed the Blue Plans to provide subscribers a single point of contact like insureds enjoyed with the national insurers. (Doc. # 1353-61 at 2). BlueCard was another avenue that allowed the Plans to offer nationwide coverage. (Doc. # 1431-66 at 226-27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Through the BlueCard program, the Plans have agreed that when a contracted provider treats a patient covered by a Home Plan,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a Plan outside the service area in which the provider is located, the Home Plan will reimburse the provider at a rate which equals (at a minimum) the levels received for providers under the provider's contract with its Host Plan,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the local Plan. (Docs. 1350 at 13; 1432 at 11). That is, \"[i]n all cases, the [Host Plan] must pass the full amount of the discount/differential received from the provider to the [Home Plan].\" (Doc. # 1433-1 at 3). Under BlueCard Rules, an access fee may be charged in connection with processing BlueCard claims, but that fee can be, and is frequently, negotiated or waived. (Docs. # 1433-1 at 8; 1433-12 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   BlueCard is not a \"product\" which is sold on its own. (Doc. # 1556 at 12). A customer cannot buy access to the BlueCard network without buying a health product. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Further, participation in the BlueCard program is a requirement of the License Agreement between the Association and each individual Plan. (Doc. # 1432 at 12). However, under the Association Rules, a Plan could create a provider network that is not made available to BlueCard-eligible Members or Subscribers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   There is specific evidence in the Rule 56 record about BlueCard's effect in Alabama. In the 1980s, prior to the adoption of the BlueCard program, BCBS-AL contracted with twenty-nine providers in counties contiguous to Alabama. (Doc. # 1350-33 at 3-5). At some point, BCBS-AL stopped directly contracting with those providers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The cessation of direct contracting provided savings for customers for the snapshot in time which was examined. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. 1993 License Agreement Standard 11\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In 1993, License Agreement Standard 11 was adopted by a double-three-quarters vote. (Docs. # 1351 at 20; 1352-183 at 46; 1432 at 22). Standard 11 is titled \"Transactions Which May Impair the Value of the Marks and Name.\" (Doc. # 1352-183 at 44). That Standard provides that \"[n]either a Plan nor any Larger Controlled Affiliate shall cause or permit an entity other than a Plan or a Licensed Controlled Affiliate thereof to obtain control of the Plan or Larger Controlled Affiliate or to acquire a substantial portion of its assets related to licensable services.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Standard 11 also sets forth certain requirements a Blue Plan must meet to transfer its license to a non-Blue entity. (Docs. # 1351 at 20; 1352-183 at 46; 1432 at 22). When Standard 11 applies, Blue rules provide that a Plan's license may be terminated if the requirements of the Standard are not met. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    v. 1994 Local Best Efforts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In 1994, the Association and the Plans adopted the Local Best Efforts Rule. (Docs. # 1349-15 at 20-21; 1349-16 at 7). Under the Local Best Efforts Rule, at least eighty percent of a Plan's annual health\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   revenue from within its designated\n   service area must be derived from services offered under the Blue Marks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    vi. 1996 Acquisition Rules\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In 1996, the Association and the Plans adopted acquisition rules to restrict the circumstances under which an adverse party could acquire a Plan. (Docs. # 1349-17 at 17; 1349-18 at 4). These rules prevent a Plan from transferring its license to a non-Blue entity without meeting certain standards. (Doc. # 1349-16 at 16-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    vii. 1999 Uncoupling Regulations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In 1999, the Association and the Plans adopted Uncoupling Regulations. (Doc. # 1352-1 at 91). Under these Regulations, a Plan may choose to use a name in connection with the Blue Marks; however, if it does so, it may not thereafter \"uncouple\" that name from the Blue Marks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). For example, a Plan may call itself Acme Blue Cross and Blue Shield, but it may not later use the trade name Acme Health Insurance - it must keep the \"Blue\" in the trade name. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    viii. 2005 National Best Efforts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In 2005, a National Best Efforts rule was adopted. (Doc. # 1349-21 at 5). This rule requires a Plan to derive at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent of its national health insurance revenue under its Blue brands. (Doc. # 1349-16 at 7). Thus, under the National Best Efforts rule, any health revenue a Blue Plan may generate from services offered under any non-Blue brand is limited in relation to its Blue brand health revenue. (Doc. # 1432 at 20-21). Nonetheless, many Plans have had significant unbranded business. (Docs. # 1349-23 at 5; 1349-25 at 5-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    ix. National Accounts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Under the License Agreements, the Association's rules, or both, a Plan may not bid on a National Account headquartered outside its service area using the Blue Marks unless the Plan in whose service area the National Account is headquartered agrees to \"cede\" the right to bid. (Docs. # 1350 at 11; 1432 at 11). In the limited instances of overlapping service areas, more than one Plan may bid for the business of a National Account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plans, including Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama, have requested cedes from each other. (Docs. # 1350 at 11; 1432 at 12). Some of these requests have been granted and some have been denied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On occasion, a Blue Plan will pay another Plan to cede the right to bid for a national account. (Docs. # 1431-1 at 28; 1551 at 12). Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama has done so multiple times. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Through collaboration, Plans compete with national insurers for national accounts. (Doc. # 1353-60 at 2). In 2011, the Blue share of the national account market was estimated at forty-six percent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The top three national insurers-Aetna, Cigna and United-which offer healthcare financing plans and/or health insurance and related services in all fifty states (Docs. # 1350 at 18; 1432 at 17), had a combined share of forty-one percent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. # 1353-60 at 2). Plans also compete with regional insurers. (Doc. # 1353-102 at 54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Present Day Blue Plans\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In 2015, fifteen of the Blue Plans were within the top twenty-five insurers in the United States as measured by total membership. (Docs. # 1350 at 18; 1432 at 17). Anthem was the second largest insurer in the country by membership and held Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licenses in fourteen different states. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). HCSC was the fourth or fifth largest insurer in the country\n   by membership and held Blue Cross and Blue Shield licenses in five states. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Other Blue Plans are among the top ten insurers by membership. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama is the largest insurer in Alabama, and the sixteenth largest insurer in the nation by membership. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   One of BCBS-AL's corporate representatives, Tony Carter, testified that he defined BCBS-AL's competitors as follows: \"in the broadest of sense, a competitor is anybody that sells a similar product.\" (Doc. # 1352-211 at 14, 44). When speaking about Anthem's proposed merger with Cigna, and in relation to the prospect of competing for national accounts outside of its fourteen-Blue service area, a representative of Anthem testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   [O]ur current market is confined to the 14 states. We have the Blue Cross/Blue Shield license, and we have any number of customers and consultants that express an interest in working with us, and we're prohibited from doing that. To be able to go from-I know we're a national plan. We're a national plan that operates in 14 states. To be an [sic] national plan that operates in 50 states and have unfettered access, without asking permission to have a conversation with a prospect, would be-I don't know-exhilarating, I would say.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   (Doc. # 945-1 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Nationwide, 96 percent of hospitals and 92 percent of physicians are in-network with the Blue Plans. (Docs. # 1353-82 at 6; 1435 at 27). Some subscribers have chosen to contract with the Blues and have favorable comments about the experience (Docs. # 1353-85 at 76-77; 1353-73 at 83), while others have complaints (Docs. # 1431-77 at 182-83; 1431-83 at 97, 258-59). Still others have expressed an interest in additional options and/or more competition for their health insurance needs. (Docs. # 1436-69 at 177-79; 1436-56 at 99).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Over the years, certain Plan executives have expressed a concern that the ESAs violate antitrust laws. (Docs. # 1352-214 at 3; 1352-218 at 2; 1352-219 at 3; 1431-12 at 2; 1431-25 at 3; 1436-6 at 2). They have also expressed similar concerns about the Best Efforts Rules. (Docs. # 1352-219 at 3, 1436-8 at 2; 1336-5 at 24; 1436-87 at 3; 1436-87 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

There is also evidence that, among the Plans, even with respect to this particular \"function,\" there are deep disagreements about whether service areas based on the Marks should be exclusive. Defendants' own documents show that certain Blue Plan CEOs believed that they could have protected the Marks without the ESAs. (Doc. # 1352-227 at 69). And, not all common law marks were exclusive.

The Blues' Geographic Market Allocations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Plaintiffs' first Section 1 theory is that the Defendant Blue Plans committed a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   violation of the Sherman Act when they agreed to allocate geographic markets for the sale of commercial health insurance and/or commercial healthcare financing services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docs. # 1082 at \u00b6 815; 1083 at \u00b6\u00b6 340, 469). Provider Plaintiffs also claim that the Blue Plans allocated geographic markets for the purpose of contracting with health care service providers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 1083 at \u00b6\u00b6 323, 469). Both Provider and Subscriber Plaintiffs argue that the geographic market allocations constitute\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   anticompetitive conduct under\n   <em>\n    Sealy\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Topco\n   </em>\n   .

First, they insist that the Association's rules, including the ESAs, have plausible procompetitive benefits because they have facilitated the creation of new and unique products. (Doc. # 1349 at 35-41). Second, Defendants claim that the ESAs are procompetitive because they \"incentivize Plans to focus on local needs of their members and providers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41-42). Third, they argue that courts lack experience with the types of service areas at issue in this case because the service areas \"arose organically\" from the predecessors to the current Plans use of common law trademarks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45-47). Fourth, Defendants contend\n   <em>\n    Topco\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Sealy\n   </em>\n   are distinguishable from the service areas at issue here because (1) the Blue Plans productively cooperate, (2) the Plans owned common law trademark rights in their service areas before the challenged agreement was formed, (3) the Plans have never entered into a naked price fixing agreement like the one in\n   <em>\n    Sealy\n   </em>\n   , (4) the commercial health insurance industry is more complex than the industries at issue in\n   <em>\n    Sealy\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Topco\n   </em>\n   , and (5) the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Sealy\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Topco\n   </em>\n   \"actively modified territories throughout the conspiracy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47-49). Finally, Defendants assert that the challenged restraints are not purely horizontal because some restraints are historically the product of vertical arrangements between insurance plans and the AHA or AMA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 52-53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Plaintiffs insist that the Blue Plans' ESAs qualify as\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   anticompetitive conduct under\n   <em>\n    Topco\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Sealy\n   </em>\n   . While, to be sure, several similarities exist between the market allocations here and those presented in\n   <em>\n    Topco\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Sealy\n   </em>\n   , the court need not decide whether the Blue Plans' service\n   area allocations alone constitute a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   violation of Section 1. This is the case because, like\n   <em>\n    Sealy\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs have presented evidence of an aggregation of competitive restraints-namely, the adoption of ESAs\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   , among other things, best efforts rules-which, considered together, constitute a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   violation of the Sherman Act. The court explains the reasoning behind this conclusion below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Association is a Licensee-Controlled Entity, Not a Vertical Licensor\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The Blues contend that the Association is a vertical licensor and therefore the court is presented with vertical restraints, not horizontal ones. But that argument is off the mark. The Association's own bylaws demonstrate that the Association is funded and controlled by the Blue Plans, who receive licenses to use the Blue Marks. The licensees are deemed regular members of the Association and pay monthly dues to the Association that are set by a three-quarters licensee vote. (Doc. # 1352-6 at 7, 9). The Association's Board of Directors consists of the CEOs of all licensee Plans and the president of the Association. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13).\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sealy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168492\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/388/350/\">\n    388 U.S. at 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168492\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/388/350/\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that Sealy's directors had to either be a stockholder or a stockholder's nominee). A director can only be removed by a three-quarters vote of the other licensees and a three-quarters weighted vote of the licensees based on dues paid. (Doc. # 1352-6 at 13). Amendments to the Association's bylaws require approval by a three-quarters vote of the licensees and a three-quarters weighted vote of the licensees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26). Indeed, the Association describes itself as an organization controlled by the Blue Plans; the Association's training materials for directors state that \"Member Plans have the authority to establish or change the constitutional framework or matters that affect fundamental aspects of the Blue System.\" (Doc. # 1352-48 at 3).\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sealy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168492\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/388/350/\">\n    388 U.S. at 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168492\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/388/350/\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that Sealy's licensees were directly in control of its operations \"without even the semblance of insulation\"). For these reasons, the court finds the Association is comparable to the licensee-controlled entities in\n   <em>\n    Sealy\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Topco\n   </em>\n   . Thus, the ESAs established by the Association must be examined as horizontal allocations, not vertical ones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   In addition, the undisputed record evidence also reveals that the Blue Plans control the terms of each Blue's License Agreement. The Blue Plans must act collectively \"to alter the License Agreement's basic brand principles,\" but the Board of Directors-comprised of Blue Plan executives-possess the authority to amend or add regulations to use of the trademarks. (Doc. # 1352-48 at 5). Indeed, the Blue Plans vote on and approve amendments to the licensing agreements.

(Doc. # 1349 at 52). The court is not persuaded. First, at best, it is disputed whether the AHA or AMA required ESAs as a condition of insurance plan certification in the 1930s and 1940s. Indeed, the AHA's 1946 standards for approval of new Blue Plans only provided that new Blue Cross Plans should not be established in markets that were already served adequately by existing Plans. (Doc. # 1353-5 at 14). Moreover, the AMA's 1947 preliminary standards merely provided that the Plan was required to obtain the approval of the appropriate local or state medical association. (Doc. # 1353-6 at 82). Overlapping service areas existed at the time the AHA and AMA exercised ultimate control over certification. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 1353-5 at 19) (discussing the Blue Cross Commission's reluctance to enforce exclusive area requirements and observing \"a number of [ ] instances of plans serving the same areas\"). (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Docs. # 1353-4 at 27, 32; 1353-5 at 27) (discussing areas where Blue Cross Plans and Blue Shield Plans competed in 1947). Thus, Defendants' insistence that the ESAs were a vertically-imposed condition of AHA or AMA certification is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Second, Defendants' focus on the alleged vertical restraints imposed in the 1940s and 1950s disregards the effects wrought by the Long-Term Business Strategy and the Assembly of Plans in the 1980s. The Long-Term Business Strategy provided that all Blue Cross Plans and Blue Shield Plans in a geographic area would merge into one entity by the end of 1985. (Doc. # 1352-164 at 81-82). To facilitate this, the Association directed the chief executive officers of certain Plans to produce a merger table by no later than July 1983. (Doc. # 1352-164 at 81). The Association's representative has acknowledged that the Long-Term Business Strategy factored into the consolidation of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   which also constituted a consolidation of the service areas for those respective Plans. (Doc. # 1352-164 at 85). Likewise, during the Assembly of Plans, the Blue Plans approved amendments to the licensing agreements between the Association and each Plan. (Doc. # 1352-164 at 138-39). For these reasons, the court cannot conclude that the allocation of ESAs reflects conduct by a vertical licensor. Rather, the Rule 56 evidence in the record supports the proposition that the allocation of areas was the result of the Association's plan to (1) consolidate Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans and (2) issue new licensing agreements reflecting the competitive restraints agreed to by a majority of the Blue Plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The ESAs in Which Blue Plans May Sell Blue-Branded Insurance are At Least as Anticompetitive as the Exclusive Sales Areas at Issue in\n    <em>\n     Sealy\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Topco\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Sealy\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Topco\n   </em>\n   , the Blue Plans entered into licensing agreements whereby\n   they agreed to only sell branded health insurance plans and related products within a certain geographic region. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. # 1352-49 at 3-4) (1991 Blue Cross license agreement for BCBS-AL). As a condition of these licenses, the Blue Plans explicitly agreed to not sell health insurance plans and services with the Blue Marks outside of their respective geographic service areas. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5).

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. # 1349-15 at 20-21; 1349-16 at 7; 1349-21 at 5).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sealy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168492\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/388/350/\">\n    388 U.S. at 354-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168492\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/388/350/\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing the aggregation of territorial and price fixing restraints conducted by Sealy).

In contrast, here, there are strict limits placed on the volume of non-branded health insurance products the Blue Plans may sell both inside and outside their service areas.

According to Defendants, the Blue Plans require integrative mechanisms to produce a product for large national employee groups. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38). They insist that a \"new product exception\" to the\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   horizontal market allocation standard applies even in cases where cooperation is not necessary to create the product.

The market allocations at issue are not necessary to market, sell, or produce health insurance. Insurers offered health insurance benefits on a nationwide scale in the 1940s and 1950s, although at that time they only offered indemnity benefits, not service benefits. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 1353-7 at 71) (discussing insurers' ability to offer uniform rates, uniform benefits, and one-stop shopping through indemnity plans). By the 1980s, the Blue Plans' market share, including their share of national health insurance accounts, had decreased because other insurers were able to provide health insurance services to those accounts. (Docs. # 1349-7 at 9-24; 1352-164 at 80-84). The plan to go to ESAs constituted a new marketing/sales strategy, not a new product. The products remain exactly the same-commercial insurance and insurance services. Thus, Defendants cannot rely on\n   <em>\n    BMI's\n   </em>\n   unique product defense to foreclose application of the\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Defendants contend that, because the Rule 56 record does not indicate that the national insurers offer products in all areas of all fifty states, other national insurers do not offer the same products as they do (or even similar ones). (Doc. # 1432 at 17). This argument fails to account for the Blues' sale of health insurance policies on a national scale well before the market allocations were implemented in the 1980s. The Blues offered a similar health insurance product-through syndicates and with open provider networks-both before and after the alleged allocations of markets; therefore, it cannot be said that the market allocations were\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   to market\n   the Blues' health insurance product at all.\n   <em>\n    Cf.

At most, Defendants' argument indicates that the Blues' agreement has permitted them to offer a product (and, to be clear, it is precisely the same product-health insurance) in a more attractive manner. That argument does not establish, though, that the ESAs are necessary to provide health insurance or health insurance services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.

But there is nothing in the Rule 56 record which indicates that there is any valid connection between trademark rights and the National Best Efforts rule. The rule specifically restrains the Plans' ability to compete under\n   <em>\n    non-Blue\n   </em>\n   brands. This output limitation is separate from the limits related to ESAs, which prohibit the Blue Plans from competing, and thus earning revenue, outside of their area under their Blue brands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Defendants argue that the National Best Efforts rule is not properly viewed as an output restriction because the rule leaves Plans plenty of \"headroom\" to compete under non-Blue brands. (Doc. # 1349 at 44). They also argue that the National Best Efforts restriction on competition under non-Blue brands generates plausible procompetitive benefits, such as \"promot[ing] collaboration among Plans, encourag[ing] Plans to invest in the Blue Marks, and prevent[ing] transfer of the immense goodwill associated with the Blue Marks to other brands.\" (Doc. # 1556 at 41-42). The fact remains, however, that the rule places a limit on the revenue a Plan can earn under a non-Blue brand. The fact that the National Best Efforts rule imposes a relative limit, rather than an absolute limit (Doc. # 1432 at 52), is of no moment. It constitutes a limit or a restriction on the volume (output) of a Plan's non-Blue business. Thus, there is little question that, properly analyzed, the National Best Efforts rule is an output restriction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Output restrictions have been called one of the \"most important per se categories,\" along with naked horizontal price-fixing and market allocation.\n   <em>\n    Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Co. v.

But that is not the situation here. The National Best Efforts restrictions on non-Blue brand business clearly are not necessary for the product to be \"available at all.\" Health insurance is regularly made available to consumers without such restraints.

(Doc. # 1350 at 30-31).

(Doc. # 1432 at 55). According to Defendants, the BlueCard program should be analyzed as a joint purchasing agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56). Defendants also insist that the court should not analyze the BlueCard program under a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   price fixing rule because the program offers significant procompetitive benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57). These claimed procompetitive benefits include: (1) access to high-quality insurance products with a local focus, broad provider networks, and competitive premiums; (2) access to a nationwide patient volume for health care providers; and (3) \"prompt payments, ease of claims processing[,] and lower administrative costs.\" (Doc. # 1349 at 43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   In reply, Provider Plaintiffs argue that price fixing does not require the conspirators to agree on a specific price. (Doc. # 1557 at 25). They distinguish the agreements forming the BlueCard program from joint-purchasing agreements because (1) the agreements are related to the ESAs established by the Licensing Agreements, (2) the Blue Plans use the ESAs to create local monopolies, and (3) the lower provider prices obtained through the Blues' alleged monopolistic conduct are shared with other Plans.

Trademark Uncoupling Rules\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   In their summary judgment papers, Subscriber Plaintiffs briefly argue that the Association's restrictions on the use of trade names that have been used in conjunction with a Blue Mark are\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   violations of the Sherman Act. (Doc. # 1351 at 36-38). Subscriber Plaintiffs insist that the trade name restriction is analogous to a horizontal market allocation because (1) the trade name restraint was instituted in 1999, and (2) the Blue Plans would commit a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   violation of the Sherman Act if they agreed to not compete with each other in certain areas using their individualized trade names. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Defendants respond that the \"uncoupling rules\" are not analogous to geographic market allocations because they prevent a Blue Plan from independently using any trade name that has been associated with the Blue Marks nationwide. (Doc. # 1432 at 54). Moreover, Defendants claim that the rule was adopted for a procompetitive purpose and that it falls within the Association's rights as the trademark holder and licensor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54-55). Although this issue may have been under-briefed, the court is inclined to find, upon its initial review, that the uncoupling rules are subject to a rule of reason analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   In 1999, the Association's Board of Directors voted to recommend the uncoupling rules for distinguishing words and symbols used alongside the Blue Marks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. # 1433-5 at 15-21). In their simplest application, the uncoupling rules prevent a Blue Plan from using a trade name with the Blue Marks and then using the same trade name to sell another health care service product without the Blue Marks. (Doc. # 1433-5 at 16, 18-19). They also prohibit the Blue Plans from using unique words and symbols associated with products sold under the Blue Marks to sell non-branded health care service products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18). The rules do not apply to certain tag lines approved in advance by the Association, joint advertising ventures with non-Blue entities approved by the Association, or the sale, marketing, and administration of products other than core health care products and services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Subscriber Plaintiffs refer to the uncoupling rules as agreements not to compete, but they are actually more similar in substance to trademark agreements between competitors. Thus, the Second Circuit's analysis of restrictive trademark agreements in\n   <em>\n    Clorox Company v. Sterling Winthrop, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11959431\" index=\"329\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/117/50/\">\n    117 F.3d 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 1997) is instructive. There, the producers of Pine-Sol branded products and Lysol branded products had entered into a series of agreements that restricted the products to be sold under the Pine-Sol trademark and limited when they could be promoted as disinfectants.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11959431\" index=\"330\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/117/50/\">\n    117 F.3d at 53-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After the parties entered into their trademark agreement, Clorox purchased the Pine-Sol assets and challenged the limitations on use of the Pine-Sol trademark under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11959431\" index=\"331\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/117/50/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11959431\" index=\"331\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/117/50/\">\n    at 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Second Circuit held that the trademark agreement between Lysol's and Pine-Sol's producers was to be examined under the rule of reason because (1) trademark agreements are favored by courts, (2) trademark agreements that regulate use of competing trademarks are distinguishable from trademark agreements \"that in reality serve to divide markets,\" and (3) the agreement presented there did not create a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   antitrust violation, such as price fixing, market division, or a group boycott.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11959431\" index=\"332\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/117/50/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11959431\" index=\"332\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/117/50/\">\n    at 55-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   The trademark restrictions created by the uncoupling rules in this litigation are substantially similar to those analyzed under the rule of reason in\n   <em>\n    Clorox\n   </em>\n   . As the\n   <em>\n    Clorox\n   </em>\n   court noted, the uncoupling rules restrain independent competitors from using trademarks for particular products,\n   but they do not restrain competitors from selling products under other brands or trademarks. (Those restrictions were put in place by other Assocation rules, as discussed above.) Subscriber Plaintiffs characterize the trade name uncoupling rule as an \"absolute prohibition on the use of individualized trade names that have previously been used in conjunction with the Blue Marks\" (Doc. # 1351 at 37), but a review of the uncoupling rules reveals that the Blue Plans are only prohibited from using the trade names for the sale of certain core health insurance products and services. Thus, the trade name uncoupling rule is analogous to the trademark agreement in\n   <em>\n    Clorox\n   </em>\n   , which restricted Pine-Sol's owner from using that name in connection with certain cleaning and disinfecting products.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11959431\" index=\"333\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/117/50/\">\n    117 F.3d at 53-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These rules are not \"naked\" agreements between competitors (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Blue Plans). That is, the rules are not simply reciprocal agreements between the Blues to not use their trade names associated with the trademarks. Rather, the Rule 56 evidence shows that the rules are intended to protect the strength of the Blue Marks by preventing the transfer of goodwill in the Blue Marks to other unique marks created by an individual Blue Plan. (Doc. # 1436-27 at 248-49). Because the record does not show that the uncoupling rules were used to effectuate a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   antitrust violation, and the uncoupling rules have potential procompetitive benefits (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , preventing the transfer of goodwill), the uncoupling rules do not fall within a category of\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   restraints under the Sherman Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

This is even true in antitrust law, where the economic principles of competition policy are subject to continual evolution. The Supreme Court has specifically cautioned district courts and appellate courts against reading the tea leaves and predicting which antitrust precedents are now disfavored.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State Oil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11470447\" index=\"334\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/3/#p10\">\n    522 U.S. at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11470447\" index=\"335\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/3/#p10\">\n    118 S.Ct. 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (commending the court of appeals for applying the precedential opinion at issue because \"it is [the Supreme Court's] prerogative alone to overrule one of its precedents\").
