Folks, Ltd., and its landlord, Defendant DC Jefferson Building, LLC. Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that Defendant's refusal to permit Plaintiff's patrons access to its building's third-floor restrooms after normal business hours is unreasonable, arbitrary, and violates the written and unwritten terms of the parties' leasing arrangement. ECF No. 1-1 (Compl.). Defendant moves to dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. ECF No. 4-1 (Mot.). For the reasons explained below, the court will GRANT Defendant's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Since May 1981, Plaintiff has owned and operated C.F. Folks Restaurant, a lunchtime restaurant/caf\u00e9 contained within commercial property located at 1225 19th Street NW, Washington, D.C (the \"Building\"). Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4, 6. Over the years, C.F. Folks Restaurant has leased space in the Building from several different persons and entities. Compl. \u00b6 5. Defendant has owned the Building and served as Plaintiff's landlord since on or about January 8, 2009. Compl. \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The terms of the parties' leasing arrangement are contained in six documents: (1) the original lease agreement, dated June 18, 1990; (2) a First Amendment to the original lease agreement, dated October 31, 1999; (3) a Second Amendment to the original lease agreement, dated July 31, 2006; (4) a Third Amendment to the original lease agreement, dated February 2008; (5) a settlement agreement (the \"Settlement Agreement\"), dated February 2008; and (6) a Fourth Amendment to the original lease agreement, dated January 26, 2010. Compl. \u00b6 19. Most relevant to this action, section 5 of the Settlement Agreement provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Contingent upon C.F. Folks maintaining the garage level one restroom in a workable and sanitary manner in accordance with its obligations under the Lease, patrons of C.F. Folks may also use those restrooms on the third floor level of the Building.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Such right to use the third floor restrooms is subject to Landlord's discretion and Landlord may revoke such right if: (1) such use interferes with other tenants in the building, or (2) C.F. Folks fails to maintain the garage level one restroom in accordance with the provisions outlined in paragraph 4 of this Settlement Agreement and the Lease. Landlord shall provide 60 days' notice of any revocation of C.F. Folks' right to use the third floor restrooms. In the event that Landlord revokes the right of C.F. Folks to use the third floor restrooms, such revocation of those rights shall not apply to any C.F. Folks' customer who, by reason of handicap or other physical disability, cannot use the garage level one restrooms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Compl. Ex A at \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to Plaintiff, section 5 of the Settlement Agreement memorialized its unwritten understanding with its prior landlords that, pursuant to the District of Columbia Building Code and the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), its patrons and employees are required to have access to two restrooms-at least one of which is ADA-compliant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 11, 13. Under the lease terms, Plaintiff has always had exclusive access to one of two single-occupancy restrooms located on the garage level (one level below C.F. Folks Restaurant) of the Building. Compl. \u00b6 7. Neither of those restrooms are capable of becoming ADA-compliant. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 12. In the past, Plaintiff's patrons were permitted to use restrooms located on either the second or third floors of the Building. Compl. \u00b6 10. Through the 2008 Settlement Agreement, Plaintiff's patrons were given, in writing, formal access to the Building's\n   third-floor restrooms-at least one of which is ADA-compliant. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13. Currently, Plaintiff's patrons-both those with and without disabilities-have unrestricted access to the garage-level and third-floor restrooms during normal business hours.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Compl. \u00b6 20; Compl. Ex. C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Since 2014, Plaintiff has sought to expand its restaurant's operating hours from strictly lunchtime hours to 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Sunday through Thursday, and 6 a.m. to 2 a.m. on Friday and Saturday. Compl. \u00b6 21; Compl. Ex. D at 2. The restaurant also planned to begin serving alcoholic beverages during these expanded hours. Compl. Ex. D at 1-2. Finding section 5 of the Settlement Agreement ambiguous as to whether restaurant patrons were permitted to use the third-floor restrooms after normal business hours, ECF No. 7 (Opp.) at 9, Plaintiff expressly requested \"after office hours\" use of the third-floor restrooms. Compl. \u00b6 22. In an August 1, 2016 letter, Defendant agreed to Plaintiff's request, but only for those patrons who are unable to access the garage-level restroom due to a handicap and who are accompanied by a C.F. Folks Restaurant employee. Compl. Ex. C. In the letter, Defendant stated that \"[t]he safety of the building's tenants is of paramount importance,\" and explained that permitting unrestricted after-hours access to the third-floor restrooms presented safety concerns, since the Building had no night security guard and Plaintiff's patrons may have consumed alcohol. Compl. Ex. C. Even after Plaintiff agreed not to serve alcoholic beverages, Compl. Ex. D at 2, Defendant maintained its position that use of the third-floor restrooms after normal business hours would be limited to those who are disabled and accompanied by a C.F. Folks employee,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. Ex. E. Plaintiff alleges that as a result of Defendant's continued position regarding after-hours restroom access, Plaintiff has been unable to expand its restaurant's operating hours due to its fear of litigation relating to the District of Columbia's Building Code, the ADA, and personal injury claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 43, 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff requests declaratory and injunctive relief to address Defendant's \"unreasonable and arbitrary\" position. Specifically, in Counts I and II of the Complaint, Plaintiff asks this court to declare (1) \"Defendant's conduct to be in violation of the express terms of the parties' settlement agreement and in contradiction to the previously-described, well-understood custom between the parties,\" and that (2) \"Defendant has unreasonably and arbitrarily exercised its contractual discretion to condition Plaintiff's use of the third floor bathrooms in a manner that has directly harmed Plaintiff's business interests within its restaurant/caf\u00e9.\" Compl. at 11, 13. Plaintiff also requests an injunction \"restraining Defendant from taking any action [ ] designed to hinder or otherwise prevent Plaintiff from acting in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and the District's building code.\" Compl. at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Defendant further argues that Counts I and II should be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted for two reasons. First, to the extent Counts I and II are based on an alleged \"unwritten understanding\" between the parties, this unwritten understanding is unenforceable, and thus cannot properly serve as the basis for Counts I and II.

Second, \"[e]ven if Plaintiff is alleging its patrons' use of the third floor restrooms was custom and practice between the parties,\" Counts I and II should nonetheless be dismissed because Plaintiff fails to support such an allegation in its Complaint.

Yet the record is devoid of any mention of steps Plaintiff has taken between 2014-when Plaintiff initially desired to expand its business-and 2017-when Plaintiff filed its Complaint-to effectuate the expansion. Plaintiff has not alleged, for example, that it has begun to expand its menu, hired additional employees, or solicited additional funds to support its desired expansion. Instead, Plaintiff asks the court to infer, from its willingness to incur litigation costs \"in obtaining certainty about the extent and scope of its patrons' right to access [the] third floor bathrooms,\" \"the seriousness of Plaintiff's desire to expand its hours of operation.\" Opp. at 11-12. But a restaurant's successful expansion requires more than its patrons' access to ADA-compliant restrooms, and Plaintiff's willingness to litigate does not suffice to demonstrate a practical expansion plan. Thus, while Plaintiff argues that it has not yet expanded its business solely because of Defendant's alleged \"arbitrary and capricious conduct in exercising its discretion\" with respect to the third-floor restrooms,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 43, the record-or lack thereof-suggests otherwise. Accordingly, the court finds that Plaintiff has not shown a practical likelihood that it will expand its restaurant's business hours in the near future, and therefore Defendant's alleged future misconduct is not of \"sufficient immediacy and reality\" to warrant a declaratory judgment at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff's arguments do not convince this court otherwise. Plaintiff first argues that Defendant's impending restriction on Plaintiff's access to the third-floor restrooms after normal business hours qualifies as an anticipatory breach of the parties' leasing arrangement, and demonstrates the existence of an actual controversy. Opp. at 10-12. However, Plaintiff does not expressly allege an anticipatory breach in its Complaint, and even if it did, the alleged \"anticipatory breach\"-Defendant's refusal to permit Plaintiff's patrons access to the third-floor restrooms-is not sufficiently \"immediate\" or \"real\" to warrant a declaratory judgment. Plaintiff next argues that it \"stands to suffer several important harms should this court not intervene and enter a declaratory judgment.\" Opp. at 13-15. However, the alleged harms-a violation of the District of Columbia's Building Code, a violation of Plaintiff's right to quiet enjoyment of the leased premises, and the threat of civil litigation from disabled patrons-are all speculative at this point, and are contingent upon Plaintiff expanding its hours, Defendant refusing access to the third-floor restrooms for certain patrons, and an actual threat of litigation arising out of Defendant's restrictions. These are not current harms that require immediate attention or an immediate judgment, and this court therefore cannot issue a declaration addressing them on the basis of the record before it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hoffman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4185508\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/643/132/#p140\">\n    643 F.Supp.2d at 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In sum, the court concludes that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate Counts I and II because they do not present a \"substantial controversy ... of sufficient immediacy and reality,\" as required under the Declaratory Judgment Act and Article III of the Constitution.
