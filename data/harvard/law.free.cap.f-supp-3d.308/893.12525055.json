GOLDSMITH, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The United States Supreme Court has ruled that juveniles convicted of first-degree murder cannot be subject to mandatory life sentences without parole. Because of their lesser culpability and greater capacity to change, they must be sentenced under a process that gives them an individualized opportunity to present mitigating circumstances to avert such a harsh sentence. In response, the Michigan legislature enacted legislation that purported to comply with the Court's ruling, which included the possibility of being resentenced to prison for a term of years. However, the legislature provided that in calculating any such sentence, the youth offenders were not to receive any credit-known as good time or disciplinary credit-even though such credits were earned while the youth offenders served their illegally imposed sentences. In that respect, the legislative response ran afoul of our Constitution's ban on ex post facto laws-the constitutional guarantee that laws may not retroactively criminalize conduct or enhance the punishment for criminal acts already perpetrated. For this reason, the Court must declare that provision of the statute unconstitutional and order that the youth offenders receive the credit that they have previously earned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This matter is currently before the Court on competing motions of the parties, for which a hearing was held on March 22, 2018. For the following reasons, the Court grants in part and denies in part Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment, declaratory judgment and permanent injunction (Dkt. 181); denies Defendants' cross-motion for partial summary judgment (Dkt. 190); and grants Plaintiffs' second renewed motion for class certification (Dkt. 180).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs are individuals who were sentenced to mandatory life without parole for homicide crimes that they committed as juveniles.

They argue that prisoners serving a life sentence cannot have that sentence \"reduced,\" and that there is no time \"fixed\" for the \"expiration\" of such sentence; therefore, they say, this statute cannot be applied to prisoners serving a life term. Def. Resp. at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   This argument is unconvincing. The language may mean that the good time credits are not actually\n   <em>\n    applied\n   </em>\n   to a life sentence so long as it remains a life sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   But there is no reason to think that a prisoner serving a life sentence could not, nonetheless,\n   <em>\n    earn\n   </em>\n   good time credits. They would be applied if and when the sentence was converted, for some reason, to a fixed sentence. Once changed to a term of years, there is an \"expiration\" that is \"fixed,\" and the sentence can then be \"reduced.\" In fact, this view of the statutory language is precisely the view of the MDOC, whose practice has routinely been to calculate credits when a prisoner previously serving a life sentence is subsequently resentenced to a term of years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   section III.B.iii.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   As for the disciplinary credit statute, Defendants have no explanation for the explicit inclusion of first-degree murder as one of the crimes for which credits could be earned. They maintain that the language in other parts of the statute, which references deductions from a minimum and maximum sentence, means that the statute cannot apply to those serving a life sentence, as such prisoners have no minimum or maximum term. Def. Resp. at 4-5. But again, a plausible interpretation of the statute-and one that renders the statute as a whole internally consistent-is that the disciplinary credits are not\n   <em>\n    applied\n   </em>\n   to a life sentence, although prisoners serving such term still\n   <em>\n    earn\n   </em>\n   them.

MDOC Practice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Further evidence of the state of Michigan law is MDOC's long-standing policy to calculate and award credits for those serving life sentences. Plaintiffs have provided an affidavit from Richard Stapleton, the former Administrator of the MDOC Office of Legal Affairs, who spent thirty-four years at MDOC. Stapleton averred that when a prisoner was originally serving a life sentence and was then resentenced to a term-of-years sentence, it was \"routine and regular practice for the department's records office staff to compute a prisoner's new sentence by applying the time already served\n   <em>\n    and by awarding good time or disciplinary credits in accordance with MCL 800.33\n   </em>\n   to the new terms of years' sentence.\" Stapleton Aff. \u00b6 9 (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Defendants do not dispute that this is MDOC's practice. Def. Cross-Reply at 3. Instead, they argue that MDOC regularly calculates credits \"when lifers have been resentenced\n   <em>\n    for a different offense\n   </em>\n   or to a new sentence\n   <em>\n    for the same offense under existing law that permitted credits for the new term of years\n   </em>\n   ,\" which, they say, is not the case here.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633524\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/197/1178/#p1181\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphases in original). It is not clear why this distinction should matter, and Defendants offer no explanation.

Plaintiffs contend that the Michigan Parole Board examines whether an individual has completed rehabilitative programming when determining whether to grant parole, and often denies parole to prisoners who have not completed their recommended programming. Pl. Mot. at 16. Plaintiffs allege that the 236 juvenile offenders who are the subject of motions for life sentences are currently considered to be ineligible for parole, and thus are denied access to rehabilitative programming.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20769\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   They argue that by denying these prisoners rehabilitative programming, Plaintiffs have no chance of being released on parole; accordingly, Defendants are violating Plaintiffs' right to a meaningful opportunity for release, as outlined in\n   <em>\n    Graham v.

Def. Resp. at 19. Plaintiffs are currently in a pre-sentencing posture, Defendants argue, and once they receive their new sentences, those who are resentenced to a term of years will be eligible for rehabilitative programming.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. They argue that Plaintiffs have no right to rehabilitative programming at this point; at any rate, the Michigan Parole Board has released 44 of 45 resentenced juvenile homicide offenders, and Plaintiffs therefore cannot show that they are in fact being denied an opportunity for meaningful release.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20. Defendants state that the parole board considers many factors in making its decisions, and successful completion of programming plays only a \"minimal role.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The Court will deny both motions for summary judgment on Count VI without prejudice to allow further discovery to take place. Because there has been no discovery, the summary judgment record\n   is very thin. Plaintiffs point to an affidavit from 2013 stating that the \"Parole Board often denies release to prisoners who have not completed [recommended] programs,\" Richard Stapleton Aff., Ex. 3 to Pl. Supp. Br., \u00b6 22 (Dkt. 67-4). Defendants rely on the MDOC Policy Directive 06.05.100, which sets forth several factors for the Parole Board to consider; they also argue that 44 out of 45 juvenile homicide offenders have been released on parole. Def. Resp. at 19-20. Given the lack of a fully developed record, the Court will deny summary judgment at this time. Discovery is ongoing with respect to Count IV, and the Court believes that its decision on Count VI will benefit from additional information regarding the concerns and considerations of the Michigan Parole Board, particularly regarding the 45 individuals who went before the Board following their resentencings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Class Certification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Plaintiffs have moved for certification of a class of \"all individuals in Michigan DOC custody who were convicted of first-degree murder for offenses committed when they were below 18 years of age, were or will be subjected to resentencing under M.C.L. \u00a7 769.25a, and are or could become eligible for parole.\" Pl.

The proposed primary class consists of \"over 50\" individuals still incarcerated who are currently eligible for parole or will become parole eligible, and 250 individuals who are awaiting resentencing. Pl. Mot. at 5. The first subclass, which consists of individuals whose offenses occurred before December 15, 1998, exceeds 250.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. The second subclass consists of over 250 individuals who are awaiting resentencing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These groups are sufficiently numerous to satisfy the first requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davidson v.

Mich. 2014) (\"[I]t generally is accepted that a class of 40 or more members is sufficient to satisfy the numerosity requirement.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Defendants had previously argued that for the first subclass, Plaintiffs were improperly including individuals who may be resentenced to life without parole; if they were sentenced to life without parole, they would not be affected by whether or not they obtained good time or disciplinary credits under Count V. Def. Resp. at 21 (Dkt. 188). However, Plaintiffs responded that there are fifty-one individuals who have\n   <em>\n    already\n   </em>\n   been resentenced and are being denied good time or disciplinary credits; this alone satisfies the numerosity requirement. Pl. Reply at 3 (Dkt. 191). Defendants conceded at oral argument that the numerosity requirement would be met regardless of whether the individuals who have yet to be resentenced were included in the subclass. Additionally, even if a class member were resentenced to life without parole, he or she still continues to earn good time and/or disciplinary credit, which may eventually be applied if there is some future resentencing. Individuals whose offenses occurred prior to December 15, 1998 and who have yet to be resentenced are, therefore, appropriately considered as part of the first subclass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Defendants also argued that Plaintiffs improperly included individuals awaiting resentencing in the second proposed subclass who may ultimately be resentenced to life without parole. Def. Resp. at 21. However, Plaintiffs alleged that the denial of rehabilitative programming \"imperils their ability to demonstrate rehabilitation in the context of the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   resentencing hearings themselves,\" Pl. Mot. for Summ.

The challenged statute or MDOC policy affects all class members in the same manner.

Def. Resp. at 22. For Counts IV and V, there are enough proper class representatives who\n   <em>\n    have\n   </em>\n   been resentenced to a term of years such that it does not defeat class certification if these three individuals are not considered adequate representatives. For Count VI, as Plaintiffs point out and as discussed above, the entire claim is brought on behalf of individuals who await resentencing, so the fact that they have\n   not been resentenced would not disqualify Boyd, Dupure, or Tipton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. Adequacy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The final prerequisite of Rule 23(a) is whether the named Plaintiffs' representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. The Sixth Circuit employs the following two-prong test to determine adequacy: (i) the class representatives must have common interests with the putative class members; and (ii) the representatives must \"vigorously prosecute the interests of the class through qualified counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    Vassalle v.

Here, the proposed class representatives have common interests with the putative class members, as described above. Further, counsel for Plaintiffs have shown themselves to be qualified and to have vigorously pursued this case over the last seven years. This requirement is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    v.

R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \"The key to the (b)(2) class is the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted-the notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of them.\"\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    564 U.S. at 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Here, this requirement is satisfied as to the proposed class and both proposed subclasses.

The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's refusal to award any disciplinary credit, reasoning that if the defendant had been properly sentenced to an indeterminate sentence originally, he would not have been entitled to such credit based on an express exclusion in the statutory language.
