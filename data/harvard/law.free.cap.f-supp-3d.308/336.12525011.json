McFADDEN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Manuel J. Casares has filed a \"claim\" for \"trespass (forgery), conspiracy[,] burglary, robbery, theft, false arrest, false imprisonment,\n   battery, injury, damages[, and] failure to immediately return of property [sic],\" naming numerous opposing parties, the first of which is Wells Fargo Bank, N. A. ECF No. 1. As supplemented by a later filing, Mr. Casares argues that he is being injured by \"Indian River Sheriff Daryl Loar and other wrongdoers,\" including \"Indian River county deputies,\" as they trespassed on his \"home\" and \"enforce[d] ... forged void orders,\" thereby discriminating against his unique heritage. ECF No. 4 at 3-4. He explains that this claim \"must be filed as superseding 1:13-cv-01633\"-referring to a prior case dismissed by Judge Amy Berman Jackson-in part because he erroneously \"file[d] a complaint ... when it should have been a claim.\" ECF No. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   But Mr. Casares has already litigated these facts-twice. In his case before Judge Jackson, Mr. Casares \"who formerly worked as a financial advisor for Wells Fargo Advisors, allege[d] that he lost his home [in Indian River County, Florida] as a result of a mortgage fraud scheme, and that after he published a website critical of Wells Fargo's handling of the mortgage situation, he also lost his job.\"\n   <em>\n    Casares v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264381\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/248/#p250\">\n    268 F.Supp.3d 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 250 (D.D.C. 2017). Mr. Casares challenged the foreclosure on numerous grounds: including \"treason and conspiracy,\" obstruction of justice, and \"mail and wire fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264381\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/248/#p250\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264381\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/248/#p250\">\n    at 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Judge Jackson dismissed Mr. Casares' claims about \"the alleged illegal foreclosure action ... in Indian River County,\" because that foreclosure had already been litigated in Florida's state courts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264381\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/248/#p250\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264381\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/248/#p250\">\n    at 254-255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted). Under the doctrine of res judicata, also known as claim preclusion, parties cannot repeatedly litigate the same basic facts simply by \"raising a different legal theory or seeking a different remedy in the new action that was available ... in the prior action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264381\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/248/#p250\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264381\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/248/#p250\">\n    at 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, \"a subsequent lawsuit will be barred if there has been prior litigation (1) involving the same claims or cause of action, (2) between the same parties or their privies, and (3) there has been a final, valid judgment on the merits, (4) by a court of competent jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Porter v.

Cir. 2010) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I must reach the same conclusion here. Mr. Casares cannot repackage his challenge to the Indian River County foreclosure in new legal terms-\"trespass,\" \"burglary, robbery, [and] theft,\" among others,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 1, 4-and keep coming back to court.
