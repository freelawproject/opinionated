The co-worker says no, but the plaintiff argues that the Iowa Court of Appeals, the state's\n   intermediate court of appeals, has rejected the co-worker's argument, ruling that the intra-corporate nature of statements goes to qualified privilege, not \"publication.\" I must decide whether the plaintiff's defamation claim survives a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. INTRODUCTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. The Amended Complaint\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff David Goodman originally filed this action on August 22, 2017, in the Iowa District Court for Woodbury County, against his former employer, Performance Contractors, Inc., and two former co-workers, Derek Racca and Kelly Pabst. On October 6, 2017, Performance removed the action to this federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction prior to service on Racca or Pabst. On January 23, 2018, Goodman filed an Amended Complaint asserting state race discrimination and retaliation claims against Performance and Pabst, federal discrimination, harassment, and retaliation claims against Performance, and a defamation claim against Performance, Pabst, and Racca.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because only the defamation claim is at issue on Racca's Motion To Dismiss, which is now before me, I will focus on that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Apart from an introductory allegation that Racca is a citizen of Louisiana who, at all material times, lived and worked in Sergeant Bluff, Iowa, Racca is only mentioned individually in Count II of Goodman's Amended Complaint asserting Goodman's \"Defamation\" claim. The allegations in that Count, in their entirety, are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   45. Mr. Goodman re-alleges paragraphs 1 through 44 as if fully set forth herein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   46. In the course of their work for Defendant Performance Contractors, Inc., Defendants Kelly Pabst and Derek Racca stated that Mr. Goodman threatened to commit violent crimes including a mass shooting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   47. Defendant Kelly Pabst stated that Mr. Goodman had \"mentioned numerous time [sic] when he had enough he was coming in shooting [and] was going to make world news.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   48. Defendant Derek Racca stated that Mr. Goodman had \"threatened to come to the CF Port Neal expansion project and 'shoot it up' and kill those that don't like him or piss him off.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   49. Defendant Derek Racca also stated Mr. Goodman said he \"was going to take a bat and wrap it in barbwire and beat his wife.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   50. Defendants' statements about Mr. Goodman were defamatory per se.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   51. Defendants' statements about Mr. Goodman were made with knowledge that they were false or with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   52. Defendants acted intentionally, maliciously and/or with reckless indifference to Mr. Goodman's rights and knew or should have known that their actions were illegal; therefore, Mr. Goodman is entitled to punitive damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   53. As a proximate cause of Defendants' statements, Plaintiff has been damaged. Specifically, he has suffered lost wages, emotional and mental anguish, humiliation, embarrassment,\n   and loss of enjoyment of life.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Amended Complaint, \u00b6\u00b6 45-53.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. The Motion To Dismiss\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On March 16, 2018, Racca filed the Motion To Dismiss now before me, asserting that Goodman does not, and cannot, state a plausible claim for defamation against him. Racca argues that Goodman's defamation claim is based solely on statements that Racca made in an Employee Statement submitted to Performance in the course of Racca's work for Performance and that there are no allegations that Racca communicated any allegedly defamatory statement to a person other than Performance or outside of his employment with Performance. Racca argues that, while Iowa courts do not appear to have directly decided whether such intra-corporate statements constitute \"publication\" of the defamation, other jurisdictions have specifically found that intra-corporate communications, like Racca's Employee Statement, do not, as a matter of law, constitute publication to a third party. Racca also argues that Goodman's \"threadbare\" recitals of the remaining elements of his defamation claim-which he identifies as intent, malice, and harm-do not identify the facts supporting them, so that such conclusory allegations also warrant dismissal, but he argues that the court need not reach that issue. Racca appended his Employee Statement as an exhibit to his Motion To Dismiss, and he argues that the court may properly consider it on his Rule 12(b)(6) Motion, because it is embraced by the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Goodman filed his Resistance on March 30, 2018. Goodman argues that, in\n   <em>\n    Newell v. JDS Holdings, L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7058662\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/834/463/#p470\">\n    834 N.W.2d 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 470 (Iowa Ct. App. 2013), the Iowa Court of Appeals rejected the argument that there was no \"publication\" of allegedly defamatory statements that were made by a supervisory employee to individuals within the company and noted that the argument presented the minority view among the states. Indeed, Goodman argues, the Iowa Court of Appeals thoroughly analyzed the position Racca urges but rejected an intra-corporate communication exception to \"publication,\" because the court concluded that the intra-corporate nature of the communication was properly addressed in the context of a qualified privilege. Goodman also argues that he has adequately pleaded the other elements of his defamation claim against Racca, because he alleges that the statements attributed to Racca were untrue, creating a reasonable inference that Racca made the statements with intent and malice. He also argues that the content of the statements constitutes\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   defamation, so that falsity, malice, and injury are presumed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Racca filed a Reply on April 5, 2018. In his Reply, Racca argues that Goodman has not disputed that the court may consider his Employee Statement as a document embraced by the pleadings. Racca also argues that\n   <em>\n    Newell\n   </em>\n   is not \"controlling,\" merely \"persuasive,\" because it is a decision by an intermediate court of appeals. Also, the\n   <em>\n    Newell\n   </em>\n   decision is not the best evidence of state law, Racca contends, because the Iowa Supreme Court actually expressed support for the theory that intra-company communications do not constitute publication in\n   <em>\n    Taggart v. Drake University\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12083268\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/549/796/#p802\">\n    549 N.W.2d 796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 802-03 (Iowa 1996). Racca argues that Goodman's position would invite disgruntled employees to sue co-workers individually for defamation, which would discourage co-workers from reporting legitimate concerns about workplace threats or participating in investigations. Racca argues that, had the Iowa Court of Appeals been presented with the Amended Complaint in this case, it might well have reached a different conclusion than it did in\n   <em>\n    Newell\n   </em>\n   , because Racca was Goodman's co-worker, not his supervisor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   I conclude that oral arguments on Racca's Motion are not likely to be of benefit, so I deem the Motion fully submitted on the parties' written submissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.
