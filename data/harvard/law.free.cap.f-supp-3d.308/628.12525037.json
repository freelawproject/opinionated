Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") alleges that Defendant Iftikar Ahmed (\"Mr. Ahmed\") violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 (Count One), Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") (Count Two), and Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act (\"Advisers Act\") (Counts Three, Four, and Five).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Second Am. Compl. (\"SAC\") [Doc. # 208].) In Counts Six through Fourteen, the SEC seeks equitable disgorgement against each respective Relief Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court bifurcated summary judgment, with this first stage addressing only liability, and a second stage addressing the appropriate relief, if needed, or in the alternative, a trial on liability will be held. All three parties move for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. [Doc. # 616]; Relief Defs.' (\"RD\") Mot. for Summ. J. [Doc. # 618-2]; PL's Mot. for Summary Judgment [Doc. # 622].) The Court held oral argument on February 28, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The SEC alleges that Defendant \"systematically used fraudulent and deceptive means to divert more than $67 million from funds he advised\" while employed by venture capital firm Oak Investment Partners (\"Oak\") \"into his personal bank accounts, before funneling much of his ill-gotten gains into assets and accounts in the name of his wife in order to conceal his fraud and protect the assets from confiscation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (PL's Mot. for Summ. J. at 1.) In response, neither Defendant nor Relief Defendants argue that Defendant did not commit the alleged frauds, instead contending primarily that Defendant should not be held liable because (1) certain fraudulent acts are time-barred by the statute of limitations, (2) the fraud was not sufficiently connected to securities transactions, and (3) the underlying securities transactions are not sufficiently domestic to be within the reach of the United States securities laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the SEC's Motion for Summary Judgment is granted. Defendant and Relief Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Overarching Facts\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Oak Management Corporation (\"OMC\") is the investment manager for various venture capital investment funds, which raise money from investors (ranging from state and municipal pension funds to individual investors) and, in turn, invest those monies in various types of securities. (SEC Loc. R. 56(a) 1 Statement of Facts (\"SOF\") at X-4.) Defendant joined Oak in 2004 where he worked as an investment professional and a managing member of entities that serve as general partners of certain Oak funds. (SOF \u00b6 X-5.) Defendant was responsible for, among other things, identifying companies in which Oak funds might invest (\"portfolio companies\"), recommending investments, and negotiating the terms of investments with portfolio companies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 X-6 to X-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   To enter into a securities transaction, Oak entities memorialized an agreement to consummate a purchase or sale in written agreements, typically share purchase agreements (\"SPAs\"), merger agreements or tender offer agreements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 X-25.) The SEC's allegations focus on a series of such transactions relating to ten companies, described in the Second Amended Complaint as Companies A through J, all of which involved Defendant. In essence, and as described\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   in detail with respect\n   to each transaction, Defendant opened bank accounts he alone controlled that were deceptively titled in the name of Oak and its portfolio companies, which he then used to divert monies intended for Oak funds or its portfolio companies into his and his wife's personal bank accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   On April 2, 2015, before the SEC initiated this action and unrelated to this action, Defendant was arrested and charged with insider trading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Kanodia\n   </em>\n   , et al., No. 1:15-cr-10131-NMG-MBB,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2012672172\">\n    2015 WL 12672172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Mass. Apr. 1, 2015) (Docs. ## 3-4). Defendant's bond was set at $9 million and, as a condition of release pending his criminal trial, his travel was restricted to Connecticut, New York, and Massachusetts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ahmed\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:15-mj-00052-WIG (D. Conn. Apr. 2, 2015) (ECF 4 &amp; 8 at \u00b6 7(f) );\n   <em>\n    United States v. Kanodia, et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:15-cr-10131-NMG-MBB (D. Mass. Apr. 21, 2015) (ECF 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   On May 6, 2015, the SEC filed its Complaint [Doc. # 1] and an emergency motion [Doc. # 2] for a temporary restraining order freezing assets and asking for a preliminary injunction. The following day, the Court entered [Doc. # 9] a temporary restraining order freezing assets of Defendant and certain Relief Defendants up to approximately $55 million, and scheduled a preliminary injunction hearing. At some point in May, prior to the preliminary injunction hearing, Defendant fled from the United States to his native country-India-where he remains to this day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On August 12, 2015, after a two day evidentiary hearing, the Court granted [Doc. # 113] the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction. This hearing transcript is posted on the docket, to which Defendant has access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Defendant's Assertion of his Fifth Amendment Right\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendant answered [Doc. # 218] the SEC's Second Amended Complaint on April 22, while represented by counsel, \"assert[ing] his right under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and applicable laws and statutes not to be compelled to be a witness against himself ...\" in response to the SEC's allegation of fraud. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SEC Ex. 1; SOF \u00b6 X-1.) In discovery, among other things, the SEC requested \"all communications ... with any of the Relief Defendants regarding any of the allegations in the Complaint,\" \"all communications ... with any individuals from Companies A-I regarding any of the allegations in the Complaint,\" and \"all communications ... with any individual from Oak, and Oak Fund, Oak Funds investors, or an Oak Fund portfolio company regarding any of the allegations in the Complaint.\" (SEC Ex. 12 at 11-13.) In response to the SEC's Requests for Admission and Interrogatories, Defendant invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. (SOF \u00b6\u00b6 X-1, X-16.) In response to the SEC's Document Requests, Defendant claimed to have no responsive documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 X-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Defendant's Fraudulent Conduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Company A\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In August 2014, Defendant proposed via email that Oak Fund XIII purchase 124,378 Series A shares of Company A from Company A's holding company, the \"BVI Company,\" at a price of $28.50 per share, for a total purchase price of $3,544,773. (SOF \u00b6 A-1.) He buttressed his proposal with favorable comments on Company A's financial condition, but before Oak Fund XIII purchased the shares, Defendant received a copy of Company A's most recent board package, which included lower estimated\n   financial results for Company A than the figures Defendant reported in his proposal to Oak. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 A-2.) On August 11, Oak approved Defendant's proposed purchase of Company A shares and executed the stock purchase agreement on behalf of Oak Fund XIII. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 A-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defendant then induced Oak Fund XIII to pay an inflated purchase price by emailing Oak what appeared to be the deal documents already executed by the seller with the purchase price of $3,544,733. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 A-7.) However, the versions sent to the seller contained a price of $1.5 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, the seller agreed to a purchase price of $1.5 million for the Company A shares, but Defendant's fraud caused Oak Fund XIII to pay $3,544,733 for those same shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, Defendant provided Oak instructions for Oak Fund XIII to wire the $3,544,773 purchase price to a Bank of America account in the name of \"Iftikar Ali Ahmed Sole Prop, DBA [BVI Company]\" (the \"BOA BVI Company Account\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   which the Oak Fund followed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 A-6, A-8.) Defendant then wired the $1.5 million actual purchase price from this account to the seller. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 A-8.) Rather than returning the excess purchase price to Oak Fund XIII, Defendant transferred the remaining balance of just over $2 million into a joint account he owned with his wife, Relief Defendant Shalini Ahmed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Company B\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Company B was a joint venture formed by two parties, denoted here as JV Party 1 and JV Party 2. (SOF \u00b6 B-1.) JV Party 2 was a subsidiary of the BVI Company from which Oak Fund XIII purchased its Company A shares. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In December 2014, Defendant recommended that Oak Fund XII purchase JV Party 1's shares in Company B for $20 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 B-2.) Financial documents Defendant received prior to his recommendation, on November 22, 2014, reveal that the projected results for Company B were lower than the projections Defendant included in his presentation recommending the investment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 B-10.) After the investment was approved, Defendant told Oak that the $20 million purchase price should be split between two accounts, with $2 million wired to JV Party 1 and $18 million wired to an account that Defendant claimed belonged to the BVI Company, but was in fact Defendant's BOA BVI Company Account. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 B-3, B-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Oak Fund XII wired the payments as Defendant directed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 B-7.) Defendant also forwarded to Oak personnel what he claimed were the final deal documents reflecting a $20 million purchase price. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 B-4.) The actual purchase price for the Company B shares was $2 million, not $20 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 B-5.) Examination of Defendant's personal directory at Oak after his arrest, which is generally inaccessible to other Oak personnel, revealed a Word version of the SPA that is identical to the SPA that Defendant received as a Word document on December 16, with the exception of Section 3.1, which reflects a $20 million purchase price. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 B-6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   After the $18 million was wired by Oak Fund XII into Defendant's BOA BVI Company account, Defendant transferred approximately $18 million into a joint bank account that he held with his wife, Relief Defendant Shalini Ahmed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 B-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. Company C\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Defendant engaged in deceptive conduct by misrepresenting Company C's financial performance and concealing and misrepresenting his ownership of Company C shares, while he recommended and advised Oak Fund XIII to make two separate investments in Company C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    $10,896,193.59 Redemption of Company C Shares.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In November 2012, Company C-an e-commerce business based in the United States-sold its Series A shares to several investors including I-Cubed Domains, LLC (discussed more fully below), and the BVI Company, an Oak portfolio company.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (SOF \u00b6 C-1.) At the time, Defendant was one of three people on the BVI Company's board of directors and was responsible for identifying and negotiating the transaction involving BVI Company's purchase of Company C Series A Preferred Stock for $150,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 C-2, C-3, C-4.) On November 13, 2013, the BVI Company wired $150,000 from a BVI Company Fidelity account to Company C. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 C-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Shortly after the BVI Company's $150,000 investment in Company C, Defendant represented that an additional $2 million investment by the BVI Company was necessary because Defendant was getting pressure from Oak for being on the Board of the Company without a bigger investment. (SEC Ex. 145.) He then requested via email that Company C \"lawyers ... wrap up the incremental $2MM funding,\" which the Company C representative confirmed would be done \"right away.\" (SEC Ex. 146.) On November 26, 2012, $2,000,000 was wired from the same BVI Company Fidelity account for the purchase of additional Company C shares. (SOF \u00b6 C-6.) When he was subsequently confronted by the BVI Company about the $2 million that was missing from the BVI Company's Fidelity account, Defendant claimed the $2 million purchase was a mistake on the part of the \"finance team.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 C-7.) Continuing to conceal that he negotiated the $2 million investment, Defendant told BVI he would \"take full responsibility\" for the \"mistake\" and would personally purchase the shares, which he did on or about June 21, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 C-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Meanwhile, on Defendant's recommendation, in October 2013 Oak Fund XIII invested $25 million into Company C Series B shares, while Defendant simultaneously negotiated with Company C (purportedly on behalf of Oak Fund XIII), an investment by Oak Fund XIII that would be conditioned on Company C redeeming the BVI's Company's Company C shares (now secretly owned by Defendant) for $10,896,193.59. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 C-9, C-15.) Essentially, Defendant was pretending to act on behalf of Oak Fund XIII in negotiating its investment in Company C, while actually seeking to profit (by more than $8 million) by redeeming the Company C shares he was holding in the name of the BVI Company. Prior to Oak Fund XIII making its $25 million investment into Company C-which triggered Company C's obligation to redeem Defendant's Company C shares held in the name of the BVI Company for $10,896,193.59-Defendant was specifically asked if he had invested in Company C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Defendant falsely stated that he had \"no personal investment or any other direct beneficial interest or investment\" in Company C. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 C-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Ms. Ames, OMC's Chief Operating Officer and designated witness in this case (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 X-3), asked Defendant about any ownership of Company C shares because each Oak Fund is prohibited, absent proper consent, from investing in the securities of any entity in which any of the Managing Members of its general partner (including Defendant) have, or have had within the preceding ninety days, any investment or any other material financial interest. (SOF \u00b6 C-16.) Oak funds also are prohibited, absent the proper consent, from purchasing or selling securities to or from any Managing Members of the general partner of the Oak Funds (including Defendant) or any of their respective affiliates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   To further conceal that he was holding Company C shares and would personally profit from their redemption (triggered by Oak Fund XIII's investment in Company C), Defendant opened the BOA BVI Company Account on October 10, 2013, and directed, through an attorney, Company C to wire the redemption proceeds into this account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 C-11-13.) After he received the funds in his BOA BVI Company Account, Defendant transferred the funds into a joint bank account that he held with his wife, Relief Defendant Shalini Ahmed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 C-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In sum, Defendant purposefully lied to his fellow BVI Company directors when he told them the $2 million purchase of Company C shares was a mistake, as he had personally negotiated the purchase of those shares in the name of the BVI Company. Defendant then bought the shares, left them in the name of the BVI Company, and negotiated their redemption for a price that was substantially greater than the $2 million originally paid by leveraging the redemption on Oak Fund XIII's $25 million investment in Company C. While recommending that Oak Fund XIII purchase $25 million of Company C's Series B shares, Defendant concealed from Oak Fund XIII and Company C that he (as opposed to the BVI Company, which was an Oak portfolio company) was the seller of those Company C shares and that he would personally profit by more than $8 million upon Oak Fund XIII's $25 million investment. Defendant told Oak that he did not have any personal investment or direct beneficial interest in Company C, which was false because Defendant was: (1) holding the Company C shares in the name of BVI Company that were redeemed upon Oak Fund XIII's investment; and (2) holding Company C shares in the name of I-Cubed, as explained below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    $7,500,000 I-Cubed Sale\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   I-Cubed is a single member Delaware LLC formed on October 24, 2012 whose sole member (and owner) was Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 C-22.) In November 2012, Defendant, through I-Cubed, invested in Company C. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 C-24.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   On October 30, 2014 Oak Fund XIII entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with I-Cubed to purchase its Company C shares for $7.5 million. (SOF \u00b6 C-18.) That agreement was executed by Defendant on behalf of Oak Fund XIII and was purportedly executed on behalf of I-Cubed by Richard N. Kimball. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant provided wire transfer instructions to Oak and directed that it wire $7.5 million to an account held by I-Cubed at Bank of America ending x8384 (\"BOA I-Cubed Account\"),\n   which Oak followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 C-19.) On November 3, 2014 Defendant wrote a $7,425,000 check from the BOA I-Cubed Account to the Shalini Ahmed 2014 Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (the \"GRAT\"). (SEC Ex. 160 at SEC-BOA-E-1355.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   When presenting this proposed investment to Oak's managing partners at their investment committee meeting held on or about October 27, 2014, Defendant described the seller of the shares, I-Cubed, as a \"family office.\" (SOF \u00b6 C-17.) Defendant's written presentation included financials for Company C showing, among other things, that Company C's estimated revenues in 2014 were $515.6 million, a 65% increase over 2013 revenues of $311.81 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, on October 8, 2014, Defendant had received Company C's financials showing $178.1 million in revenue for the first eight months of 2014, which was just 11.7% ahead of revenues for the first eight months of 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 C-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Defendant had recognized the declining value of Company C stock even before this. In August 2014, two months before I-Cubed sold the Company C stock to Oak Fund XIII for $7.5 million, a 99% interest in I-Cubed-which held only the Company C shares-was transferred into the GRAT. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 C-32-33.) According to the GRAT formation document, which the GRAT's 30(b)(6) witness confirmed was accurate, the market value of the 99% interest in I-Cubed was worth only $876,193.72. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 C-32.) Similarly, during the preliminary injunction hearing, Relief Defendant Shalini Ahmed testified that she believed the GRAT formation document was accurate and that I-Cubed's Company C shares were worth $876,193.72 as of August 29, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 C-33.) Thus, while Defendant represented to Oak that I-Cubed's Company C shares had increased in value by 375% (to $7.5 million) since their purchase, Defendant himself had acknowledged the shares had diminished in value by more than 50% to less than $1 million. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   SOF \u00b6 C-18\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 C-32-33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Defendant misrepresented that he had no personal investment or any other direct beneficial interest or investment in Company C and did not disclose to Oak or its funds that he or his family owned or had an interest in I-Cubed despite recommending that Oak Fund XIII buy Company C shares directly from I-Cubed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 C-10, C-27.) Thus, Defendant concealed that he was on both sides of the transaction, going so far as to forge the signature of Mr. Richard Kimball who had retired as I-Cubed's manager more than one month earlier and had no knowledge of the transaction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 C-27-29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     4. Company D\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Oak Fund IX purchased and sold Company D shares through a special purpose vehicle based in the Netherlands named A. Bohl Praktiijk B.V. (\"BPBV\"), and Defendant had substantial responsibilities in connection with this investment. (SOF D-1, D-6.) The evidence, discussed below, shows that in connection with these transactions, Defendant misappropriated money from Oak Fund IX four different times by\n   causing money to be transferred to his secret bank accounts and then transferring it to his personal accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The first misappropriation occurred in connection with Oak Fund IX's December 2004, purchase of Company D shares. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 D-1.) Defendant negotiated a letter agreement with Company D that replaced the annual dividend provisions in the deal's term sheet with a one-time management fee of $600,000 to be paid to Oak Fund IX by Company D. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 D-2.) After receiving instructions from Defendant to wire the money to a Fleet Bank account number x9310 in the name of OIP Advisors, Company D confirmed in a January 5, 2005 email that it would wire $600,000 the following day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 D-3.) On January 7, 2005, Defendant received a revised agreement reflecting a $50,000 increase in the management fee to be paid by Company D.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 D-4.) On January 11, 2005, Defendant emailed Company D stating \"[s]ame instructions as last time\" and, three days later, Company D confirmed that it had wired $50K that day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In fact, the account that Defendant provided Company D was not an Oak account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 D-5.) Rather, Defendant had previously opened a Fleet Bank account ending in numbers x9310 in the name of \"Ifitkar Ali Ahmed dba OIP Advisors,\" and after the two banks merged, that account became Bank of America account ending in numbers x9310 (the \"BOA OIP Advisors Account\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The second misappropriation was in relation to Oak Fund IX's sale of a portion of its Company D shares in May 2006. (SOF \u00b6 D-6.) Defendant had substantial responsibilities in connection with Oak Fund IX's exit from the Company D investment in 2006 and 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, Oak Fund IX agreed to pay the broker's (the \"Investment Bank\") fees and expenses in connection with the transaction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 D-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   On June 26, 2006, Defendant received a $1.2 million invoice from the Investment Bank for advisory services related to the sale of the shares. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 D-8, D-9.) That same day, Defendant opened a Bank of America account number x2349 in the name of Company D (the \"BOA Company D Account\"), on which he was listed as the sole authorized representative. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 D-10.) Company D did not actually have an account at Bank of America. (SOF \u00b6 D-6.) On July 3, 2006, BPBV wired $3 million to Defendant's BOA Company D Account, believing that to be the amount for advisory fees charged by the Investment Bank. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 D-11.) On that same day, $1.2 million was transferred to Defendant's BOA OIP Advisors Account, and $1.8 million was transferred to his joint bank account that he held with his wife, Relief Defendant Shalini Ahmed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 D-11.) On July 5, 2006, $1.2 million was transferred from Defendant's BOA OIP Account to an account for the Investment Bank. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Defendant again misappropriated funds when, in January 2007, he requested that Oak Fund IX make a $6.6 million payment for a Korean tax obligation related to the 2006 sale of Company D shares. (SOF J D-13.) Defendant submitted a wire transfer request with an invoice on Company D letterhead and included that wire transfer instructions for Defendant's BOA Company D Account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Company D invoice was not from Company D. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 D-6.) On January 26, 2007, Oak Fund IX wired a total of $6.6 million to BPBV which, in turn, on January 29, 2007, wired $6.6 million to Defendant's BOA Company D Account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 D-14.) On that same date, nearly $6.6 million was transferred from Defendant's BOA Company D Account to a joint bank account that he held\n   with his wife, Relief Defendant Shalini Ahmed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Contrary to Defendant's instructions, Oak is not aware of any document suggesting that Korean capital gains taxes were in fact assessed on the sale of the shares or that there was any legitimate reason for the $6.6 million payment that Defendant directed Oak Fund IX to make in January 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 D-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Lastly, on August 21, 2007, Defendant presented Oak Fund IX with a wire transfer request relating to another invoice on Company D letterhead seeking payment of $800,528.81 in \"[t]ransaction fees to be paid to the Korean Tax Authority\" in connection with Oak Fund IX's January and March 2007 distributions of Company D shares to its investors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 D-16.) The invoice provided wire transfer instructions for payment to Defendant's BOA Company D Account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Again, the Company D invoice was not from Company D. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 D-6.) On August 21, 2007, Oak Fund IX wired a total of $800,528.81 to Defendant's BOA Company D Account. (SOF \u00b6 D-17.) None of this money was transferred to Company D; rather, the money (minus a $30.00 wire transfer fee) was transferred to a joint bank account that Defendant held with his wife, Relief Defendant Shalini Ahmed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 D-17.) Oak is not aware of any document or other evidence to suggest that Company D paid $800,528.81 (or any other amount) in securities transaction taxes to the Korean tax authorities in connection with Oak Fund IX's March 2007 distribution of Company D shares. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 D-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     5. Company E\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Defendant recommended to Oak's Managing Partners that Oak Fund XI purchase Company E shares for 17 million Euros. (SOF \u00b6 E-1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his recommendation, Defendant used an exchange rate of 1.3 U.S. Dollars to Euros to convert the purchase price to a total of $22.1 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 E-2.) Company E's bank account appears in the final version of the written agreement for the deal and in an email from Company E to Defendant providing payment instructions, while Defendant's BOA Company E Account\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   appears in neither. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 E-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Defendant instructed Oak Fund XI to fund the $22.1 million purchase with two separate transfers: (1) $20.74 million to an account of Company E; and (2) $1.36 million to Defendant's BOA Company E Account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In the written wiring instructions that Defendant sent Oak Fund XI, Defendant represented the account name as \"[Company E] USA\" and did not state in any manner that he owned or had a personal interest in the account. (SOF \u00b6 E-4.) Three days later, on July 29, 2005, Oak Fund XI made the transfers requested by Defendant. (SEC Exs. 44, 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Although Defendant represented to Oak Fund XI that the purchase price of 17 million Euros was equivalent to $22.1 million-an exchange rate of 1.3 dollars to Euros-Defendant knew at the time that the exchange rate was actually closer to 1.2 dollars to Euros. Defendant stated as much in an email to Company E dated August 2, 2005, where he told Company E\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   that the actual exchange rate at the time of Oak Fund XI's transfer \"was more like 1.21,\" and Defendant \"did the calculations at 1.22 assuming some maring [sic] for movement\" to arrive at the $20.74 million amount transferred by Oak Fund XI to the seller. (SEC Ex. 46 at OAK-SEC-1643.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Thus, Company E agreed to a purchase price of $20.74 million but Oak Fund XI paid $22.1 million and Defendant diverted the difference of $1.36 million to Defendant's BOA \"Company E\" Account. (SOF \u00b6 E-6.) Over the next month, Defendant transferred a total of $1,358,188 from the BOA Company E Account to two of his personal accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 E-7; SEC Ex. 47 at SEC-BOA-E-2141.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Soon after the transaction, Company E notified Defendant of a shortfall in the purchase price and then accepted Defendant's suggestion that Oak Fund XI pay the shortfall of \u20ac19,486 as a setoff against the amount Company E owed Oak Fund XI for legal expenses under the Investment Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 E-5, E-8.) Unbeknownst to Oak Fund XI, Defendant then directed the seller to send the legal expense reimbursement (less the shortfall in the purchase price) to Defendant's BOA OIP Advisors Account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 E-9.) The seller complied with Defendant's direction and transferred $92,285.15 to Defendant's OIP Account on November 11, 2005. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 E-10.) Two weeks later, Defendant transferred the funds from the BOA OIP Advisors Account to his personal account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     6. Company F\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In February 2007, Oak Fund XII invested in shares of Company F. (SOF \u00b6 F-1.) Company F was required to reimburse Oak Fund XII for its legal fees in connection with the share purchase, up to $250,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 F-2.) Defendant advised Company F to send the legal fees reimbursement to his BOA OIP Advisors Account, which Company F did. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 F-3 to F-4.) Defendant then wired those funds to a joint bank account that he held with Relief Defendant Shalini Ahmed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 F-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Later in 2007, Oak Fund XII sold its shares in Company F. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 F-5.) Similar to the initial share purchase agreement, the sale agreement related to this transaction provided that the acquiring company would pay the seller's transaction expenses, with a cap of $500,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Oak Fund XII paid its own legal fees, however, once again Defendant advised Company F to send Oak Fund XII's reimbursement of legal fees to his BOA OIP Advisors Account, which Company F did. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 F-6 to F-7.) Just as in June 2007, Defendant did not provide the legal fees to Oak Fund XII, but rather wired the $500,000 to a joint bank account that he held with Relief Defendant Shalini Ahmed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 F-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     7. Company G\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Oak Fund XII purchased and sold Company G shares through its affiliated entity Oak Asia Infrastructure, LLC. (SOF \u00b6 G-1.) Specifically, with respect to these transactions, Defendant recommended and/or signed the agreements on behalf of Oak Fund XII or its affiliate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 G-2, G-7, G10.) In connection with these transactions, Defendant misappropriated money from Oak Fund XII five different times, as discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The first misrepresentation relates to Defendant's 2007 proposal that Oak Fund XII invest 40 billion Korean Won in Company G shares. (SOF \u00b6 G-2.) After the investment was approved, Defendant presented wire transfer instructions showing that Oak Fund XII was buying 2,348,904 shares for a total price of $47.5 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In accordance with Defendant's instructions, on December 18, 2007, Oak Fund XII wired $45 million to a Korea Exchange Bank account and the remaining $2.5 million to a Bank of America account\n   ending in numbers x9887 in the name of \"Company G\" (the \"BOA Company G Account 1\"), which Defendant had opened earlier that same day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 G-2, G-5.) The $2.5 million was immediately transferred to a joint bank account that Defendant held with his wife, Relief Defendant Shalini Ahmed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 G-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Defendant knew that the purchase price for the Company G shares would be less than $45 million, and he instructed that the excess funds be sent to his BOA OIP Advisors Account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 G-3.) On January 9, 2008, Korea Exchange Bank wired $2,201,070.56 to Defendant's BOA OIP Advisors Account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 G-4.) Oak has no record of receiving that money or any other amount back from the $45 million Oak Fund XII wired on December 18, 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The next day that money was transferred to a joint bank account that Defendant held with his wife, Relief Defendant Shalini Ahmed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 G-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   On four separate occasions from 2009 to 2013, Defendant presented requests for Oak Fund XII to make payments purportedly to Company G with an invoice that appeared to be on Company G letterhead. Each invoice was submitted with a wire request and contained wire transfer instructions directing that payment be remitted to one of two Bank of America accounts in the name of Company G. In each instance, Oak Fund XII made the payments as requested by Defendant. However, Defendant's BOA Company G Accounts did not belong to Company G, and Company G never received the funds mentioned above. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 G-7-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Defendant's second misrepresentation was in connection with Oak Fund XII's 2009 Tender Offer Agent Engagement Agreement for Company G that resulted in the company being taken private and delisted, which Defendant signed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 G-7.) On October 29, 2009, Defendant submitted a wire request and Company G invoice for Oak Fund XII's payment of 2,490,325,000 Korean Won (or $2,101,185.45) to Company G for purported delisting fees and legal fees with wire instructions for Defendant's BOA Company G Account 1. (SOF \u00b6 G-8.) Oak Fund XII subsequently wired the $2,101,185.45 to the BOA Company G Account 1, of which $2,099,998 was transferred to a joint bank account Defendant held with his wife the following day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 G-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Defendant's third fraud associated with Company G centers on Oak Fund XII's sale of its Company G shares in October 2011, with a portion of the sales price remaining in escrow until 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 G-10.) This agreement was also executed by Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The transaction was set up so that Oak Fund XII would receive a certain portion of the consideration for its shares at the initial closing and the remainder would be held in escrow until March 31, 2013, upon which time it would be released to Oak Fund XII. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   On November 25, 2011, Defendant submitted a wire request, along with an invoice, for Oak Fund XII's payment of a $3,113,981 \"Management Incentive Payment\" to Company G. (SOF \u00b6 G-11.) The wire request directed that $3,113,981 be paid to Company G, and the invoice contained wire transfer instructions for a Bank of America account number x6367 in the name of Company G (the \"BOA Company G Account 2\"), which Defendant had previously opened on October 17, 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 G-11-12.) On November 28, 2011, Oak Fund XII wired $3,113,981 to that account, and the next day $3,000,000 was transferred to Defendant and his wife's joint bank account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 G-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Defendant made his fourth misrepresentation on April 10, 2013 when Defendant submitted a wire transfer request, along with an invoice and an email explanation of the fees for Oak Fund XII's payment of a $1,556,990 Management Incentive Payment to Company G, related to the sale of Company G shares. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 G-13.) The invoice contained wiring instructions for the BOA Company G Account 2. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On April 11, 2013, Oak Fund XII wired $1,556,990 to the BOA Company G Account 2 and that same day the money was transferred to the joint bank account that Defendant held with his wife. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 G-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Finally, on April 29, 2013, Defendant submitted a wire transfer request, along with an invoice, for Oak Fund XII's payment of a $622,796 Investment Banking Advisory Fees reimbursement to Company G, again containing wiring instructions for the BOA Company G Account 2.

Purporting to act pursuant to agreements between Oak and Company H, Defendant directed Company H to transfer nearly 1.5 million British pounds to the BOA OIP Advisors Account as reimbursement for Oak's legal expenses.

(SOF \u00b6 I-1.) Defendant represented to Oak that this purchase price translated into $3.6084 per share for a total of approximately 59 million U.S. dollars, and that this was based upon a fixed exchange rate of 1.62 dollars to the British pound, which had been reflected in a term sheet signed in November 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 I-2, I-3.) These representations were not true-the November 2010 term sheet contained no such provision for a fixed exchange rate, and application of the correct exchange rate on the date of Oak Fund XII's investment would have resulted in a per share price of $3.49.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 I-6.) Defendant directed Company I to wire these surplus funds to his secret BOA OIP Advisors Account, which Company I did. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 I-7, I-8.)

(SEC Ex. 51 at OAK-SEC-5630, 5662.) Defendant worked on Oak Fund XI's purchase of Company J shares. (SOF \u00b6 J-2.) The Share Purchase Agreement stated that Company J would use the proceeds from the sale of the stock to, among other things, fund the payment of a one-time special dividend to Oak Fund XI in the amount of $0.12 per share, which equates to $1.8 million.

He further contends that he cannot be an \"investment adviser\" under the federal securities laws because he did not hold the requisite licenses and certifications and was not registered with any state or federal agency. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 44-47.) Lastly, he maintains that an investment adviser must be compensated in certain ways. None of his arguments are availing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The record indisputably shows that Defendant was not simply some \"assistant,\" but played a central role in the transactions at issue. From 2004 through 2015 he recommended and advised that Oak Funds IX, XI, XII, and XIII purchase or sell securities, and then monitored and managed\n   those investments. (SOF \u00b6 X-8.) Specifically, Defendant's responsibilities at Oak included identifying, analyzing, and recommending investment opportunities for the various Oak Funds at issue in this case, which were typically investments in the securities of various \"portfolio companies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 X-6, X-7.) Defendant was also responsible for negotiating the terms of the investments and managing the relationships with the companies in which the Oak Funds invested. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 X-6.) Indeed, Defendant signed many of the agreements for the transactions at issue on behalf of Oak.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , SEC Ex. 127 at Oak-SEC-747; SEC Ex. 135 at Oak-SEC-26.) Contrary to Defendant's contention, the fact that he was not licensed, certified, or registered with any state or federal agency does not preclude him from being considered an investment adviser under the Adviser's Act, as the Act's definition of an adviser turns on conduct, not certification or registration.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    U.S. v. Onsa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=523%20Fed.%20Appx.%2063\">\n    523 Fed.Appx. 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 65 (2d Cir. 2013) (\"[T]he Act defines investment adviser in a functional way, applying to 'any person' who engages in the specified conduct,\" and \"the structure of the Act demonstrates that individuals need not register, or even be\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to register, in order to be an 'investment adviser' within the meaning of the Act.\" (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-2(a)(11) ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   In addition, Defendant was clearly compensated for his work at Oak. (SOF \u00b6 X-9.) There is no requirement that an investment adviser be compensated in any particular way, and Defendant's citation to an SEC Investor Bulletin is unconvincing. (Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 47 &amp;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at n.57.) Even if the bulletin were binding on this Court, it says only that individuals \"might\" pay a broad range of financial professionals in certain ways.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   https://www.sec.gov/investor/alerts/ib_top_tips.pdf at 2. It does not purport to exhaustively list the ways investments advisers are compensated. Defendant's misappropriation of investor funds is sufficient, by itself, to meet the \"compensation\" element of the definition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

Section 206(2) prohibits an investment advisor from engaging \"in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or prospective client.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-6(2). Section 206(4) prohibits advisers from engaging in \"any act, practice, or course of\n   business which is fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative\" as defined by rules promulgated by the SEC. For conduct after September 10, 2007, Rule 206(4)-8 prohibits advisers to \"pooled investment vehicles\" from engaging in fraudulent acts or making material misrepresentations to investors or prospective investors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20275.206\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 275.206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4)-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     i. Defendant's Fraud was Directed Towards Clients and Investors\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Defendant argues that certain of his misconduct related to Companies D, E, F, G, and H did not violate Sections 206(1) or 206(2) of the Advisers Act because he did not direct this fraud to any \"clients.\" (Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 40-41.) However, Defendant's clients were the various Oak Funds, and the record demonstrates without question that Defendant's fraud was directed towards these Funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   With respect to Company D, Defendant fraudulently informed Company D that it was to pay $650,000 in a \"management fee\" to an Oak entity in exchange for removing a provision from the Oak Fund's investment agreement that would have required Company D to pay an annual dividend. (SOF \u00b6\u00b6 D-1-D-2.) In other words, Defendant fraudulently bargained away a provision that would have benefitted his client in exchange for $650,000 that he misappropriated for himself. Similarly, with respect to Companies E, F, and G, Defendant fraudulently caused these companies to pay legal fees that his clients (the Oak funds) were entitled to receive to an account that he personally controlled, and then further misappropriated these funds for his personal use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 E-5, E-8-E-10, F-1-F-8, H-1-H-6.) And with respect to Company G, Defendant fraudulently induced his client-the Oak fund-to send money that it thought was paying to Company G for \"delisting fees\" to another account that he personally controlled, and again misappropriated these funds for his personal use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 G-8-G-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   In each of these instances, Defendant either misappropriated a benefit his client was entitled to receive (Company D), intercepted funds his client was entitled to be paid (Companies E, F, and H), or caused his client to send him money it thought was destined for a portfolio company (Company G). Defendant's misconduct and resultant misappropriation of his clients' money plainly violated his \"affirmative duty of utmost good faith, and full and fair disclosure\" to his clients, therefore violating Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Advisers Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Defendant also argues that his conduct did not violate Advisers Act Section 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-8 because he did not direct any of his fraud to \"investors.\" (Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 42-43.) As discussed above, Rule 206(4)-8 provides that an investment adviser may not, among other things, \"engage in any act, practice, or course of business that is fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative with respect to any investor ...\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20275.206\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 275.206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4)-8(a) (2).

Because it is evident that Defendant did not disclose his interest in I-Cubed to Oak or Oak Fund XIII when Oak Fund XIII bought Company C shares directly from I-Cubed, Oak Fund XIII did not have the opportunity to-and in fact did not-give its consent to the transaction knowing that, in effect, Defendant was on the other side. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SOF \u00b6 C-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Defendant argues that SEC's claim under Section 206(3) of the Adviser's Act must fail because Defendant was not \" 'acting as a principal for his\n   <em>\n    own account\n   </em>\n   ,' \" but rather \"traded securities belonging to a company owned by his wife.\" (Def.'s Memo at 27 (emphasis in original).) Defendant's argument is meritless. As an initial matter, Defendant provides no evidentiary support, or even argument, that his wife in fact controlled I-Cubed and owned the Company C shares. Therefore, there is no basis for the Court to revisit its previous ruling rejecting this very argument. Following the preliminary injunction hearing, the Court explained\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-174\">\n   Despite Mr. Ahmed's nominal transfer of this interest in I-Cubed before the October 2014 sale, the evidence shows that he continued to control the company's bank account and flow of funds and Mrs. Ahmed's testimony at the hearing demonstrated that she played little, if any, role in the sale negotiations with Oak and did not learn of the sale until after it took place.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   ( [Doc. # 113] at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   The record establishes that Defendant formed I-Cubed, purchased the Company C shares in the name of I-Cubed, and, despite transferring the entity into the name of his wife, subsequently negotiated the sale of the Company C shares, going so far as to forge the signature of the purported I-Cubed representative on the stock purchase agreement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SOF \u00b6\u00b6 C-17-25, C-28-29.) Indeed, it was Defendant who opened the Bank of America account just days before the sale of I-Cubed's Company C shares to the Oak fund, certifying on that account opening document that he was a \"member\" of I-Cubed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 C-20.) Ms. Ahmed was not even aware of this I-Cubed bank account until her deposition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant also wrote checks for the proceeds of the I-Cubed Company C shares from the Bank of America account to the Shalini Ahmed 2014 GRAT. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 C-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Additionally, Ms. Ahmed admitted at the preliminary injunction hearing that while owning the Company C shares on paper, she played no role in their sale and in fact did not even learn of the sale until after it took place.

Their math reveals they assumed these representations were made in connection with the December 2004 transaction, which none were. Rather, the evidence establishes that just months after the May 2006 securities purchase agreement, in July, Defendant fraudulently obtained $1.8 million by exploiting a provision in the agreement related to advisory fees that the relevant Oak fund was required to pay pursuant to the securities transaction.

Defendant later fraudulently obtained an additional $6.6 million (in January 2007) and $800,000 (in August 2007) by claiming these monies were owed to tax authorities as a result of the May 2006 sale and January/March 2007 distribution of Company D shares.

As discussed above, under\n   <em>\n    Absolute Activist\n   </em>\n   the SEC need only show that either of these events occurred in the United States in order to establish domesticity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   The SEC claims the Oak funds formed contracts, incurred closing obligations, and transferred or received money while in the United States, thereby rendering the transactions domestic. (Pl's Mot. for Summ. J. at 18.) The SEC supports its claim of domesticity primarily with the testimony of Oak's designated witness, Ms. Grace Ames, bolstered by the adverse inference against Defendant arising from his invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights, and several emails and letters specific to transactions A, B, and E. For their part, Defendants rely entirely on the language of the contracts to argue that the transactions occurred abroad, without offering any extrinsic evidence indicating where in actuality irrevocable liability attached and transfer of title took place.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   <em>\n    1.

Here, the Oak funds at issue-Oak Fund IX, XI, XII, and XIII-are all limited partnerships registered in Delaware (SOF \u00b6 X-19), and the offices of Oak's managing members responsible for approving investments during the relevant time period were all in the United States (Ames Depo. at 282:10-4). All Oak email addresses ended with @OakVC.Com and the Oak servers housing these email addresses are located in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 296:8-297:5.) In addition, the legal counsel Oak used to help negotiate the stock purchase and other agreements for the transactions at issue, Finn Dixon &amp; Herling, is also based in Connecticut.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Ames Depo. at 290:5-291:22.) Although not sufficient on its own, the fact that Oak is a United States company which functioned out of United States offices during the relevant time period, lends some support for the SEC's claim that the transactions themselves also occurred domestically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Moreover, Ms. Ames attested that when an Oak Fund was a purchaser, Oak transferred the purchase payment from its bank in the U.S, and the Oak representatives who directed the Oak Funds' bank to transfer money were similarly based out of the U.S. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 309:3-10.) When an Oak fund was a seller, Oak received the purchase payment in a bank account located\n   in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 309:25-310:11.) Furthermore, she specifically testified that Oak did not have a practice of traveling outside the United States for the formation of, or to enter into, contracts for the purchase or sale of an investment, nor did it do so to exchange signatures or funds or to obtain share certificates. (Ames. Depo. at 331:3-333:22.) Rather, these actions all generally occurred from the Oak offices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She also confirmed that Oak followed its general practices with respect to the transactions associated with Companies A through J.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Ames Depo. at 334:16-338:21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   <em>\n    2. The Court Applies an Adverse Inference\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   Defendant asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege and declined to answer when the SEC asked him with respect to each Company where the respective investment, purchase, or sale, was \"negotiated, approved, and transacted.\" (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , SEC Ex. 2 (Def.'s Depo.) at 16:5-8, 22:4-6, 79:7-25.) As a result of Defendant's choice to remain silent on this point, the Court draws an adverse inference against Defendant, meaning that the Court infers that his response to the question would have affirmed the domesticity of the transactions. As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , this inference can be applied at the summary judgment phase, balanced against the other evidence in the record.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    LiButti I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7635927\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/107/110/#p124\">\n    107 F.3d at 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   <em>\n    3.

Black's Law Dictionary defines title as \"[l]egal evidence of a person's ownership rights in property.\" TITLE, Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). Subsequent cases (discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ) focus primarily on irrevocable liability and do not expand upon the\n   <em>\n    Absolute Activist\n   </em>\n   language, but the Second Circuit's reliance on the Eleventh Circuit's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Quail Cruises\n   </em>\n   is telling because there the Eleventh Circuit found that the complaint's allegations that share transfer documents\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   were delivered\n   to the United States was sufficient to allege title was transferred domestically. Accordingly, the point at which title is transferred is when it is delivered to the location of the buyer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   The SEC maintains all of the transactions are domestic because either Oak wired funds from the United States to purchase securities, ownership of which it then received while located in the United States, or it received funds and sent title from within the United States when acting as the seller. Defendants urge the court to enforce the language in the parties' contracts, contending that in each transaction title was to be transferred at the closing, and these closings were intended to take place in foreign countries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   Ms. Ames stated that \"in this electronic age ... there's not a case where the Oaks all travel to ... a location for a closing and people sit around the [ ]table ... that's just not how our business is done.\" (298:15-21.) She testified that Oak was \"never in a room giving a check in one hand and receiving share certificates in the other hand\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 327:20-328:2), nor was it ever in the same room as its counterparty when signatures were exchanged (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 319:14-25). Original stock certificates representing Oak's ownership in the respective Company would generally be physically mailed to Oak's counsel after the closing took place, and vice versa where Oak was the seller. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 322:13-324:3, 326:19-327:5.) Oak's project managers generally signed and received signed documents from Oak's offices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 320:2-16.) Moreover, the evidence the SEC puts forth for both transactions A and B demonstrates that although the parties may have agreed in the contract that the closing would take place at a certain foreign location, they did not necessarily act in accordance with that language, undercutting Defendants' argument that title was transferred abroad at closing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   The Share Purchase Agreement involving Company A states that \"[t]he closing hereunder, including payment for and delivery of the Shares, shall be deemed to have occurred at the offices of the Company, immediately following the execution of this Agreement, or at such other time and place as Seller and Purchaser may mutually agree ....\" (Defs.' 56(a) 1 Stmt. \u00b6 7; RD Ex. 1, at OAK-SEC-00000742; SEC SOF A-7; SEC Ex. 127.) The offices of Company A are located in Shanghai, China. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RD's Ex. 2 at OAK-SEC-00000715; Ames Depo. at 41:11-42:17.) The Agreement further required the Purchaser (an Oak fund) to \"deliver [payment for the\n   shares] on the Closing Date to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds ....\" (RD Ex. 1 \u00a7 2(b) at OAK-SEC-00000742.) Relief Defendants acknowledge that Oak's designated witness testified that Oak's representatives were not present at Company A's offices at the time of the closing (Defs.' 56(a) 1 Stmt. \u00b6 9; Ex. 3, Ames Depo. 22:15-23:13), but argue that is not significant based upon their contention that the Court \"must enforce the words of the parties establishing that the closing-and passing of title-took place in Shanghai, China.\" (RDs' Mot. for Summ. J. at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   However, the SEC points to the email that Defendant, acting on behalf of Oak, sent the seller, requesting the seller \"please send me scanned and signed signature pages as soon as you can. I leave for vacation tomorrow and hence getting these out to you before I leave.\" (SEC Ex. 124 at SEC-686.) The seller signed the deal documents with a purchase price of $1.5 million and delivered the signature pages and share transfer form to Defendant's Oak email address. (SOF A-5; SEC Exs. 125; 126.) The share transfer form stated that the seller \"for value received, does hereby transfer to Oak Investment Partners XIII ... the ... Series A Preference Shares.\" (SEC Ex. 127 at SEC-749.) On behalf of Oak Fund XIII, Defendant signed a copy of the signature page for the Share Purchase Agreement that had already been signed by the seller. (Compare SEC Ex. 127 at OAKSEC-747, with SEC Ex. 125 at OAK-SEC-705.) Subsequently, Defendant sent an e-mail to the purchasers from his U.S.-based email address, saying that \"[a]ll signed docs are in. Good to wire and close the purchase.\" (SEC Ex. 127.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   The Company B Agreement provides that \"[c]ompletion shall take place at the offices of the Seller's solicitors (or any other location as agreed by the Seller and the Buyer) on the Completion Date.\" (RD LR 56 \u00b6 11; Ex. 4, at OAK-SEC-00000477.) The Seller's \"solicitors\" are not identified in the agreement and Oak's designated witness was unable to testify as to the location of the offices of the Seller's solicitors, but other evidence indicates it is in Shanghai, China. (R. Defs.' 56(a)1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 13-14; Ex. 3, Ames Depo. 63:3-66:24, 344:22-345:21; Ex. 5, at OAK-SEC-000000008.) According to the agreement, the seller was to provide a written instrument of transfer and \"the original share certificates\" to Oak at the closing. (RD.'s Ex. 4 \u00a7 5.2 at OAK-SEC-00000477 and Schedule 2, Part 1 at OAK-SEC00000484.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   In contrast with this language, in an email exchange regarding the Company B transaction, Counsel for Oak explicitly stated that \"[t]o be clear, the closing will not yet have occurred and requires the completion of the [O]ak wire. Oak can't wire until it is confirmed that the signing of the SPA has occurred.\" (SEC Ex. 135 at OAK-SEC-8.) The Seller emailed Oak's counsel the signed SPA and \"Instrument of Transfer,\" to be held in escrow until Oak wired the funds, upon which the transaction closed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at OAK-SEC-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   The Court is not persuaded by Defendants' argument that it should enforce the language of the contracts, given that both the testimony of Ms. Ames and the emails concerning transactions A and B illustrate that the parties did not act in accordance with those terms. Defendants have therefore offered no evidence of where title was actually transferred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   On the other hand, the emails offered by the SEC establish title was transferred in the United States in both transactions A and B, since in each instance the signed transfer instruments were electronically sent to Oak's United States registered email addresses as part of the closing, rather than at the locations for closing identified in each respective agreement. Additionally, these emails tend to support Ms. Ames' testimony that the parties were never exchanging documents, such as the share transfer forms and stock certificates, while in the same room, but instead Oak received these documents in the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, where Oak was the purchaser, there is no genuine dispute of fact on this record that it obtained title to the respective securities in the United States, and accordingly no rational jury could find these transactions were entirely foreign.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   <em>\n    4. Irrevocable Liability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   With respect to irrevocable liability, there are several points at which parties might be bound, and the parties may become bound at two separate times and locations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   , 992 F.Supp.2d at 178. On this record, the Court cannot determine the exact point at which irrevocable liability attached for each respective transaction. Nonetheless, for each potential point at which the parties may have been irrevocably bound, the evidence demonstrates that at least one party (Oak) was acting from the United States, and therefore all of the transactions are domestic under\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a. Contract Formation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   The first opportunity at which the parties could have incurred an irrevocable obligation to perform was the point at which they formed the agreements-where there was a meeting of the minds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Absolute Activist\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3872171\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/60/\">\n    677 F.3d at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   According to Oak's designated witness, Oak's partners evaluated and discussed investments at weekly partner meetings held in Oak's United States offices and it was often at these meeting that individuals would both seek and gain approval of investments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Ames. Depo. at 283:14-285:9.) Ms. Ames confirmed that Oak did not have a practice of traveling outside the US to form contracts for the purchase or sale of investments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 330:20-331:2.) She further testified that the Oak project manager and Oak's counsel (Finn Dixon &amp; Herling), both based out of the United States, generally worked together to negotiate agreements on behalf of Oak with respect to the purchase, sale or disposition of investments-i.e. to form the contracts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 291:3-22.) Defendants offer no evidence of where the contracts were formed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b. Conditions Precedent\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   Subsequently, irrevocable liability might be incurred upon completion of the final closing condition, thereby obligating the parties to close the transaction. The SEC argues that \"the Oak funds had no obligation to close until they received (as a buyer) or sent (as a seller) the required notice\" indicating that necessary closing conditions had been satisfied, which were sent from and received in Connecticut. (PL's Mot. for Summ. J. at 17.) It concludes that \"incurring the obligation to close a transaction while located in the United States ... is sufficient to locate the transactions in the United States under\n   <em>\n    Absolute Activist\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Relief Defendants, for their part, contend that \"the SEC must present evidence that the last condition precedent that was satisfied for each transaction occurred in the United States,\" which they maintain it cannot do. (RDs' Opp'n at 10.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   Relief Defendants' basic contention is that in each of the agreements there were multiple conditions which had to occur before the closing could take place, some of which would have had to occur outside of the United States, and because the SEC has not presented the Court with evidence as to which of the conditions occurred last, it cannot establish each transaction is domestic. For instance, they argue that conditions requiring certain documents and certificates be delivered to investors or the buyer at the closing indicates these conditions were satisfied in the foreign location designated as the closing location in the respective agreements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relief Defendants also point to conditions in the July Company F agreement requiring that in order for the closing to proceed the buyer was required to have a certain resolution filed and registered by the Target's Register of Parma, Italy. (Defs.' 56(a)1 Stmt. \u00b6 64; Ex. 18 \u00a7 11.1 at OAK-SEC-00005336-37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   The Court affords Relief Defendants' first argument little weight, given that as discussed above, Ms. Ames's testimony that closings never occurred with the parties in the same room, and the email exchanges illustrating both the closings for Companies A and B occurred remotely with Oak acting from its United States based email accounts, undermine the language in the contracts providing that closing was to occur in these foreign locations. With respect to Relief Defendants' second argument, there are several flaws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   First, there is no support in existing case law for the proposition that irrevocable liability attaches abroad for a party located in the United States simply because the last condition precedent was completed in a foreign country. Relief Defendants rely upon\n   <em>\n    Adderley\n   </em>\n   , discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , but there the court merely held that the formation of an agreement to purchase securities did not create irrevocable liability because a necessary condition was never satisfied. No. 15 CIV. 9935 (NRB),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201319819\">\n    2017 WL 1319819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7-8 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2017) (\"[I]rrevocable liability for purposes of Section 10(b) was not incurred.\"). The condition required the approval of the Bahamian authorities, but nothing in\n   <em>\n    Adderley\n   </em>\n   suggests that the buyer (located in\n   New York) would have incurred irrevocable liability inside of a Bahamian clerk's office without the buyer's knowledge if the deal had received government approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Second, and relatedly, the agreements almost uniformly contained a final condition requiring delivery of notice to Oak, and/or that Oak send notice to its counterparty, confirming that all other conditions to closing had been satisfied or waived. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , RDs' Ex. 14 \u00a7 1.10 at SEC-1334-35 (the investors, including Oak \"shall confirm to the Company that the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 1.11 below ... have been met or have been waived....\"); RD's Ex. 18 \u00a7\u00a7 5.1.2 and 5.1.3 at SEC-5296 (requiring both that the Buyer send written evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent referred to in Clause 11 to the Seller and that \"[t]he Sellers ... give to Buyer ... written evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent ...\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Ames stated that the Oak representatives (counsel and project managers) would be notified the closing conditions had been met while located in their Connecticut offices either by email or telephonically. (Ames Depo. at 294:23-296:7; 299:21-300:3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   Absent any evidence or language in the contracts tying the completion of the final condition precedent to the point at which the parties became bound, the Court cannot determine on this record if this was in fact the point at which the parties were irrevocably obligated to perform. Although it is true that the transactions could not close absent completion of all conditions precedent, nothing in the contracts suggest that was also sufficient to commit the parties to perform. That being said, if indeed this is the point at which irrevocable liability attached, the record demonstrates that in each case Oak sent and received notice that closing conditions had been satisfied while located in the United States, and Defendants again offer nothing outside of the language of the contracts themselves, which is unavailing at the summary judgment stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     c. Execution of the Agreement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   Finally, the parties might not become irrevocably bound until they sign the agreement and obligate themselves to either deliver the securities or wire the funds to purchase the securities.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Liberty Media Corp. v.

Oak has the obligation now to fulfill whatever it had committed to in the document and to proceed with the security transaction.\" (Ames Depo. at 302:3-18.) She further testified that counterparties' signatures would be sent to Oak offices so the respective project manager could sign the document (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 320:2-16) and that Oak project managers signed written agreements while located at the Oak offices in the United States (\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   at 292:12-292:4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   Defendants' objection that Ms. Ames' testimony is \"general practices\" evidence that cannot alone satisfy the SEC's burden is unpersuasive here, where Ms. Ames not only testified that Oak followed its general practices with respect to the transactions associated with Companies A through J (Ames Depo. at 334:16-338:21), but also buttresses this evidence with the adverse inference against Defendant, as well as the evidence relating to the Companies A and B transactions, which support Ms. Ames' testimony. In contrast, Defendants proffer only the language of the contracts, without identifying a single piece of extrinsic evidence indicating that any of these transactions actually occurred abroad, or even addressing the SEC's evidence establishing that the language of the contracts was ignored. As the Court has noted already, Defendants' reliance on the language of the contracts is insufficient. The mere fact that the parties may have intended for their conduct to occur outside of the United States carries no significance, for the question is not where the parties desired the transaction to take place, but where in fact it did take place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vilar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699841\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/729/62/#p77\">\n    729 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   93 n.12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   In sum, in all but three of the disputed transactions, Oak was the buyer, and the SEC proffered evidence that title was delivered either electronically to its United States email accounts, or physically to its offices located in the United States.

(Compl. [Doc. # 1].) On June 16, 2015, the SEC filed its Amended Complaint [Doc. # 33] in which it added the remaining Relief Defendants as parties and asserted additional claims against Defendant arising out of transactions associated with Companies D, E, F, G, H, and I.

(\n    <em>\n     See e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Doc. # 286.) Since Defendant has submitted no evidence to support his denials, and since the record does not support those denials, the facts set forth in the SEC's Rule 56(a) 1 Statement have been established as true for purposes of summary judgment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Henderson v.

First, not all of Ms. Ames' testimony was stated in such terms. Second, as discussed below, the SEC offers additional evidence of domesticity, and third, Ms. Ames specifically affirmed that Oak had followed its general practices with respect to these transactions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"36\">\n   <p id=\"p-295\">\n    \"Share transfer documents\" might refer to forms in which the seller purports to transfer its interest to the Buyer (\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    SEC Ex. 135 at SEC-47 (the Seller \"for value received, does hereby transfer to Oak ... the following shares ...[,]\") ) stock/share certificates, or both. According to the SEC, \"[s]tock certificates are title-the documents prove that Oak owns the shares it purchases. It does not matter whether Oak receives title on or after a closing date-the location of the transaction occurs at the place title is delivered regardless of when it is delivered.\" (Pl.'s Reply at 9.) Given that title is evidence of ownership, an executed document which specifically expresses the buyer's ownership interest would constitute the transfer of title, even where the stock certificates are to be transferred at a later time.

However, it does find that where Oak was the seller and delivered title in the form of the transfer instruments and/or actual stock certificates to a foreign country, title was not transferred domestically. Title can be transferred only once, and the SEC cannot have it both ways-i.e, that when Oak was the buyer it was transferred in the United States upon delivery, but when it was the seller it was transferred when Oak sent it from the United States to a foreign country.

Based on the record and facts in this case, the Court agrees. For instance, the Company A agreement provides as a condition to closing that the Seller and Purchaser, respectively, \"shall have performed all obligations and conditions herein required to be performed or observed by it on or prior to the Closing Date.\" (RDs' Ex. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 5(a)(iii), 5(b)(iii).)

Moreover, Relief Defendants similarly have not offered any such evidence-and given the extent of discovery in this case, they had every opportunity to uncover documents establishing that the transactions occurred outside of the United States.
