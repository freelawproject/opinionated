For the reasons that follow, the arbitration award will be confirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 23, 2014, Altruist, LLC and Medex Patient Transport, LLC (doing business as Caliber Patient Care) (\"Medex\") entered into a Franchise Agreement relating to the provision of emergency medical transportation services. The Franchise Agreement provided that all disputes, except for those involving intellectual property rights or claims for injunctive relief, were to be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Altruist filed a demand for arbitration on May 27, 2016, alleging intentional misrepresentation/fraud in the inducement, negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, violation of the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\"), and misrepresentation by concealment. It sought rescission, punitive damages, and attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The claims were arbitrated from April 25 through 28, 2017. On July 5, 2017, an AAA arbitrator issued an Interim Award that resolved all claims, except the award of attorney's fees, which required further briefing as to the amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the Interim Award, the arbitrator found in favor of Altruist and its co-owners, Susan K. Bigelow and Joanna Milkovich, on three grounds-breach of the contract, fraudulent inducement, and violation of the TCPA. He also found rescission under the TCPA to be appropriate, and awarded $235,611.71 (representing damages, interest, AAA fees, and the arbitrator's fees and expenses), of which $29,968.94 had already been paid. The award was assessed against Medex d/b/a Caliber and its owners, Klein and Kyle Calvert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Final Award (\"Award\") assessing an additional $211,015.81 in attorney's fees and costs was rendered on August 14, 2017, making the total $416,758.58. Respondents seek to vacate the award on the ground that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law in various respects. Altruist requests confirmation of the award, attorney's fees for having to defend this action, and post-judgment interest at a rate set by Tennessee statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"The Federal Arbitration Act ('FAA') expresses a presumption that arbitration awards will be confirmed.\"\n   <em>\n    Nationwide Mut.

Among other things, a FDD requires the disclosure of bankruptcy by certain individuals within the preceding ten years, but Medex failed to disclose that Kyle Calvert had filed for bankruptcy on July 20, 2013. The arbitrator found this failure to be a material breach upon which Altruist reasonably relied, and supported its claim for fraudulent inducement. It was not error for him to consider evidence on this issue because the integration clauses specifically allowed Altruist to rely on the representations in the FDD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Nor was it in violation of the integration clauses for the arbitrator to hear evidence on \"back-office operations\" provided by Medex. According to Susan Bigelow and two other franchisees, Kyle Calvert represented that Medex would handle all back-office operations, including fielding calls, scheduling, dispatching, and invoicing. Bigelow also stated that Kyle Calvert told her the back-office support was such that neither she nor Milkovich would need to work full-time to run the franchise. Thereafter, Altruist signed the franchise agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As Medex points out, the integration clauses prohibit reliance upon \"inducements, promises or agreements, oral or otherwise, between the parties not embodied in this Agreement.\" However, in the Franchise Agreement, Medex promised that, \"in exchange for the Operations Fee, Franchisor shall operate a centralized service center to provide the following services to the Franchisee: (i) call center, (ii) centralized dispatch, (iii) route management, (iv) certain office function, (v) reporting invoices to Franchisee, and (vi) route efficiency planning and the mapping of trouble spots.\" (Doc. No. 1-1, Agreement \u00a7 14.3). Medex also promised to \"use commercially reasonable effort to provide these services ... in the same\n   <em>\n    first-class\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    high-quality\n   </em>\n   as performed for Patient Transport Businesses operated by Franchisor or its Affiliates.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.)\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Parol evidence used to determine whether the services provided by Medex were, in fact, \"first class and high quality\" does not violate the integration clauses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In any event, \"there is no rule that a merger clause makes reliance on oral representations unreasonable\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   so as to necessarily defeat a fraudulent inducement or promissory fraud claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Shah v.

Application of the TCPA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Respondents also argue that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law by applying the TCPA, even though Altruist \"did not point to any enumerated provision of the Act that it alleged was violated in its Amended Statement of Claim.\" (Doc. No. 13 at 11). While Respondents are correct that the TCPA's catchall provision in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2047-18-104\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 47-18-104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(27) is only enforceable by the attorney general, the nature of Altruist's TCPA claim was hardly a mystery. In its Amended Statement of Claims, Altruist alleged that the TCPA is to be interpreted and construed in accordance with Section 5(A)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), and that Respondents engaged in \"unfair and/or deceptive trade practices in connection with the sale of the franchise [by], among others: (a) affirmatively representing that Caliber had not [sic] bankruptcy or litigation disclosures in Item 3 and Item 4 of the FDD; (b) representing that the franchised business had characteristics and benefits that the business did not in fact, have; (c) representing that the business had particular qualities that it did not, in fact, have; (d) representing that the business had rights that it did not have; and (e) engaging in other acts an practices which were deceptive to Altruist ... all of which are in violation of TCPA \u00a7 47-18-104(b).\" (Doc. No. 13-5 \u00b6 112). This was more than sufficient to place the TCPA claim before the arbitrator under the Commercial Arbitration Rules that requires that a claimant provide \"a statement setting forth the nature of the claim including the relief sought and the amount involved.\" Commercial Arbitration Rule R-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Respondents also contend that, even if the TCPA claim was properly before the arbitrator, \"there is absolutely no basis and no private cause of action in the state of Tennessee for a private plaintiff/claimant to enforce the Franchise Rule\" of the FTC, and \"[t]here is no private cause of action under the FTC Act.\" (Doc.

Maybe so, but \"the TCPA, like the little FTC acts of many other states, explicitly provides that it is to be interpreted and construed in accordance with interpretations of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n    15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) by the Federal Trade Commission and the federal courts.\"\n   <em>\n    Tucker v.

Ct. App. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Regardless, the award was not based upon the Franchise Rule or the FTC. Quite the contrary, the arbitrator acknowledged \"that a violation of the FTC Rule is not a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   violation of the TCPA,\" but found that Medex's misrepresentations about its \"back office\" services was both a misrepresentation of goods or services within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2047-18-104\">\n    Tenn.

The arbitrator found that Kyle Calvert was personally involved in the decision to omit the bankruptcy from the FDD, and that this omission was so important that Klein Calvert should have known of it. The arbitrator also found that both were personally involved in the misrepresentations relating to back-office operation and support. This was sufficient for purposes of the FAA because, as stated previously, arbitrators are not required to explain their decisions absent a request for specific findings and conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

The upshot of all this is that, notwithstanding any comparisons between taking an appeal and pursuing an action for confirmation, there is nothing in the Federal Arbitration Act itself that would authorize a district court to go beyond confirming an arbitrators' award and independently award additional attorneys' fees.
