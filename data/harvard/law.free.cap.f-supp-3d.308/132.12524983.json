The Fund claims that Arnold Walter owes $29,830.53 in contributions and interest, plus attorney's fees and costs. Arnold Walter asserts that the Fund's calculations for both amounts are unreliable. For the reasons explained below, I find that no genuine dispute exists as to any material fact, and will enter summary judgment for the Fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Rather, it claims that \"genuine issues of material fact persist as to the amount of damages,\" Opp. 3, and \"the Court must significantly adjust down the amount [in attorney's fees] requested.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. I am satisfied that no reasonable jury could find for Arnold Walter on the question of liability, given the Fund's allegations, the governing documents and supporting evidence, and Arnold Walter's failure to dispute the point. For the reasons stated below, I also find that no genuine issue of material fact remains as to the amount requested in either damages or attorney's fees. Accordingly, summary judgment will be entered for the Fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Fund has Adequately Demonstrated the Amount of Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   To prove the amount of damages, the Fund relies on the affidavit of Ms. Smith, its Contributions Compliance Manager, who \"maintain[s] the Fund's records, determine[s] whether participating employers have satisfied their obligations, and assist[s] in efforts to collect delinquent contributions.\" Smith. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.

In making these calculations, Ms. Smith relies on \"the remittance reports that Defendant provided to the Fund, the contributions that Defendant remitted ... the dates on which the reports and contributions were received, and the interest and liquidated damages that were assessed on any underpaid or late paid contributions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.

Yet no party disputes that only employees who have lasted for 90 days are eligible for contributions. The only other relevant assertion is that Arnold Walter has correctly calculated the amounts that it owes, summarized that information in remittance reports, and then \"paid ... for individuals who ... met the applicable threshold eligibility criteria.\" Jasinski Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-9. Since we have paid our obligations, Arnold Walter seems to reason, the Fund must have \"improperly included ... certain individuals who have not met the required threshold criteria.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   But if this is so, why does Arnold Walter not dispute the question of liability?

None at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The absence of evidence is even harder to ignore in this context, because\n   the Fund pulls all of its data from remittance reports that Arnold Walter itself prepares and submits. If Arnold Walter knew of a remittance report that demonstrated (or even hinted at) inaccuracies in the Fund's math, it could easily produce that evidence. As it is, we have on one hand the Fund's detailed evidence for the calculation process, and the detailed final numbers resulting from that process, while on the other hand we have Arnold Walter's conclusory assertion that it has paid in full, and so the Fund must have improperly included ineligible employees.

Bristol Manor Healthcare Ctr., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the district court rejected an accusation that the Fund was only \"summarily stat[ing] the amounts they believe are owed\" in a spreadsheet, and then \"expect[ing] Bristol Manor and the Court to take the alleged amounts owed on their face.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289653\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/153/363/#p375\">\n    153 F.Supp.3d 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 375 (D.D.C. 2016) (alteration in original). The court held that \" Rule 1006 allows Plaintiffs to do so. If Bristol Manor believes the summary evidence to be inaccurate, then the burden falls on Bristol Manor to rebut it with affirmative evidence of its own.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289653\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/153/363/#p375\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, Bristol Manor had not \"produced a version of Plaintiffs' spreadsheets that Bristol Manor claims is accurate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289653\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/153/363/#p375\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing to a \"Jasinski Decl. \u00b6 12\"). With \"no admissible evidence contradicting Plaintiffs' spreadsheets, nor any colorable argument calling the spreadsheets' accuracy into doubt,\" the court concluded that the defendant had failed to \"point to specific facts in the record that reveal a genuine issue suitable for trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289653\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/153/363/#p375\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Celotex\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 324,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p322\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Because \"Plaintiffs' spreadsheets [were] the only admissible evidence offered to show the appropriate total amount of unpaid contributions, interest, and liquidated damages,\" the court awarded summary judgment in the amount requested.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p322\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p322\">\n    at 375-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Only five months later, in\n   <em>\n    Serv. Employees Int'l Union Nat'l Indus. Pension Fund v. Harborview Healthcare Ctr. Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the district court faced strikingly similar evidence from the Fund, and similar objections from the employer at issue.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122028\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/191/13/#p19\">\n    191 F.Supp.3d 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 19 (D.D.C. 2016). Again undergirded by an affidavit from Mr. Jasinski, the defendant \"suggest[ed] that plaintiffs may have erroneously included overtime hours or other ineligible hours (e.g. hours worked by employees who have been employed for fewer than 90 days) in the gross payroll numbers and thus miscalculated the contributions owed by Harborview.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122028\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/191/13/#p19\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But the court rejected this argument, noting that the Fund had already provided \"both the amounts that the Fund has calculated it is due ... and a detailed explanation of how those amounts were calculated.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122028\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/191/13/#p19\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122028\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/191/13/#p19\">\n    at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [T]he spreadsheets are based on defendant's remittance reports and thus include only \"covered\" hours. Moreover, the remittance reports were produced by Harborview, so defendant has possession of any evidence that might contradict plaintiffs' evidence and, thus, has the ability to offer its own analysis. Under\n   such circumstances, defendant cannot avoid summary judgment simply by speculating that plaintiffs may have erroneously included ineligible hours without offering any evidentiary support for that contention.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122028\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/191/13/#p19\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 19 (citing\n   <em>\n    Bristol Manor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289653\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/153/363/#p375\">\n    153 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   375 ). I adopt the same logic here. Arnold Walter cannot avoid summary judgment by speculating-without evidence-that the Fund may have made a miscalculation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Fund's Requested Attorney's Fees Are Reasonable\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Arnold Walter's challenge to the amount of attorney's fees also fails. When a judgment is awarded to enforce ERISA Section 515,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201145\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , an award of \"reasonable attorney's fees and costs of the action, to be paid by the defendant\" is mandatory.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(2). The Fund's attorneys seek reimbursement for \"39.15 hours of work\" for initial case research, filing the complaint, and filing the motion for summary judgment. Reply 13; Lin Decl. \u00b6 4. For reviewing the opposition and filing a reply, the firm seeks reimbursement for 21.6 hours. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Role Models Am., Inc. v. Brownlee\n   </em>\n   , which also involved the statutory authority to award \"reasonable attorney fees,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3720307,9297980\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/353/962/\">\n    353 F.3d 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 968 (D C. Cir. 2004), Arnold Walter argues that much of the time billed is \"duplicative\" and \"excessive,\" since more time was spent drafting the complaint than the brief supporting summary judgment, \"the summary judgment submissions in this matter are virtually identical in all substantive respects to ... [other motions] Plaintiffs [have] filed,\" and the Fund billed \"4.0 hours to 'corporate research' in connection with determining Defendant's name.\" Opp. 5-6. But\n   <em>\n    Role Models\n   </em>\n   involved a request for 1,085 billed hours, and the requestor \"failed to explain why this relatively straightforward case required the efforts of three senior attorneys, each billing at least $400 per hour.\" 353 F.3d at 972. These amounts are far more reasonable: 60.75 total hours, with an appropriate amount of time spent on each task, and rates of only $75, $195, and $220 per hour. Lin Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, Ex. A; Supp. Lin Decl. \u00b6 12, Ex. A. These rates are significantly lower than the market rate for attorneys of similar experience. Supp. Lin. Decl. \u00b6 14. I find that both the hours spent and the billable rates charged are more than reasonable under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For these reasons, I will grant the Fund's motion for summary judgment, and retain jurisdiction for enforcement. The total award will be for $41,557.53, totaling $29,830.53 in unpaid contributions, interest, and liquidated damages, plus $11,217.00 in attorney's fees, and $510.00 in costs.
