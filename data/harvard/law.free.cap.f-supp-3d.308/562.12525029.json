Cunningham challenges the decision by the sentencing court in the Western District of North Carolina that he is a career offender. He asserts that, based on this erroneous calculation, he should be released from federal custody. For the reasons that follow, the government's motion to dismiss will be allowed and petitioner's claim will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In May, 1999, a grand jury in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina charged Cunningham in a one count indictment with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base. Later that month, he pled guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In October, 2000, the Court adopted the recommendation in the pre-sentence report that Cunningham was a career offender with a total offense level of 37 and a criminal history category of VI. Although the applicable guideline range was 262 and 327 months, the Court sentenced Cunningham to the statutory maximum of 240 months of incarceration. Cunningham did not appeal the conviction or the sentence. On the day of his sentencing, he absconded and became a \"fugitive from justice\" until he was recaptured and began serving his sentence in January, 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In March, 2010, Cunningham filed a \u00a7 2241 petition in the Eastern District of North Carolina. In that petition, he claimed that 1) the Western District of North Carolina had lacked jurisdiction to sentence him, 2) the sentence imposed is unconstitutional and 3) the government breached the plea agreement. In May, 2011, the Court allowed Cunningham's voluntary motion to withdraw his petition after advising him that the \u00a7 2241 petition would be converted to a \u00a7 2255 petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In September, 2011, Cunningham filed a \u00a7 2255 motion in the Western District of North Carolina alleging that 1) he is innocent of the crimes of conviction, 2) he did not enter his plea of guilty knowingly and voluntarily and 3) he is not properly considered a career offender under the guidelines. The Court dismissed that motion as time-barred. In March, 2012, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of his petition in an unpublished,\n   <em>\n    per\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    curiam\n   </em>\n   decision after concluding that his motion did not demonstrate a \"debatable claim of the denial of a constitutional right\".\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cunningham\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-7597, slip op. (4th Cir. Mar. 20, 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In August, 2013, Cunningham filed a \u00a7 2241 petition in the Western District of North Carolina, which was summarily dismissed three months later. The Court reasoned that the motion was improperly filed under \u00a7 2241 because Cunningham could not meet the requirements of the savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e). Consequently, the Court concluded that the petition was a \u00a7 2255 motion disguised as a \u00a7 2241 petition. The Court explained that, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(A), Cunningham was ineligible to file subsequent \u00a7 2255 petitions without obtaining approval from the Fourth Circuit. As such, his petition was dismissed. Cunningham filed a notice of appeal but subsequently withdrew that notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In June, 2017, Cunningham filed a \u00a7 2241 motion in this Court. He contends\n   that he should be released because the Western District of North Carolina wrongfully relied on a prior drug charge when designating him a career offender. The government responds that the petitioner did not sufficiently show that \u00a7 2255 was an inadequate remedy and thus he cannot invoke a claim under \u00a7 2241.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A prisoner seeking to attack his sentence collaterally must assert his claim through a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   before the sentencing court rather than pursuant to \u00a7 2241 in the district in which he is incarcerated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"577840\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/178/34/\">\n    178 F.3d 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 50 n. 10 (1st Cir. 1999)\n   <em>\n    cert.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    denied\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9693697,9693959,9693768,9693928,9693803,9693899,9693645,9693740,9693871,9693676,9693754,9693717,9693847,9693786,9693661,9693823\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/1176/\">\n    528 U.S. 1176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20S.%20Ct.%201208\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=145%20L.%20Ed.%202d%201110\">\n    145 L.Ed.2d 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11662982\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/349/\">\n    180 F.3d 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 357 n. 15 (1st Cir. 1999)\n   <em>\n    cert.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    denied\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9677606,9677447,9677574,9677289,9677545,9677639,9677678,9677519,9677425,9677266,9677396,9677332,9677364,9677492,9677306,9677244\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/1126/\">\n    528 U.S. 1126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20S.%20Ct.%20958\">\n    120 S.Ct. 958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=145%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20831\">\n    145 L.Ed.2d 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000) (motion under \u00a7 2255 is the \"exclusive remedy in the sentencing court for any errors occurring at or prior to sentencing, including construction of the sentence itself\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In certain instances where a petitioner may not seek relief under \u00a7 2255, he may do so under \u00a7 2241 and the \u00a7 2255 savings clause.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).

Further, it is well settled that a petitioner who has exhausted his \u00a7 2255 remedy cannot avail himself of the savings clause to circumvent the restrictions of \u00a7 2255 by filing a motion under \u00a7 2241 instead.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"577840\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/178/34/\">\n    178 F.3d at 50-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (permitting a petitioner to evade the restrictions of \u00a7 2255 by resorting to \u00a7 2241 would render those restrictions meaningless).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Application\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Cunningham has not set forth exceptional circumstances nor proven that there would be a complete miscarriage of justice should the \u00a7 2241 petition not be granted. Although the instant challenge varies slightly from the previous two petitions, his claim is, once again, an assertion denying the legitimacy of his sentence. Petitions that attack the validity rather than the execution of a sentence are not subject to review under \u00a7 2241.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DiRusso\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1062605\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/535/673/#p674\">\n    535 F.2d 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 674-75 (1st Cir. 1976).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In this case, \u00a7 2255 relief is unavailable to Cunningham because his prior filings for such relief (in various forms) were unsuccessful. He likely is aware that this alternative is foreclosed to him so he now seeks to challenge his sentence via a \u00a7 2241 habeas petition under the guise of the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. Cunningham was unsuccessful with his first \u00a7 2255 motion. A prisoner seeking to file a second\n   \u00a7 2255 petition must first obtain authorization from the appropriate court of appeals.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(A).
