Applying this well-settled precedent, the Court concludes that barring the FDIC's claims at this stage is premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Furthermore, whether BANA made a false statement with intent to evade its assessments is a \"contested question[ ] of fact,\" precluding dismissal at the pleadings stage.\n   <em>\n    Bregman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154906,4179374\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/873/\">\n    747 F.3d at 875-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court finds that the FDIC has alleged facts sufficient to allow the reasonable inference that BANA acted with intent to evade assessments. Specifically, the FDIC alleges that BANA should have known how to properly report its data because the same compliance group was responsible for reporting both BANA's and its parent corporation's quarterly data. Am. Compl., ECF No. 10 \u00b6\u00b6 57-60. According to the FDIC, the parent company reported its data to a different regulating entity correctly, but BANA \"decided not to\" report its data to the FDIC the same way.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58 (emphasis added). [Redacted] Finally, the FDIC pleads that BANA \"certified as true and correct\" its reporting, \"despite the fact that [it] did not [do so].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 68. All three allegations, when taken as true, reasonably lead to the inference that BANA deliberately underreported its risk data in order to evade full assessment payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Likewise, assuming BANA did make a false statement with intent to evade, BANA has not established that there is no factual dispute as to \"when the limitations period began.\"\n   <em>\n    Feld Ent., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3850920\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/873/288/#p308\">\n    873 F.Supp.2d at 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To illustrate, the parties dispute the date that the FDIC discovered any alleged false statement. The FDIC argues that it did not discover BANA's underpayments until 2016, while BANA argues that the FDIC was aware of its reporting methodology as early as 2012.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot., ECF No. 13 at 21-22 n.3, with Am.

Count II: Unjust Enrichment Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   BANA argues that the Court should also dismiss the FDIC's unjust enrichment claim for the same time period-the first quarter of 2012 through the first quarter of 2013-because it is also time-barred under a three-year limitations period pursuant to District of Columbia (\"D.C.\") law. Def.'s Mot, ECF No. 13 at 22-24; Def.'s Reply, ECF No. 25 at 30-31. Alternatively, BANA argues that the FDIA's three-year statute of limitations also applies to the unjust enrichment claim because Section 1817(g)(2)\"governs all 'actions\n   <em>\n    relating to\n   </em>\n   assessments.' \" Def.'s Mot., ECF No. 13 at 22 (quoting with emphasis\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201817\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(2) ). In response, the FDIC argues that (1) its unjust enrichment claim is timely under the FDIA because the previously discussed exception applies; and (2) its claim is timely under D.C. law because the statute of limitations does not begin to run until a defendant wrongfully refuses to pay, and BANA did not refuse to pay its assessments until March 2017. Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 21 at 51. Finally, the FDIC argues that federal law, which provides for a six-year statute of limitations, applies to its unjust enrichment claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201817\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 50-51 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202415\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court need not decide, at this stage of the proceedings, which statute of limitations applies because BANA has not established that the FDIC's claims would be conclusively time-barred under any of these limitations periods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   If the Court were to accept BANA's argument that it should apply the FDIA's three-year statute of limitations, the previously discussed factual dispute arises.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Sec. IV(C)(i). Therefore, the Court cannot dismiss the relevant alleged underpayments as time-barred because it is plausible that BANA made a false statement with the intent to evade assessment payments, tolling the statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201217\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(2)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Likewise, were the Court to accept BANA's argument that the three-year statute of limitations pursuant to D.C. law governs, another factual dispute arises. Def.'s Reply, ECF No. 28 at 30-31. Under D.C. law, the three-year statute of limitations for unjust enrichment claims begins to run \"only when the enrichment actually becomes unlawful, i.e., where there has been a wrongful act giving rise to a duty of restitution.\"\n   <em>\n    Bregman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154906,4179374\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/873/\">\n    747 F.3d at 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    News World Commc'ns v.
