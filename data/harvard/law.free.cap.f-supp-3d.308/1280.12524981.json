Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The following are the facts relevant to the pending motions to dismiss. In its first amended complaint [128], the Federal Trade Commission alleges violations of various statutes over which it has enforcement jurisdiction. The FTC has organized the parties into three groups:\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

In addition are individual Defendants Patricia Robinson, as Executor for the estate of Jerry L. Robinson, Earl G. Robinson, Mark Ward,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and James McCarter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    3. iStream Parties\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   -iStream Financial Services, Inc., along with Kris Axberg and Richard Joachim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The long-story-short version of the FTC's 625-paragraph first amended complaint is as follows. The FTC alleges that as far back as 2010, the EDP Parties targeted subprime customers for enrollment in their discount-club offerings. They obtained customer data, including financial information, through loan applications and other lead-generation apparatus. They would then use this information, purporting to sign consumers up for discount clubs, to debit consumers' accounts without their authorization. These unauthorized, recurring debits were made through electronic checking mechanisms, and resulted in numerous returned checks due to bank concerns about the legitimacy of the transactions' authorizations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After being sued previously by the FTC and private plaintiffs for unfair and deceptive practices, the EDP Parties wound down their businesses and sold assets to the Hornbeam Entities in 2013. The FTC alleges that the Hornbeam Entities continued the unfair and deceptive scheme after the asset purchase. The alleged role of the iStream Parties in the scheme stems from their role as the financial-transaction processor-namely, the unauthorized debits from consumer accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court does not delve into further detail here, though where helpful the facts as alleged in the first amended complaint are interwoven throughout the Court's analysis of the motions. Based on the alleged unauthorized debit scheme, the FTC alleges that Defendants have violated Section\n   5(a) of the FTC Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act (\"ROSCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%208401\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 8401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The parties have made a number of motions to dismiss all or part of the FTC's first amended complaint [128].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In this Order, the Court addresses a number of motions and arguments related to certain Defendants' attempts to dismiss this case pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). The Court groups the analysis by argument and Defendant, and rules as follows.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Rule 9(b) Does Not Apply\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The EDP Parties contend that because the FTC's claims \"sound in fraud,\" [134-1] at 1, the heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b) applies. There is a split of authority over whether a claim under \u00a7 45(a) requires Rule 9(b)'s heightened\n   pleading standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FTC v. HES Merch.

Feb. 20, 2014) (noting split between the Tenth Circuit and a district court in California's Central District). This Court joins those courts holding that Rule 9(b) does not apply to FTC actions under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court begins with the rule itself, which provides that when a party is \"alleging fraud or mistake, [it] must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 9(b). The EDP Parties do not argue that the FTC is alleging fraud outright; they argue only that the FTC's claims sound in fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   This argument rests on the proposition that if a claim is near enough to fraud, or fraud-like, Rule 9(b) applies. They cite no controlling authority for this proposition. Nor was the Court made aware of a controlling standard by which to determine whether a claim sounds in fraud, and therefore triggers Rule 9(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In any event, a claim under the FTC Act is not like fraud, even though it may involve some level of deceit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the Tenth Circuit noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   A \u00a7 5 claim simply is not a claim of fraud as that term is commonly understood or as contemplated by Rule 9(b), and ... treat[ing] it as such unduly hinder[s] the FTC's ability to present its case. Unlike the elements of common law fraud, the FTC need not prove scienter, reliance, or injury to establish a \u00a7 5 violation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    FTC v.

Similarly, when compared to the elements of fraud under Georgia law, fraud requires proof of scienter, reliance, and injury, but these are not required for a violation of the FTC Act.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Engelman v.

The general rule in this circuit in multi-defendant pleadings, which has not been officially abrogated or overturned, is that \"[w]hen multiple defendants are named in a complaint, the allegations can be and usually are to be read in such a way that each defendant is having the allegation made about him individually.\"\n   <em>\n    Crowe v.

Ward argues that this is no longer good law because this case was decided prior to the pleading standard announced in\n   <em>\n    Iqbal.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court is unwilling to draw this conclusion absent clear guidance from the Eleventh Circuit regarding its as-of-now good case law. The Eleventh Circuit has applied\n   <em>\n    Crowe\n   </em>\n   in the post-\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   era, indicating at least a tacit support for its viability.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crespo v.

Accordingly, as a general rule, each allegation in the first amended complaint is to be considered as if it is made against each Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Even so, in this case, the FTC's first amended complaint has well-satisfied the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Iqbal.\n   </em>\n   As an initial matter, Ward does not appear to challenge that the FTC has plausibly alleged its counts as to the Hornbeam Entities. Rather, he focuses only on the FTC's allegations as they relate to him, specifically, whether the FTC has plausibly alleged his individual liability for the Hornbeam Entities' putative malfeasance. After reviewing the arguments and briefs, the Court concludes that the FTC has plausibly alleged Ward's liability in the first amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   After establishing (or, as here, assuming) that the FTC has demonstrated a violation by the corporate entity, to show individual liability the FTC must prove (1) that \"the individual defendant[ ] participated directly in the practices or acts or had authority to control them\" and (2) that \"the individual had some knowledge of the practices.\"\n   <em>\n    FTC v.

The first amended complaint is replete with examples of Ward's investment and involvement in the day-to-day activities of the Hornbeam Entities, which includes the allegedly unlawful scheme related to the discount clubs. His knowledge is alleged based on the \"daily, weekly, and monthly reports on all aspects of the business,\" [128] \u00b6 200, and regular communication at all levels of Hornbeam's operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   At this stage, the first amended complaint is more than sufficient to make it plausible that Ward was culpably involved in the Hornbeam Entities' allegedly unlawful scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Complaint States a Claim Against Earl Robinson\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Like Ward, Earl does not dispute that the first amended complaint plausibly states a claim against the Hornbeam Entities. He too argues that the FTC has failed to demonstrate his individual responsibility for those violations. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The standard is the same as that discussed above with respect to Ward. Earl had authority at the Hornbeam Entities; he is alleged to have been an owner of the Hornbeam parent company, Hornbeam Special Situations. Earl is also alleged to have served on the management committee, which included day-to-day operations, as well as serving as the chief revenue officer. In these capacities, Earl was involved and received reports regarding all aspects of the business, had authority on a policymaking level, and was aware of the importance of subprime consumers' recurring monthly charges to the Hornbeam Entities' revenue stream. He was also aware of the past history of lawsuits related to unauthorized charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This is only a sampling of Earl's involvement in the Hornbeam Entities' allegedly unlawful enterprise, and makes it plausible that Earl could be held individually liable for the Hornbeam Entities' wrongdoing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Once again, the Court applies the same standard as above and finds that the FTC has adequately pleaded its claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The first amended complaint alleges that Jerry was an owner of the Hornbeam Special Situations parent company, and possessed the largest ownership share of the Hornbeam Entities. He was on and served as the chairman for the management committee, which exercised control over the company and day-to-day operations; he also served as the chief strategy officer and had financial authority. These positions make it plausible that he had policymaking authority. He received reports and information about operations and was aware of the importance and role of subprime consumers to revenues. Moreover, he was specifically made aware of the risk of high returns of electronic checks\n   when Hornbeam bought the business. These are just a handful of the myriad allegations contained in the FTC's first amended complaint, which thoroughly sets forth the facts making it plausible that Jerry is liable for the corporate violations of the Hornbeam Entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Complaint States a Claim Against the EDP Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The EDP Parties make a brief footnote argument that the FTC has not satisfied Rule 8's pleading standards,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   [134-1] at 13 n.3, but do not elaborate further. This is insufficient argumentation for the Court to engage this issue. Moreover, the Court is satisfied that the FTC has adequately alleged the unlawful scheme as set forth in its response in opposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [152] at 9-10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4190603\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/645/1167/#p1207\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 10 n.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Res Judicata\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Various parties have argued that all or part of the FTC's claims are barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The Eleventh Circuit has summed up the analysis for when res judicata applies so as to preclude a party from bringing a claim as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Res judicata or claim preclusion refers to the preclusive effect of a judgment in foreclosing religitation of matters that were litigated or could have been litigated in an earlier suit. In order for the doctrine of res judicata to bar a subsequent suit, four elements must be present: (1) there must be a final judgment on the merits, (2) the decision must be rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, (3) the parties, or those in privity with them, must be identical in both suits[,] and (4) the same cause of action must be involved in both cases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    I.A.

Using this standard, the parties' arguments are addressed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Res Judicata Based on a Prior Suit Between the FTC and the EDP Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The EDP Parties argue that res judicata bars this action. Addressing this argument requires some brief background. In 2007, the FTC brought an enforcement action against, inter alia, EDebitPay, LLC, Wilson, and Cleveland in the Central District of California for violations of the FTC Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FTC v. EDebitPay, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:07-cv-04880 (C.D. Cal. filed July 30, 2007). The complaint at that time was based on the manner in which the EDP Parties marketed prepaid debit cards, which included unauthorized debiting of consumer accounts, nondisclosure of material facts, and misrepresentations regarding fees owed. The Central District of California entered a stipulated final injunction from the 2007 action, and in 2010 entertained contempt proceedings against the defendants, which resulted in a 2011 contempt order against them for violation of the 2007 order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The misconduct at issue in the 2007 case is very similar to that alleged here, except now the FTC complains about different EDebitPay products and, more importantly, violations during a time period\n   <em>\n    subsequent\n   </em>\n   to the conclusion of the prior actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The parties do not disagree that the first three elements of res judicata are met here. Rather, the dispute is as to whether this case and the 2007 case (and 2010 contempt action) are the same cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   In the Eleventh Circuit, \"[t]he principal test for determining whether the causes of action are the same is whether the primary right and duty are the same in each case. In determining whether the causes of action are the same, a court must compare the substance of the actions, not their form.\" \"It is now said, in\n   general, that if a case arises out of the same nucleus of operative fact, or is based upon the same factual predicate, as a former action, that the two cases are really the same 'claim' or 'cause of action' for purposes of res judicata.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    Ragsdale v. Rubbermaid, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11567203\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/193/1235/#p1239\">\n    193 F.3d 1235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1239 (11th Cir. 1999) (citation omitted) (alteration in original) (first quoting\n   <em>\n    Citibank, N.A. v.

As the Eleventh Circuit has put it:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   [W]e do not believe that the res judicata preclusion of claims that \"could have been brought\" in earlier litigation includes claims which arise after the original pleading is filed in the earlier litigation. Instead, we believe that, for res judicata purposes, claims that \"could have been brought\" are claims in existence at the time the original complaint is filed or claims\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   asserted by supplemental pleadings or otherwise in the earlier action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    Manning v.

Thus, there are two categories of claims that are precluded by res judicata based on previous litigation: those claims that\n   <em>\n    could have been brought\n   </em>\n   in the original pleading of the original litigation and claims that\n   <em>\n    were actually brought\n   </em>\n   in supplemental or later proceedings in the same action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Here, the FTC has conceded that it is not seeking relief based on any violations that occurred during the 2007 case or the 2010 contempt action. Nor is it seeking relief for any of the claims it actually brought in the 2010 contempt proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [152] at 11 (\"The current complaint alleges violations that occurred afterwards from July 2010 to June 2016.\"); [128] \u00b6 594 (\"In numerous instances from July 2010 through September 2013, the EDP Defendants ....\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 597 (same). Because the claims presently before the Court accrued\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the 2007 action, or were not asserted during the 2010 contempt proceedings, res judicata does not bar their litigation here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Res Judicata Based on a Prior Class Action Between the EDP Parties and Private Litigants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Court again begins this section with some brief background. In 2011, the EDP Parties were subject to two class actions that were later consolidated in the Central District of California,\n   <em>\n    White v. EDebitPay, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:11-cv-6738,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%209198903\">\n    2011 WL 9198903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.D. Cal. filed Aug. 16, 2011), and\n   <em>\n    Deffenbaugh v. EDebitPay, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 4:11-cv-3024,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%202447429\">\n    2011 WL 2447429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Cal. filed June 20, 2011). For convenience and consistent with the parties' submissions, these are together referred to as the \"\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   actions\" or \"\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   \" These class actions were based on alleged debiting of consumer accounts without authorization. It eventually resulted in a settlement and release by all class members. The FTC, though not a party, objected to the settlement on the grounds that the compensation exchanged for the release was not fair to the class members. The district court overruled the objection and approved the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The EDP Parties now contend that the instant action by the FTC is at least partially precluded by the classwide settlement. They limit this argument to the\n   monetary relief sought by the FTC as it relates to the alleged consumer injury, which they argue was redressed in the\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   actions. The FTC responds that it is not in privity with the\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   class because it is asserting independent federal-law-enforcement interests, which the class and its representatives did not adequately represent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The EDP Parties rely on\n   <em>\n    California v. IntelliGender, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290235\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/771/1169/\">\n    771 F.3d 1169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2014), for the proposition that when the Government, through its agent the FTC, seeks relief that is wholly duplicative of the claims of a prior class-based action and the FTC is seeking monetary compensation\n   <em>\n    on behalf of\n   </em>\n   injured persons in the class, res judicata bars the Government's action. Put concretely, in a consumer fraud suit by the Government, the suit will be barred if there has been a prior class action based on the same alleged misconduct with respect to the same consumer class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Court, however, agrees with the FTC that to the extent\n   <em>\n    Intelligender\n   </em>\n   would require barring the FTC's suit here, it conflicts with controlling precedent in this circuit.\n   <em>\n    Herman v. South Carolina National Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1318598\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/140/1413/\">\n    140 F.3d 1413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 1998), concluded that a lawsuit brought by the Secretary of Labor was not barred by res judicata, notwithstanding a prior ERISA class action based on the same alleged misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Court applies\n   <em>\n    Herman\n   </em>\n   here to determine whether the present lawsuit concerns the same parties or their privies as those in\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   \"[A] nonparty to a prior decision cannot be bound by it unless he had sufficient identity of interest with a party that his interests are deemed to have been litigated.\"\n   <em>\n    Herman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1318598\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/140/1413/\">\n    140 F.3d at 1424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Birmingham Reverse Discrimination Emp't Lit.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10552012\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/833/1492/#p1498\">\n    833 F.2d 1492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1498 (11th Cir. 1987) ). The Court finds that the FTC's action here is analogous to the Secretary's ERISA enforcement in\n   <em>\n    Herman\n   </em>\n   , and that res judicata \"does not apply here because the [FTC] was not a party to the [\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ] settlement and has national public interests separate and distinct from those of the [\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ] private litigants.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10552012\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/833/1492/#p1498\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Like the Secretary's action in\n   <em>\n    Herman\n   </em>\n   , the FTC is bringing an action that, while based on the same or similar misconduct by the Defendants, seeks to enforce its own independent interests in the FTC Act's enforcement. Moreover, as the FTC argues, the\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs did not adequately represent, nor were they charged with representing, the broader national interests in law enforcement and fair dealing in the marketplace, which have been entrusted by Congress to the FTC. The\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs had their own, private interests when they released the EDP Parties from their claims, and these potentially ran counter to the FTC's broader interest in deterrence, full recompense, and enforcement of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   While not raised by the parties, the Court notes that\n   <em>\n    Herman\n   </em>\n   also contemplates that the statutory regime under which the Government seeks redress could affect the res judicata outcome. Here, the Court has not been made aware of anything in the statutory regime of the FTC Act (or ROSCA) that indicates that the FTC is not permitted to redress its own interests separate and apart from those litigated in\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Accordingly, the Court holds that the FTC was not in privity with the\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs and therefore res judicata does not apply to bar this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Res Judicata and Collateral Estoppel for Individual Defendant Patricia Robinson, as Executor of the Estate of Jerry Robinson\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The estate of Jerry Robinson also argues that this action is barred by res judicata, as well as collateral estoppel. Jerry was an owner of the Hornbeam Entities before he passed away. He had various roles within the companies, and the FTC alleges that by virtue of these roles he is personally liable for the misconduct alleged against the Hornbeam Entities in the first amended complaint. The estate now claims that Jerry was in privity with the EDP Defendants in the earlier FTC action against them, and therefore the current case against his estate is barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   This argument fails for a few reasons. First, as the Court has already held, even if Jerry was in privity with the EDP Parties, their res judicata claim fails. This holding would apply equally to one of their privies. As stated above, the FTC is also asserting violations predicated upon different conduct, later in time, and which the FTC did not argue in the contempt proceedings (a continuation of already-ongoing proceedings). The violations alleged herein did not exist\n   <em>\n    at the time the complaint was filed\n   </em>\n   in the original FTC action. Therefore, this action is not barred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Lastly, collateral estoppel does not apply because the issues in this case are not \"identical to the one[s] involved in the prior litigation ....\"\n   <em>\n    CSX Transp., Inc. v.

The instant claims involve a different set of products and violations related to those products at a different time. Moreover, the issues were not \"actually litigated in the prior\" contempt proceeding, which the estate admits by arguing that the issues should have been raised at that time.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1587336\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/793/1541/#p1549\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Even though this was a new argument, the Court allowed it after providing the FTC an opportunity to file a surreply. This new argument is that the FTC brings its complaint solely under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 57b, which is governed by a three-year statute of limitations. The EDP Parties argue that in order for the FTC to bring an action under its purported statutory grounds-\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2053\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) -it must show that the EDP Parties \"[are] violating, or [are] about to violate\" a provision of law under the FTC's jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2053\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 53(b)(1). The EDP Parties argue that because they are no longer carrying on with the offending conduct, and EDebitPay has sold its assets, they are not violating or about to violate anything.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   But this ignores the rest of the statute, which provides that the FTC may seek equitable relief \"[w]henever the [FTC]\n   <em>\n    has reason to believe\n   </em>\n   \" that a violation is taking or is about to take place.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2053\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) (emphasis added).

Whether the FTC has reason to believe that a violation is taking or is about to take place is committed to agency discretion, and therefore, unreviewable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   This requires the Court to defer to the agency's determination of whether it has reason to believe that the EDP Parties are violating or could be violating the FTC Act. There is no meaningful standard by which the Court can review the FTC's belief in this regard. Accordingly, the Court defers to the FTC's belief that the parties are violating or will violate the FTC Act, and this action is properly brought under \u00a7 53(b).

The iStream Defendants now seek to extend\n   <em>\n    Kokesh\n   </em>\n   to apply \u00a7 2462 to the instant disgorgement action sought by the FTC. The question turns on whether the disgorgement remedy sought by the FTC in the instant action constitutes a \"penalty\" within the meaning of \u00a7 2462.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   To answer this, the Court asks the same questions asked in\n   <em>\n    Kokesh.\n   </em>\n   First, is the disgorgement brought as a consequence of the violation of a public law? Second, is the disgorgement claim brought for punitive purposes, which also involves the corollary question, is the remedy sought punitive? The Court concludes that, as the FTC has urged, this question is not amenable to disposition at the motion to dismiss stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   First, there appears to be no dispute that the FTC's current action is brought in consequence of an alleged violation of public law(s)-the FTC Act and ROSCA. But it is the next one that causes the trouble. At this time, it is not clear to the Court what exactly the nature and purpose of the FTC's disgorgement claims are. For example, it is not clear what will happen to the disgorged funds. Will they return to injured consumers, and therefore be compensatory? Or will they be placed into the U.S. Treasury, indicating that the purposes is actually to punish?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In fact, disgorgement is not per se penal,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The iStream Defendants contend that to the extent these allegations are based on violations of the Telemarketing Sales Rule (\"TSR\"), the FTC is invoking\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206105\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 6105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), which is subject to a three-year statute of limitations when brought pursuant to Section 19 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 57b(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The FTC responds that it is not bringing this claim under Section 19, but rather under Section 13(b),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2053\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Therefore, it argues that \u00a7 57b's statute of limitations does not apply. The FTC's position is that the alleged violation of the TSR forms the basis of one of its unfair or deceptive practice allegations under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Given these positions, the parties appear to be speaking past one another. iStream says the FTC is doing \"X,\" which is wrong; the FTC responds, no, we are doing \"Y,\" which is right, but does not explain to the Court what would happen if it\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   doing \"X.\" Moreover, it is at least colorable that the FTC is doing \"X\"; that is, it is bringing a claim under \u00a7 57b and the TSR. While the FTC's brief in opposition is clear that it is seeking the equitable relief under \u00a7 53(b), the complaint is not so clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Given this ambiguity, the Court construes Count VII of the complaint as being brought pursuant to \u00a7 53(b), which is not subject to the statute of limitations in \u00a7 57b. It appears to the Court that the FTC intended to bring an equitable claim against the iStream Defendants pursuant to \u00a7 53(b) by, in Count VII, alleging that the iStream Defendants were involved in a deceptive act or practice, the contours of which are defined by the TSR.
