For the reasons that follow, plaintiff's motion to alter the judgment will be allowed and her motion for hearing will be denied as moot. Summary judgment will be entered in favor of plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Carol Lewis has had Type 1 diabetes for over 30 years. Consequently, she suffers from hypoglycemia and hyperglycemic unawareness, which means that she cannot determine whether she is experiencing a glucose \"high\" or \"low\". To combat the malady, Lewis's doctor prescribed her a continuous glucose monitor (\"CGM\"). That device, which is implanted under a patient's skin, computes blood glucose level and transmits that information to a receiver which, in turn, alerts the user of her glucose level. CGM devices also provide information as to the trends of a user's glucose level, allowing a patient and physician to devise a long-term glucose management plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In March, 2013, Lewis submitted five claims to the National Health Insurance Corporation (\"NHIC\") for a total of $2,842 for her use of a Medtronic brand CGM device in June 2011 and March, June, September and November 2012. Those claims were denied and plaintiff filed an appeal of the denials with the Medicare Appeals Council (\"the Council\") on March 24, 2014. The Council also denied her claims. It held that the subject equipment did not \"serve a medical purpose\" as required by agency regulation,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20414.202\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 414.202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that the CGM was merely precautionary. Accordingly, it found, the CGM was not covered under the Durable Medical Equipment (\"DME\") Medicare benefit. Plaintiff petitioned this Court for judicial review in October, 2015. In her complaint, plaintiff states that she\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-13\">\n   seeks an order reversing these coverage denials and instructing the Secretary to pay the claims at issue. In January, 2017, plaintiff filed a motion for summary\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   judgment, arguing that the Secretary's decision that the CGM device was not covered by Medicare was arbitrary and capricious and not supported by substantial evidence. In due course, defendant filed a motion to affirm the secretary's decision and a reply to plaintiff's opposition thereto. In defendant's reply, the government for the first time argued that plaintiff's claim was moot because plaintiff had switched from using her Medtronic brand CGM device (which was not covered) to a Dexcom brand CGM device (which was covered).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In August, 2017, this Court treated that reply as \"defendant's motion to dismiss plaintiff's claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction\" and allowed the motion, holding that the plaintiff's claims were moot. The Court stated\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Because plaintiff is not using the subject CGM equipment, she lacks a legal interest in the outcome of the case and, therefore, her claims will be dismissed as moot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Motion to alter the judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A motion for reconsideration is an \"extraordinary remedy\" granted only when the movant demonstrates that the court committed a \"manifest error of law\" or that newly discovered evidence not previously available has come to light.\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Champion Mortg.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3263926\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/465/24/#p30\">\n    465 F.3d 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 30 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2810.1 (2d ed. 1995) ).

The plaintiff seeks reimbursement for funds she spent on her Medtronic CGM device in 2011 and 2012. She states that the Secretary erred in his designation of the claims from 2011 and 2012 because the Medtronic CGM device should have been deemed a covered device. Whether or not Lewis continued using the device after those dates is irrelevant to whether she is entitled to reimbursement for those claims under the Medicare Act.

The Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and multiple professional medical societies such as the American Diabetes Association and the American Medical Association deem CGM primarily and customarily to serve a medical purpose as a medical device. The Secretary makes no mention of the opinions of those societies in his decision.\n    <em>\n     But see\n    </em>\n    Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chap. 15, \u00a7 110.1(B)(1) (providing that the determination of whether a specific item of equipment is medical in nature is to include the advice of medical societies and specialists in the field). His decision is not supported by substantial evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    \"Precautionary\" is defined in neither the Act nor its regulations. The only example provided for precautionary-type equipment is a preset portable oxygen unit.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20414.202\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at \u00a7 110.1(B)(2). A CGM, in contrast to a \"back-up\" oxygen tank, is used as a primary monitoring device. It is the primary method of glucose monitoring for persons with hypoglycemic unawareness. Although the Council maintained that a CGM serves\n    a duplicative function to a fingerstick, it failed to recognize that CGM devices also provide trend information and overnight monitoring that fingersticks cannot provide.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    The fact that fingersticks may be used to confirm the results of a CGM does not deprive a CGM of its \"primarily medical\" character. First, Medicare frequently covers confirmatory testing. Second, the FDA recognizes that a CGM may be a diabetic's sole means of monitoring glucose levels. The Secretary's assertion that a device loses its medical nature if it is used in conjunction with another medical device is contrary to law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Finigan\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Burwell\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12124878\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/189/201/\">\n     189 F.Supp.3d 201\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 207 n. 6 (D.
