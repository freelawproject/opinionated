Rodriguez sued the restaurant and its executive chef under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the District of Columbia Minimum Wage Act, and the District of Columbia Wage Payment and Wage Collection Law. Dkt. 1. Before the Court is the defendants' motion for summary judgment. Dkt. 27. For the reasons that follow, the motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Fair Labor Standards Act requires employers to pay overtime compensation (at least 150 percent of the rate of regular compensation) to a covered employee working more than forty hours in a week.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

During discovery, Rodriguez and his former superiors gave very different accounts of his role with the company, both sides serving their own narrative. The restaurant's witnesses recalled Rodriguez regularly exercising managerial power, while Rodriguez described his work as manual-labor intensive and without administrative input or leadership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The restaurant initially hired Rodriguez as a part-time \"line cook\" in June 2015, paying him $14 an hour to prepare ingredients and cook food. Rivas Dep. at 72:12-15, Dkt. 27-3. An immigrant from Mexico with only a high school education, Rodriguez had nineteen years of culinary experience but no formal culinary education.

In September 2015, the restaurant promoted him to sous chef with a $55,000 annual salary and classified him as exempt from the overtime requirement. Adams Restaurant Answers to Pl.'s First Set of Interrogs., Answer to Interrog. No. 9, at 10-11, Dkt. 27-4. According to Rodriguez, his hours per week jumped from about forty to about seventy.

Rodriguez testified that he and Benitez both worked full days during their overlapping time as sous chefs, with Benitez supervising him. Rodriguez Dep. at 49:1-5, 52:7-19, Dkt. 28-1. The restaurant, on the other hand, claims that one of the sous chefs was responsible for the day shift while the other was responsible for the night shift. Adams Dep. at 160:18-161:7, Dkt. 27-6. In any event, Benitez left the restaurant after a month or two and Rodriguez became the only sous chef.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rodriguez Dep. at 49:15-17, Dkt. 28-1, Ex.

According to Rodriguez, however, she monitored employees daily through surveillance video, regularly informed them that she was watching them, and often provided corrective instruction and reprimands. Rodriguez Dep. at 118:11-119:15, Dkt. 28-1; Rodriguez Decl. \u00b6 6, Dkt. 28-1, Ex. C. Rodriguez also claimed that Rivas \"fired a lot of people\" in the kitchen while Rodriguez was sous chef (and that he did not fire anyone himself). Rodriguez Dep. at 50:2-10, 59:3-5, Dkt. 28-1. Rodriguez testified that he was supervised by both Rivas and a restaurant manager (and Benitez at first), though Rivas disputed that. Rodriguez Decl. \u00b6 5; Rivas Dep. at 372:6-7 (\"[Rodriguez] didn't have someone supervising him, he was a supervisor.\"). Rivas testified that Rodriguez supervised line cooks, but Rodriguez recounted that he offered the line cooks very little instruction beyond some informal training during three line cooks' first day on the job. Rivas Dep. at 174:14-17; Dkt. 27-3; Rodriguez Dep. at 86:16-20, 88:2-17, 89:8-16, 90:21-91:9, Dkt. 28-1. Rodriguez conducted approximately three interviews of prospective hires, but he says that his questions were limited to \"Where have you worked?\" and \"What do you know how to do?,\" and he simply relayed the answers to the restaurant manager, who made the hiring decision without his input.

No. 2, at 4 (\"[Rodriguez] possessed the independent authority to hire and fire other employees.\"). According to the restaurant, Rodriguez's primary duty was managing the restaurant's kitchen operations and staff, but according to Rodriguez, his daily schedule generally consisted of preparing food and cooking.
