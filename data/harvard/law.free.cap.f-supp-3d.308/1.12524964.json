In addition, a search of plaintiff's name and alias in the State Archiving System, which houses records \"commonly referred to as the 'Central Foreign Policy Files' or 'Central File' \" and is capable of querying \"over 40 million records through a single interface,\" yielded an additional seven responsive documents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff's second assertion is beyond the scope of FOIA.
