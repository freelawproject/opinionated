The plaintiff is the executor of his father's estate, and he has brought this suit in his capacity as the executor and as an individual. On behalf of the estate, the plaintiff seeks damages on claims that the defendant negligently, recklessly, and wrongfully caused his father's death, breached the contract regarding his care, and engaged in dependent adult abuse. In his individual claim, the plaintiff seeks damages for loss of parental consortium. The question now before me is whether to stay all proceedings pending arbitration of the estate's claims or to deny a stay as to the plaintiff's individual claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. INTRODUCTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This case is before me on Chief United States Magistrate Judge C.J. Williams's March 12, 2018, Report And Recommendation Regarding Defendant's Motion To Compel Arbitration And Stay Proceedings. In his Report And Recommendation, Judge Williams recommends that I grant in part and deny in part defendant's February 12, 2018, Motion To Compel Arbitration And Stay Proceedings. Specifically, Judge Williams recommends that I compel plaintiff Eric Anderson to arbitrate his father's estate's claims, but not his individual claim for loss of parental consortium, and that I stay all proceedings pending arbitration of the estate's claims. On March 26, 2018, Anderson filed his Objection To The Magistrate's Report And Recommendation, in which he objected only to the stay of his loss of parental consortium claim pending arbitration of the estate's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the part of his Report And Recommendation considering whether the court should stay all proceedings, Judge Williams stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Section three of the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\") empowers federal courts to stay proceedings of issues referable to arbitration.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If a court determines that a claim falls within the scope of a valid arbitration agreement, under sections three and four of the FAA, the court may stay proceedings and compel the parties to submit their dispute to arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Lyster v. Ryan's Family Steak Houses, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076712\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/239/943/#p945\">\n    239 F.3d 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 945 (8th Cir. 2001). Here, there is no indication that plaintiff will be prejudiced by staying proceedings pending arbitration of the estate's claims. Plaintiff only refers obliquely and vaguely to \"logistical issues\" that would arise. (Doc. 5, at 4). This case is very young, the parties have conducted little, if any, discovery, and they have not litigated any substantial issues in federal court. I find that it is in the interest of the parties and judicial efficiency to stay all proceedings pending the outcome of arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hoffman v. Cargill, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"494732\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/968/465/#p477\">\n    968 F.Supp. 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 477 (N.D. Iowa 1997) (staying all claims pending arbitration of some of the claims).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Report And Recommendation, 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Anderson objects to this part of the Report And Recommendation, because he contends that his individual claim is entirely separate from the estate's claims and\n   that none of the pertinent factors warrant a stay depriving him of his constitutional right to a prompt jury trial on his claim. He argues that there is no evidence that any finding of the arbiters on the estate's claims would have any binding effect on his loss of parental consortium claim, so that there is no savings of judicial resources from staying his claim. He also argues that the risk of inconsistent rulings does not warrant a stay, while the denial of justice resulting from a delay of a jury trial on his claim, which is his constitutional right, outweighs any reason for a stay. He distinguishes\n   <em>\n    Hoffman\n   </em>\n   , on which Judge Williams relied, on the ground that, while\n   <em>\n    Hoffman\n   </em>\n   involved arbitrable and non-arbitrable claims by the same plaintiff, here, he is an entirely separate party from the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

In other words, the specific standard of review depends, in the first instance, upon whether or not a party has objected to portions of the report and recommendation. In most cases, to trigger\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, \"objections must be timely and specific.\"\n   <em>\n    Thompson v.

Here, even where there are common questions of fact between the estate's claims and Anderson's loss of parental consortium claim, this is not a case in which either the defendant or the estate obtained any commitment from Anderson to arbitrate any related claims he might have or to abide by the arbiters' findings on factual issues. I do not believe that the risk of inconsistent factual or even legal rulings between the arbiters and the court, where the arbiters will address the estate's claims against the defendant, and the court will address Anderson's claims against the defendant, weighs in favor of a stay that\n   would delay the exercise of Anderson's constitutional right to a jury determination of his claims.

I am sympathetic to Judge Williams's reasonable conclusion that this factor weighs in favor of a stay, because this case is very young, the parties have conducted little, if any, discovery, and they have not litigated any substantial issues in federal court. Even so, on\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, I reach a different conclusion, one that I find more reasonable and that appropriately honors the purpose behind the Seventh Amendment's right to a civil jury trial. I find that Anderson\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   be prejudiced by a delay in his ability to pursue discovery of his claim under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and, even more so, by a delay in the presentation of his claim to a jury, as is his constitutional right, where the arbitration has no binding effect on his claim. As the Supreme Court and the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals have emphasized, \" 'we rigorously enforce agreements to arbitrate, even if the result is \"piecemeal\" litigation.' \"\n   <em>\n    AgGrow Oils\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11126979\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/242/777/#p783\">\n    242 F.3d at 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v.

Similarly, although the policy favoring arbitration may support the defendant's desire to have overlapping matters resolved in arbitration in the first instance, it does not translate into a policy favoring a stay of all claims in this case, because it cannot trump Anderson's right to a prompt jury determination of his claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The United States Constitution provides, in the Seventh Amendment, that \"[i]n suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved.\" U.S. CONST. amend.

More than eighty years ago, the Supreme Court cautioned, \"Maintenance of the jury as a fact-finding body [in civil cases] is of such importance and occupies so firm a place in our history and jurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the right to a jury trial should be scrutinized with the utmost care.\"\n   <em>\n    Dimick v.

The virtues of a jury trial, in civil and criminal cases, include injection of community values into legal proceedings, protection of citizens against the potential bias and power of appointed judges (and I might add,\n   other selected adjudicators, such as arbiters), and lending respect and legitimacy to the rule of law.
