YOUNG, DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Here, counsel for the Defendants has maintained a gallant rear guard action seeking to avoid foreclosure of his clients' interests in certain real property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Having played out the game, his final move is to claim that the citizenship of the LSF9 Trust itself is, or may be, Massachusetts. If so, he maintains, diversity of citizenship is lacking,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to proceed further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The issue here is thus whether, for purposes of establishing diversity jurisdiction, the citizenship of a business trust is determined by looking to the citizenship of its trustees or that of its beneficiaries or members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In a traditional trust, the relevant citizenship is that of the trust's trustee(s). In a business trust, citizenship depends on two conditions:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   First, whether the trustee is a corporation or is an unincorporated entity. A corporation ought be considered a citizen of the state where it is incorporated or has its principal place of business.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). If the entity is not incorporated, then \"diversity jurisdiction in a suit by or against the entity depends on the citizenship of 'all the members.' \"\n   <em>\n    Carden\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Arkoma Associates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5551\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/185/#p195\">\n    494 U.S. 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 195,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5551\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/185/#p195\">\n    110 S.Ct. 1015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5551\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/185/#p195\">\n    108 L.Ed.2d 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Chapman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Barney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8299620\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/129/677/#p682\">\n    129 U.S. 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 682,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8299620\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/129/677/#p682\">\n    9 S.Ct. 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8299441,8299620\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed/32/800/\">\n    32 L.Ed. 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1889) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Here, the Plaintiff, U.S. Bank Trust, N.A., is incorporated with its principal place of business in Delaware.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Second, it is helpful to determine whether it is the trustee that is the party to the litigation or whether it is the trust itself.
