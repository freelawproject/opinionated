Mr. Starr's investigation of the former President had begun four years earlier in 1994, when a Special Division of the D.C.

DOC. NO. 105-310 (1998), Vol. I at 8. The OIC suspected that the former President may have lied under oath, in his written responses, about his sexual relations\n   and sought to investigate whether the former President or his agents had pressured witnesses in the civil case to \"lie in order to benefit the President.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3, 7-8. A Special Division of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (\"Special Division\") approved this request and expanded the OIC's authority to investigate \"whether Monica Lewinsky or others suborned perjury, obstructed justice, intimidated witnesses, or otherwise violated federal law,\"\n   <em>\n    In re Madison Guar.

In that Report, Starr highlighted three acts of former President Clinton uncovered in the investigation into the former President's relationship with a former White House intern that \"may constitute grounds for an impeachment\": (1) \"lying under oath,\" (2) \"obstructi[ng] justice,\" and (3) making \"false statements to the American people about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky\" and \"attempt[ing] to conceal the truth about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky from the judicial process\" in the sexual harassment case.

These docket numbers were previously under seal, and therefore even the unsealed documents in these dockets were not publicly available. As an initial matter, upon receiving CNN's request, the Court directed the Clerk's Office to unseal the docket numbers and captions associated with the seven sealed matters initially identified by CNN and to \"make publicly available promptly\" on the Court's Case Management/Electronic Case Filing (CM/ECF) system and Public Access to Court Electronic Records (\"PACER\") systems these seven Miscellaneous matter numbers, \"as well as the documents from those matters that have been revealed in full in the Starr Report.\" Order, dated Feb. 12, 2018 (\"Feb. 12, 2018 Order\") at 3, ECF No. 3. At the Court's request, the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") promptly examined all eleven dockets and provided its views on whether the material in these eleven dockets may be unsealed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOJ Resp. CNN's Pet. Unseal (\"DOJ Resp.\") at 1, ECF No. 20.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Petitioner CNN submitted a request, dated February 9, 2018, to unseal certain Miscellaneous matters arising from Independent Counsel Starr's 1998 investigation into then-President Clinton.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CNN/Polantz Unsealing Request at 1. Specifically, CNN averred that \"these matters were widely covered by the media at the time,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20WL%20472444\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , and that \"basic information\" about some of these matters had been \"made public through the Independent Counsel's publication\" of his final report to the U.S. House of Representatives,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n   <em>\n    See also generally\n   </em>\n   Starr Report. In its request, CNN identified eight Miscellaneous matters, which it described as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-13\">98-mc-095 Bruce Lindsey testimony 98-mc-096 Sidney Blumenthal testimony 98-mc-097 Nancy Hernreich testimony 98-mc-148 Secret Service Testimony 98-mc-202 White House documents 98-mc-267 Presidential subpoena 98-mc-278 Lanny Breuer testimony Unknown Terry Lenzner and Investigative Group Intl., Inc. subpoena.</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   CNN/Polantz Unsealing Request at 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The first seven of these docket numbers are referenced in the Starr Report, and some, but not all, of the documents entered on the dockets for these matters appear in full or are summarized in the appendices to the Starr Report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Starr Report, Vol. II at 183-200; Feb. 12, 2018 Order at 2. This disclosure was permitted by virtue of the D.C. Circuit's authorization for the Independent Counsel to disclose to the House of Representatives \"all grand jury material that the independent counsel deems necessary to comply with the requirements of [ 28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 595(c),\" based upon the \" 'Ex Parte Motion for Approval of Disclosure of Matters Occurring Before a Grand Jury' filed by Independent Counsel [ ] Starr on July 2, 1998,\" which\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   motion remains sealed with the D.C.

Upon receiving CNN's request, the Court directed the Clerk's Office to unseal the docket numbers and captions associated with the seven identified sealed matters and to \"make publicly available promptly on the Court's Case Management/Electronic Case Filing (CM/ECF) system and PACER these seven Miscellaneous matter numbers, as well as the documents from those matters that have been revealed in full in the Starr Report.\" Feb. 12, 2018 Order at 3. In addition, DOJ was asked to review these eight dockets to (1) provide the Court with DOJ's \"views as to whether the documents remaining under seal in the eight Miscellaneous dockets at issue may be unsealed, (2) confirm that the individuals, who were recipients of the grand jury subpoenas at issue or otherwise involved in these matters, have been notified of the CNN/Polantz Request, and (3) provide\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   any privacy concerns regarding such individuals.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. DOJ was granted access to the sealed records at issue to facilitate its review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, dated Feb. 14, 2018, ECF No. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Former President Clinton intervened as of right in order to represent his interests,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Minute Order (dated Feb. 16, 2018), and provided, on February 23, 2018, his views on whether the dockets at issue may be unsealed.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Status Report of Former President Clinton (\"Clinton Status Report\"), ECF No. 15. The former President stated his \"belie[f] that a great deal of the material at issue has already been made public almost twenty years ago in the 211-page Starr Report, the two-volume, 3183-page Appendices to the Starr Report, and the three-volume, 4610-page Supplemental Materials to the Starr Report,\" but that \"there may be in the sealed dockets material that is still appropriately protected by Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Notably, former President Clinton also identified three additional sealed dockets, \"closely related to those identified by Cable News Network,\" which \"should now be unsealed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. These dockets-Misc. No. 98-55, Misc. No. 98-177, and Misc. No. 98-228-\"contain materials relating to litigation between then-President Clinton and the OIC concerning improper disclosures ('leaks') by the OIC of grand jury material protected by Rule 6(e).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. DOJ was, accordingly, directed to include these three dockets in its review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Order (Feb. 23, 2018). CNN agreed with unsealing these three dockets, in part because disclosure \"would further satisfy the substantial\n   public interest in learning more about what led to the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton\" and because the OIC \"no longer exists and its 1998 investigation has long since concluded.\" CNN Resp. to Status Report of Former President Clinton (\"CNN Resp. Status Report\") at 2-3, ECF No. 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Former President Clinton also proposed a process by which review of the sealed materials could occur, stating that \"it would be appropriate for [DOJ] to notify [former President Clinton] of any putatively protected Rule 6(e) materials that affect [the former President], and to allow counsel to review these materials pursuant to appropriate confidentiality protections (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , a non-disclosure agreement). [Former President Clinton] will then be in a position to give the Court knowledgeable notice (in a sealed pleading, as appropriate) of its views.\" Clinton Status Report at 2. With the concurrence of DOJ, this procedure has been adopted: on March 15, 2018, DOJ sought and was granted permission to disclose certain sealed materials to counsel for former President Clinton \"in order to assist government counsel in evaluating whether particular information-currently sealed pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) -remains privileged and protected by grand jury secrecy.\" Gov't Counsel's Mot. Allow Counsel for President Clinton Access to Sealed Materials at 1, ECF No. 17;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Order, dated March 15, 2018, ECF No. 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Upon completion of its review of both the eight dockets identified by CNN and the three dockets identified by former President Clinton, DOJ responded to CNN's Petition to Unseal and proposed particular documents within each of the eleven dockets that should be unsealed in full or only with redactions, or that should remain under seal. DOJ Resp. at 4-9. DOJ explained that, in its view, any proposed unsealing should be limited to information already disclosed in the Starr Report-reasoning that grand jury secrecy had been waived-but averred that information not discussed in the Starr Report should remain under seal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, DOJ posited that, \"[t]o the extent Petitioner or Intervenor objects to any redactions pursuant to Criminal Rule 6(e), the Department's view-consistent with the text of Rule [6](e)-is that the Court lacks the authority to unseal grand jury materials for reasons of 'extreme public interest' or any other reason outside the reticulated exceptions to secrecy set forth in Rule 6(e).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. DOJ also stated that unsealing could be denied \"based on the fact that the events underlying the grand jury proceedings are relatively recent and concern living individuals.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   DOJ simultaneously filed,\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   , a separate submission detailing its proposed redactions and corresponding reasoning.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   DOJ Notice of In Camera, Ex Parte Submission, ECF No. 21; DOJ In Camera, Ex Parte Submission (\"DOJ First Subm.\"), ECF No. 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Any interested parties were invited to respond to DOJ's proposed action,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Minute Order (Mar. 26, 2018). CNN was the only party to respond, requesting that the Court \"release the contents of all eleven dockets identified by CNN and President Clinton, in the redacted format the government proposes in its\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   submission.\" CNN's Initial Reply Supp. Pet. Unseal (\"CNN Reply\") at 2, ECF No. 22. CNN further asked that the Court \"direct the government to publicly file a redaction log\" and sought \"leave to file a supplemental reply in support of its Unsealing Request\" after reviewing DOJ's redactions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Intervenor former President Clinton has lodged no objections to the redactions or unsealing proposed by DOJ. After reviewing DOJ's proposed redactions and the underlying documents in the eleven dockets, the Court directed DOJ to provide additional information regarding its proposed redactions and sealing, which DOJ provided on April 13, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOJ Second In Camera, Ex Parte Submission (\"DOJ Supp. Subm.\") at 1-2, ECF No. 27.

Accordingly, for the reasons discussed below, CNN's petition is granted in large part, but certain documents within some of the dockets shall remain under seal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As discussed, the\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   factors guide this analysis. Given the nature of the dockets at issue and their connection to the same grand jury proceedings, the analysis of a particular\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   factor is often the same for each docket. Specifically, the first factor, the identity of the party seeking disclosure; the third factor, the reason for seeking disclosure; the fourth factor, the specific information sought to be disclosed; the fifth factor, how long ago the grand jury proceedings took place; and the sixth factor, the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and that of their families, are the same in each case: CNN seeks disclosure of all documents in each listed docket pertaining to grand jury proceedings that took place two decades ago, because disclosure \"would further satisfy the substantial public interest in learning more about what led to the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton and in better understanding past interactions between independent prosecutors and the Executive Branch,\" CNN Resp. Status Report at 2, and \"there is much to be learned from reviewing the procedures utilized to gain compliance with a grand jury subpoena over executive branch objections, both in proceedings before the court but also as to the pre-conflict interactions between the parties typically included as exhibits to motions and memoranda.\" CNN/Polantz Unsealing Request at 3. Similarly, the principals of the grand jury investigation and their status are the same for each docket: these dockets arise from a grand jury investigation into former President Clinton, who notably does not object to the disclosure of these dockets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Clinton Status Report at 3; DOJ Resp. at 6 n.5. These five factors weigh heavily in favor of disclosure in each matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Several factors, however, differ from docket to docket. These include the second, seventh, eighth, and ninth factors: \"whether the defendant to the grand jury proceeding or the government opposes the disclosure\"; \"the extent to which the desired material-either permissibly or impermissibly-has been previously made public\"; \"whether witnesses to the grand jury proceedings who might be affected by disclosure are still alive\"; and \"the additional need for maintaining secrecy in the particular case in question.\"\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11886702\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/131/99/#p103\">\n    131 F.3d at 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Documents Pertaining to a Separate Judicial Misconduct Investigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Two documents in each docket pertain to a separate judicial misconduct complaint, in which the outside attorney named to investigate that complaint sought access, pursuant to Rule 6(e), to numerous sealed records in these dockets. The Independent Counsel in the Clinton investigation thus filed a motion to permit the outside investigator access to certain grand jury records, and the Court issued an order on that motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   These two documents in each of the eleven dockets will remain under seal. Turning to the\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   factors, DOJ opposes the disclosure of these documents because they show which documents were involved in the misconduct investigation and, as such, are accompanied by certain privacy interests not attendant to the other documents at issue in CNN's request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOJ Resp. at 4. In addition,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20360\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) requires confidentiality with respect to all files \"related to\" judicial misconduct investigations, including \"all papers, documents, and records of proceedings.\" Further, these documents have never been made publicly available. The additional need for secrecy is furthered by the weak connection between these documents and the documents that are the targets of CNN's unsealing request: in each docket, these two documents were introduced for the purpose of allowing the outside attorney to investigate the separate claims of judicial misconduct and offered no factual details or legal conclusions about the OIC investigation. Thus, the two documents in each matter that pertain to the separate judicial misconduct investigation shall remain under seal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The petitioner in each of these cases requested, between February 9, 1998, and June 16, 1998, that the Court issue an order to show cause why the OIC should not be held in contempt for violating Rule 6(e), which prohibits prosecutors, grand jurors, and certain other individuals other than witnesses from disclosing \"matter[s] occurring before the grand jury.\" FED.

In addition, several documents in each docket-including the Court's June 19, 1998 Order to Show Cause resolving each petitioner's motion for an order to show cause why the OIC should not be held in contempt for improperly disclosing grand jury material-remain under seal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   factors weigh in favor of unsealing the documents in these matters, except for the two documents in each docket related to the judicial misconduct investigation and slight redactions to two other documents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   As for previous disclosure, this factor weighs in favor of unsealing because \"[m]any of the documents in these files are unsealed\" and \"the underlying information and testimony was included in the [Starr Report], its Appendices and Supplemental Materials.\" DOJ Resp. at 8. In addition, most of these files do not pertain to particular witnesses appearing before the grand jury. Some redactions are warranted, however, to prevent the disclosure of individuals who may or may not have appeared before the grand jury. Such information remains protected by Rule 6(e), and accordingly, one document in Misc. No. 98-55, in which the OIC was proposing redactions to a certain document in Misc. No. 98-177, as well as the one document in Misc.

DOJ contends that, because the numbers made public in the Starr Report differ from the numbers cited more than three months earlier in the consolidated May 1, 1998, Memorandum Opinion, unsealing this sentence in the Memorandum Opinion would reveal the progress of the investigation as of May 1, 1998. DOJ Supp. Subm. at 6. This argument is unpersuasive. In the span of a multi-year investigation, it is only logical that the number of witnesses interviewed or called to testify before the grand jury would increase.

In addition, nine of the forty-seven documents in this matter were filed in redacted form, not under seal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   This docket will be unsealed, with certain redactions as necessary to protect ongoing privacy interests. DOJ is the only party to object to full disclosure of this matter. Specifically, DOJ objects to the disclosure of the names and testimony of two Secret Service employees who testified before the grand jury, since those two names are not included in the Starr Report or in any of the documents made public in this matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOJ Resp. at 6-7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   These employees' identities thus remain protected by Rule 6(e) and, given the strength of their privacy interests and the possibility of prejudice to these unnamed individuals, their names shall be redacted from the documents being unsealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   DOJ also urges that further redactions are warranted because \"one Secret Service lawyer litigated the governmental attorney client privilege in response to a grand jury subpoena,\" and \"[n]o testimony from that attorney was included\" in the Starr Report.

The Starr Report reveals that this lawyer is John Kelleher, former General Counsel of the Secret Service, who \"assert[ed] the 'protection function' privilege and the governmental attorney-client privilege.\" Starr Report, Vol. II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   at 194. DOJ proposes additional redactions to certain documents to protect information about Mr. Kelleher's deposition testimony, including the substance of that testimony and citations to the deposition transcript, which information was not discussed in the Starr Report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOJ Resp. at 7. While deposition testimony ordinarily might not be considered a \"matter occurring before the grand jury,\" FED. R. CRIM. P. 6(e)(2)(B), the parties had agreed that Mr. Kelleher's deposition would be taken in lieu of live testimony before the grand jury and that his deposition testimony and the evidence received in the deposition would constitute grand jury material for the purposes of Rule 6(e). As part of its review of these matters, DOJ confirmed with Mr. Kelleher that his deposition was taken in lieu of live testimony before the grand jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOJ Supp. Subm. at 7 &amp; n.3. Accordingly, references to Mr. Kelleher's deposition and the substance of that testimony are protected by Rule 6(e), and appropriate redactions shall be made to prevent the disclosure of that information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Regarding previous disclosure, nine documents in this matter were publicly filed, including the OIC's motion to compel Secret Service personnel to testify before the grand jury regarding matters for which they had previously asserted privilege, Misc.

In addition, many details about the history of this proceeding are recounted in the Starr Report. Starr Report, Vol. II at 193-97. Thus, given this previous public disclosure, the need to maintain the secrecy of this docket is low and the\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   factors weigh in favor of unsealing. Accordingly, the thirty-eight documents remaining under seal in Misc. No. 98-148, shall be unsealed with the redactions noted above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Misc.

As described in the Starr Report, \"[t]he White House had been redacting such documents on relevancy grounds and refusing to provide phone logs unless the OIC gave them a list of all persons in which the grand jury was interested.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The White House opposed this motion, while \"tr[ying] to 'reserve[ ] the right to assert executive privilege over the material.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The OIC's motion was eventually granted in a Memorandum Order issued on June 26, 1998.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 198. None of the eight documents on this docket, including the June 26, 1998, Memorandum Order, has previously been unsealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Despite the lack of previous public access to these records, the\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   factors again weigh in favor of unsealing this matter with certain redactions as necessary to protect information still covered by Rule 6(e). Many details about the document subpoenas at issue were included in the Starr Report. Nevertheless, DOJ-the only objecting party-contends that certain information pertaining to the subpoenas ought to be redacted. Specifically, DOJ avers\n   that although the Starr Report mentions certain documents within the scope of subpoena D1248, including \"presidential call log[s],\" a \"telephone memorandum,\" \"diarist schedule notes,\" and \"daynotes,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Vol. V at 1633, certain other types of documents that fell within the scope of subpoena D1248 were not mentioned in the Report. DOJ First Subm. at 3-5. Given the details given in the Starr Report about this subpoena, however, and the fact that this subpoena was issued in connection with an investigation that ended nearly two decades ago, the need for maintaining the secrecy of other types of documents demanded by this subpoena is low. The only information that remains protected by Rule 6(e) is the information associated with a second document subpoena, which subpoena was not identified by number in the Starr Report. Thus, certain redactions will be made to protect the number of, and specific information targeted by, this subpoena, which is still protected by Rule 6(e).\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As for the remaining\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   factors, no objections other than the request for redactions from DOJ have been lodged. This docket pertains to subpoenas to the White House for document production and, accordingly, witnesses are unlikely to be prejudiced by disclosure. Further, for the reasons detailed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Part III.C, the overarching interest in the accessibility of judicial opinions militates strongly in favor of unsealing the June 26, 1998, Memorandum Order and the legal briefing underlying the judicial record. Finally, as discussed above, the need for maintaining secrecy is low given the amount of previous disclosure regarding the substance of this docket and the scope of the subpoenas at issue. Thus, this matter shall be unsealed with the aforementioned redactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Misc.
