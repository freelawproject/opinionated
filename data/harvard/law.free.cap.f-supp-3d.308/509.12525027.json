O'Toole, Jr., United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The magistrate judge to whom this case was referred issued two reports and recommendations (\"the R &amp; Rs\") (dkt. nos. 188 &amp; 189) addressing the motions to dismiss filed by the Town of Brookline defendants (dkt. no. 110) and the individual defendants (dkt. no. 112), respectively. The R &amp; Rs recommend that paragraphs of the third amended complaint be stricken as surplusage. They also recommend rejecting the defendants' arguments that certain claims apparently pled by the plaintiff are barred either by the Rooker-Feldman doctrine or by principles of claim preclusion to the extent that they allege facts that pre-date the termination of the plaintiff's prior Norfolk County action. The defendants filed timely objections to the latter of these recommendations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   1 After reviewing the parties' submissions concerning the objections, I agree that the Rooker - Feldman Doctrine does not bar the present case, but I conclude\n   that the doctrine of claim preclusion does apply, because the claims at issue could have or should have been brought in the prior action.

This motion to dismiss only concerns Alston's claims against the Town.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Specifically, Alston brought this action against the Town, the Board of Selectmen (the Board), the Town Counsel, and the Human Resources Director (collectively, the Town defendants)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging that they are liable under \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983 because of a custom of racial discrimination in Town governance and because of their actions as policymakers for the Town. Alston claims that the Town defendants violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection by enforcing the policy, and that they violated his First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and to petition the government for redress of grievances by retaliating against him. (# 108 \u00b6\u00b6 192-197.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons outlined below, the court recommends that Town Defendants' Partial Motion to Dismiss (# 110) be allowed in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 1, 2015, Alston filed a 55-page complaint in which he was the sole plaintiff. (# 1.) Alston alleged that the Town defendants, individual defendants, and the firefighters' union to which Alston had belonged had violated his rights in much the same way he alleges in the present complaint.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=514%20N.E.2d%20663\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On January 12, 2016, the Town defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim (## 10, 11) on essentially the same grounds as they do in the present motion.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   # 11 at 22\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   # 111 at 15-16; # 11 at 18\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   # 111 at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Before the court acted on the motion to dismiss, Alston filed a first amended complaint on January 26, 2016, which was styled as a class action. (# 21.) The amended complaint added seven new plaintiffs who claimed that they, too, had been racially discriminated against by the Town.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=514%20N.E.2d%20663\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Two of the plaintiffs withdrew from the complaint two weeks later. (## 30, 31.) The Town again moved to dismiss the case on the same grounds as in the original motion but added arguments concerning why the new plaintiffs were not properly joined in Alston's case. (## 34, 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On September 2, 2016, this court issued a Report and Recommendation to the District Court, O'Toole, J., recommending that the first amended complaint be dismissed without prejudice for failure to conform to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 3 8 and 20, and that all plaintiffs other than Alston be required to file new, separate lawsuits. (# 72.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court did not address the substance of the Town defendants' pending motion to dismiss because the court ordered Alston to file a new complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39. Judge O'Toole adopted the Report and Recommendation in part. (# 75.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 21, 2016, Alston filed a second amended complaint. (# 78.) The Town defendants and individual defendants jointly moved to strike portions of it under Rule 12(f) (# 86) and moved alternatively for a more definite statement under Rule (12)(e) (# 88). This court issued an Order in which ## 86 and 88 were granted in part and denied in part. (# 106.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Alston then filed the now-operative third amended complaint. (# 108.) The Town defendants have once again moved to dismiss (# 110); Alston responded in opposition (# 133);\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Town defendants replied (# 135).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   An oral argument on this motion was held on January 5, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Town defendants' motion to dismiss is limited to (1) portions of the third amended complaint relating to \"policy choices by the Town regarding the powers and jurisdiction that various Town committees should have,\" including the Town Meeting's amendment of a bylaw to remove jurisdiction over employee complaints of racial discrimination from a certain commission, and a claim that the bylaw as amended is unconstitutional; and (2) portions of the complaint \"relating to alleged discrimination against third parties by unrelated actors spanning decades.\" (# 110 at 2, # 111 at 3.) The Town defendants do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   seek dismissal of Alston's claims against the Town defendants arising from an alleged hostile work environment and Alston's ultimate termination. (# 111 at 1-2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Town defendants explain that they seek dismissal of \"large sections of the Complaint that are lengthy and that would needlessly expand the scope of discovery to the prejudice of the Town and third parties when they have nothing to do with Plaintiff's alleged injury or wrongdoing by the Selectmen, who are the 'Policymaker' for purposes of establishing Section 1981 and/or 1983 municipal liability in this case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In order to determine whether the complained-of material is relevant or should be stricken, the court must first describe both the facts of the case and the particular factual allegations to which defendants object. The court will then discuss the legal framework of Alston's claims. Finally, applying this law to the facts, the court determines that certain allegations should be stricken, while others should remain in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Allegations in the Third Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The third amended complaint alleges that the Town's policy, practice, and custom of protecting and encouraging acts of racial discrimination and disparate treatment (the custom)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   was the driving force behind the racially-motivated wrongs inflicted on Alston.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   # 108. As explained above, a substantial procedural history exists in this matter and previous orders of the court set out the facts of the case at length,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , # 72 (Report and Recommendation on Motions to Dismiss). While only those facts germane to the pending motion will be repeated here, because of the nature of the analysis those facts must be set out in detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Facts Pertaining to Alston\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Alston joined the Brookline Fire Department (BFD) in 2002. (# 108 \u00b6 2.) On May 30, 2010, Paul Pender, a lieutenant in the BFD, left a voicemail on Alston's phone in which he called Alston a \"f***ing n*****\" (the voicemail incident).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. A week later, Alston reported the voicemail incident to BFD's chief operating officer, but the Town took no action other than to inform Pender of Alston's complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Alston contends that Pender made excuses for the comment, showed no remorse, and told Alston that filing the complaint\n   \"was the stupidest thing [Alston] could have ever done.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-24. Pender behaved this way because he knew that the custom of racial discrimination in the Town would protect him and punish Alston.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On August 17, 2010, the Board held a hearing to address the voicemail incident, but failed to question Pender about his excuses; did not investigate Pender's intimidating and retaliatory conduct; and did not \"terminate his employment, demote him, or make him ineligible for promotion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    \u00b6 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Alston makes no effort to rebut the Town defendants' argument that many of the examples he sets out to establish the municipal custom are not sufficiently connected to the harm he allegedly suffered, and he fails to address the objections raised by the Town that many of the examples in the third amended complaint assert harms perpetrated by actors over whom the Board has no control.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   As described below, the court finds that certain allegations in Alston's third amended complaint are irrelevant to his claims and recommends that they be stricken.

There simply is no legal precedent for finding that facts such as racial discrimination in housing, the favorable treatment of a white police officer who lost his firearm, or problems encountered by a Black director of the Town's early childhood education center, to name just a few of the many examples Alston proffers, properly may be offered as evidence of a municipal custom of racism that led to retaliation against a firefighter who complained about being called a racial slur. Surely, racism is a pervasive problem in our society. But not every example of racism in a town, or of favoritism toward white people, can be mustered to establish a municipal custom in a particular civil rights suit. As detailed below, this court therefore finds that many of the allegations pled are irrelevant to establishing the custom and should be stricken from the third amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The court does find that some of the allegations challenged by the Town should not be stricken. They may be relevant to Alston's claims for violation of his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection under \u00a7 1983 by showing that Alston was selectively treated compared with others similarly situated on the basis of his race.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Freeman v.

Certain allegations may\n   also be relevant to the alleged violation of Alston's \u00a7 1981 right to be free from employment discrimination based on race, and to Alston's claims that he was retaliated against, in violation of the First Amendment, because of his complaints to the town. Whether these allegations are pertinent to an alleged custom on which municipal liability can be based, and if so, whether they constitute enough evidence to establish a custom, may be explored further as the case progresses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The Town argues that with regard to much of the conduct alleged in the third amended complaint involving individuals other than Alston, it is not clear whether members of the Board were the final policymakers. (# 111 at 13-14, 15.) The court does not have enough information at this time to make findings on this basis. For example, the Town argues that the Board may not be deemed responsible for any conduct alleged to have occurred in the DPW, because \"[a]side from DPW Division Heads..., the DPW Commissioner is otherwise the appointing authority for DPW.\" (# 111 at 4.) At this point in the case, it is not clear what control the Board has over the DPW Commissioner, or whether in a particular case the Board could be said to have had actual or constructive knowledge of a certain problem.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Silva v.
