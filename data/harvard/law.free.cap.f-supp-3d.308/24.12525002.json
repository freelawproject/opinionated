INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In this Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") case, Plaintiff Jack Jordan submitted requests with the Office of Administrative Law Judges (\"OALJ\"), an agency within the United States Department of Labor (\"DOL\"), seeking unredacted versions of two emails related to Defense Base Act Case No. 2015-LDA-00030 (\"DBA Proceedings\"), a case in which Mr. Jordan is representing his wife, Maria Jordan, against DynCorp International, Inc. (\"DynCorp\"). In a prior Opinion, this Court granted summary judgment in favor of DOL with respect to one of the emails. However, finding that DOL had insufficiently justified its withholding of the other email, the Court denied both parties' motions for summary judgment with respect to that email and instructed DOL to either release it or to file a renewed motion for summary judgment with further justification. Now before the Court is DOL's renewed motion for summary judgment. Also before the Court are Mr. Jordan's \"Motion for Disclosure and Inclusion of Portions of the Emails and Other Non-Privileged Ex Parte Communications,\" Mr. Jordan's request that this judge recuse himself, Mr. Jordan's motion for reconsideration\n   of an order granting DOL an extension of time to file a reply, and DOL's motion for a protective order barring Mr. Jordan from filing future motions without leave of Court and permitting DOL to disregard Mr. Jordan's requests for production. For the reasons explained below, the Court denies all five motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Chief ALJ Stephen R.

The probability of bias here does not rise to a constitutionally intolerable level, and no reasonable and informed observer would question this judge's impartiality under the present circumstances.

The Court briefly addresses some of Mr. Jordan's more pointed contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   First, several of Mr. Jordan's accusations appear to take issue with this Court's reliance on\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   inspection to confirm the propriety of DOL's withholdings.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Mot. to Disqualify at 9-10, 17-28, 42-45. Of course, Congress's directive and the D.C. Circuit's precedents-not Mr. Jordan's preferences-regulate when a district court may rely on\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review. The D.C. Circuit has recognized that \"Congress provided district courts the option to conduct\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review under FOIA,\" and the decision whether to do so is left to \"the broad discretion of the trial judge.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    American Civil Liberties Union v.

Cir. 2011). Indeed, the Circuit has clarified that \"[a] judge has discretion to order\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   inspection on the basis of an uneasiness, on a doubt that he wants satisfied before he takes responsibility for a de novo determination\" and that \"[t]he ultimate criterion\" is \"[w]hether the district judge believes that\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   inspection is needed in order to make a responsible de novo determination on the claims of exemption.\"\n   <em>\n    Spirko v.

Cir. 1998) (rejecting a challenge that a court too hastily resorted to\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review). It surely cannot be that this Court's reliance on an authorized practice to evaluate an agency's FOIA withholdings, without more, constitutes conduct that mandates recusal. And Mr. Jordan has provided no factual support for any accusation that this Court was impermissibly motivated to rely on\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review. Mr. Jordan can certainly appeal from this Court's decision to review the disputed documents\n   <em>\n    in camera.

He has not shown, however, that resort to that method of evaluating DOL's FOIA withholdings requires this Court's recusal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Second, Mr. Jordan contends that this judge was biased based on the marital status or gender of Mr. Jordan, his client in the DBA Proceedings, or both.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Disqualify at 28-31. As evidence, he notes that this Court mentioned in its prior Opinion that Mr. Jordan \"is representing his wife\" in the DBA Proceeding. Mr. Jordan asserts that \"that fact must have been profoundly important to Judge Contreras on a personal level\" because it is mentioned in the first paragraph of the Court's opinion and because it had no bearing on any of the Court's legal conclusions. Mot. to Disqualify at 28. Mr. Jordan is mistaken. But more importantly for present purposes, he has not offered anything more than conclusory allegations to support his claim of bias and such contentions are plainly insufficient to mandate recusal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Klayman v.

However, other than baldly asserting that this judge has \"essentially made himself the DOL's key witness,\" Mot. to Disqualify at 14, Mr. Jordan neglects to explain what this judge's interest in this matter might be.

The Supreme Court has been clear that \"judicial remarks during the\n   course of a trial that are critical or disapproving of, or even hostile to, counsel, the parties, or their cases\" generally \"do not support a bias or partiality challenge,\" unless the comments reveal an opinion derived from an extrajudicial source or they reveal \"such a high degree of favoritism or antagonism as to make fair judgment impossible.\"\n   <em>\n    Liteky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"235096\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/540/#p555\">\n    510 U.S. at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"235096\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/540/#p555\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Mr. Jordan contends that reconsideration is warranted, asserting that this Court has \"established a pattern of denying [him] due process\" and alleging that this Court did not properly consider his opposition to Defendant's motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Corrected Opp'n to DOL's Mot. for Extension of Time to File Reply Purporting to Support Summ. J. (\"Opp'n to Extension\") at 1-3, ECF No. 49. To support Mr. Jordan's latter claim, he explains that the Court issued its minute order granting Defendant's request only about two hours after Mr. Jordan filed his opposition to the motion. Opp'n to Extension at 5. Mr. Jordan also notes that, though the minute order was issued on September 21, 2018, the docket entry indicates that the order was \"signed\" on September 20-the day before Mr. Jordan filed his opposition to Defendant's motion. Opp'n to Extension at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Mr. Jordan has not demonstrated that justice requires reconsidering the Court's order granting Defendant's request for an extension. Mr. Jordan has identified no issue on which the Court misunderstood the parties, no decision made outside the scope of the issues presented to the Court, and no change in the law or facts that would warrant reconsideration. Furthermore, the Court fails to see how its decision to grant a short extension to Defendant could possibly have deprived Mr. Jordan of due process. As for Mr. Jordan's argument that the Court's order demonstrates that it did not properly consider Mr. Jordan's opposition to the request, the Court disagrees. Mr. Jordan's conclusory statements to the contrary do not provide any basis for reconsidering the Court's grant of an extension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In any event, if the Court were to reevaluate Defendant's request for an extension and Plaintiff's opposition to that request, the Court's ruling would be the same. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b) commits to a district court's discretion the decision to extend a party's filing deadline.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Here, Defendant submitted a motion explaining that (1) Plaintiff had filed his opposition to Defendant's renewed motion for summary judgment late on a Friday night, and counsel for Defendant did not access the filing until the next Monday; (2) Plaintiff's opposition brief spanned 37 pages; (3) Defendant's counsel had a prearranged vacation beginning on September 22, 2017 (the date on which the reply was due) and continuing through the weekend; and (4) undersigned counsel had two impending deadlines in other matters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Extension \u00b6\u00b6 1-3. Counsel for Defendant requested that the Court extend the deadline from September 22 to September 28 and indicated that Plaintiff\n   opposed the motion. Mot. for Extension \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In opposition, Mr. Jordan asserted that the Court should deny the request because \"DOL already failed to state or adduce evidence establishing dispositive facts\"-an argument apparently focusing on the merits of the parties' dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n to Extension at 1-3. Mr. Jordan also argued that counsel for DOL had not established good cause for its requested extension; that DOL had not discharged its obligations under the Local Rules of this court to demonstrate that it had made a good faith effort to narrow the areas of disagreement; that DOL had only implied and had not clearly stated that counsel who had a prearranged vacation was \"crucial to the preparation\" the reply; that counsel for DOL had failed to identify the particular cases for which he had other impending deadlines and had not indicated whether he had sought extensions in those matters; that counsel for DOL had evaded Plaintiff's request for information about whether other attorneys were working on the reply; and that, based on the date on which Defendant filed its renewed motion for summary judgment, it could have and should have anticipated that its reply would be due on September 22. Opp'n to Extension at 3-8. Contrary to Mr. Jordan's assertions, DOL established cause for the short extension. Furthermore, Mr. Jordan offered no compelling reason to deny DOL's request. In this District, requests for extensions of short durations are routine. The civility of most counsel appearing before this Court results in most requests of this nature premised on prearranged vacations and the press of business being unopposed. Also routine in this District is the fact that most motions are pending for several months before being resolved due to the press of the Court's business and the volume of substantive motions filed. Thus, faced with a routine motion for an extension of a short duration based on a prearranged vacation and the press of business, and knowing that the Court was months away from turning its attention to the motion, the Court easily granted the motion and plaintiff suffered no prejudice as a result. In sum, even if this Court were to reconsider its earlier ruling, it would not revise it. Mr. Jordan's motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    3. \"Motion for Disclosure and Inclusion of Portions of the Emails and Other Non-Privileged Ex Parte Communications\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Mr. Jordan's third and final pending motion contests various aspects of the Court's prior Opinion. It also asks this Court to disclose (1) a version of the Powers email that shows any attorney-client privilege notation and any non-commercial words stating an express request for advice; (2) any verbal or written communication in which this Court received any factual information about the redacted content of any of the disputed emails or Mr. Bellomy's status as an attorney and whether he was employed in advising DynCorp; and (3) any non-commercial words in DOL's communications with the Court in or with which DOL submitted any version of the Powers email or the Huber email.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mot. for Disclosure and Inclusion of Portions of the Emails and Other Non-Privileged Ex Parte Communications (\"Mot. for Ex Parte Commc'n\") at 6, ECF No. 40.

Motion for Reconsideration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Much of Mr. Jordan's motion asks this Court to retread ground already covered in this Court's prior Opinion. Mr. Jordan contends that (1) the Court's findings about the content of the DynCorp emails were not established and were refuted by evidence in the public record; (2) no evidence on record established that Mr. Bellomy was an attorney to DynCorp or that he was giving DynCorp advice regarding the subject matter of the emails; (3) no evidence in the public record established that the Powers email contains the notation \"subject to attorney-client privilege\"; (4) no evidence in the record established that the emails contained an express request for legal advice; (5) the declaration submitted by Mr. Smyth was \"very clearly knowingly false, designed to mislead, and not made on personal knowledge\"; (6) there is no legitimate reason for DOL to have failed to disclose a version of the Powers email showing either the notation \"subject to attorney-client privilege\" or any generic non-commercial words stating an express request for advice; (7) DynCorp waived any privilege covering the emails; and (8) the Court should have assessed Mr. Jordan's request under provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Ex Parte Commc'n. Because all of the above-mentioned issues were decided in the Court's prior Opinion, the Court construes Mr. Jordan's contentions as a request for reconsideration.

Cir. 1982) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Here, DOL seems to argue that the Huber email qualifies for protection under the attorney-client privilege because it was sent as part of DynCorp's broader efforts to address a legal issue and because it was sent to an in-house attorney to provide him \"with a complete understanding of the facts relevant to the matter that was being discussed in the email.\" Def.'s MSJ Mem. at 10. The Court disagrees and concludes that, contrary to DOL's contentions, the Huber email is not protected by attorney-client privilege and must be produced.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Several factors buttress this conclusion. First, it is difficult to say, under the circumstances of this case, that one of the primary purposes of the Huber email was to obtain legal advice. The email is specifically directed to another person-a non-attorney-and the email specifically (and only) seeks information from that person. It is not at all apparent from DOL's submissions how Mr. Huber's request that Mr. Powers provide\n   certain information might in any way shape Mr. Bellomy's legal advice on the business contract or any other legal matter. DOL's contention that some broader legal problem existed in the background is insufficient to connect this specific communication to that legal problem or to any prospective legal problem.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second and relatedly, the Huber email does not appear to contain any factual information on which Mr. Bellomy might rely to form a legal judgment. Rather, it appears to contain a discrete request-directed to one person-that exposes little to nothing about the factual circumstances underlying the problem of the \"short paid invoices\" or any other legal issue. Third, protection of this document does little to promote the purpose of the attorney-client privilege, which is \"to encourage 'full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and the administrative of justice.' \"\n   <em>\n    Swidler &amp; Berlin v.

Fourth, the Huber email's topic and distribution list appears to be nearly identical to that of the final email in the chain, which was not withheld on the basis of attorney-client privilege. The only difference between the two emails is that the Huber email was copied to an attorney while the final email in the chain was not. As set forth above, simply copying an attorney on a communication does not make that communication privileged. In sum, DOL's arguments that the attorney-client privilege applies to the Huber email are unavailing. DOL's renewed motion for summary judgment is denied, and DOL is ordered to release the Huber email.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Motion for Protective Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Finally, the Court considers DOL's motion for a protective order. In its motion, DOL contends that Mr. Jordan's \"Motion for Disclosure and Inclusion of Portions of the Emails and Other Non-Privileged Ex Parte Communications\" \"appears to be a harassing, unnecessary, and frivolous motion, which merely causes unnecessary delay and wastes the time of the Court and the parties.\" Def.'s Opp'n to Mot. for Disclosure &amp; Mot. for Protective Order (\"Mot. for Protective Order\") at 4, ECF No. 43. DOL asks that this Court grant Defendant \"a protective order from responding to Plaintiff's second set of requests for production and any pending motions, and requiring that any future motions be made only with leave of Court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716190\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/383/#p390\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff opposes entry of a protective order, primarily arguing that there are \"unstated illicit purposes behind DOL's motion\" and that DOL has failed to provide a statement of facts or to state any specific point of law on which its requests are based.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n to DOL's Mot. for Protective Order at 17, ECF No. 45. Because Defendant has failed to certify that it conferred or attempted to confer with Plaintiff to resolve the disputes for\n   which Defendant seeks a protective order without court action, the Court denies Defendant's motion without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c) provides that a \"court may, for good cause, issue an order to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense.\" Fed.

Namely, Defendant has not \"include[d] a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with other affected parties in an effort to resolve the dispute without court action,\" as Rule 26 requires. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c). Defendant attached along with its motion, a series of email communications between counsel. But none of these communications involve any attempt to narrow the focus of any discovery request or any request that Mr. Jordan cease filing further motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Ex. 2, ECF No. 42-2. Because certification of either good faith or attempts to confer is mandatory, the Court denies Defendant's motion without prejudice. However, Defendant may submit a renewed motion for a protective order, if it wishes and if warranted, that satisfies the requirements of Rule 26(c). But regardless, given that this Court has now ruled on the appropriateness of DOL's withholding pursuant to FOIA of the only two emails at issue in this case, this case is near completion and the necessity for a protective order is-this Court hopes-greatly diminished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Mr. Jordan's \"Motion for Disclosure and Inclusion of Portions of the Emails and Other Non-Privileged Ex Parte Communications,\" Mr. Jordan's request that this judge disqualify himself, Mr. Jordan's motion for reconsideration of an order granting DOL an extension of time to file a reply, DOL's renewed motion for summary judgment, and DOL's motion for a protective order.
