Oliver was an employee of non-party Bechtel Corp., which acted as BECO's architect-engineer with responsibility for construction at both plants. Defendant General Electric Company (\"GE\") designed, manufactured, and sold steam turbine generators for installation at both plants and its engineers supervised each installation. Other than the insulated turbine-generators and nuclear steam systems supplied by GE, all construction materials and supplies were specified and procured by Bechtel. Before the court are GE and NSTAR's motions for summary judgment. (Docket ## 314, 307).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Wyndham Vacation Resorts, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278337\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/169/#p172\">\n    793 F.3d 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 172 (1st Cir. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Construction of Pilgrim Station\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pilgrim Station, as a nuclear power plant, was subject to the ultimate oversight of the United States Atomic Energy Commission (\"AEC\"), with BECO responsible for obtaining all required permits and approvals. BECO's onsite inspectors \"maintained an overall surveillance of construction activities by means of audit-oriented field inspections in support of quality documentation auditing.\" Docket # 307-23, at 14 (Amendment 15 to AEC License Application). Bechtel and GE, however, directed the engineering and construction and monitored on-site compliance with their designs and specifications. GE was responsible for Pilgrim Station's nuclear steam supply system, nuclear fuel, and turbine-generator; everything else fell to Bechtel. Consistent with that division of labor, Bechtel hired and supervised all subcontractors except GE, including subcontractor New England Insulation (\"NEI\"). NEI was responsible for installing thermal system insulation pursuant to the specifications and direction provided by both Bechtel and GE. BECO retained authority to conduct inspections at any time and to stop any work it deemed improper.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Absent specific instructions from BECO, Bechtel was to \"employ its own standards and ... perform the work or cause the work to be performed in accordance with its best engineering skill and judgment; provided, however, that all such work shall be subject to [BECO's] review and approval.\" Docket # 353-4, at 6. Explicitly excepted from Bechtel's engineering authority were \"the nuclear steam supply system, nuclear fuel, the turbine-generator and related services already selected by [BECO] to be performed by [GE].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Pursuant to its contract with BECO, GE was responsible both for technical direction of installation of Pilgrim's turbine generator and for procuring the turbine's thermal insulation material. GE's specifications called for the use of asbestos-containing insulation materials, and NEI's attempt to persuade GE to use a non-asbestos alternative was unavailing. The extent to which asbestos-containing insulation was used at Pilgrim Station is disputed; BECO contends asbestos products were limited to the plant's drywell containment area, while plaintiff points to evidence suggesting that asbestos was used throughout the facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As a pipe inspector at Pilgrim Station, Oliver worked throughout the facility. He was present in both the nuclear reactor building and on the turbine floor when insulation work was being performed. Although he did not personally handle, install, remove, or repair any thermal insulation at Pilgrim Station, he was present while asbestos-containing insulation was cut, mixed, and applied to piping systems and equipment at Pilgrim. Plaintiff and both of his supervisors recalled this process as a dusty one during which employees took no respiratory precautions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Construction of Calvert Cliffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As with BECO at Pilgrim Station, GE contracted with Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric at Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant to supply both the turbine generator and its thermal insulation material. As it had at Pilgrim, at Calvert Cliffs GE included asbestos-containing insulation in its specifications; it also rejected a more expensive proposal providing asbestos-free materials in favor of a cheaper bid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Oliver's job at Calvert Cliffs involved substantially the same duties he had performed at Pilgrim Station and he was similarly present in the turbine hall during the insulation process. GE representatives were on-site during the turbine work at Calvert Cliffs, and had a satellite office in the turbine room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Post-Construction Events\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Pilgrim Station and Calvert Cliffs opened commercial operations by July 1972 and March 1975 respectively. At least as to Pilgrim Station, however, GE's role\n   extended well beyond installation to include regular maintenance, inspections, and refueling that continues to the present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As a Bechtel employee, Oliver was exposed to asbestos insulation during the new construction of Pilgrim Station from approximately May 21, 1971 through July 7, 1972, and of Calvert Cliffs from July 7, 1972 until 1978. He was for much of his life in excellent physical shape, doing daily pushups and pull-up exercises until his diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma on April 20, 2015. He commenced this action on August 25, 2015, and died on July 25, 2016. Plaintiffs filed the operative Third Amended Complaint (\"TAC\") on February 17, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party \"shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Here, the turbine-generators were indisputably permanent additions enhancing the capital value of both power plants, involved the expenditure of labor and money, and facilitated the very function of each plant. Conceding as much, plaintiffs nonetheless press the point that the pre-installation asbestos-containing insulation materials-as opposed to the completed turbine generators-do not themselves constitute improvements to real property. I am unpersuaded by this distinction. The nature of the activities enumerated in Section 2B -design, planning, and construction-clearly contemplate the process of improvement as well as the finished product, and thereby reach integral components like asbestos-containing insulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harder v.

Application of Statute of Repose to GE's Asbestos-Related Conduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   More vexing is the question whether the statute of repose applies in the context of a contractor like GE's asbestos-related work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs note that GE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   knew of the risks and had control of the improvement at the time of injury, and argue that applying Section 2B to inherently latent asbestos claims would bar them completely. Citing its well-documented involvement in \"the design, planning, construction, [and] general administration\" of each plant's steam supply system, GE insists it is entitled to the repose promised by the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The SJC has not considered the application of the statute of repose to asbestos claims. Its most thorough examination of the statute is in\n   <em>\n    Klein v.

In concluding that the Legislature had struck a reasonable balance between the public's right to a remedy and the need to limit liability, the SJC considered the purpose in protecting actors with no continuing relationship to the site of injury; the proportion of meritorious claims likely to be excluded; and the problem of stale evidence. All are inapposite here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   First, the public policies animating\n   <em>\n    Klein\n   </em>\n   's analysis of the statute of repose are absent in this case. In\n   <em>\n    Klein\n   </em>\n   , the court accepted a \"well recognized public purpose [in] limiting the duration of liability.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=437%20N.E.2d%20514\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=437%20N.E.2d%20514\">\n    at 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"There comes a time,\" the court continued, \"when [a defendant] ought to be secure in his reasonable expectation that the slate has been wiped clean of ancient obligations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=437%20N.E.2d%20514\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). In the context of asbestos-related injuries, however, such an expectation ceases to be reasonable. See\n   <em>\n    Myers v. Crouse-Hinds Div. of Cooper Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6795751\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/53/1160/#p1167\">\n    53 N.E.3d 1160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1167-68 (Ind. 2016) (holding product liability statute of repose inapplicable to asbestos claims). Unlike the plate-glass window that the\n   <em>\n    Klein\n   </em>\n   architect had no reason to believe would ultimately injure someone, the dangers of asbestos were well-known by 1971.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docket # 358-26 (Harold Schmeck Jr.,\n   <em>\n    A Rare Carcinoma Believed on Rise\n   </em>\n   , N.Y. Times, Oct. 7, 1964). Despite this knowledge, GE rejected non-asbestos insulation alternatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Second, the realities of Oliver's asbestos claim are fundamentally different than the claims contemplated by the\n   <em>\n    Klein\n   </em>\n   court. In upholding the statute of repose, the SJC noted that-at least in the context of personal injury-the vast majority of claims would be brought within the six-year period. The\n   <em>\n    Klein\n   </em>\n   court explained, \"The Legislature could reasonably have concluded that a period of six years allows sufficient time for the most meritorious claims to accrue.\"\n   <em>\n    Klein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=437%20N.E.2d%20514\">\n    437 N.E.2d at 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, GE had control of the site at the time of Oliver's asbestos exposure, conducted regular on-site maintenance and inspections for at least two decades after construction was complete, and continues to the present to perform refueling outages every eighteen months. It is thus not entitled to the same repose deemed reasonable for actors whose connection to the instrumentality of injury has long since ceased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In sum, although designers, engineers, and contractors like GE appear facially covered by the statute of repose, their protection is ultimately determined by reference to underlying acts.\n   <em>\n    Dighton v.

As to the acts at issue here, it is not at all clear that the six-year statute of repose was designed to bar a category of claims known uniformly to have a latency period of at least twenty years. To so hold would transform a statute intended to limit liability into one that creates absolute immunity.

Application of the Statute of Repose to Premises Owner\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Like GE, NSTAR seeks the protection of the statute of repose. As discussed above, however, the law limits the liability of those engaged in \"the design, planning, construction or general administration of an improvement to real property,\" not that of the owners of such property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Klein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=437%20N.E.2d%20514\">\n    437 N.E.2d at 524-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the statute of repose \"denies ... protection to materialmen, owners, tenants, and others in possession or control.\"). BECO emphasizes its planning and administrative roles at Pilgrim Station, but it served in those functions principally with respect to the AEC's regulation of nuclear power, not construction of the asbestos-containing insulated turbines at issue. Although BECO is thus unable to avail itself of the statute of repose, I do not elaborate on this point in light of my determination on other grounds, discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , that BECO is not liable to plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

TAC \u00b6\u00b6 11-13. As a public utility, BECO never manufactured, supplied, or sold asbestos-containing products.

Strict Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that BECO is strictly liable due to abnormally dangerous\n   activity at Pilgrim Station, a BECO-owned premises (TAC Count VII). BECO contends that the installation of asbestos-containing insulation is not an abnormally dangerous activity, both because its risks may be managed with proper precautions, and because any remaining risks are outweighed by the value of energy production to the community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Massachusetts law of strict liability is consistent with the balancing test set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 519, 520.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clark-Aiken Co. v.
