BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Although cities seek to attract destination restaurants and desirable retail, they must also keep the more prosaic needs of their citizenry in mind. For example, fearing the rapid disappearance of full-service gas stations from the District of Columbia, the D.C. City Council passed the Retail Service Station Act (RSSA) in 1976 to ban the conversion of such gas stations to limited-service stations. This moratorium was reauthorized ten times and made permanent in 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In recent years a different threat emerged: District gas stations were disappearing altogether as developers converted them into more lucrative commercial and residential properties. Seeking to combat this threat, the City Council amended the RSSA in 2014-15 to expand its reach. Plaintiffs Petworth Holdings, LLC and John Formant, the owners of a property containing a full-service Shell gas station, are convinced that these amendments have hindered their ability to sell their property. They have thus now sued, seeking a declaration that the amended RSSA violates the Fifth and Thirteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and an injunction barring Defendants Muriel\n   Bowser, Karl A. Racine, Tommy Wells, and the District of Columbia Gas Station Advisory Board from enforcing it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Arguing that Plaintiffs have no standing to challenge the RSSA and that, in any event, it violates neither constitutional amendment, Defendants have now moved to dismiss. Finding that Plaintiffs have standing to sue and have sufficiently stated a plausible Fifth Amendment claim, but not one under the Thirteenth Amendment, the Court will grant in part and deny in part Defendants' Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Defendants alternatively maintain that even if the RSSA does apply to Plaintiffs, they have not suffered any injury here. The Court cannot concur on either score.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The RSSA provides, in relevant part, that \"[n]o retail service station which is operated as a full service station on or after April 19, 1977, may be discontinued, nor may be structurally altered, modified\n   or otherwise converted ... into a non full service facility or into any other use.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2036-304.01\">\n    D.C.

Rather, it announces a general prohibition on the discontinuation, alteration, modification, or conversion into a non-full-service facility or any other use without mentioning either \"owners\" or \"operators.\" If, as Defendants assert, the RSSA is inapplicable to Plaintiffs-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , property owners who lease service facilities to station operators-then the RSSA would be rendered ineffective. In other words, if all of its provisions were inapplicable to owners like Plaintiffs, then they would be able to cancel their leases and modify or raze their full-service gas stations at will. This legislative outcome would be illogical, and Defendants' reading is thus unlikely to have been the one the City Council had in mind when passing the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The RSSA, in addition, provides that \"[a]ny owner or operator of a retail service station who converts or causes the conversion of [a] retail service station without procuring an exemption\" shall be guilty of a civil infraction and fined accordingly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2036-304.01\">\n    D.C.

Believing that this provision defines the applicable scope of the RSSA, Defendants contend that because Plaintiffs are merely \"property owners\"-and not \"owners\" or \"operators\" of a full-service station-the RSSA does not apply to them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 2-3. Even if this subsection controlled, instead of (b) quoted above, Plaintiffs still qualify as \"owners\" under the Code. They allege, and Defendants do not contest, that they own the Property and \"its improvements\"-including the \"full service retail service station.\" Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 4-6 (noting Plaintiffs \"purchased the Property and Station\"). The Property and gas station are currently leased to an \"operator\"-DAG-but that does not alter their underlying ownership status.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2036-304.01\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2036-304.01\">\n    , \u00b6\u00b6 5-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The RSSA in fact contemplates this scenario: the Code addresses these two different property relationships to a gas station and makes regulatory distinctions between owners' and operators' obligations under the Code. For example, \u00a7 36-304.01(c) imposes requirements exclusively on \"operators\" or persons who \"control [ ] the operation\" of retail service stations with regard to the range of\n   <em>\n    services\n   </em>\n   they must offer. This targeting makes perfect sense-only operators or those who control operations exercise authority over what types of services they offer. On the other hand, the Code's provisions pertaining to applicable fines and punishments for violations of the Code apply to\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   \"owners\" and \"operators\" of service stations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2036-304.01\">\n    D.C.

The Court answers in the affirmative because they cannot sell the Property, which inability economically harms them. Because the Court must treat Plaintiffs' factual allegations as true at this stage, their assertions that the RSSA clouds the Property's title sufficiently so as to render it unattractive to lenders for financing must be taken at face value. Much like in the context of zoning cases, the Act removes a \"stick\" from Plaintiffs' \"bundle\" of property rights-namely, as explained below, their ability to raze the service station.

The 2014 Act, as discussed, amended the RSSA to prohibit a full-service station from being \"discontinued\" or from being converted to \"any other use.\" DC Act Number 20-615. Contrary to Defendants' arguments that the \"RSSA's moratorium has been interpreted in similar ways since its enactment,\" the 2014-15 amendments are best interpreted to have expanded the limitations imposed by the RSSA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 11-12 (\"By this language the Act prohibits\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   kind of conversion to something less than a full service station.\") (quoting Opinions of the Corporation Counsel (Sept. 22, 1980), 1980 D.C. AG LEXIS 51, *2). A plain reading of the pre-2014 version of the RSSA alone makes this evident-the restrictions on\n   structurally altering, modifying, or converting the stations are limited only to those changes resulting in a \"non-full service facility.\" Defendants' own evidence supports this reading: as D.C.'s Corporation Counsel explained in 1981, \"[N]othing in [the RSSA] would prohibit one from razing a full service retail service station and simply going out of business.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 13 (quoting Opinions of the Corporation Counsel (Jan. 6, 1981), 1981 D.C.

Although this may be true in the abstract, the 2014-15 amendments at issue here were not so clearly connected to previous legislative goals so as to be reasonably factored into Plaintiffs' 2005 investment decision. The Act was intended to address a different concern from the initial RSSA and implied a fundamental shift in DC's regulatory goals: not simply to prevent the downgrading of full-service gas stations to non-full-service facilities, but to prevent the removal of gas stations from the District altogether. As explained above, the original RSSA was intended \"to stop the growing trend of converting stations to non-full service stations.\" MTD, Exh. 1 (1979 Committee Report);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672072,654135\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/198/874/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672072,654135\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/198/874/\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Exh. 2 (2004 Committee Report) at 3 (\"The Council first adopted the moratorium in response to the continuing trend away from full-service gas stations to non-full-service stations ...

Indeed, the City Council's discussion leading up to the permanent reauthorization of the RSSA focused exclusively on the benefits of the\n   <em>\n    full-service\n   </em>\n   components the moratorium would protect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2004 Report at 3 (\"The District's retail service station dealers support the moratorium on conversions ... [because] the economics of conversion favor the oil companies ... [as] [g]as station operators make less profit off gasoline sales than they do off of automotive repairs. . . [The RSSA] also benefits District residents by ensuring that they continue to have access to\n   <em>\n    full automotive services\n   </em>\n   at neighborhood gas stations.\") (emphasis added). The 2014 amendments, on the other hand, had a different objective-they modified the moratorium so as to prohibit a full-service retail station \"from going out of business and shutting the station down.\" Compl., Exh.
