(Throughout this Order, the court refers to LPI and force-placed insurance interchangeably.) Wieck claims Defendants overcharged her and improperly benefitted from the placement in violation of state and federal laws. Three sets of Defendants have filed Motions to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"). ECF Nos. 55, 56, 59.

Given the FAC's length and that it is very premature to address class matters, the court does not reiterate all the pertinent allegations of the FAC. Rather, the court focuses on factual allegations as to Wieck to examine whether she has alleged sufficient facts to withstand the Motions to Dismiss.

Further details are also provided in the appropriate discussion sections that follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For purposes of these Motions, the court assumes the following factual allegations are true.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Turner v.

Borrowers do not have to pay interest on their reverse mortgage loan and can live in their homes for life. A sale of the property can be used to repay the debt. The reverse mortgage loans are backed\n   by insurance from the Federal Housing Administration (\"FHA\"). When a loan comes due, the loan servicer can earn interest on the loan from the FHA by meeting deadlines for certain tasks such as getting an appraisal and starting the foreclosure process. If the loan servicer misses the FHA deadlines, the service is not entitled to earn interest from the FHA while waiting for the agency to pay its claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   FAC \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Traditionally, a reverse mortgage is meant to come due and payable when the resident dies.

FAC \u00b6\u00b6 67-69.

A at 3, ECF No. 15-1 (emphasis added). Wieck's theory is that CIT breached this provision because (although conceding that CIT generally had a right to procure hurricane insurance to protect the property) it was not \"necessary\" for it to charge her for amounts well in excess of what was required (the actual cost of insurance)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and for expenses unrelated to the insurance (such as unearned compensation or a portion of the premium paid to the insurer). She also alleges that it was not necessary for the forced-place insurance to be \"backdated\" or made \"retroactive\" to cover past periods of time during which no loss could have occurred because no hurricanes struck Hawaii during those periods. Further, she alleges it was not necessary to charge her a fee to inspect her property during the subsequent, wrongful, foreclosure process (as if the property was vacant) when she was still living in the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   This breach of contract claim is not preempted. At the first step of the analysis-as applied to Wieck's mortgage contract-it is not a type of state-law claim contemplated in \u00a7 560.2(b) as \"impos[ing] requirements\" on lending. Such a claim, for example, would not impose requirements on CIT as to (1) licensing, (2) the ability to require or obtain private mortgage insurance, (3) the terms of credit, (4) disclosure and advertising, or (5) loan processing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Instead, \"it is the parties' own agreement, rather than [Hawaii] state law, that imposes any requirements on [CIT].\"\n   <em>\n    Campidoglio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275417,12275421\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/963/\">\n    870 F.3d at 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a particular breach-of-contract claim under Washington law regarding contractual interest rates in a mortgage loan was not preempted by HOLA).

During oral argument, Wieck's counsel indicated that-if the court were to find any claims preempted by HOLA but limited such preemption to pre-February 28, 2014 conduct-she would request leave to file a second amended complaint to clarify whether or to what extent her claims are not preempted. The court agrees to such a request, and GRANTS leave to amend to allow Wieck to attempt to assert non-HOLA preempted chapter 480 claims.

The court disagrees, at least in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   As set forth earlier when discussing preemption, Wieck's theory is that when CIT force placed hurricane coverage and charged her account excessive premiums (including amounts paid by or to the insurance company or agent), it breached the mortgage contract because the contract only allows the lender to do what is \"necessary\" to protect the value of the mortgaged property. It was not \"necessary\" for CIT to charge her for amounts that exceeded the cost of hurricane insurance and for unrelated expenses. It was not necessary to include other amounts (alleged \"kickbacks\" or unearned \"commissions\") in the amount charged as an insurance premium. And it was not necessary for the force-placed insurance to be \"backdated\" or made \"retroactive\" to cover past periods when no hurricanes had occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   At this motion-to-dismiss stage, Wieck's breach-of-contract theory and chapter 480 claims based on affirmative misrepresentations are plausible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this regard, the court is convinced by the reasoning of cases such as\n   <em>\n    Perryman v.

It may well be that Wieck will only be able to prove a relatively small amount of damages, but at this stage, a minimal amount of damages is not a basis to dismiss the breach-of-contract or chapter 480 claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Compton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151809\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/1046/#p1053\">\n    761 F.3d at 1054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A plaintiff's 'allegation that he has, as a \"direct and proximate result\" of [defendant's] violation [of section 480-2 ], \"sustained special and general damages\" suffices to withstand a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).' \") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Jenkins v.

Defendants argue that procuring LPI \"retroactive\" to the date of the lapse is required and complies with Wieck's mortgage (and is thus not unfair or deceptive under chapter 480) because the mortgage and Fannie Mae guidelines require\n   <em>\n    continuous\n   </em>\n   coverage.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722241\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/601/#p612\">\n    735 F.3d at 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And \"continuous\" coverage necessarily means there are no lapses. It may take time for a lender or servicer to discover a lapse in coverage and give a borrower the necessary notice to cure the lapse before imposing LPI. \"Backdated\" coverage fills the gap in the event that property incurs insurable losses during lapses in coverage. Cases explain, for example, that a lender may have no way of knowing whether losses might have arisen during the lapsed period, such as latent damages like mold or structural issues with flood insurance.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cannon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203388222\">\n    2013 WL 3388222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (\"Plaintiffs failed to explain ... why it would be unreasonable to backdate flood insurance given that,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , some damage may not be readily apparent (such as mold).\");\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722241\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/601/#p612\">\n    735 F.3d at 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"How could [lenders] know-either in [borrower's] case or in the case of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   particular borrower-whether or not a property loss had occurred during the lapse period?\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The nature of LPI apparently is such that, once placed and \"backdated,\" it necessarily covers any losses (known or not) that may have\n   <em>\n    already\n   </em>\n   occurred during a lapsed period. And the alternative-disallowing retroactive LPI and requiring it to be charged and placed only from the date the lender or servicer\n   <em>\n    notifies\n   </em>\n   a borrower-could improperly create an incentive for borrowers not to insure property against hazards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   This argument that the mortgage contractually requires \"continuous\" coverage, however, is grounded in the mortgage documents themselves. In\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   , for example, the borrower signed a \"Notice of Fire/Hazard Insurance Requirements\" that explicitly stated \"The terms of our loan documents require maintenance of continuous insurance coverage.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722241\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/601/#p612\">\n    735 F.3d at 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But here, Wieck's mortgage does not itself explicitly require \"continuous\" coverage-it requires insurance to be \"maintained in the amounts, to the extent and for periods required by Lender,\" ECF No. 15-1, Mortg. \u00b6 3, with the qualification that \"Lender may do and pay whatever is necessary to protect the value of the Property[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Wieck, like the borrower in\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   , might have signed a similar \"Notice of Fire/Hazard Insurance Requirements\" document that made clear she was required to have \"continuous coverage.\" But if so, such a document is not before the court now. And the Fannie Mae guideline cited by CIT likewise does not explicitly require continuous coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 55-3 (providing in part only that \"[p]roperty insurance for home mortgages must protect against loss or damage from fire and other hazards covered by the standard extended coverage endorsement .... We will not accept hazard insurance policies that limit or exclude from coverage (in whole or in part) windstorm, hurricane, hail damages, or any other perils that are normally included under an extended coverage endorsement[.]\"). It may be implicit in the Fannie Mae guidelines that the coverage must be continuous (or another guideline may explicitly say so), but the record is not clear enough for the court to make that determination as a matter of law now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Moreover, Wieck has argued that the nature of\n   <em>\n    hurricane\n   </em>\n   insurance (in contrast\n   to other hazards such as floods or earthquakes, for example) might render it not \"necessary\" to impose coverage from the date of lapse-it is undisputed that no hurricanes struck Hawaii during the lapsed time periods (something that would be confirmable when coverage was placed).\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court, however, needs more information regarding the nature and limitations of LPI before it can fully assess whether hurricane insurance might be distinguishable from other types of hazard insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Defendants argue that \"[t]he Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which regulates mortgage servicing, has made clear that 'backdating' LPI is legal and proper.\" Seattle Specialty Mem. at 25 n.7, ECF No. 56-1 (citing\n   <em>\n    Mortg.

Count Four-Chapter 480 Claims as to Seattle Specialty and Lloyd's/Great Lakes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   For largely the same reasons that Wieck's chapter 480 claims survive CIT's Motion to Dismiss, they also survive Seattle Specialty and the Insurer Defendant's Motions. In this regard, the court recognizes that claims preempted by HOLA as to CIT are not preempted as to the other Defendants. For that reason, claims of deceptive or unfair practices based on\n   <em>\n    non-disclosure\n   </em>\n   of material information (as opposed to affirmative misrepresentation) may also be considered as to those Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Specifically, assuming as required at this stage that the FAC's well-pleaded factual allegations are true, Count Four alleges a plausible theory that Seattle Specialty, Lloyds, and Great Lakes committed unfair or deceptive acts that damaged Wieck. It alleges that the LPI insurance \"costs\" were high not because that \"actual cost\" was high, but \"because Financial Freedom had selected the significantly more expensive Lloyd's and Great Lakes polices in order to receive kickbacks, reinsurance profits and other wrongful benefits from Lloyd's and Great Lakes via Seattle Specialty.\" FAC \u00b6 163. That is, essentially, the higher the premium, the higher the \"compensation\" for placing the insurance. \"The insurance premiums were also inflated to pay for the kickbacks and other unlawful benefits that Lloyd's, Great Lakes and Seattle Specialty provided to Financial Freedom.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201758878\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   The FAC also alleges that these Insurer Defendants \"had a relationship with Financial Freedom,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161, whereby Wieck was not being charged the necessary \"cost\" of LPI (despite being told so) but instead was being charged the cost, plus other unnecessary amounts such as a \"commission\" (or \"kickback\" or remuneration).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 164. Even if it was explained to Wieck that CIT or its affiliates might receive \"compensation in connection with the placement\" of the LPI, ECF No. 55-4, it could be misleading and unfair for purposes of chapter 480 to then\n   <em>\n    charge\n   </em>\n   Wieck for that \"compensation\" by including it in the amounts represented to be a premium. That is, it is unclear at this stage whether this is allowed or \"necessary\" under the terms of the mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   As discussed previously, Defendants' arguments justifying or explaining the necessity of \"backdating\" LPI to prevent gaps in continuous coverage have considerable force-that is, such \"backdating\" may well be justified. The court, however, needs further information before it can fully address whether hurricane coverage must be \"continuous,\" and whether \"continuous\" coverage was actually (explicitly or implicitly) part of the mortgage documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Finally, in opposing Defendants' Motions, Wieck argues that it is an unfair or deceptive insurance practice to pay \"rebates\" or commissions, citing HRS \u00a7 431:13-108(8). Such a violation, Wieck apparently argues, would support her chapter 480 claim. The court, however, will not address this argument because the FAC does not actually allege a violation of Hawaii's insurance code (and does not mention a violation of \u00a7 431:13-103(8) ) as a basis for a chapter 480 claim. If Wieck intends to raise this theory, she must first allege facts supporting it in an amended complaint. And because the court has granted Wieck leave to amend her chapter\n   480 claims as to CIT, it will also allow Wieck to amend her chapter 480 claims as to the other Defendants to raise a theory based on \u00a7 431:13-103(8), if possible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   In short, although Defendants' Motions as to Count Four are DENIED, Wieck is nevertheless granted leave to amend Count Four to explain the basis of her claims in more detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

She acknowledges that the letters repeatedly notified her that (1) \"windstorm\" (sometimes referred to as \"windstorm (including hail/hurricane)\") was lacking and that such coverage would be placed, for the benefit of the lender, on the property, (2) she would be charged for the \"cost\" of the insurance, (3) Financial Freedom or its affiliates \"may receive compensation in connection with the placement\" of such insurance, and (4) the \"cost\" of such insurance \"may be significantly higher than the cost of such insurance purchased through your own agent or company.\" ECF No. 55-12 (emphasis omitted). Even if these letters contained misrepresentations or omitted material information (for example, that the \"cost\" of the insurance actually included commissions or \"kickbacks\" for placement), the notification letters themselves are inconsistent with a broader \"specific intent to\n   <em>\n    defraud.\n   </em>\n   \" They might be unfair or deceptive, but (without more) fall short of a plausible continuing scheme of\n   <em>\n    actual fraud.\n   </em>\n   This claim fails to meet Rule 9(b)'s particularity standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   Third, at least as to the insurer Defendants (Lloyd's and Great Lakes) and Seattle Specialty, the RICO claim fails for lack of proximate causation as to any foreclosure-related damages.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oki Semiconductor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11451733\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/298/768/#p773\">\n    298 F.3d at 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Some 'direct relationship' between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct is necessary.\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Holmes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6226783\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/258/#p268\">\n    503 U.S. at 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6226783\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/258/#p268\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Plaintiff's theory is that the high premiums assessed by Financial Freedom (with the involvement of other Defendants) led to Financial Freedom foreclosing on the property, which then led to an un-refunded $30 inspection fee and to consequential damages related to defending against the foreclosure. As to the insurer Defendants and Seattle Specialty, such damages-without more-are too attenuated to satisfy RICO's proximate cause requirement. These Defendants were not involved in the foreclosure, and the alleged scheme does not involve foreclosing on borrowers who do not pay any inflated premiums (these Defendants would not benefit from foreclosing on the mortgage).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Because Wieck fails to state a claim under \u00a7 1962(c), her claim under \u00a7 1962(d) for a\n   <em>\n    conspiracy\n   </em>\n   to violate \u00a7 1962(c) necessarily fails.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Howard v.
