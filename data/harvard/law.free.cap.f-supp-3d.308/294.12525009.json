Between 2011 and 2014, Donato submitted a series of document requests to various components of the Department of Justice under the Freedom of Information Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the FOIA\"), seeking records related to an alleged plot by an inmate housed at the Metropolitan Correction Center in New York (\"MCC New York\") to frame another inmate and a staff member of the Bureau of Prisons (\"BOP\") for conspiracy to commit murder. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 25, 29, 35.) Donato's document-request letters were addressed to the Executive Office for United States Attorneys (\"EOUSA\"), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\"), and BOP (collectively, \"Defendants\"), and by separate correspondence addressed only to BOP, Donato also sought records related to BOP's consideration of various statutory factors \"when making designation placement determinations for all [Donato's] prison transfers.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 10, 25, 29, 35, 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Donato has filed the instant four-count complaint to challenge (1) EOUSA's denial of his request for a fee waiver (Claim 1), (2) the FBI's refusal to confirm or deny the existence of any records regarding the\n   alleged murder-conspiracy plot (Claim 2), and (3) the adequacy of BOP's search for records in response to Donato's requests, and also that agency's invocation of certain FOIA exemptions to withhold records about the alleged murder-conspiracy plot (Claims 3 and 4). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 10-16.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before this Court at present is Defendants' collective motion for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Defs.' Mot.\"), ECF No. 18.) The motion argues that each of the defendant agencies, including BOP, conducted an adequate search for records and properly invoked any applicable FOIA exemptions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-13.) Defendants further maintain that EOUSA properly denied Donato's request for a public interest fee waiver because he failed to demonstrate the requisite ability to disseminate information to the public (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Reply in Support of Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 25, at 3-4), and the FBI properly refused to confirm or deny the existence of records responsive to Donato's murder-conspiracy plot request (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 13-25). Donato disputes these contentions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 23; Opp'n to Defs.' Reply in Support of Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 31, 2018, this Court issued an order\n   <strong>\n    GRANTING IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENYING IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' motion for summary judgment. The instant Memorandum Opinion explains the reasons for that order. In short, with respect to Donato's claim against EOUSA, this Court finds that EOUSA properly denied Donato's request for a fee waiver, but that EOUSA is nonetheless obliged to produce 100 pages of responsive records to Donato at no charge, and summary judgment cannot be entered in that agency's favor because it is not clear from the instant record that EOUSA has done so. The Court further finds that the FBI properly declined to confirm or deny the existence of records pertaining to the alleged murder-conspiracy plot, and is thus entitled to summary judgment, but BOP's declarations do not provide sufficient details regarding the searches that that agency conducted, or its invocation of FOIA exemptions, to warrant summary judgment at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Alleged MCC Murder-Conspiracy Plot\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Dominick Cicale is a former captain in the Bonanno organized crime family[,]\" who began cooperating with the government in 2006 with respect to its investigation and prosecution of members of the Bonanno and other organized crime families.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cicale\n   </em>\n   , No. 05-CR-60-2,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20388941\">\n    2018 WL 388941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 11, 2018). Cicale was incarcerated at MCC New York, and was a participant in BOP's Witness Security program (\"WitSec\"), during the cooperation period. While at MCC New York, Cicale purportedly ordered \"other WitSec inmates to create mischief in the unit\" by, for instance, spilling coffee on the floor prior to an inspection.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Basciano\n   </em>\n   , No. 03cr929,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20794945\">\n    2008 WL 794945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2008). In addition, and significantly for present purposes, in June of 2007, Cicale allegedly attempted to frame Vincent Basciano (another member of the Bonanno crime family) and a BOP Correctional Officer (Marco Santomaggio) by asking another inmate at MCC New York (Carlos Medina) to tell government attorneys that Santomaggio had hired him to kill Cicale on behalf of Basciano. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aff. of Mary Wade-Jones (\"Wade-Jones Aff.\"), Ex. 2 to Pl.'s Opp'n,\n   ECF No. 23-1 at 4-7, \u00b6\u00b6 5-6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. 11 to Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 23-1, at 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Instead of carrying out Cicale's nefarious request, Medina allegedly reported the plot to BOP Correctional Counselor Gloria Black, who prepared a memorandum regarding Cicale's alleged murder-conspiracy scheme. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wade-Jones Aff. \u00b6 6.) Approximately two months later, Black provided a copy of the memorandum to a BOP Special Investigative Supervisor (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 6-7), who then purportedly referred the matter only to BOP's internal affairs office, and did not \"refer the allegations regarding a possible murder plot to any other law enforcement agency such as the FBI[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Donato's FOIA Requests And Defendants' Pre-Litigation Responses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As mentioned, at issue in this opinion are FOIA requests that Donato made regarding two types of records: records concerning the murder-conspiracy scheme that Cicale allegedly orchestrated inside MCC New York, and separately, records documenting the factors that BOP took into account when it transferred Donato to various prisons within the federal system. Although Donato is a member of the same organized crime family as Cicale,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Donato v. United States\n   </em>\n   , No. 09cv5617,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204328368\">\n    2012 WL 4328368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 20, 2012), he does not allege anywhere in the instant complaint or other filings that he was\n   <em>\n    involved\n   </em>\n   in any way in Cicale's alleged murder-conspiracy plot or BOP's investigation of it; rather, it appears that Donato was engaged in the process of gathering information about the purported plot for other reasons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Donato sought these categories of records from different components of DOJ, as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Donato's Requests For Information Regarding The Murder-Conspiracy Plot\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Between 2011 and 2014, Donato submitted five substantively identical FOIA requests to agencies within DOJ: one to EOUSA, three to the FBI, and one to BOP. Each request sought records relating to Cicale's alleged scheme to frame Basciano and BOP Officer Santomaggio for conspiracy to commit murder. Specifically, Donato sought\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   all documents, e-mails, inter-office memos, including the Carlos Medina 7-page letter to BOP Counselor Gloria Black from the U.S. Attorney's Offices in the Southern District of NY and the Eastern District of NY pertaining to the Dominick Cicale plot to frame Vincent Basciano and BOP officer Santomaggio with the help of Carlos Medina in a phony murder conspiracy in the WitSec Unit at MCC Manhattan on or about June, 2007.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Ex. 1 to Compl., ECF No. 1-1 at 5 (\"EOUSA Murder-Conspiracy Plot Request\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. 10 to Compl., ECF No. 1-1 at 20 (\"First FBI Request\"); Ex. 12 to Compl., ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   No. 1-1 at 22-24 (\"Suppl.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 10). In subsequent correspondence, Donato clarified that he was seeking records from the United States Attorney's Offices in both the Southern District and the Eastern District of New York (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12), and thus, EOUSA separated his request into Request No. 11-2389 for the Southern District inquiry, and No. 11-2390 for the Eastern District request (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13). EOUSA found no responsive documents in the Southern District of New York (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14), but advised Donato that it had located 55 \"unindexed boxes of documents from this multi-defendant case [i.e., the\n   <em>\n    Basciano\n   </em>\n   case] that are potentially responsive\" to his request in the Eastern District of New York, each of which might contain 2,000 to 4,000 pages of records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 2.) EOUSA further informed Donato that completing its search for responsive records would take an additional 55 hours beyond the two free hours that the FOIA allots to each FOIA requester, and would therefore cost $1,540. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Donato requested a waiver of those fees, but EOUSA denied this request. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Donato then administratively appealed this denial to DOJ's Office of Information Policy (\"OIP\"), which concluded that EOUSA's denial of the fee waiver request was proper. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19, 21.) OIP remanded the matter to EOUSA with instructions for EOUSA to provide Donato with his \"statutory entitlement of 2 hours of search time and up to 100 pages of duplication without cost[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) At the time Donato filed his complaint, he had not received any documents in response to the EOUSA Murder-Conspiracy Plot Request. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Request Nos. 1175243-000 and 1286073-000 (The FBI Murder-Conspiracy Plot Requests)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Donato submitted his first FOIA request to the FBI (\"the First FBI Request\") on May 25, 2011, and the FBI assigned it Request No. 11752443-000. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-27.) As of the filing of the complaint in the instant case, Donato had not received any response to this request. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) Thereafter, on July 23, 2014, Donato submitted additional, substantively identical FOIA requests to two different FBI field offices (\"the Supplemental FBI Requests\"): one to the FBI Field Office in Albany, New York, and one to an FBI office in Manhattan. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) The FBI assigned Request No. 1286073-000 to both of the Supplemental FBI Requests, and it informed Donato that, because his requests pertained to third parties (Gloria Black, Carlos Medina, Dominick Cicale, Vincent Basciano, and Marco Santomaggio),\n   it would not process the request until Donato had submitted either \"(1) an authorization and consent from [each] individual; (2) proof of death; or (3) a justification that the public interest in disclosure outweighs personal privacy[.]\" (Compl. \u00b6 30.) The FBI further informed Donato that, in the absence of any of these items, it could neither confirm nor deny the existence of responsive records. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In response, Donato asserted that the privacy interests of those third parties \"were nullified because the names of those involved in the Cicale plot are public knowledge[,]\" given that Cicale and Media had testified in open court and the relevant events had been reported in newspapers and in published court opinions. (Compl. \u00b6 31.) Donato also insisted that \"[t]he public has an interest to know which of the government's informants perjured himself at trial ..., and why the government allowed this to take place without any ramifications to either informant.\" (Ex. 14 to Compl., ECF No. 1-1, at 28.) Donato further maintained that there is a public interest in knowing \"how the FBI and DOJ carried out their respective statutory duties to investigate and prosecute criminal conduct, i.e.[,] murder conspiracy and perjury.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The FBI stood firm, refusing to confirm or deny whether it had any responsive records, on the grounds that Donato had \" 'not sufficiently demonstrated that the public's interest in disclosure outweighs [the] personal privacy interests of the subject.' \" (Compl. \u00b6 32 (quoting Ex. 15 to Compl., ECF No. 1-1, at 29).) During the subsequent administrative appeal, OIP upheld the FBI's decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Request No. 2011-08565 (BOP Murder-Conspiracy Plot Request)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On May 31, 2011, Donato submitted a document request to BOP, seeking records related to the alleged murder-conspiracy plot, and BOP designated Donato's letter as Request No. 2011-08565. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35-36.) BOP located 225 pages of responsive records, and on September 28, 2011, it advised Donato that it was withholding all of the records in their entirety under Exemptions 2, 5, 6, 7(C), 7(D), 7(E), and 7(F). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) OIP affirmed BOP's withholding determination on appeal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Donato's Request For Information Regarding BOP's Placement Decisions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On March 2, 2014, Donato submitted a FOIA request to BOP seeking the worksheets that \"detail the BOP's assessment of the 5 factors of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203621\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) that the BOP must consider when making designation placement determinations for all his prison transfers\" (\"BOP Placement Request\").

Nor can BOP claim entitlement to summary judgment now, because the declarations that Defendants have submitted are manifestly insufficient to establish either that BOP's searches were adequate or that its withholdings are well-founded. Accordingly, Defendants' motion for summary judgment has been granted in part and denied in part, and the Order that accompanies this Memorandum Opinion provides a deadline\n   for the parties' submission of a proposed schedule for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Therefore, his contention falls well short of the applicable standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Donato also attempts to invoke the public domain doctrine (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 41-45), pursuant to which information otherwise exempt from disclosure \"lose[s its] protective cloak once disclosed and preserved in a permanent public record.\"\n   <em>\n    Cottone v.

His argument about the public nature of the requested information focuses entirely on what others have said about the murder-conspiracy plot-e.g., Cicale's and Medina's testimony in open court about the alleged plot (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 41), media coverage of the alleged plot and associated trial proceedings (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 41-42), and the discussion of the plot in court filings (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 42-43)-and Donato does not reference any statements from the FBI. To be sure, Donato points to documents that indicate that BOP or the \"Government\" generally investigated the alleged murder-conspiracy plot. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 45; Wade-Jones Aff. \u00b6 5.)

This Court rejects Donato's claim that EOUSA responded improperly regarding the fee waiver request, but the record herein is muddled as to whether or not EOUSA satisfied its obligation to provide Donato with 100 pages of records, and until the agency provides the necessary clarification, an award of summary judgment must be withheld.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Donato Has Not Demonstrated That He Is Able To Disseminate The Requested Records To The Public\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In order to be entitled to a public interest fee waiver for records requested under the FOIA, the requester must establish, first, that he does \"not have a commercial interest in the disclosure of the information sought[,]\"\n   <em>\n    Larson v.

And Donato has not provided any details about the\n   <em>\n    reach\n   </em>\n   of the Access Legal Aide website; indeed, the sole detail that Donato has offered is a link to Access Legal Aide's purported website (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Letters From Inside Email, Ex.

EOUSA's declarant indicates that the agency fulfilled this obligation and provided Donato with the records he requested (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Luczynski Decl. \u00b6 17); however, Donato maintains that he has received no such records (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 32-33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Importantly, careful scrutiny of the response letter that EOUSA sent to Donato following the administrative remand (which Donato claims not to have received), reveals that the agency's letter states that the subject matter of the request was \"Self-Anthony Donato[,]\" rather than records pertaining to Cicale's alleged murder-conspiracy scheme. (Ex. N to Luczynski Decl., ECF 18-5 at 38.) This suggests that the agency's free search time may have been misdirected. And the Luczynski Declaration adds to the confusion about EOUSA's purported search, because it states both that EOUSA searched for records regarding Donato himself\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that it \"searched for records from the case files related to the criminal prosecution case [that] the plaintiff identified.\" (Luczynski Decl. \u00b6 18.) Given the uncertainty in the current record regarding whether or not EOUSA has properly responded to the records request that Donato actually submitted, by providing him with two hours of search time and up to 100 pages of records responsive to his request for documents related to Cicale's alleged murder-conspiracy plot, this Court has no other option but to conclude that summary judgment is inappropriate at this juncture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Donato maintains that BOP conducted inadequate searches for records in response to his two FOIA requests\n   to that agency, and that BOP also improperly invoked FOIA Exemptions 2, 5, 6, 7(C), 7(D), 7(E), and 7(F) to withhold certain documents related to the alleged murder-conspiracy plot. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 35-52.) To be entitled to summary judgment with respect to the adequacy of its search, BOP must show that it made \"a good faith effort to conduct a search for the requested records, using methods which can be reasonably expected to produce the information requested.\"\n   <em>\n    Oglesby v.

And in this regard, BOP has submitted a declaration from John Wallace, a Senior Attorney with BOP, detailing the agency's response to Donato's request for records concerning the alleged murder conspiracy (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Wallace Decl.), and another declaration from Sandra Raymond, a Government Information Specialist in BOP's General Counsel's FOIA/Privacy Act Section, explaining the agency's response to Donato's request for his placement records (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Raymond Decl.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Neither of these declarations is sufficient to support an award of summary judgment in BOP's favor. To begin with, each declaration is utterly silent as to the scope or method of the search that BOP staff conducted, nor do the declarants reveal the search terms used. Moreover, there is also no indication of the agency's reasons for believing that responsive records would likely be found in the places where it searched. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wallace Decl. \u00b6 5 (stating that the declaration \"will provide the Court and Mr. Donato with an explanation of ... the procedures used to review and process the responsive records,\" but not actually providing any such explanation); Raymond Decl. \u00b6 6 (noting that staff at FCI Sandstone \"detailed their search of Mr. Donato's Inmate Central File\" in an email, without describing the contents of that email or attaching it to the declaration). Thus, the statements that BOP has submitted themselves provide no basis whatsoever for any determination that BOP's searches for records were reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weisberg v.

Certain portions of the Wallace Declaration refer simply to \"pages\" that BOP has produced or withheld-pages that are identified solely by Bates number. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Wallace Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 24, 35.)

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The agencies' different responses to Donato's substantively similar FOIA requests have demanded different legal analyses that, not surprisingly, lead to different results. Defendants have established that they are entitled to summary judgment on the claims that Donato asserts against the FBI, because that agency appropriately issued a Glomar response with respect to Donato's requests for materials pertaining to Cicale's alleged murder plot. Defendants have also established that EOUSA properly denied Donato's fee waiver request, but Defendants have not shown that EOUSA spent at least two hours searching for records regarding the alleged murder-conspiracy plot, or that it produced 100 pages of records to Donato at no cost, nor have they demonstrated that BOP conducted a reasonable search for records, or made proper withholdings, regarding either FOIA request that Donato submitted to that agency. Accordingly, as reflected in the prior Order, Defendants' motion for summary judgment has been\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   . An Order setting a deadline for Defendants to submit a proposed schedule for further proceedings will issue separately.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Page number cited herein refer to those that the Court's electronic case filing system automatically assigns.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Donato's interest in the subject appears to relate to his own conviction for murder in aid of racketeering, which resulted from the same organized-crime prosecution that had landed Vincent Basciano in prison.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v. Basciano\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223254\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/599/184/#p194\">\n     599 F.3d 184\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 194-95 (2d Cir. 2010) (noting that superseding indictment named Basciano and Donato, among others, as co-defendants). The instant records requests seem to be part of Donato's effort to get his conviction overturned by unearthing damaging information about the 'snitch' who had given him up to the government (Cicale), as evidenced by various other court filings and proceedings. That is, during the same time that Donato was using the FOIA to gather records about Cicale's alleged murder-conspiracy scheme, he was also litigating a habeas petition that alleged, among other things, that his guilty plea \"was obtained involuntarily\" because \"the government failed to disclose\" records about Cicale's plot in the context of the plea negotiations-records that Donato claimed he could have used such to impeach Cicale's credibility if he had gone to trial.\n    <em>\n     Donato\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204328368\">\n     2012 WL 4328368\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Donato presumably requested records from BOP because BOP officials investigated Cicale's alleged plot and had generated at least one memorandum on the subject, as mentioned above. Furthermore, it was reasonable to assume that EOUSA had documents regarding the events at issue, because after his racketeering conviction, Basciano had unsuccessfully moved for a new trial on the grounds that the U.S. Attorney's Office had withheld material information about Cicale's prison plot that Basciano could have used to attack Cicale's credibility during trial.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v. Basciano\n    </em>\n    , No. 03-CR-929,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203325409\">\n     2010 WL 3325409\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 19, 2010).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Although Donato's complaint does not expressly challenge the adequacy of BOP's search for records responsive to his request for information about Cicale's alleged scheme, he makes such a challenge in his opposition (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n at 20-21), and because he is proceeding pro se, this Court will consider the merits of that claim.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Crawford v.

Cir. 2017). Similarly, the Court will consider the complaint's representation that \"EOUSA has failed to respond\" to Donato's request for two hours of search time and 100 pages (Compl. \u00b6 24), and will evaluate that allegation separate and apart from the complaint's challenge to that agency's fee-waiver determination, even though Donato has omitted the two-free-search-hours allegation from the count that assigns error to EOUSA's fee-waiver decision (\n    <em>\n     see id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 57-65).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    In the FBI's declaration, Hardy admits that the FBI mistakenly construed Donato's first request for records as one seeking records\n    <em>\n     about Donato himself\n    </em>\n    .
