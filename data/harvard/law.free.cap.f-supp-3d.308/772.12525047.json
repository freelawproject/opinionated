NATHAN, District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On March 1, 2018, Petitioner Perez Chocho filed a petition seeking a writ of habeas corpus ordering Respondents to release him or provide him with a bond hearing. Pet. \u00b6 1. On March 9, 2018, the Court ordered Respondents to file a return by March 21, 2018, showing cause why the\n   writ of habeas corpus should not be granted. Dkt. No. 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On March 20, 2018, the Court received a letter from Respondents stating that Petitioner was released from custody on March 19, 2018 and granted a one-year administrative stay of removal. Dkt. No. 13. In light of Petitioner's release from detention, Respondents request that this Court dismiss the action as moot. Dkt. No. 13. Petitioner opposes that request. Dkt. No. 15. For the reasons explained below, the Court dismisses the action as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Petitioner is a citizen of Ecuador and has resided in the United States since 2003. Pet. \u00b6 17. He has a six-year-old daughter who is a United States citizen. Pet. \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 29, 2003, Petitioner was ordered removed by the San Antonio Immigration Court. Pet. \u00b6 22. Petitioner was unaware of the removal order until 2013, when he contacted an attorney to represent him on immigration matters. Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 23-25. On December 18, 2013, Petitioner surrendered to ICE. Pet. \u00b6 26. ICE released Petitioner pursuant to an Order of Supervision. Pet. \u00b6 27. For the next three years, Petitioner attended regular check-ins with ICE. Pet. \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Petitioner attended check-ins with ICE on March 16, 2017, and May 25, 2017. Pet. \u00b6 32. At a check-in on August 29, 2017, Petitioner was arrested, and was detained until March 19, 2018. Pet. \u00b6 34; Dkt. No. 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 15, 2017, Petitioner moved the San Antonio Immigration Court to reconsider its 2003 removal order. Pet. \u00b6 31. The San Antonio Immigration Court denied that motion on June 21, 2017, and Petitioner appealed that decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) on July 13, 2017. Pet. \u00b6 33. On November 17, 2017, the BIA remanded Petitioner's case to the San Antonio Immigration Court to consider new evidence submitted on appeal. Pet. 39. The San Antonio Immigration Court issued an order on February 16, 2018 denying the motion to reopen proceedings. Pet. 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 21, 2017, Petitioner filed a motion for a bond hearing with the New York Immigration Court. Dkt. No. 8, Ex. 2 \u00b6 11. The Immigration Court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over a bond hearing because Petitioner was subject to an administratively final order of removal. Pet. \u00b6 43. On February 15, 2018, Petitioner filed a second motion for bond with the New York Immigration Court based on\n   <em>\n    Lora v. Shanahan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356006\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/601/\">\n    804 F.3d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2015), and in the alternative,\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas v.

Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 45, 49; Dkt. No. 8, Ex. 2 \u00b6 13. On March 1, 2018, the Immigration Court held a hearing and denied bond because it concluded that it had no jurisdiction to consider the bond application. Pet. \u00b6 46. On March 1, 2018, Petitioner submitted a written request for ICE to reconsider Petitioner's custody status. Pet. \u00b6 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Petitioner has submitted an application for U Nonimmigrant Status, and on March 1, 2018, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) found that Petitioner was prima facie eligible for U Nonimmigrant Status. Pet. \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 1, 2018, Petitioner also filed a petition seeking a writ of habeas corpus. Pet. \u00b6 1. He requested a writ of habeas corpus directing Respondents to bring Petitioner to Court and explain why Petitioner should not be released from custody; issue a declaratory judgment that Petitioner's mandatory detention violates his statutory and constitutional rights; direct Respondents to release Petitioner or provide him with a bond hearing; and award Petitioner all costs in maintaining the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On March 19, 2018, Petitioner was released from custody and granted a one-year administrative stay of removal. Dkt. No. 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"In order to satisfy the case-or-controversy requirement [of Article III], a party must, at all stages of the litigation, have an actual injury which is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752951\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/475/468/#p478\">\n    475 F.3d 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 478-79 (2d Cir. 2007). The petition for habeas corpus requests that Respondents release Petitioner or provide him with a bond hearing. Pet. 1. Since the filing of the petition, Petitioner has been released. Following his release from custody, Petitioner \"is no longer suffering an 'actual injury.\" '\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leybinsky v. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=553%20Fed.%20Appx.%20108\">\n    553 Fed.Appx. 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 109 (2d Cir. 2014). Petitioner has received the relief that was sought in the habeas petition, so the action is now moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martin-Trigona v. Shiff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1847843,6126237\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/702/380/\">\n    702 F.2d 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 386 (2d Cir. 1983) (\"The hallmark of a moot case or controversy is that the relief sought can no longer be given or is no longer needed.\"). Despite Petitioner's argument to the contrary,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 15, his request for a declaratory judgment does not change that conclusion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Velvet Underground v. Andy Warhol Found., for the Visual Arts, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4274444\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/890/398/#p403\">\n    890 F.Supp.2d 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 403 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (\"As with any federal action, courts may not entertain actions for declaratory judgment 'when the parties are asking for an advisory opinion, when the question sought to be adjudicated has been mooted by subsequent developments, and when there is no standing to maintain the action.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Flast v.

Kemna,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503101\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/1/#p7\">\n    523 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503101\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/1/#p7\">\n    118 S.Ct. 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503101\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/1/#p7\">\n    140 L.Ed.2d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998). Petitioner contends that there is a live controversy because Respondents have promised to re-arrest Petitioner and hold him without bond if USCIS denies his petition for a U Visa. Dkt. No. 15 at 1. However, any continuing injury would result from the removal order,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leybinsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=553%20Fed.%20Appx.%20108\">\n    553 Fed.Appx. at 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The only consequence Leybinsky fears-future detention-is a consequence of his final order of removal, not of his most recent detention.\"), and this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear any challenge to the removal order,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   For similar reasons, Petitioner's invocation of the \"voluntary cessation\" exception to mootness doctrine is unavailing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 15 at 2-4. It \"is well settled that a defendant's voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice.\"\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p189\">\n    528 U.S. 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 189,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p189\">\n    120 S.Ct. 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p189\">\n    145 L.Ed.2d 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). However, the Government may overcome the exception and demonstrate mootness by showing that \"(1) there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur and (2) interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.\"\n   <em>\n    MHANY Mgmt., Inc. v.

As stated above, ICE's release of Petitioner \"eradicated\" the alleged violation. Although Petitioner insists that he may be re-arrested if his U Nonimmigrant Status petition is denied, Dkt. No. 15 at 3, the Stay of Removal\n   is in effect for one year from March 16, 2018, Dkt. No. 15, Ex. 2, and \"[t]he mere potentiality that Petitioner may be re-detained because [ ]he is under a removal order is insufficient to warrant this Court's retention of jurisdiction over the case,\"\n   <em>\n    Pierre-Paul v.
