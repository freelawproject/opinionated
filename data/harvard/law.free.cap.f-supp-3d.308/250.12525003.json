Statutory Framework\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 1978, Congress passed the Ethics in Government Act (\"EIGA\"), which, in pertinent part, imposes financial disclosure obligations on individuals holding or seeking certain public offices.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   5 U.S.C. app. 4 \u00a7\u00a7 101 - 11 (2016). For presidential candidates, fulfilling the EIGA's requirements involves filing a financial disclosure report with the Federal Election Commission (\"FEC\"), which then transmits the report to the Director of the Office of Government Ethics (\"OGE\").\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 103(c), (e); Def.'s Mot. at 3; U.S. Office of Gov't Ethics,\n   <em>\n    Presidential Candidates\n   </em>\n   , https://www.oge.gov/web/oge.nsf/Presidential% 20Candidates?OpenView (last visited Apr. 9, 2018). Section 105 of the EIGA establishes the minimal requirements for members of the public to obtain copies of these reports through \"written application,\" with certain limitations on their use. 5 U.S.C. app. 4 \u00a7 105. If an individual who is required to make financial disclosures under the EIGA \"knowingly and willfully falsifies or ... knowingly and willfully fails to file or report any information\" required by the EIGA, the Attorney General may file suit and may be permitted to recover a civil penalty.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 104(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Executive Branch personnel who must file the above-described report do so through an OGE Form 278e.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 3; Def.'s Ex. 1, ECF No. 20-1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The pertinent portion of this form is \"Part 8,\" where the reporting individual is required to list certain financial liabilities.

With regard to the filer's own liabilities, the statutory bases for this instruction are 5 U.S.C. app. 4 \u00a7 102(a) &amp; (a)(4), which specify that the EIGA report must include \"a full and complete statement\" as to \"[t]he identity and category of value of the total liabilities owed to any creditor other than a spouse, or a parent, brother, sister, or child of the reporting individual or of the reporting individual's spouse which exceed $10,000 at any time during the preceding calendar year,\" subject\n   to certain exclusions.

Plaintiff argues in effect that OGE guidance did require reporting of a defined set of unrelated business liabilities, but because \"none of the business liabilities listed in Part 8 were unrelated to the operations of that business entity,\" Defendant should not have reported any liabilities (here, business liabilities) except personal liabilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-34. The Court has found that the applicable statutory and regulatory provisions do not prohibit the President from disclosing non-personal liabilities together with his personal liabilities. Plaintiff's discussion of the OGE guidance does not alter that assessment, nor save Plaintiff from its consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In response to the parties' various points about enforcement, the Court notes that the statutory scheme is not without mechanisms for holding the putative errant filer to account. The Attorney General has authority to sue for certain false or deficient reports provided that the filer had the requisite scienter. 5 U.S.C. app. 4 \u00a7\u00a7 104(a). Moreover, OGE has a role in reviewing submitted reports and can refer a filer whom OGE has \"reasonable cause to believe\" fits the aforementioned profile to the Attorney General for prosecution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 104(b). There is no indication that either OGE or the Attorney General sought enforcement in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Declaratory Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As it did with mandamus jurisdiction, the Court also considers declaratory relief only to the extent necessary to determine whether Plaintiff's grievance is redressable and consequently accords him standing. The Declaratory Judgment Act provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   In a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction ... any court of the United States ... may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought. Any such declaration shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree and shall be reviewable as such.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (2016).
