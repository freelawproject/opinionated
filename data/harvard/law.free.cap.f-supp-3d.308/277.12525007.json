MCFADDEN, United State District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before the Court is an Application for a Preliminary Injunction filed by the Plaintiff Beacon Associates, Inc. Beacon alleges that the Defendant Apprio, Inc. solicited Beacon's employees in violation of a contract between the parties, and then terminated that contract without legal justification, destroying Beacon's ability to compete in a pending government contract competition. For the reasons that follow, I conclude that Beacon has met the high standards for imposition of a preliminary injunction, and will issue a corresponding order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Preliminary Findings of Fact\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Beacon has been a subcontractor under Apprio's prime contract with the Federal\n   Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) since 2014, \"providing approximately [40 employees] to support the training [efforts] at FEMA's Center for Domestic Preparedness [FEMA Center] at Fort McClellan in Anniston, Alabama.\" Compl. 1. From 2009 to 2014, Beacon held the prime contract for these services, but graduated from the qualifying program for \"small disadvantaged businesses\" before \"FEMA re-competed the [contract] in late 2013 and early 2014.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3-5. Beacon therefore teamed with Apprio to win the follow-on contract, \"in exchange for a share of 49% of the work as a subcontractor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. On January 16, 2018, FEMA issued a \"sources sought\" notice, a \"Request for Information\" (RFI), and a \"draft Performance Work Statement,\" giving formal notice that competition for the follow-up FEMA Center contract was about to begin. Declaration of Carol Koffinke, Application for Preliminary Injunction Ex. 2 \u00b6 39-41 (Koffinke Decl.); Koffinke Decl. Ex. 11. Because neither Apprio or Beacon will qualify as a prime contractor in the next round,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47, each is searching for a new contracting partner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 43-47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Fall 2017 Dispute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For approximately the first three years of the subcontract, Beacon routinely paid for Other Direct Costs (ODCs), \"such as conference expenses, bus transportation, overtime and incidental supplies and equipment.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 43, 75. These ODCs were submitted as invoices from third party vendors, who were often engaged by Apprio without Beacon's prior knowledge. Koffinke Decl. \u00b6 22. To get reimbursed after paying an ODC invoice, \"Beacon would in turn submit an invoice for the ODCs to Apprio plus 1% [General and Administrative costs], and then Apprio would in turn pass Beacon's invoice directly to FEMA for payment before paying Beacon's invoice.\" Koffinke Decl. \u00b6 22. Beacon allegedly paid an average of about $30,000 to $35,000 in ODCs per month, until \"emergencies caused by Hurricanes Harvey, Maria[,] and Irma\" caused FEMA's ODC expenses to rise dramatically in late 2017. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 76-80. When Beacon began receiving larger invoices from a bus company named Cline Tours, some of which \"were in excess of $200,000,\" Beacon asked Apprio to pay some of the invoices. Koffinke Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-35. Apprio initially assented, and paid two of the Cline Tours invoices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   But the parties eventually became frustrated about the issue. Apprio's president, Darryl Britt, sent an email to Beacon's president, Carol Koffinke on November 7, 2017, expressing \"concern[ ] that Beacon has not made the payments for the ODC's for FEMA's surge.\" Koffinke Decl. Ex. 8 at 2. In part because \"Beacon has been able to make payments to date, with the exception of the recent invoices that Apprio paid upon Beacon's request,\" Mr. Britt stated that \"[i]t was not [Apprio's] intention to take over full payment of ODC's,\" and Apprio did \"not consider the payments terms to Beacon to be onerous, nor abnormal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In response, Ms. Koffinke said that Apprio had \"[a]pparently ... received a [modification] to support the hurricane effort that I am guessing\n   was somewhere between $1.5M and $2M of ODC's,\" without ever informing Beacon or modifying the Apprio-Beacon subcontract accordingly.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Ms. Koffinke said that \"[h]ad the communication and contract administration been handled correctly ... we could have worked something out.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She emphasized that Beacon had \"no contractual obligation to pay for the ODC's on this [modification],\" and told Mr. Britt that \"our contract for this Option Year had zero dollars funded for ODC's.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Koffinke avers that \"Apprio never responded,\" and that \"[a]fter November, Beacon paid other ODC invoices in line with past practice ... without any further comment from Apprio.\" Koffinke Decl. \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Relevant Contractual Provisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Under the prime contract between Apprio and FEMA, ODCs were to be \"Incrementally Funded,\" and ODCs had $650,000 budgeted in each option year of the potential four-year contract. Koffinke Decl. Ex. 1 at B-4. Under the subcontract between Apprio and Beacon, Koffinke Decl. Ex. 2 (Subcontract), Beacon was \"not authorized to perform Services, make expenditures or incur obligations which exceed the costs as set forth in Appendix B, plus travel and other direct costs that are pre-approved by Apprio and funded through a separate modification.\" Subcontract \u00a7 5.2. Under Appendix B to the subcontract, Beacon was obligated to \"satisfy ODC requirements as identified by Work Orders which are authorized by the customer.\" Subcontract App. B at \u00a7 2.2. Section 2 also said that \"other direct costs ... shall be funded through purchase orders, pursuant to Section 5.2 of this Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 2. Modification 9 to the contract between Apprio and Beacon, which covered Option Year 3 (from March 15, 2017 to March 14, 2018), stated that \"ODCs are not included in the [budgeted] amounts and will be reimbursed at cost plus 1% additional for General &amp; Administrative costs.\" Koffinke Decl. Ex. 3 at 2. In September 2017, FEMA twice modified its prime contract with Apprio, adding $231,257.50 and then $1,780,000.00 for ODCs. Koffinke Decl. Exs. 5-6. This totaled slightly over 2 million dollars in ODC funding in the prime contract for Option Year 3 alone, whereas the amount had previously been only $650,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The subcontract also prohibited solicitation of the parties' employees:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   During the term of this agreement and thereafter for a period of one (1) year, both the Subcontractor and Contractor shall not directly, for its own account or for the account of any other individual, corporation, partnership, association or firm, induce or attempt to induce any employee of the other party to leave his or her employment with the applicable party. This does not include individuals responding to media advertised employment opportunities or any individual who makes an unsolicited direct contact with a Party regarding employment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Subcontract App. A, \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Apprio Offers Retention Bonuses and Contingent Offer Letters to Beacon's Staff\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   About two weeks after FEMA released the contract competition notices, Mr. Britt sent an email to Carol Koffinke dated January 30, 2018, informing her that in \"planning for the recompete of [FEMA Center] and now that the RFI is on the street,\" Mr. Bitt had offered \"retention bonuses\" to the \"entire contract team.\" Koffinke Decl. Ex. 11. According to Ms. Koffinke, these bonuses were in the amount of $500. Koffinke Decl. \u00b6 47. Mr. Britt's email said: \"I want to make sure you are informed as some have already signed the paperwork I provided to them.\" Koffinke Decl. Ex. 11. Mr. Britt explained: \"I heard through the\n   grapevine that Beacon was not pursuing the contract, hence I figured it was of little consequence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Apprio admits that it provided what it describes as \"contingent offer letters\" to \"Beacon's staff on the [FEMA Center] Project.\" Opp. 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Apprio Terminates the Subcontract with Beacon\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Less than a month later, on February 27, 2018, Apprio terminated its subcontract with Beacon. Koffinke Decl. Ex. 14. The termination notice required Beacon's employees to stop work immediately, and stated that \"Beacon [had] committed material breaches\" by failing to pay two American Coach bus line invoices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Beacon claims that it did not receive these invoices until the termination. Second Declaration of Carol Koffinke \u00b6\u00b6 1-3, Pl.'s Reply, ECF No. 12-1 (Second Koffinke Decl.). The notice also relied on \"the material breaches described in the November Letter,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , referring to a letter dated November 24, 2017, and attached to the termination notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Koffinke Decl. Ex. 16. The November Letter-drafted by Apprio's attorney and addressed to Ms. Koffinke-claimed to be in response to her exchange with Mr. Britt regarding whether Beacon was required to pay for ODCs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The letter argued that Beacon was contractually obligated to pay ODCs if \"authorized by the customer,\" and that the issue of whether \"Beacon's contract for the current option year of the Subcontract ... [had] any funding for ODCs[ ] is irrelevant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Given Apprio's payment of some ODC invoices from Cline Tours, the letter stated that \"Beacon is currently in default,\" and that \"Apprio affirmatively reserves its rights to seek any remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Beacon asserts that it never received the November Letter until it was attached to the termination notice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After the termination notice on February 27, 2018, Beacon's 40 FEMA Center employees began working for Apprio the very next day, on February 28, 2018. Apprio claims that on the afternoon of February 27\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , following the termination, \"Beacon employees began\n   <em>\n    en masse\n   </em>\n   to apply for job openings on Apprio's website. Consequently, Apprio hired such Beacon employees to continue to staff and fulfill Apprio's obligations.\" Declaration of Darryl Britt \u00a7 16, Def.'s Opp., ECF No. 10-2 (Britt Decl.). The termination occurred approximately two weeks before March 14, 2018, when FEMA formally exercised \"the fourth and final option in the prime contract, extending Apprio's [prime] contract until March 14, 2019.\" Under past practice, (and, Beacon alleges, the subcontract's plain language\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ), Apprio would have extended Beacon's contract for that year as well unless the termination occurred.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Beacon alleges that Apprio breached the subcontract in two ways: soliciting Beacon's employees, and terminating the contract without legal justification. Beacon seeks a preliminary injunction that would \"immediately: (1) reinstate and restore the parties' subcontract through March 14, 2019; and (2) enjoin Apprio from employing or attempting to employ Beacon's employees in violation of Appendix A, Section 5 of the subcontract.\" Application 25.

The \"material breaches\" that Apprio cited in terminating the subcontract, Koffinke Decl. Ex. 14, if breaches at all, were certainly not material.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Under Delaware law, whether a breach is material is a question \"of degree[,] and is determined by weighing the consequences in the light of the actual custom of men in the performance of [similar] contracts.\"\n   <em>\n    BioLife Sols., Inc. v.

June 29, 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Apprio's termination notice primarily relied on Beacon's failure to pay two American Coach invoices totaling $12,830.20. Koffinke Decl. Ex. 14 (the invoices were for $8,422.20 and $4,408.00, respectively). But the evidence currently supports Ms. Koffinke's claim that it never even received these invoices until the termination. The invoices were addressed to a \"Charlies Williams\" at \"BEACON ASSOCIATES,\" but at a Government address. Koffinke Decl. Ex. 15, Second Koffinke Decl. \u00b6 3. No person named \"Charlie Williams\" has worked at Beacon Associates. Second Koffinke Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-3. Apprio's Controller was notified about the unpaid invoices by Dorothy Ping, one of Apprio's employees, who told him that \"American Coach ... resent statements to\n   <em>\n    us\n   </em>\n   from September 2017.\" Opp. Ex. G (emphasis added); Koffinke Decl. Ex. 7 (identifying Marvin Huber as the \"Controller\" of Apprio). And Kristi Ledbetter, Beacon's former Deputy Project Manager (now working the same job for Apprio) spends three paragraphs explaining that she was aware of the Cline Tours invoices, but conspicuously fails to mention any knowledge of the American Coach invoices. Declaration of Kristi Ledbetter \u00b6\u00b6 8-10, Opp., ECF No. 10-3 (Ledbetter Decl.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   And even if Beacon received the American Coach invoices, failure to pay them was not a material breach, justifying immediate termination of the subcontract. For one thing, Apprio could have easily asked Beacon for prompt payment. Mr. Tom Buzan, Apprio's Project Manager on the FEMA Center contract, says that he learned about the unpaid American Coach invoices from American Coach directly \"[i]n or around early February 2018.\" Declaration of Tom Buzan \u00a7 12, Opp., ECF No. 10-4 (Buzan Decl.). Mr. Buzan then \"informed Apprio management of this issue,\" not Beacon.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%202580572\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 13. Second, Apprio had already been reimbursed for the expenses by its client, meaning that it had the funds to pay the invoices itself. Ms. Ping's email indicates that Apprio had already sent invoices to FEMA for the American Coach amounts, meaning that Apprio had probably already received those amounts within a few months of September 2017, and certainly before February 2018.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%202580572\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Reply 6 n.3. Because Apprio terminated Beacon's contract while the invoices remained outstanding, it has since presumably paid the invoices itself, further demonstrating its ability to pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Koffinke Decl. Ex. 14. Finally, the\n   insignificant amount of the American Coach invoices-totaling less than $13,000, when Apprio had recently received FEMA contract modifications providing over $2 million in ODC funding-also indicates that any American Coach breach was immaterial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The termination notice also cites as \"material breach[ ]\" Beacon's failure in November 2017 to pay the significantly larger Cline Tours invoices. Koffinke Decl. Ex. 14 at 2. But the weight of the evidence indicates that the Cline Tours invoices presented no material issue in February 2018. Apprio had voluntarily paid two Cline Tours invoices at Beacon's request, although the parties later disputed whose contractual duty was being discharged. Koffinke Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-35. Beacon then paid the remaining invoices without further discussion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%202580572\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 38. Apprio challenges this conclusion, citing the November Letter and Mr. Britt's statement that he terminated the contract because of Beacon's \"repeated failure to fulfill its obligations,\" and broader concerns about the FEMA Center project. Op. 17-18. But Mr. Britt had guaranteed ODC funding from FEMA exceeding $2 million in Option Year 3, but apparently did not inform Beacon of these monies, undermining his claim that he was truly worried about Beacon's timely ODC payments. Koffinke Decl. Exs. 5-6; Koffinke Decl. Ex. 8. And the November Letter said nothing about invoices that\n   <em>\n    remained\n   </em>\n   unpaid. Instead it said that although Apprio had already paid the Cline Tours invoices, Beacon was somehow \"currently in default.\" Koffinke Decl. Ex. 14. Weighing the evidence, Beacon appears likely to succeed on the merits of this issue. Invoices that have already been paid in full do not constitute a current or ongoing breach of contract-much less a\n   <em>\n    material\n   </em>\n   breach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In sum, Apprio's stated reasons for terminating the subcontract-unpaid third-party invoices totaling less than $13,000, and larger invoices that had already been paid in full-did not constitute a material breach of this multi-million-dollar contract.

In view of the full record, Apprio's grounds for termination were thin and pretextual. I find that any breach was not material, or at least that Beacon is likely to prevail on this point.

On January 30, 2018, Mr. Bitt offered \"retention bonuses\" to the \"entire contract team,\" along with paperwork that some Beacon employees immediately signed. Koffinke Decl. Ex. 11.

Not so: the letters had a very immediate effect. Addressed to Beacon's employees, the letters said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    Contingency(ies):\n   </strong>\n   Your acknowledgment of this offer authorizes Apprio, Inc.

But Beacon\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   suffered damages, as will be discussed in more detail below. As a direct result of Mr. Britt's solicitation on January 30, 2018, \"Beacon could not even use its own workforce in its proposal from the new [FEMA Center] contract,\" or discuss FEMA Center operations with its staff, \"thereby handicapping Beacon's ability to develop a competitive proposal.\" Pl.'s Reply 16 (Reply).

In fact, Apprio says that its own Contractor Performance Assessment Report \"could be adversely affected by Beacon's breaches of the parties' Subcontract,\" implicitly conceding that a major subcontractor's past performance matters. Opp. 11 n.1. Accordingly, Beacon has made a strong showing of likely irreparable harm to its reputation in the absence of an injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Beacon's second winning argument is that without a preliminary injunction restoring the terminated subcontract and its poached employees, Beacon will be almost entirely unable to compete for the renewed FEMA Center contract as part of a contract team. During the life of this litigation, Beacon will be deprived of its entire FEMA Center workforce. Without\n   those incumbent employees, and their institutional knowledge and reputation, Beacon will be at a strategic disadvantage in finding a contracting partner, and competing for the next award of the contract. Apprio, in turn, will receive a strategic advantage, with Beacon's 40 incumbent employees sitting on Apprio's contracting 'resume' along with Apprio's own incumbent FEMA Center workforce. No other federal contractor besides Apprio-including Beacon-will likely be able to offer FEMA the option of hiring incumbent employees. And because Beacon has been terminated for default, Beacon will be considered \"toxic\" in an award competition.

The final solicitation of proposals will likely be released in April, May, or June 2018, Koffinke Decl. \u00a7 41, and the initial RFI suggests that final proposals will be due approximately 45 days thereafter. Koffinke Decl. Ex. 9 at 3. Contractors begin working on contract proposals as soon as an initial RFI is released, meaning that Beacon's competitors have been looking for teaming partners since January 2018. Koffinke Decl. \u00a7 42;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Koffinke Decl.

Beacon cannot even enter the race. Without its incumbent workforce, and with the black mark of default on its current record, Beacon cannot effectively compete with Apprio or secure a teaming partner in the competition. And losing the FEMA Center contract would be a great loss to Beacon, as no party disputes. The subcontract represents 16% of Beacon's business, and millions of dollars in contract funds. Koffinke Decl. \u00a7 71; Koffinke Decl. Exs. 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The injury is also irreparable, absent an injunction. Beacon's loss of the follow-on FEMA Center contract is likely reducible to a dollar figure, and economic damages ordinarily do not constitute irreparable harm unless \"it threatens the very existence of [a plaintiff's] business.\"\n   <em>\n    Patriot, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 963 F.Supp. at 5 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A 16% decrease in business, without more, cannot demonstrate a threat to Beacon's very existence.

Under Subcontract Appendix A \u00a7 16, neither party can recover for \"special, consequential, indirect, or punitive damages,\" including \"lost profits, lost revenues ...

In\n   <em>\n    Armour\n   </em>\n   , the D.C. Circuit found irreparable harm where a challenged agency regulation would have forced the plaintiff to either \"grossly misbrand[ ]\" its moisture-added \"genuine ham as IMITATION HAM,\" which \"could not fail to damage its good name,\" or else \"[w]ithdraw[ ] from the interstate market ... caus[ing] loss of profits which could never be recaptured.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6810721\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/304/404/#p406\">\n    304 F.2d at 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis original);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nalco Co. v.

Although Apprio tries to cabin the application of\n   <em>\n    Armour\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Nalco\n   </em>\n   to the principle of sovereign immunity, neither case relies on the mere fact of sovereign immunity, but rather on the fact that damages are unrecoverable at law. And there is precedent for applying the contract itself to determine which damages are recoverable. In another case involving private parties, where the contract at issue limited recovery to \"direct compensatory damages,\" a district court held that the counter-claim plaintiff, who was seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent \"unjustified termination\" of the contract, had established irreparable harm because the parties had \"contractually removed\" the ability to recover lost fees from third-parties.\n   <em>\n    Flex-Plan Servs., Inc. v.

Wash. Dec. 31, 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   At the end of the day, Apprio raises no persuasive argument that the loss of the upcoming FEMA Center contract is recoverable.

The Equities Favor Beacon\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The equities in this case clearly favor Beacon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   First, I note that the parties appear to have bargained for injunctive relief rather than a damages remedy, when a breach of contract will create any damages beyond the amount of the subcontract. Not only does the subcontract cap liability at the amount of the subcontract and make \"special, consequential, indirect, or punitive damages\" unavailable, Subcontract App. A \u00a7 16, but it also specifically anticipates the potential for equitable remedies and injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%2012092543\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at App. A, \u00a7 19 (\"[i]n no event shall the foregoing [dispute resolution procedure] prevent or delay either party from seeking injunctive or equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction.\"). This combination of contracting parties' decision to drastically limit their abilities to obtain damages from each other but hold open the potential for injunctive relief makes an injunction particularly appropriate and equitable.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flex-Plan Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%2012092543\">\n    2013 WL 12092543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Second, Apprio continues to employ Beacon's 40 employees, thus benefiting from its solicitation and termination breaches of the subcontract. Because Beacon is likely to succeed in showing that Apprio breached the contract when it employed Beacon's employees, and destroyed Beacon's competitive position, Apprio's current employment of Beacon's employees is a factor that favors Beacon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    D. In These Circumstances, an Injunction is in the Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%203.101-1\">\n    48 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.101-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"Transactions relating to the expenditure of public funds require the highest degree of public trust and an impeccable standard of conduct.\" Failure to enjoin this conduct will undermine the integrity of public contracting and subcontracting. If no injunction issued, I would be allowing Apprio to benefit from an egregious breach of contract\n   that destroyed Beacon's ability to compete on level ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Apprio argues that every subcontractor who is terminated by a prime contractor would expect to suffer the exact same injuries as alleged here. I disagree. There is overwhelming evidence that Apprio committed a blatant violation of the subcontract's anti-poaching provisions. And given the timeline of this case, there is some evidence of a calculated attempt to set up Beacon for supposed breach, to remove Beacon as potential competition. Apprio gave offer letters and retention bonuses to Beacon's FEMA Center workforce about two weeks after FEMA provided notice that a contract competition was about to begin. This immediately secured some of Beacon employees for Apprio's pending proposal, and ensuring that the remainder had offer letters waiting in hand. In early February, Apprio's FEMA Center Project Manager learned that two American Coach invoices were unpaid, and chose to \"inform[ ] Apprio management of this issue.\" Buzan Decl. \u00b6 13. On February 27, 2018, Apprio terminated the subcontract, thereby avoiding its contractual obligation to renew Beacon's subcontract for Option Year 4 on March 14, 2018, when FEMA renewed Apprio's prime contract. Koffinke Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 53-54. The termination effectively fired Beacon's entire FEMA Center workforce, leaving them with no job and Apprio's offer letter. By close of business on February 28, 2018, Apprio had secured Beacon's workforce for the remainder of the existing prime contract, and for the contract competition to follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Furthermore, granting this injunction would return the parties to the status quo, defined as \"the last uncontested status which preceded the pending controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    Dist. 50, United Mine Workers of Am. v.

The scope of Beacon's requested injunction is properly tailored to the scope of the alleged wrongs, with the sole exception of the request that Apprio be enjoined from employing Beacon's employees for one year after the subcontract expires. Pl.'s Proposed Order at 2, ECF No. 6-1. Given the possibility that Apprio may win the follow-on FEMA Center contract, and Beacon may not, such an order might prevent Beacon's employees from seeking legitimate employment with Apprio in their current roles, and thus unfairly punish innocent parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Having considered the entire record before me, including the parties' briefs, documentary evidence, and oral submissions, the Plaintiff's application for a Preliminary\n   Injunction will be granted.
