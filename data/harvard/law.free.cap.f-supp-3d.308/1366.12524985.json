Commerce may rescind a review if it concludes that two conditions have been met: (1) \"there has not been an entry and sale to an unaffiliated customer in the United States of subject merchandise\" during the period of review, and (2) that \"an expansion of the normal period of review to include an entry and sale to an unaffiliated customer in the United States of subject merchandise would be likely to prevent the completion of the review within the [required] time limits.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.214\">\n    19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(2). Although the regulation addressing rescission of a new shipper review does not mention a\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   requirement, \"Commerce interprets the term 'sale' in [ 19 C.F.R.] \u00a7 351.214(f)(2)(i) to mean that a transaction it determines not to be a\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   sale is, for purposes of the regulation, not a sale at all.\"\n   <em>\n    Shijiazhuang Goodman Trading Co. v.

Commerce determined that the information provided does not substantiate payment for the sale and sale expenses, and that the information provided was insufficient to determine resale profit.

Commerce identified the ways in which it sought information necessary to conduct\n   the\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   analysis, but the information was not provided in a manner satisfactory to the agency. With respect to payment for the sale, Commerce sent Jingmei, Eno, Company X, and Company Y three supplemental questionnaires requesting information on the payment process and documentation to substantiate proof of payment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I &amp; D Mem. at 7; Final BPI Mem. at Note 2.

I &amp; D Mem. at 7-8; Prelim.\n   <em>\n    Bona Fide\n   </em>\n   Mem. at 9-10. With respect to payment of sales expenses-Chinese inland freight, port charges, import duties, ocean freight, and U.S. inland freight-the agency sent four supplemental questionnaires to Jingmei, Company X, and Company Y seeking to determine which company incurred which expense related to the sale under review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I &amp; D Mem. at 8; Prelim.\n   <em>\n    Bona Fide\n   </em>\n   Mem. at 8-9. The agency determined that the documentation provided by the companies in response to the supplemental questionnaires \"failed to tie payment of expenses for the sale under review to the individual company's books and records,\" and that the companies \"provided incomplete answers in response to the [agency's] ongoing requests\" to link those expenses to the companies' accounting records. Prelim.\n   <em>\n    Bona Fide\n   </em>\n   Mem. at 9; I &amp; D Mem. at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In its analysis of whether the merchandise was resold at a profit, the agency explained that the relevant inquiry is whether the U.S. customer, Company Y, made a profit. I &amp; D Mem. at 10. Commerce explained that Company Y provided only a limited number of invoices accounting for the resale of the subject merchandise, thereby complicating the agency's ability to determine resale of the merchandise based on all of Company Y's sales.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201675\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201675\">\n    at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Final BPI Mem. at Note 5. When Commerce sent a supplemental request to Company Y for a complete list of its sales of the subject merchandise during the POI, Company Y responded with a list that included both subject and non-subject merchandise and no means to enable the agency determine which sales were of subject merchandise. I &amp; D Mem. at 10; Final BPI at Note 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The first issue, therefore, is whether Commerce properly rescinded the new shipper review based upon its asserted inability to complete the\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   analysis because of the failure of Eno, Jingmei and Jingmei's downstream customers to provide sufficient information as requested by the agency. Jingmei argues that Commerce's decision is unsupported by substantial evidence because the agency had enough information to find that its sale was\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. at 12-29; Pl.'s Reply at 9-12.

Rather, Congress gave the agency the authority to use facts available to fill any gaps in the record and, when certain conditions are present, to make an adverse inference in the selection of the available facts (referred to as \"adverse facts available\" or \"AFA\"). See 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677e(a), (b). In other words, Congress has established a statutory scheme in which it ensured that the agency will have enough information to make its determinations, whether provided by an interested party in response to an information request or otherwise selected by the agency.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Haixing Jingmei,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12419631\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/277/1375/\">\n    277 F.Supp.3d at 1383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Haixing Jingmei,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12419631\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/277/1375/\">\n    277 F.Supp.3d at 1383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , although Commerce here claims it lacked sufficient information to find that the sale is\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   , it did not use facts available, with or without an adverse inference, to fill any asserted gaps in the record. I &amp; D Mem. at 9 (\"[N]o adverse inferences have been drawn against Jingmei in rescinding this review.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14 (\"[T]he facts otherwise available and use of adverse inference statutory provisions have not been applied in this case.\"). Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a), when \"necessary information is not available on the record,\" or an interested party \"withholds information\" requested by Commerce, \"significantly impedes a proceeding,\" \"fails to provide [ ] information by the deadlines for submission of the information,\" or provides information that cannot be verified pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(i), Commerce \"shall ... use the facts otherwise available.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, if Commerce determines that the party \"has failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply with a request for information,\" it \"may use an inference that is adverse to the interests of that party in selecting from among the facts otherwise available.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1677e(b). Thus, in light of the statutory authority to provide gap-filling information on any record when and as justified, the court cannot find that the agency's decision to rescind the new shipper review due to insufficient information is supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Additionally, as the court explained recently:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   By avoiding the use of facts available and, instead, rescinding the review based on an asserted lack of information, the agency potentially evades the[ ] statutory constraints while creating the effect of applying an adverse inference.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   By remanding this determination to the agency to determine whether the sales in question were\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   , the court will be in a better position to evaluate whether that redetermination is supported by substantial evidence and otherwise in accordance with law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Haixing Jingmei,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12419631\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/277/1375/\">\n    277 F.Supp.3d at 1383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
