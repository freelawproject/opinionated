On July 17, 2017, Judge Robinson found that Gamarra was not competent and, upon motion by the government, committed Gamarra to the custody of the Attorney General pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204241\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) for 120 days to determine whether there was a substantial probability that he would attain the capacity to permit the proceedings to go forward in the foreseeable future.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order [ECF No. 8].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   However, due to a clerical error, Judge Robinson's order was not transferred to the Marshal's Office until late August, and Gamarra was not transferred to FMC Butner in North Carolina until September 19, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 5; Def.'s Reply [ECF No. 13] at 6-7. The medical staffers at Butner indicated that they would need a full 120 days-until January 16, 2018-to evaluate Gamarra because he \"showed an unwillingness to take medication and appeared psychotic.\" Gov't's Status Rep. [ECF No. 10] at 1-2. On January 30, 2018, the parties jointly moved to continue the status hearing scheduled for that day until March, when they would have had time to examine the report from Butner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Min.

There, the government requested a\n   <em>\n    Sell\n   </em>\n   hearing to determine whether Gamarra could be involuntarily medicated; Gamarra, conversely, moved for the first time to dismiss the indictment because he had been held for longer than the 120 days authorized by statute for competency evaluations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204241\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This latter motion is now before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984 set up a three-step process for evaluating the competency of criminal defendants. First, upon a party's motion, and \"if there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant may presently be suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent,\" a court ma y order the defendant committed for not longer than thirty days for evaluation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204241\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) - (b) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204241\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4247(b). Second, if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence after the evaluation that the defendant remains mentally incompetent to stand trial, \"the court shall commit the defendant to the custody of the Attorney General\" for \"a reasonable period of time, not to exceed four months\" for further examination.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204241\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4241(d) - (d)(1). Third, after the four-month evaluation period, the court must commit the defendant \"for an additional reasonable period of time until his mental condition is so improve d that trial may proceed,\" but only \"if the court finds that there is a substantial probability that with in such additional period of time he will attain the capacity to permit the proceedings to go forward.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204241\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4241(d)(2). This case has already proceeded through the first two of these steps, but the government has not yet received an order to extend Gamarra's confinement under the third step.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Gamarra argues that his extended detention at Butner violates the Insanity Defense Reform Act. He is correct. The statutory text leaves no room for debate: it authorizes evaluation for a period \"not to exceed four months.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204241\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4241(d)(1). Congress set this limit mindful of the Supreme Court's admonition in\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. Indiana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173472\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/715/#p738\">\n    406 U.S. 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 738,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173472\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/715/#p738\">\n    92 S.Ct. 1845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173472\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/715/#p738\">\n    32 L.Ed.2d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972), that \"due process requires that the nature and duration of commitment bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual is committed.\" Nor did Congress set any provision for extending this four-month period, as it did for the initial thirty-day evaluation, which can be extended for up to fifteen more days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Magassouba\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3841763\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/544/387/#p405\">\n    544 F.3d 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 405 (2d Cir. 2008). The only manner by which a defendant can be kept in confinement beyond four months is through a court order finding that he has a substantial probability of attaining competency. Gamarra has remained in Butner for more than six months, without an order committing him \"for an additional reasonable period of time.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204241\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The government has therefore violated the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   However, the proper remedy for this violation is not to dismiss the indictment, but rather to ensure a speedy evaluation under \u00a7 4241(d)(2). \"Any error, defect, irregularity, or variance that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded,\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(a), and the statutory error here is harmless. If Gamarra had not been confined for evaluation, he likely would have remained in pretrial detention, with the same level of deprivation to his liberty rights. Moreover, nothing in the Act suggests that dismissal is a necessary or proper remedy. The Act itself provide s no particular remedy for violating its time limits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Magassouba\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3841763\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/544/387/#p405\">\n    544 F.3d at 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It also does not suggest that a court must make a \u00a7 4241(d)(2) determination within the four-month confinement period; indeed, to set such a deadline, particularly when the defense needs time to contest a \u00a7 4241(d)(2) motion, could itself raise due process concerns.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3841763\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/544/387/#p405\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3841763\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/544/387/#p405\">\n    at 406-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Nor does the Constitution require dismissal. The Court in\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   , after finding that a three-year confinement violated due process, did not dismiss the indictment but rather remanded to the lower courts for a determination of the defendant's competency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173472\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/715/#p738\">\n    406 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   738 &amp; n.25, 741,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173472\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/715/#p738\">\n    92 S.Ct. 1845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, in a case with facts similar to this one, the Second Circuit found that mandamus actions to compel evaluation hearings and habeas corpus actions to free illegally confined defendants, rather than dismissal of indictments, are the correct remedies for violating the Act's time limits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Magassouba\n   </em>\n   , at 411 n. 16. Finally, the length of Gamarra's confinement is to some extent due to his own actions in refusing to consistently take his medication, which necessitated a lengthier examination period by Butner staff, and to his counsel's agreement to prior continuances of status hearings. Given these facts, the Court finds that Gamarra's six-and-a-half-month confinement has not affected\n   his substantial rights so as to make dismissal appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The government's proposed remedies, however, are either not available or not properly directed to the Court at this time. First, the government's contention that the Court could simply order a second initial evaluation under \u00a7 4241(a) - (b) is contrary to the statute. The Act clearly sets up the three-step structure outlined above, and continuously refers to a singular initial competency hearing rather than to multiple hearings.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204241\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Neither the government nor the courts can circumvent that process by circling back to another step-one initial examination after engaging in the step-two four-month evaluation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Only a determination under \u00a7 4241(d)(2) that a defendant has a substantial probability of attaining competency with a further period of confinement can justify continued detention at a facility at this stage. Second, it is premature to make a dangerousness determination under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g), as Gamarra is still at Butner rather than in pretrial detention. There is currently a hearing scheduled before Judge Robinson to determine whether Gamarra can be involuntarily medicated under\n   <em>\n    Sell v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897706\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/166/\">\n    539 U.S. 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897706\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/166/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897706\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/166/\">\n    156 L.Ed.2d 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003). As the government believes that such medication can render Gamarra competent to stand trial, it can and should move for a finding under \u00a7 4241(d)(2), and Judge Robinson can rule on that matter, as well.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Should Judge Robinson find that Gamarra must continue to be held at Butner, a \u00a7 3142(g) determination will be unnecessary. Third, and for the same reasons, the Court will not make a substantial probability finding under \u00a7 4241(d)(2) based on the existing reports. The government should direct its motion to Judge Robinson, once expert reports have been filed. Because of the statutory violation, the\n   <em>\n    Sell\n   </em>\n   hearing-and any hearing to make a \u00a7 4241(d)(2) determination-must take place by not later than April 30, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court will deny Gamarra's motion to dismiss the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    Gamarra asserts that the Court should count the four-month period allowed for in the Act from the date on which Judge Robinson ordered him to be confined, rather than from the date on which he actually arrived at Butner.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mot. to Dismiss [ECF No. 11] at 16-17.
