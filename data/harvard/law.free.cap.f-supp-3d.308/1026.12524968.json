The CFA provides for the disgorgement of all \"profits, gain, gross receipts, or other benefits obtained by means of\" the alleged misconduct. A.R.S. \u00a7 44-1528(A)(3). Walgreens, Holmes, and Balwani have not disgorged any profits or gains as a result of the Consent Decree and it is possible that Theranos has not disgorged all of its profits or gains.

In paragraph 398, plaintiffs allege that defendants failed to disclose information about the reliability of the Theranos blood tests, information about the deficiencies and non-compliance of Theranos's testing facilities and/or equipment, the fact that Theranos's testing services were not ready-for-market and that Theranos and Walgreens were using the tests for research and development, the fact that Walgreens had agreed to not obtain objective proof that Theranos's testing services were reliable, the fact that Walgreens agreed to conduct no oversight of Theranos's laboratory testing practices, the fact that Theranos employees were not adequately trained, the fact that Theranos had manipulated its internal proficiency testing processes and covered up known reliability problems; the fact that Theranos's internal validation tests showed that the testing was unreliable, and the fact that the Edison technology was not market-ready and that the true\n   purpose for the tiny blood draws was research and development.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs allege that Walgreens\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   owed a duty to [p]laintiffs ... to provide them material information about the unreliability of Theranos tests ... because they had exclusive and far superior knowledge regarding the material information, because of the nature of the information in question, because they knew that customers would rely on them to provide accurate and complete material information about the reliability and readiness of the tests, and because they had disseminated pervasive false and/or partial representations about Theranos testing that were misleading absent full disclosure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In the order on the first motions to dismiss, the court found, in the context of the aiding and abetting claim, that plaintiffs' allegations were \"sufficient to suggest that it is plausible that Walgreens was aware of more than just 'suspicious activity' but was actually aware of the alleged fraud.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the SAC, plaintiffs have again alleged that it is plausible that Walgreens was actually aware of the alleged fraud. If Walgreens were actually aware of the alleged fraud, then it is plausible that Walgreens had a duty to disclose information regarding the unreliability of the tests. Plaintiffs have adequately alleged that Walgreens had a duty to disclose at least some of the information that plaintiffs allege was concealed. Plaintiffs' fraud by omission claims against Walgreens are plausible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Theranos defendants argue that the non-Edison plaintiffs' fraud by omission claims are not plausible because the only omissions plaintiffs have alleged have to do with the Edison device. But as set out above, in paragraph 398 of the SAC, plaintiffs allege that defendants failed to disclose information concerning the reliability of the non-Edison tests. The non-Edison plaintiffs' fraud by omission claims against Theranos are plausible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Plaintiffs' CFA and common law fraud claims are also based on affirmative misrepresentations. In the SAC, plaintiffs only assert affirmative misrepresentation fraud claims against Walgreens and Theranos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As to those claims, Walgreens first argues that plaintiffs have not alleged that Walgreens knew that the Theranos blood tests were unreliable or that Walgreens knew that Theranos was deceiving plaintiffs and other consumers. Rather, Walgreens contends, the SAC indicates that Theranos was a secretive technology company and that Theranos did not allow Walgreens access to its technology and laboratories.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   Walgreens argues that the alleged secretive behavior on the part of Theranos does not lead to an inference that Walgreens actually knew, or even suspected, that the Theranos defendants' representations about the reliability of the blood tests were false. Walgreens also points out that plaintiffs all allege that they purchased their Theranos blood tests prior to January 25, 2016 and Walgreens insist that plaintiffs have not alleged that Walgreens knew that the blood tests were unreliable before then. Walgreens argues that other allegations in the SAC suggest that Walgreens could not possibly have known about the alleged fraud prior to January\n   25, 2016 (the date that the CMS made public its findings about the deficiencies at the Theranos labs).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Walgreens may be correct that one inference that could be drawn from plaintiffs' allegations is that because of Theranos's secretive behavior, Walgreens had no way of knowing that the Theranos blood tests were unreliable. But another reasonable inference that could be drawn from these allegations is that Theranos's secretive behavior should have put Walgreens on notice that there might be some problems with Theranos's technology. On a motion to dismiss, the court must draw inferences in plaintiffs' favor. This second inference supports plaintiffs' allegation that Walgreens knew that the blood tests were unreliable. In addition, plaintiffs have alleged that there were public reports of problems with the blood tests prior to January 25, 2016. Plaintiffs allege that in April 2015, the \"Arizona Department of Health Services inspectors identified multiple deficiencies at Theranos's Scottsdale laboratory\" and plaintiffs cite to a November 30, 2015 newspaper article as the source of this information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   The article includes Theranos's self-serving representations that \"the inspection findings were routine and all issues were addressed or corrected within days or weeks of the April inspection.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs also allege that \"[i]n October 2015 the FDA released inspection reports of Theranos declaring the nanotainer to be an 'uncleared medical device.' The investigation also found deficiencies in Theranos's processes for handling customer complaints, monitoring quality and vetting suppliers.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on these allegations and the reasonable inferences that can be drawn in plaintiffs' favor, the court finds that plaintiffs have alleged that it is plausible that Walgreens knew that the blood tests were unreliable and that they knew so prior to January 25, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Walgreens next argues that plaintiffs have again failed to plead their affirmative misrepresentation fraud claims with the particularity required by Rule 9(b). Walgreens argues that plaintiffs continue to lump Walgreens and Theranos together and thus have failed to attribute any specific affirmative misrepresentation to Walgreens. For example, Walgreens cites to paragraph 87 of the SAC in which plaintiffs allege that \"Theranos and Walgreens caused ... prominent billboards to be erected in the high-visibility areas in Arizona[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   The examples of the billboards that plaintiffs include in the SAC bear only the Theranos name and Walgreens argues that plaintiffs do not allege what involvement Walgreens had in their creation or display. Walgreens also cites to paragraph 97, in which plaintiffs allege that \"Theranos and Walgreens also widely disseminated social media commercials and television commercials,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   but the only example plaintiffs include in paragraph 97 is a commercial that allegedly appeared on Theranos's twitter page.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   Walgreens acknowledges that plaintiffs allege generally that Theranos and Walgreens \"jointly designed,\n   approved, and implemented\" a broad marketing campaign,\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   but Walgreens argues that such an allegation is insufficient to meet the requirements of Rule 9(b) because plaintiffs have not alleged any specifics about Walgreens' involvement in the marketing campaign. Walgreens argues that it cannot be liable based on Theranos's alleged misrepresentations in the advertising campaign without some factual support that Walgreens was involved in developing that campaign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   While the SAC does still contain allegations in which plaintiffs lump Walgreens and Theranos together, plaintiffs have also alleged a number of specific affirmative misrepresentations made by Walgreens. For example, in paragraph 56, plaintiffs allege that in 2015, \"Walgreens reportedly said it was 'confident in the quality of Theranos's services[.]' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   In paragraph 71, plaintiffs allege that \"[w]hen the discontinuation of the Edison device occurred ... Walgreens, via its divisional vice-president... told reporters: 'TRUST me. If the results are not there we would hear.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   In paragraph 92, plaintiffs allege that \"[t]hroughout the time that the 'tiny' blood 'tests' were being offered in Walgreens stores, Walgreens' website promoted the 'blood tests' that could be run on 'just a tiny sample', alongside images of the 'tiny' collection vials, and stating that the technology supported 'better, more informed treatment.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   In paragraph 93, plaintiffs allege that \"during this same time period,\" Walgreens' website \"claimed ... that Theranos's 'high-complexity CLIA-certified laboratory can perform your tests quickly and accurately using tiny samples' and 'can perform tests on any sample type.... It's fast, easy and the highest level of quality.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   In paragraph 94, plaintiffs allege that during the time that the blood tests were being sold in Walgreens' stores, Walgreens' website \"stated that Theranos had 'reinvented' testing with its technology, directly benefitting consumers of this testing by dramatically reducing the time it takes to analyze samples because its technology enabled a 'more timely diagnosis to support better, more informed treatment.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   In paragraph 111, plaintiffs alleged that \"Walgreens' website stated that the Theranos technology supported 'better, more informed treatment.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   In paragraph 112, plaintiffs allege that \"[t]hroughout its partnership with Theranos, Walgreens endorsed the information on Theranos's website, directing its customers to visit www.theranos.com for more information.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   In paragraph 115, plaintiffs allege that Walgreens issued joint press releases with the Theranos defendants in which Walgreens represented \"that Theranos testing was government approved and reliable\" and that Walgreens made other statements to the media about the reliability of the tests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   By way of example, plaintiffs allege that in November 2013, Walgreens' president told a newspaper that \"Theranos could perform tests 'more accurately' than traditional blood tests.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   In paragraph 100, plaintiffs allege that in September 2013, in a joint press release with Theranos, Walgreens \"touted Theranos's 'CLIA-certified laboratory services'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   and promised that its 'proprietary laboratory infrastructure minimizes human error through extensive automation to produce high quality results.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   These allegations are sufficient to meet plaintiffs' Rule 9(b) obligation to plead their claims with particularity. Although some of these allegations are related to the size, affordability, and convenience of the tiny blood draws, others amount to affirmative misrepresentations about the reliability of the non-Edison tests. Plaintiffs have alleged that representations about the reliability of both the Edison and non-Edison tests were false. For example, plaintiffs allege that none of the Theranos tests \"were ... conducted in conformity with CLIA regulations, nor 'validated' under or compliant with federal guidelines[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   And as discussed above, plaintiffs have adequately alleged that Walgreens knew that the blood tests were unreliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Walgreens next argues that plaintiffs have not alleged that they relied on any alleged affirmative misrepresentations by Walgreens nor have they alleged what advertisements they saw with particularity. As to most of the plaintiffs, Walgreens is correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiffs A.R., B.P., D.L., R.C., S.J., and S.L. all allege that they viewed Walgreens' marketing prior to going to the store to get a blood test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   Walgreens argues, however, that a vague allegation that they viewed \"marketing\" does not meet the particularity requirements of Rule 9(b).

Theranos argues that plaintiffs' theory of the case boils down to a fraudulent scheme in which the Edison device was rushed to market before it was ready in an effort to use the blood samples obtained for research and development. But, Theranos argues that these allegations cannot support a fraud claim that is not based on the tiny blood draws. Theranos argues that the non-Edison plaintiffs fail to identify a single false affirmative misrepresentation about the testing on which they relied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Plaintiffs have alleged that Theranos made numerous affirmative misrepresentations about the non-Edison blood tests. In paragraph 110, plaintiffs allege that \"Theranos's website... advertised that Theranos's test results could be relied on by consumers and their doctors in making health decisions that they provided 'actionable health information at the time it matters' to consumers, and that they 'lead the industry in transparency and quality.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   In paragraph 108, plaintiffs allege that \"Theranos's marketing ... stated that 'we continuously conduct proficiency testing and participate in multiple proficiency testing programs,' and that all 'tests are developed and validated under and to the CLSI, FDA Centers for Disease Control, and the World Health Organization guidelines.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n   In paragraph 109, plaintiffs allege that \"[o]n its website, Theranos advertised that Theranos testing was of 'the highest levels of accuracy,' and that the tests were 'validated under and in compliance with federal regulations and guidelines[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n   In paragraph 107, plaintiffs allege that in \"marketing that appeared on Theranos's website and in the Wellness Centers, Theranos and Walgreens touted that their testing\n   services would help patients 'evaluate' health issues and to screen for diseases[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    80\n   </footnotemark>\n   In paragraph 115, plaintiffs allege that the Theranos defendants issued press releases that included representations \"that Theranos testing was government approved and reliable.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   While Theranos does not dispute that plaintiffs have made the foregoing allegations in the SAC, Theranos argues that none of the non-Edison plaintiffs allege that they saw any of these statements, except for S.L. S.L. alleges that he went to Walgreens twice to get a Theranos blood test and that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   [p]rior to each visit, [he] had seen and heard advertisements for Theranos that caused him to believe that Theranos test results would be as reliable as other labs' results, and that Theranos was the cheapest and least invasive alternative option for blood testing.

Theranos argues that plaintiffs have not alleged any facts that suggest that Theranos knew that the venipuncture tests were unreliable nor have plaintiffs alleged any facts that would negate the obvious alternative explanation, which is that Theranos intended to offer accurate blood testing services that extended beyond the Edison device, but problems in the execution of its clinical lab services led Theranos, out of an abundance of caution, to void its test results. Theranos contends that plaintiffs are pleading \"fraud by hindsight\" which is not sufficient. \"A plaintiff does not satisfy the falsity requirement by merely asserting that a company's later revelation of bad news means that earlier, cheerier statements must have been false. This is a classic definition of so-called fraud by hindsight and it does not establish falsity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    Glen Holly Entertainment, Inc. v.

For example, plaintiffs allege that \"[i]n March 2014, a former Theranos employee alleged to New York State's public-health lab that Theranos may have manipulated the proficiency testing process, in part by intentionally excluding data that showed Theranos's technology to be unreliable.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    86\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs also allege that \"in April 2015, Arizona Department of Health Services inspectors identified multiple deficiencies at Theranos's Scottsdale laboratory, including serious issues with Theranos's proficiency testing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    87\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on these allegations, it is plausible that Theranos knew that the non-Edison tests were not reliable at the time those tests were being sold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Theranos next argues that the Edison plaintiffs (B.P., R.C., and S.J.) have failed to plead their affirmative misrepresentation fraud claims with particularity because they have still failed to adequately delineate the conduct attributed to each defendant. Theranos argues that plaintiffs' advertising allegations fail to support any conclusion other than that the advertisements encouraged members of the public to purchase Theranos's product. Theranos emphasizes that the advertising does not say anything about which clinical analyzer (the Edison device or a commercial device) would be used to run patient blood samples. Theranos argues that plaintiffs cannot allege that advertising about the efficacy of the Edison device was material to their decision to purchase Theranos testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Edison plaintiffs have alleged that they relied on Theranos's marketing materials.\n   <footnotemark>\n    88\n   </footnotemark>\n   They have also alleged with particularity that Theranos made affirmative misrepresentations about the tiny blood draws\n   <footnotemark>\n    89\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that Theranos knew that these representations were false.\n   <footnotemark>\n    90\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Edison plaintiffs have pled plausible affirmative misrepresentation fraud claims against Theranos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Battery and Medical Battery Claims (Third and Fourteenth Causes of Action)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Battery and medical battery occur in \"situations in which the patient is mistaken about the nature of the invasion and the mistake is induced by a health care provider's misrepresentation.\"\n   <em>\n    Duncan v.

Walgreens contends that while plaintiffs allege that Walgreens knew that the Edison device was not ready-for-market, this allegation does not suggest that Walgreens knew about the alleged research and development purpose. Walgreens argues that it is implausible that it knew that this was the true purpose of the tiny blood draws, given the Master Service Agreement (MSA). Walgreens argue that the MSA describes a contractual relationship for which Walgreens paid $140 million as well as describing what the essential purpose of the contractual relationship was, which was for Walgreens to draw blood for legitimate blood testing. Walgreens argues that the fact that plaintiffs have alleged that Walgreens was aware of red flags does not mean that Walgreens knew about the research and development purpose. At best, Walgreens argues that such allegations would suggest that Walgreens was negligent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In the SAC, plaintiffs allege that Walgreens knew that the Edison device was still in development, not market-ready, and incapable of being used for legitimate blood testing; that Walgreens knew that any consumer submitting to a tiny blood draw was doing so under the mistaken belief that the essential purpose was for legitimate blood testing; and that Walgreens substantially contributed to this mistaken belief through its own misrepresentations and omissions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    101\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs also allege that Walgreens directly participated in the tiny blood draws by physically performing the blood draws and otherwise providing support for same.\n   <footnotemark>\n    102\n   </footnotemark>\n   If, as plausibly alleged, Walgreens knew that the Edison device was not market-ready, then Walgreens at least had constructive knowledge that the essential nature of the tiny blood draws was not legitimate testing. That Walgreens knew that Edison device was not market-ready supports the further allegation that Walgreens understood that research and development was the true purpose of the tiny blood draws. The Edison plaintiffs have stated plausible battery and medical battery claims against Walgreens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Theranos also argues that the Edison plaintiffs have failed to state plausible battery and medical battery claims against it. Theranos argues that because plaintiffs admit that they consented to the blood draws, plaintiffs must allege more than that their consent was uninformed because \"battery and lack of informed consent are separate causes of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Saxena v. Goffney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3851272\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/159/316/\">\n    159 Cal.App.4th 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20469\">\n    71 Cal.Rptr.3d 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 475 (2008). Theranos contends that plaintiffs have sought to allege that their consent was vitiated by fraud or misrepresentation but what they are really attempting to do is recast an informed consent theory as a battery. Theranos argues that as long as the essential character of the treatment in question was therapeutic then consent cannot be vitiated even if plaintiffs were induced to give their consent via deception. Theranos argues that the actionable conduct is the blood draws, which is exactly what plaintiffs consented to. Theranos insists that this is not a case in\n   which plaintiffs made a \"substantial mistake concerning the nature of the invasion of [their] interests or the extent of harm to be expected from it....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    103\n   </footnotemark>\n   But rather, Theranos contends that the Edison plaintiffs have pled that they were not fully informed about the status of the Edison device,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that it was still in development. Such allegations, Theranos argues, sound in negligence, not battery. Theranos also argues that plaintiffs are attempting to expand the scope of consent required for a procedure to include not only the blood draw but also the running of the blood sample from that blood draw on a particular analyzer. Theranos argues that this is not plausible because plaintiffs cannot contend that they only provided consent for a particular method of analyzing their blood sample. Theranos contends that the crux of its argument is that in light of the Edison plaintiffs' consent to the essential conduct (the blood draw), what plaintiffs are in fact alleging is that Theranos did not disclose a research interest behind that procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   If this is the crux of Theranos's argument, this argument fails. The Edison plaintiffs are not just alleging that there was a \"research interest\" behind the Edison blood draws; they are alleging that the true and essential purpose of the Edison blood draws was research and development and that there was no legitimate purpose, allegations that the court has already found plausible. It is plausible that the Edison plaintiffs' consent to the blood draws was rendered ineffective by Theranos's alleged misrepresentations. Thus, the Edison plaintiffs have stated plausible battery and medical battery claims against Theranos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Negligence Claims (Fourth Cause of Action)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In the SAC, plaintiffs assert negligence claims against Theranos and Walgreens.

Walgreens argues that pharmacies cannot regulate drug companies, second-guess doctors, investigate side effects, or independently corroborate medical testing. Walgreens insists that its duty here was limited to performing the services conducted by pharmacy staff within the pharmacy's narrow role, which was to do blood draws and store the blood, services which plaintiffs do not allege were done negligently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Plaintiffs' negligence claims against Walgreens are plausible.
