CONCLUSION...453\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs Miller Investment Trust (\"Miller\") and Jura Limited (\"Jura\") seek to recover investment losses from purchases of $8.7 million of bonds offered by ShengdaTech, Inc. (\"Shengda\") made between December 2010 and February 2011. In March 2011, it was reported that Shengda had vastly overstated its revenues. Shortly thereafter, Shengda defaulted and declared bankruptcy. In December 2011, Miller brought this action alleging securities fraud against Defendants Morgan Stanley, which underwrote the offering, and KPMG Hong Kong (\"KPMG-HK\"), Shengda's auditor. The Plaintiffs allege that Morgan Stanley and KPMG-HK knew or should have known about misrepresentations of material fact made in the offering documents provided to the Plaintiffs on which Plaintiffs relied in deciding to purchase the Shengda bonds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The instant motion to dismiss pertains only to those claims asserted by Miller against KPMG-HK. Following several iterations of the complaint, after each of which KPMG-HK has moved to dismiss, now before me is KPMG-HK's motion for dismissal of the two counts against it set forth in the Third Amended Complaint: negligent misrepresentation under state common law and violation of \u00a7 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78r.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   I recount the facts as alleged in the Third Amended Complaint as true, focusing primarily on those allegations pertaining to KPMG-HK.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Shengda's Note Offering and the Plaintiffs' Purchases\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Shengda was a Nevada corporation with its principal place of business in the People's Republic of China. Third Am. Compl. (TAC) \u00b6 37. Before its bankruptcy, Shengda primarily manufactured a chemical additive called nano-precipitated calcium carbonate, which is used to improve industrial materials such as paint, paper, plastic, and rubber.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It conducted its manufacturing operations through Chinese subsidiaries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34, 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In 2010, Shengda sold an aggregate of $130 million of 6.5% senior convertible notes due in 2015 through a private placement offering closing in December 2010. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 1, 16, 219, 224. In connection with the offering, Morgan Stanley,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the underwriter, prepared a private placement memorandum (\"PPM\") that would be distributed to potential purchasers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 20, 23, 32, 33, 258. The PPM contained numerous financial documents relating to Shengda, including its 2008 and 2009 SEC Form 10-Ks, each of which contained an audit report from KPMG-HK for the respective fiscal years 2008 and 2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 34, 258. Shengda retained KPMG-HK\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to serve as its independent auditor from November 2008 until April 2011, during which time KPMG-HK completed audits for fiscal years 2008 and 2009, and partially completed an audit for 2010.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34, 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   After receiving additional assurances from KPMG-HK as to the use of its audit reports and the accuracy of Shengda's financial statements, Morgan Stanley distributed the PPM to potential buyers, including Wellesley Investment Advisors, Inc. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 2, 23, 34, 220, 243, 258. Wellesley Investment Advisors is a registered investment adviser in Massachusetts that manages Miller, a mutual fund, and has full investment authority over the funds of Jura, a Bermuda corporation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28, 30-31. Relying on the information provided in the PPM and in Shengda's SEC filings, Miller purchased approximately $8 million of Shengda bonds (Shengda's 2015 Notes) between December 10, 2010 and February 16, 2011,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, 29, 32, 243-244, from Morgan Stanley,\n   through the private placement and four subsequent transactions. Jura, through Wellesley Investment Advisors, purchased $700,000 of Shengda convertible bonds in two purchases on December 12, 2010 and February 27, 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-32, 243-245.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. KPMG-HK's Realization of Shengda's Overvaluation and Shengda's Bankruptcy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In conducting its audit for Shengda for fiscal year 2010, KPMG-HK conducted additional procedures that it had allegedly assured the chair of Shengda's Audit Committee it would perform. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 17, 166. On March 1 and 2, 2011, KPMG-HK began contacting Shengda's customers, suppliers, and banks using publicly available contact information, and learned that many of Shengda's claims regarding business relationships and financial statements were false.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17, 225-226. Specifically, KPMG-HK \"could not confirm sales amounts, sales terms, and outstanding balances, discovered that many documents ShengdaTech provided to KPMG were crude forgeries, discovered that certain transactions had been with related parties without necessary disclosure, and that suppliers and customers denied engaging in business with ShengdaTech.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 226. The Plaintiffs contend that KPMG-HK would have discovered these issues earlier had it conducted its 2008 and 2009 audits consistent with governing auditing standards.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 227.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Beginning on March 2, 2011, and through a series of three memoranda thereafter, KPMG-HK informed Shengda's Audit Committee of its discovery of \"potentially serious discrepancies and unexplained issues\" during its audit of Shengda's financial statements for fiscal year 2010. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 226-227. Shengda immediately convened a special committee, composed of the independent directors on the Audit Committee and advised by a law firm and an accounting firm, to conduct an internal investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 228-229. On March 14, NASDAQ suspended trading in Shengda's equity securities, thereafter stating that it would not resume trading until Shengda had \"fully satisfied NASDAQ's request for additional information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 230, 232. The next day, Shengda issued a press release announcing the appointment of the special committee \"to investigate potentially serious discrepancies and unexplained issues relating to the Company and its subsidiaries' financial records.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 231.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In April 2011, KPMG-HK resigned as Shengda's auditor, stating that it had \"doubts about management's representations provided to [KPMG-HK] in connection with [its] 2008 and 2009 audits of the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting of the Company.\" TAC \u00b6 233. KPMG-HK implored Shengda to make disclosures regarding any errors in previously issued audit reports to prevent future reliance on them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On May 5, Shengda filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC, stating that \"KPMG previously informed the Company's Audit Committee of certain concerns arising during its incomplete audits of the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.\" TAC \u00b6 234. It went on to identify issues related to bank balances, supplier transactions, VAT tax invoices, third-party sales and payments, customer sales, and the confirmation process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On June 9, Shengda announced that it was in default on the convertible bond securities issued in the 2010 private placement; the next day, all trading of Shengda stock was suspended by NASDAQ. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 235-236. The SEC thereafter commenced a regulatory proceeding resulting\n   in an order noting potential federal securities laws violations arising from false statements made in the 2009 Form 10-K, the 2009 Form 10-K/A, and the 2009 and 2010 Form 10-Qs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 237, 239.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On August 19, Shengda filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition and an adversary proceeding against its Chief Executive Officer, Ziangzhi Chen, to prevent him from interfering with the restructuring.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 238, 240-241, 251.\n   <em>\n    See In re ShengdaTech, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , BK-11-52649 (D.

With this filing, the Plaintiffs' notes became immediately due and payable by their terms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 238. In bankruptcy, Shengda has been unable to satisfy the vast majority of its liabilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 252-254.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Alleged Misrepresentations by KPMG-HK\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Plaintiffs allege that the offering documents in the PPM on which they relied in purchasing the Shengda bonds contained material misrepresentations that made Shengda appear far more stable financially than it was. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 22, 26, 32, 61, 62. Further, they contend that KPMG-HK, as Shengda's auditor (and Morgan Stanley as Shengda's underwriter), \"had access to ShengdaTech's internal reports and other data and information about those companies' finances, operations and sales at all relevant times,\" and failed to perform its auditing responsibilities adequately, such that it would have discovered Shengda's fraud, in light of this information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 246.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Specifically, the Plaintiffs assert that KPMG-HK made two materialy false statements:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   First, regarding its own compliance with Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\"PCAOB\") standards in auditing Shengda's financial statements; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Second, regarding Shengda's compliance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in preparing its financial statements. The Plaintiffs contend that KPMG-HK knew or should have known that these statements were false. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 59-61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   KPMG-HK's statement of PCAOB compliance appears in its audit reports for fiscal years 2008 and 2009, dated March 31, 2009 and March 15, 2010, respectively, and in its internal control audit report for fiscal year 2008, also dated March 31, 2009. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 34, 59-61; 2008 Audit Report; 2009 Audit Report; 2008 Internal Control Audit Report. KPMG-HK's statement of GAAP compliance also appears in its audit reports for fiscal years 2008 and 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 59-60; 2008 Audit Report; 2009 Audit Report. These audit reports were incorporated into Shengda's 2008 Form 10-K, filed April 1, 2009, and Shengda's 2009 Form 10-K, filed March 15, 2010, respectively, and were included in the PPM.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   TAC \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In addition, the Plaintiffs identify an allegedly false or misleading statement in a comfort letter KPMG-HK provided to Morgan Stanley in connection with the private placement, dated December 9, 2010. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 34, 220. In that letter, KPMG-HK consented to the use of its audit reports and its review of Shengda's 2010 quarterly financial statements in the PPM and acknowledged that purchasers would rely on the opinions expressed therein.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34, 220. KPMG-HK also affirmed its opinion as to the accuracy of Shengda's 2010 quarterly financial statements, noting that KPMG-HK did not believe that \"any material modifications should be made to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\" included in the PPM \"for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 221(a), 272.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D. Impact of Misrepresentations on the Plaintiffs\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Plaintiffs allege that they relied to their detriment on the misrepresentations and omissions of KPMG-HK and Morgan Stanley in the documents that led the Plaintiffs to purchase the Shengda notes. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 20-22, 26, 32. According to the Plaintiffs, the materially false or misleading statements created \"an unrealistically positive assessment of ShengdaTech\" in the market, and this \"fraudulently created\" both a market for and an overvaluing of the notes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 26, 32, 61-62, 247. They contend that the notes \"would never have come into the market but for the fraud,\" or, if they had, would have done so with more favorable terms to investors, and that the Plaintiffs would not have purchased the notes at all or on the terms they did but for the misrepresentations of KPMG-HK and Morgan Stanley.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 247.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Plaintiffs further allege that immediately following Shengda's March 2011 press release stating that KPMG-HK had encountered discrepancies in its 2010 audit, the Plaintiffs sought to sell their convertible bonds, but the market had become illiquid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 248-250. As a result, having purchased the bonds at or near par, and in many cases above par value, the Plaintiffs \"lost nearly their entire investment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25, 231, 248-250, 255.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   This case came to this session, having been before two other judges in this district previously. The motion to dismiss now before me follows a familiar pattern for motion to dismiss practice in securities fraud litigation: successive motions to amend the pleadings creating a moving target for an extended period of time until the plaintiffs' allegations come to rest and can be examined by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Miller filed its complaint on December 1, 2011, alleging one count of violation of the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act, Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 110A, \u00a7 410, against Morgan Stanley and one count of negligent misrepresentation under state common law against KPMG-HK. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-3, 143-157. Morgan Stanley filed a motion to dismiss the original complaint on January 31, 2012 for failure to state a claim. This was denied by Judge Tauro.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller Inv.

R. Civ. P. 8(a) or Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before ruling on the motion to dismiss, and at the joint request of Miller and KPMG-HK, Judge Tauro granted Miller leave to file an Amended Complaint to add a claim against KPMG-HK arising under \u00a7 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78r (the \"Exchange Act\"). The earlier motion to dismiss was treated as superseded and KPMG-HK was given the opportunity to file a new motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Miller filed its first Amended Complaint on August 29, 2012, preserving the original two counts and adding a third count for violation of \u00a7 18 of the Exchange Act by KPMG-HK.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   KPMG-HK thereafter filed a motion to dismiss for insufficient service and inadequate pleading of both the \u00a7 18 claim and the negligent misrepresentation claim. Judge Tauro provided Miller with the opportunity to re-serve KPMG-HK in compliance with the Hague Convention, in order to remedy the insufficient service of KPMG-HK, and denied KPMG-HK's motion to dismiss as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Thereafter, in July 2013, KPMG-HK filed a renewed motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint asserting inadequacy in the pleadings. Miller moved for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint, having provided notice of its intent to do so in November 2013 in light of factual discovery it was obtaining in another matter regarding the same underlying events. Simultaneously, Jura moved to intervene as a plaintiff pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(2) with respect to only count one against Morgan Stanley. Judge O'Toole granted both the motion for leave to amend and the motion to intervene, and dismissed KPMG-HK's pending motion to dismiss as moot in light of the anticipated Second Amended Complaint, permitting KPMG-HK to file a new motion to dismiss thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint on March 10, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   That complaint preserved the three counts in the Amended Complaint and added Jura as a claimant in count one only. Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 245-265. In addition, the reorganized Second Amended Complaint added fifty pages of new allegations, derived largely from discovery in an action pursued by the Plaintiffs against Shengda's\n   directors and officers in the Southern District of New York and from a complaint filed by Shengda's liquidating trustee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Morgan Stanley dutifully filed an answer to the Second Amended Complaint, and KPMG-HK filed a motion to dismiss, again alleging failure to plead adequately both the \u00a7 18 claim and the negligent misrepresentation claim. Following further briefing, the case was reassigned to this session with KPMG-HK's motion to dismiss still pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   On January 15, 2015, the Plaintiffs filed yet another motion to amend the complaint and for leave to file additional allegations, which KPMG-HK opposed. After argument on both, I granted Miller's motion to amend and denied KPMG-HK's motion to dismiss without prejudice. Thereafter, Miller filed its Third Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Morgan Stanley again answered the complaint, and KPMG-HK filed the motion to dismiss both counts against it for inadequate pleadings now before me.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The claims relevant to the instant motion-those brought by Miller against KPMG-HK-are that the statements in the 2008 and 2009 audit reports, regarding KPMG-HK's compliance with the PCAOB standards and Shengda's compliance with GAAP, constitute negligent misrepresentation and violate \u00a7 18 of the Exchange Act, and further that the statement in KPMG-HK's comfort letter that Shengda's 2010 quarterly financial statements conformed with GAAP also constitutes negligent misrepresentation.

The largest collection of such allegations involves KPMG-HK's conduct following its discovery of a misrepresentation by management regarding a related party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In August 2007, Shengda's Chief Financial Officer, Anhui Guo, reported to Shengda's previous auditor, Hansen, and to Shengda's board that Shengda had sold its interest in Shandong Shengda Chemical Machinery Co. Ltd. (\"SSCM\") in an arm's length transaction to Prosper Crown Limited, and that SSCM was no longer a related party. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 40, 112-114. This was inaccurate, because Shengda's CEO, Xiangzhi Chen (\"X. Chen\"), continued to serve as the CEO of SSCM, making it a related party requiring disclosure. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 41, 112-113, 120. Hansen expressed skepticism over Guo's representation and investigated further, but Guo falsely affirmed by email to Hansen on February 18, 2008, that there was no relationship between SSCM and any parties related to Shengda.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 115-118. Guo made the same representations to Shengda's Audit Committee throughout the year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 120-124. As a result, the Audit Committee did not review transactions with SSCM for approval under its related-party transaction policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 125. King &amp; Shine Partners, Ltd., a law firm that conducted due\n   diligence for Shengda, was similarly unaware that SSCM remained a related party.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 133.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Miller alleges that when KPMG-HK became Shengda's auditor, it inquired about related parties and, like those inquiring before it, did not receive an indication from management that SSCM was a related party after July 2007. TAC \u00b6 126. But on February 14, 2009, Michael Tse, a KPMG-HK auditor, learned from A. Carl Mudd, the chair of Shengda's Audit Committee, that X. Chen continued to be SSCM's CEO.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 127, 130. In addition, KPMG-HK knew that Prosper Crown had paid only $9.3 million for SSCM, despite SSCM's 2007 revenues of $45 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 137. Both of these facts suggested that the sale to Prosper Crown was not an arm's length transaction, and that SSCM remained a related party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Miller alleges that what KPMG-HK did upon its discovery that Guo had misrepresented SSCM's status, and that SSCM remained a related party, did not comply with the PCAOB standards in several respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   First, Miller alleges that KPMG-HK did not adequately confirm the precise nature of the relationship between SSCM and Shengda through extrinsic evidence. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 134, 150-152. Because KPMG-HK knew that SSCM was a related party, it was required under the PCAOB standards to obtain assurances from the board that the related-party transaction was approved; to obtain information about the related party and other significant information from intermediaries, other agencies, and the prior auditor; and to confirm the transactions between Shengda and SSCM, among other responsibilities. AU \u00a7\u00a7 315.09, 334.08-.10;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AS No. 18. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 130, 150-151. Miller identifies two specific sources that it contends KPMG-HK should have consulted but did not: Prosper Crown's public corporate records filed in Hong Kong and available on the internet at a cost, and SSCM's AIC filings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 134, 151(a), (d). These sources would have revealed that a Shengda executive, Pu Li, was Prosper Crown's sole director, and its general manager was Zhen Chen (\"Z.

But these allegations are not sufficient to establish that KPMG-HK failed adequately to satisfy the directives of the PCAOB standards Miller cites. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 130, 150-151.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Additional allegations assert that KPMG-HK corresponded with Hansen, King &amp; Shine, Mudd, Shengda management, and the Shengda board generally about the transactions between SSCM and Shengda.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 99-101, 128-134, 209. Miller's allegation that KPMG-HK would have learned something new from consulting the foreign document filings is belied by its allegation that the same names were disclosed in Guo's email to Hansen on February 18, 2008, in which Guo expressly represented that these individuals \"have no relationship with ShengdaTech, Inc.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 118, 151(a).

Surely the Audit Committee, with this knowledge, could infer that Guo's representations regarding SSCM were inaccurate and could respond accordingly. KPMG-HK also communicated directly with Guo after its discovery of the error, informing Guo that Shengda's \"failure to disclose related-party transactions meant that its financial statements contained material errors\" and discussing how to proceed appropriately with 2008 reporting.
