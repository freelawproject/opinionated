The Union's governing body, the National Executive Council, consists of the National President, the National Secretary-Treasurer, the National Vice President for Women and Fair Practices, and the National Vice Presidents for the 12 AFGE districts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 18. The President and the NST are the top two positions in the organization.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15. Plaintiff was elected to serve as NST for two consecutive three-year terms beginning in 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 14-15. After taking office, Hudson alleges that \"AFGE President J. David Cox and his staff harassed [him] on the basis of his race and created a hostile work environment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Although Plaintiff contends that this discriminatory and abusive behavior had been ongoing \"[s]ince 2012,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 20, all of the conduct alleged in the Complaint occurred in the last two years. Over the course of the latter half of 2016, Cox systematically and \"unilaterally stripped\" Hudson of many of his NST duties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 24. First, in June, without receiving approval from the NEC, Cox took away Hudson's supervisory responsibilities for the Information Services department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 23-25. The following month, after Hudson questioned NEC members about travel expenses, his \"investigations\" became a heated discussion topic at an NEC retreat.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 32. In August, Cox \"issued a memorandum stating that he would be the sole authority for all NEC members' travel vouchers, except for his own.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 34. By the end of 2016, Cox had \"removed\" Hudson \"from all chairmanships.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 35. Also, at some point, Plaintiff recommended a promotion for a black member of his staff, which Cox denied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Cox's onslaught against Plaintiff continued into the next year. In January 2017, federal employees received a salary increase to reflect the increased cost of living. AFGE employees, who are pegged to the same scale, also received a bump. In contrast to \"the full Cost of Living Adjustment 2.88%\" that Cox gave himself and an NVP (both white), the Union President only \"gave Plaintiff ... a 2.48% increase.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 22, 26-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The internal strife reached a breaking point after an NVP filed a charge against Hudson. Pursuant to Union protocol, AFGE convened a Committee of Investigation in July 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 36-37. The COI considered five charges, dismissing all but one.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 38-39. It \"found probable cause that a November 15, 2016[,] email that\n   [Plaintiff] sent to AFGE members concerning President Donald Trump's election constituted malfeasance\" under the Union Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 39. In August, the NEC met and \"found NST Hudson guilty based on the single ... charge,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 41, and made the unprecedented decision to remove him from office.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 16 (\"Plaintiff is the first national officer of any race in the history of the AFGE to have been removed from elected office.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Litigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 12, 2017, Hudson filed a lawsuit, alleging that his discharge violated the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) and the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hudson v.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Before addressing the specific counts, a few housekeeping notes are in order. Plaintiff states three statutory bases for this action: Title VII and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1983. Section 1983 is plainly not available here as AFGE is not a state actor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chandler v. W.E.

A plaintiff may, however, invoke \u00a7 1981 when he has \"suffered an injury flowing from the racially motivated breach of his contractual relationship with another party.\"\n   <em>\n    Hamilton v.

In race-discrimination employment cases, Title VII and \u00a7 1981 overlap such that the analysis here applies to both.\n   <em>\n    Ayissi-Etoh v. Fannie Mae\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3662697,3555750\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/712/572/\">\n    712 F.3d 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 576 (D.C.

With that in mind, the Court addresses his counts in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Discrimination\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Title VII makes it \"an unlawful employment practice ... to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual ... because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). As a member of a protected class, Hudson must show that (1) he suffered an adverse employment action (2) because of his race to prevail on his discrimination claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baloch v.
