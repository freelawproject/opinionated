KEELEY, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The defendant, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (\"State\n   Farm\"), has filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, presenting the question whether West Virginia law requires that it pay a\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   share of the attorney's fees and costs incurred by the plaintiff, Dawn Frisenda (\"Frisenda\"), when State Farm applies the non-duplication of benefits provision applicable to Frisenda's underinsured motorist (\"UIM\") coverage. Concluding that State Farm is under no such obligation, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the motion for partial summary judgment (Dkt. No. 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     I.

On March 20, 2015, Frisenda was involved in an automobile collision with the defendant, Lindsey Floyd (\"Floyd\"). Frisenda alleges that Floyd crossed the center line and struck the driver's side of Frisenda's vehicle (Dkt. No. 1-1 at 2). At the time of the accident, State Farm's policy with Frisenda provided $100,000 of UIM coverage and $25,000 of medical payments coverage (\"MPC\"). Floyd's policy with Westfield Insurance Co. (\"Westfield\") provided $50,000 in liability coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Frisenda's policy contained provisions regarding reimbursement, subrogation, and non-duplication of benefits.

On July 7, 2016, Frisenda advised State Farm of her settlement with Westfield, which was contingent on State Farm's consent, waiver of subrogation, and full release of Floyd. Frisenda also reiterated that she had incurred $34,809.27 in medical expenses, and demanded that State Farm pay her the full $100,000 UIM coverage available under her policy (Dkt. No. 33-1). On August 8, 2016, State Farm responded that it would settle Frisenda's UIM claim for $5,707, but failed to address the pending settlement with Westfield (Dkt. No. 33-2). Following further inquiry, on August 30, 2016, State Farm consented to the settlement with Westfield and waived its right to subrogation (Dkt. Nos. 33-3; 33-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On September 20, 2016, State Farm indicated that, after taking into account the non-duplication of damages paid as expenses under MPC, it had determined the amount of the proposed settlement as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-34\">\u2022 Medical Bills $36,716.06 \u2022 Future Medical $13,216.00 \u2022 Lost Wages $1,537.17 \u2022 General Damages $17,000.00 \u2022 Future General Damages $2,000.00 \u2022 Non Duplication Offsets -$14,761.61 for MPC \u2022 Other Insurance -$50,000.00</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (Dkt. No. 33-7). Frisenda asserts that after she provided supplemental records and bills State Farm increased its settlement offer to $7,000. Frisenda then advised State Farm that her lost earning capacity was approximately $174,312, and again demanded that State Farm tender the full $100,000 of available UIM coverage. Rather than do so, State Farm instead requested additional information regarding the permanency of Frisenda's injuries (Dkt. No. 1-1 at 3-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On March 15, 2017, Frisenda filed this action in the Circuit Court of Marion County, West Virginia, against Floyd and State Farm (Dkt. No. 1-1). In addition to her negligence claim against Floyd, Frisenda alleged claims of breach of contract, breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing, and violations of the West Virginia Unfair Trade Practices Act against State Farm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-14. She specifically alleged that \"State Farm failed to reduce its medical payment reimbursement amount by its pro rata share of attorney's fees and costs pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Federal Kemper Insurance Company v. Arnold\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8575034\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/183/31/\">\n    183 W.

No. 1-1 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   State Farm timely removed the case to this Court and filed its answer on May 16, 2017 (Dkt. Nos. 1; 3). In relevant part, State Farm \"denie[d] that it sought reimbursement of medical payments coverage, but affirmatively state[d] and allege[d] that it applied non-duplication of medical payments coverage pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company v. Schatken\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3851418\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/230/201/\">\n    230 W.Va. 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3851418\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/230/201/\">\n    737 S.E.2d 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012)\" (Dkt. No. 3 at 5). Following a scheduling conference on July 28, 2017, the Court set a briefing schedule regarding whether State Farm is required to pay a\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   share of Frisenda's attorney's fees and costs when it applies its policy's non-duplication provision (Dkt. Nos. 8; 9). On August 2, 2017, State Farm\n   advised Frisenda that it was waiving the subrogation of medical payments (Dkt. No. 33-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In its motion for partial summary judgment, State Farm contends that neither West Virginia law nor the language of the policy at issue requires that it pay attorney's fees and costs when applying the non-duplication of benefits provision to prevent a double recovery of Frisenda's damages (Dkt. No. 19). State Farm argues that, although it must share in fees and costs when seeking reimbursement, non-duplication is distinct from reimbursement (Dkt. No. 20 at 5-9). In response, Frisenda contends that non-duplication accomplishes the same purpose as reimbursement, and that State Farm therefore must pay its fair share of the cost Frisenda incurred to create the $50,000 \"common fund\" from Westfield (Dkt. No. 33 at 11-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate where the \"depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials\" establish that \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Rather, she contends that it is inequitable for State Farm to apply non-duplication without accounting for the costs she incurred to recover $50,000 from Floyd's liability carrier (Dkt. No. 33 at 6). Frisenda argues that State Farm's obligation to share in her attorney's fees and costs with regard to amounts paid under MPC should not\n   turn on whether she obtained the policy limits from Floyd's liability carrier.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3851418\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/230/201/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Frisenda's argument is best illustrated by two examples that utilize the coverage available in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The first example assumes that a no-fault insured recovers less than the policy limits from the tortfeasor's liability carrier, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-60\">\u2022 Tortfeasor's Liability Coverage: $50,000.00 \u2022 No-Fault Insured's MPC: $25,000.00 \u2022 No-Fault Insured's UIM Coverage: $100,000.00 \u2022 Total Damages: $40,000.00 \u2022 No-Fault MPC Advancements: $25,000.00 \u2022 Liability Settlement: $40,000.00 \u2022 Attorney's Fees and Costs: -$13,333.33 \u2022 Reimbursement: -$16,666.67 \u2022 Insured's Total Recovery: $35,000.00</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In this example, the insured retained counsel under a one-third contingency fee agreement to secure the $40,000 settlement from her tortfeasor's liability carrier. But, in doing so, the insured never triggers her UIM coverage, because she did not recover the tortfeasor's policy limits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In order to be reimbursed for medical payments, the insurer must account for the cost that its insured incurred to secure the common fund from the liability carrier. Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Federal Kemper\n   </em>\n   , in this example, the insurer does so by reducing its $25,000 reimbursement by one-third to $16,666.67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The second example assumes that the no-fault insured recovers the policy limits from the tortfeasor's carrier, and in fact incurs $30,000 in damages above those policy limits:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-63\">\u2022 Tortfeasor's Liability Coverage: $50,000.00 \u2022 No-Fault Insured's MPC: $25,000.00 \u2022 No-Fault Insured's UIM Coverage: $100,000.00 \u2022 Total Damages: $80,000.00 \u2022 No-Fault MPC Advancements: $25,000.00 \u2022 Liability Settlement: $50,000.00 \u2022 Attorney's Fees and Costs: -$16,666.67 \u2022 UIM Settlement: $5,000.00 \u2022 Attorney's Fees and Costs: -$1,666.67 \u2022 Insured's Total Recovery: $61,666.66</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Here, the insured retained counsel pursuant to a one-third contingency fee agreement, and collected the $50,000 policy limits from her tortfeasor's liability carrier, thus triggering the insured's UIM coverage for her remaining $30,000 in damages. In reliance on the non-duplication provision of its policy, the insurer reduces\n   what would otherwise be a $30,000 UIM settlement by the $25,000 already advanced under MPC, thus arriving at a UIM settlement of $5,000. Under State Farm's approach, the insurer does not account for attorney's fees and costs when crediting the $25,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   At bottom, Frisenda argues that it is inequitable for State Farm to apply its policy's non-duplication provision where it could have paid the full $30,000 in UIM coverage and recovered the MPC advancement through reimbursement (Dkt. No. 33 at 15). To account for this perceived inequity, Frisenda would have the Court extend\n   <em>\n    Federal Kemper\n   </em>\n   to scenarios in which an insurer applies non-duplication rather than reimbursement. Frisenda cites absolutely no authority in support of her position, and every court in West Virginia that has considered the question has rejected Frisenda's argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , No. 5:12CV23,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202533832\">\n    2014 WL 2533832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Walker v.
