AFRICK, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The question is, what substantive law governs plaintiffs' case? BP Exploration and Production Inc. (\"BP Exploration\"), BP America Production Company (\"BP America\") (collectively, \"the BP defendants\"), and Bishop Lifting Products, Inc. (\"Bishop\") argue that Louisiana law applies to this negligence action, at least as to plaintiffs' tort claims against them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs counter that general maritime law, not Louisiana law, applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before the Court are three motions\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   for summary judgment on this narrow, yet significant, issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The MAD DOG is an oil and gas spar platform located on the Outer Continental Shelf (\"OCS\") in the Gulf of Mexico that is owned and operated by BP Exploration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In March 2016, a vessel-the OCSV SIEM STINGRAY (\"STINGRAY\")-was being used as a \"flotel,\" or living quarters, for at least some of the MAD DOG's crew and subcontractors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time, BP Exploration was the time charterer of the STINGRAY.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   While BP America employs many of the personnel on the MAD DOG, it does not employ them all. For example, Bishop had at least one employee stationed on the MAD DOG in March 2016. Ensco PLC Drilling (\"Ensco\") also had employees stationed on the MAD DOG, including Robert Hicks (\"Hicks\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In March 2016, Hicks was working as a rig electrician on the MAD DOG pursuant to a contract between Ensco and BP Exploration. He was \"rooming\" on the STINGRAY at the time,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and would be transferred\n   to and from the MAD DOG via a personnel basket. The crane facilitating the transfers was located on the MAD DOG.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Hicks alleges that, on March 20, 2016, he was injured during one of these transfers. According to Hicks, the personnel basket in which he was being transferred \"hit the deck of the [STINGRAY],\" then \"jerked up\" before it \"hit the [STINGRAY] again.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hicks contends that he \"fell down in the basket\" the second time that it made contact with the STINGRAY, with \"one leg in [the basket] and one leg out of it.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Hicks and his wife eventually initiated this tort action. They allege that negligence attributable to BP Exploration, BP America, and Bishop-as well as other defendants-during the March 20, 2016 personnel basket transfer from the MAD DOG to the STINGRAY caused the injuries about which Hicks now complains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Summary judgment is proper when, after reviewing the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits, the court determines that there is no genuine dispute of material fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.
