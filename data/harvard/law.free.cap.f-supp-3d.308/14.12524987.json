Therefore, the Court finds that the plaintiff has at most pleaded facts \"consistent with\" an improper disclosure, but that \"stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief\" under the Privacy Act. <em>Twombly</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">550 U.S. at 557</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">127 S.Ct. 1955</extracted-citation> (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Furthermore, the plaintiff has alleged no injury apart from his one-month incarceration, which, as concluded above, cannot yet support a claim.
