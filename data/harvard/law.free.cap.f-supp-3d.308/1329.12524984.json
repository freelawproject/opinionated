Both claim that Commerce, when determining the export prices or constructed export prices of the sales of their subject merchandise, erred in making deductions for unrefunded value-added tax (\"VAT\") incurred in China. Qihang's Br. 5-15; Xugong's Br. 71-78. They also claim that the Department's calculation of a \"surrogate\" value for one of their production materials, reclaimed rubber, was not supported by substantial evidence on the record. Qihang's Br. 33-54; Xugong's Br. 23-38. In their third claim in common, both contest the method by which Commerce valued foreign inland freight in China. Qihang's Br. 15-33; Xugong's Br. 38-44.

The provision directs Commerce to reduce the starting price by \"the amount, if included in such price, of any export tax, duty, or other charge imposed by the exporting country on the exportation of the subject merchandise to the United States, other than an export tax, duty, or other charge described in section 1677(6)(C) of this title.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For the Final Results, Commerce made several findings concerning value-added tax incurred in China by the two mandatory respondents.

Further finding that the irrecoverable VAT was the difference between the 17% \"standard VAT levy\" and the 9% \"rebate\" rate, i.e., 8%, Commerce reduced both respondents' EP or CEP starting prices by an amount it calculated as 8% of the free-on-board (\"FOB\") value of the exported subject merchandise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.402\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.402\">\n    at 23-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While the Final Issues and Decision Memorandum contains findings of fact and conclusions of law pertaining to value-added tax, that specific factual finding, or one equivalent to it, does not appear in the document. Commerce stated that irrecoverable VAT \"\n   <em>\n    amounts to\n   </em>\n   an export tax, duty, or other charge imposed on exported merchandise,\"\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 22 (emphasis added), and \"is a product-specific export tax, duty, or other charge that is\n   <em>\n    incurred\n   </em>\n   on the exportation of subject merchandise,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.402\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.402\">\n    at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

At least arguably, a value-added tax incurred on materials used in production has been \"imposed\" on something other than exportation and already has been incurred by the time the exportation of the finished good occurs. And although the term \"tax, duty, or\n   <em>\n    other charge\n   </em>\n   \" is broader than the word \"tax,\" the provision requires that any such \"charge\" be \"imposed ...\n   <em>\n    on\n   </em>\n   the exportation\" of the good, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B) (emphasis added).

The reference to \"current law\" clarifies that the downward adjustment to EP and CEP for \"export taxes or other charges\" (the \"export tax\" adjustment) under the new statute was intended to be the same downward adjustment as the downward adjustment to purchase price and exporter's sale price (identified collectively in the statute\n   as \"United States price\") as was made under the prior statute. That is, the only change to the export tax adjustment Congress intended to make in enacting the URAA was the change to the new terminology used to describe what was being adjusted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The statutory language specifying the adjustment for export taxes, duties, and other charges, i.e., the \"export tax\" adjustment, was not materially changed by the URAA. Consistent with the explanation in the SAA that no change was intended in this adjustment, Congress retained in the post-URAA section 772(c)(2)(B) the provision accomplishing the adjustment that was nearly identical to that of section 772(d)(2)(B), as codified by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (\"TAA\"), the antecedent provision. Trade Agreements Act of 1979, Pub. L. No. 96-39, \u00a7 101,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20Stat.%20144\">\n    93 Stat. 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 182 (1979). Therefore, the court must decide if Congress had an intention on whether the TAA export tax adjustment would apply to materials used in the production of a good in a foreign country that was not remitted or avoided by reason of exportation of the finished good. The court concludes that Congress intended that it would not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Just prior to enactment of the URAA in 1994, section 772, in all respects relevant to the issue presented here, was unchanged from the form in which it was enacted as part of the TAA. Significant to this discussion is that the 1979 statute included not only the export tax adjustment, which if applied would increase a dumping margin, but then also included an\n   <em>\n    upward\n   </em>\n   adjustment to purchase price and exporter's sales price, i.e., an adjustment that would\n   <em>\n    reduce\n   </em>\n   a dumping margin, that applied to recoverable value-added taxes. The two foreign-tax-related provisions that appeared in the TAA version of the statute are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   The purchase price and the exporter's sales price shall be adjusted by being-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (1) increased by-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (C) the amount of any taxes imposed in the country of exportation directly upon the exported merchandise or components thereof, which have been rebated, or which have not been collected, by reason of the exportation of the merchandise to the United States, but only to the extent that such taxes are added to or included in the price of such or similar merchandise when sold in the country of exportation ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   (2) reduced by-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (B) the amount, if included in such price, of any export tax, duty, or other charge imposed by the country of exportation on the exportation of the merchandise to the United States other than an export tax, duty, or other charge described in section 1677(6)(C) of this title.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(d) (1982). A comparison of the language Congress used in the two provisions demonstrates an intent to address different classes of taxes in each. In \u00a7 1677a(d)(1)(C), Congress addressed a tax \"imposed\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   the country of exportation directly\n   <em>\n    upon\n   </em>\n   the exported merchandise\" or the components used to produce it. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(d)(1)(C) (1982) (emphasis added). This language plainly describes a domestic tax such as a VAT. Any amount of such tax that was refunded, or not collected, by reason of exportation to the United States would reduce a dumping margin if it was reflected in prices of home-market sales of identical or similar merchandise. Consistent with its plain\n   meaning, the provision generally was understood to refer to recoverable VAT imposed by the country of exportation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Federal-Mogul Corp. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416776\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/63/1572/\">\n    63 F.3d 1572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In contrast, Congress provided in \u00a7 1677a(d)(2)(B) (1982) (and currently in \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B) ) that a tax, duty, or other charge in the home-market country imposed\n   <em>\n    on the exportation\n   </em>\n   of the merchandise to the United States, if included in the price of the merchandise, would\n   <em>\n    increase\n   </em>\n   a dumping margin (unless intended to offset a countervailable subsidy). The provision does not refer to domestic taxes imposed on the merchandise itself, and there is no mention of a tax imposed on components of that merchandise, as there was in \u00a7 1677a(d)(1)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Because of the different language Congress used in the two provisions, any attempt to interpret \u00a7 1677a(d)(2)(B) to address irrecoverable VAT poses an insurmountable problem. The differences in the two provisions of the TAA demonstrate congressional awareness of a distinction between domestic taxes, such as value-added taxes, that are imposed directly\n   <em>\n    on\n   </em>\n   finished goods or the components thereof (which had the potential to result in an adjustment that reduces a dumping margin), and taxes imposed\n   <em>\n    on the exportation\n   </em>\n   of finished, exported goods (which had the potential to result in an adjustment that increases a dumping margin). While specifying in \u00a7 1677a(d)(1)(C) that a dumping margin would be reduced for a domestic tax, such as a VAT, if it was recovered (or not collected) by reason of exportation and appeared in the price of the foreign like product, Congress did not provide for a margin adjustment, downward or upward, for\n   <em>\n    irrecoverable\n   </em>\n   VAT. Congress having addressed taxes such as value-added taxes in subparagraph (1)(C) of \u00a7 1677a(d), it would be unreasonable, and illogical, to conclude that Congress also intended to address these same types of taxes in subparagraph (2)(B), in which it used language that was different and unsuitable for that purpose. Congress plainly was aware that a foreign government might impose a domestic tax on materials used in producing a good that is later exported to the United States and also aware that such a tax might be, or might not be, recovered or not collected by reason of the exportation of the good made from those materials. The plain meaning of the two provisions, when read together, demonstrates congressional intent\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to increase a dumping margin for VAT, whether or not recoverable upon exportation of the finished good. In sum, the 1979 TAA reduced a dumping margin for\n   <em>\n    recoverable\n   </em>\n   VAT that was present in home-market prices, increased a dumping margin for taxes, duties, and other charges imposed on the exportation of the finished good to the United States, if appearing in the purchase price or exporter's sale price (unless imposed to adjust for a countervailable subsidy), and made no margin adjustment at all for\n   <em>\n    irrecoverable\n   </em>\n   VAT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   While imposing the same adjustment to United States price (now EP and CEP) for export taxes as did the TAA, the URAA converted the \u00a7 1677a(d)(1)(C) upward adjustment to United States price to a downward adjustment to normal value, where it also would reduce a dumping margin. A side-by-side comparison of the TAA and URAA provisions illustrates the change. As noted above, the TAA increased United States price (and thereby reduced dumping margins) by:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   the amount of any taxes imposed in the country of exportation directly upon the exported merchandise or components thereof, which have been rebated, or which have not been collected, by reason of the exportation of the merchandise to\n   the United States, but only to the extent that such taxes are added to or included in the price of such or similar merchandise when sold in the country of exportation ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(d)(1)(C) (1982). As amended by the URAA, the antidumping statute reduces the price by which normal value is determined (and thereby reduces dumping margins) by\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   the amount of any taxes imposed directly upon the foreign like product or components thereof which have been rebated, or which have not been collected, on the subject merchandise, but only to the extent that such taxes are added to or included in the price of the foreign like product ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(6)(B)(iii). This provision has remained in the antidumping law since the 1994 enactment of the URAA and is unchanged in the current statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The SAA discussed the change from the TAA version to the URAA version as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   The deduction from normal value for indirect taxes constitutes a change from the existing statute. The change is intended to ensure that dumping margins will be tax-neutral. The requirement that the home-market consumption taxes in question be \"added to or included in the price\" of the foreign like product is intended to insure that such taxes actually have been charged and paid on the home market sales used to calculate normal value, rather than charged on sales of such merchandise in the home market generally. It would be inappropriate to reduce a foreign price by the amount of the tax, unless a tax liability had actually been incurred on that sale.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    SAA\n   </em>\n   at 827-28,\n   <em>\n    reprinted in\n   </em>\n   1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4166.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Federal-Mogul Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416776\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/63/1572/\">\n    63 F.3d at 1575-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which was decided after enactment of the URAA but on a factual situation arising under the prior TAA provisions, the Court of Appeals noted that Commerce had a practice under the TAA of addressing recoverable VAT by making a downward adjustment to normal value rather than an upward adjustment to U.S. price. The Court of Appeals affirmed this practice, noting that doing so corrects a mathematical problem that understated the downward margin adjustment, from the standpoint of achieving tax neutrality, when the adjustment is made to U.S. price.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416776\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/63/1572/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416776\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/63/1572/\">\n    at 1580-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Unless a downward margin adjustment is made, home-market taxes such as a VAT, if present in the price of the foreign like product but, due to recovery upon exportation, not present in the U.S. price (i.e., the purchase price or the exporter's sales price under the TAA, and the export price or constructed export price under the URAA), improperly inflate a dumping margin. To obtain a tax-neutral price comparison, the margin-inflating effect of a recoverable domestic tax is removed from the margin calculation, either by adding it to the U.S. price (under the previous law) or by removing it from the home-market price (under the current statute). On the other hand, an \"export\" tax, i.e., an export tax, duty, or other charge that is incurred upon the exportation of the merchandise, is by definition one that is not present in the home-market price of the foreign like product. Congress intended that such a tax, if present in the U.S. price, should be removed from U.S. price to achieve a tax-neutral price comparison between normal value (when based on the home-market price or other comparison-market\n   price) and U.S. price, unless imposed to offset a countervailable subsidy. In summary, Congress provided, in both the TAA and the URAA, a statutory scheme under which home-market taxes that are recoverable upon exportation, such as recoverable VAT, the adjustment for which would reduce a dumping margin, are treated one way and export taxes, the adjustment for which would increase a dumping margin, are treated the opposite way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   It can now readily be seen that the Department's interpretation of the current \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B) to require a margin increase for irrecoverable VAT, which is not supported by the plain meaning of the provision, also conflicts with the legislative purpose. A foreign exporter of a product upon which VAT, a domestic tax, was imposed (either on the product itself or components therein) will receive a reduction in the dumping margin to the extent the VAT appears in the home-market price but does not appear in the U.S. price that is compared to that price, i.e., to the extent the VAT is refunded or not collected as a result of exportation (\"recoverable\" VAT). The downward adjustment to the margin (whether effected by an upward adjustment to U.S. price, as under former law, or a downward adjustment to normal value, as under current law) restores the balance to tax-neutrality. On the other hand, Congress intended that VAT that appears in both the home-market price and also in the U.S. price, because it is irrecoverable upon export, would result in neither an upward nor a downward adjustment to the dumping margin. Having incurred it, the foreign producer or exporter can be expected to pass it on by including it in the U.S. price, and there is no justification for removing this domestic tax from the U.S. price. Because the irrecoverable VAT is present in the home-market price of the foreign like product and also in the U.S. price, the comparison is already tax-neutral, and no adjustment to the dumping margin is required or appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The producer or exporter already lost the benefit of any downward adjustment to the margin to the extent the VAT was not recovered, in that the downward adjustment to normal value (as was the previous upward adjustment to U.S. price) is limited to recoverable VAT. This stands in contrast to an export tax, which may be present in the U.S. price but, by definition, cannot be present in the home-market price. This is because, as the URAA recognized in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B) (which is continued in current law) and the TAA recognized in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(d)(2)(B) (1982), an export tax, duty, or other charge under the \"export tax\" provision is limited to one that is \"imposed by the exporting country on the\n   <em>\n    exportation\n   </em>\n   of the subject merchandise to the United States.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(d)(2)(B) (1982) (\"imposed by the country of exportation\n   <em>\n    on the exportation\n   </em>\n   of the merchandise to the United States\") (emphasis added). The Department's construction of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B) to increase a dumping margin for irrecoverable VAT does not achieve tax neutrality but upsets the balance the statute is intended to achieve,\n   impermissibly inflating a dumping margin by the amount of the irrecoverable VAT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   To summarize, because irrecoverable VAT would be present in both the price of the foreign like product and the U.S. price, no adjustment to the margin is necessary to achieve tax neutrality. Making an adjustment under these circumstances by reducing the starting price for EP or CEP by the amount of the irrecoverable VAT would be \"double-counting\" the effect of the irrecoverable VAT, inflating the dumping margin accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Up to this point, the court's analysis considered comparisons between U.S. price and normal value that is based on price, either in the home market or another comparison market. The court now considers this issue in the context of situations in which normal value is not based on price. Normal value may be based on constructed value (under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(e) ) and, in the special case of goods produced in a non-market economy country, ordinarily is based on valuation of factors of production according to the best available information in a market economy country Commerce considers appropriate (under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c) ). In the case of constructed value, the Tariff Act includes a provision to ensure that the cost of materials used in producing the subject imported merchandise do not include a recoverable internal tax such as a VAT. Under this provision, \"the cost of materials shall be determined without regard to any internal tax in the exporting country imposed on such materials or their disposition that is remitted or refunded upon exportation of the subject merchandise produced from such materials.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(e). The use of the term \"internal tax\" distinguishes the provision from the export tax adjustment, which applies only to external taxes imposed on exportation. No provision parallel to \u00a7 1677b(e) is in \u00a7 1677b(c), which addresses normal value for non-market economy countries based on surrogate values for factors of production. This omission is logical because the prices for the materials in the home-market, non-market economy country ordinarily are not used in calculating normal value under that provision. But here also, the objective of tax neutrality is still relevant, as Commerce implicitly recognizes in preferring surrogate values that are exclusive of taxes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Commerce explained in the review that previously it did not adjust EP and CEP starting prices for Chinese irrecoverable VAT but that \"[i]n 2012, we announced a change of methodology with respect to the calculation of the EP or CEP to include an adjustment for irrecoverable VAT in certain NME [non-market economy] countries, in accordance with section 772(c)(2)(B) of the Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 22 (citing\n   <em>\n    Methodological Change for Implementation of Section 772(c)(2)(B) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as Amended, In Certain Non-Market Economy Antidumping Proceedings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2036%2C481\">\n    77 Fed.

In\n   <em>\n    Methodological Change\n   </em>\n   , Commerce explained that its administrative practice had been not to make the adjustment to EP and CEP starting prices under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B) when the good was exported from a non-market economy country \"because pervasive government intervention in NMEs precluded proper valuation of taxes paid by NME respondents to NME governments.\"\n   <em>\n    Methodological Change\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2036%2C481\">\n    77 Fed. Reg. at 36,482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the notice, Commerce concluded that for certain non-market economy countries, specifically China and Vietnam, under its countervailing duty practice it now believed it could \"determine whether the Chinese or Vietnamese governments have bestowed an identifiable and measurable benefit upon a producer,\n   and whether the benefit is specific, including certain measures related to taxation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2036%2C481\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On that reasoning, Commerce announced that for antidumping investigations and reviews of merchandise from China and Vietnam \"the Department will determine whether, as a matter of law, regulation, or other official action, the NME government has imposed 'an export tax, duty, or other charge' upon export of the subject merchandise during the period of investigation or the period of review (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , an export tax or VAT that is not fully refunded upon exportation).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2036%2C481\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As applied to an internal tax such as a VAT, this reasoning was contrary to the congressional intent underlying 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Rather than take account of the differences between an export tax and an internal tax such as a VAT imposed domestically on materials used in production in the country of exportation,\n   <em>\n    Methodological Change\n   </em>\n   treats all irrecoverable VAT in a non-market economy country as the equivalent of an export tax for purposes of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B). This is erroneous for the reasons the court discussed previously: Congress drew a clear distinction between the export tax adjustment, which it addressed in \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B), and VAT imposed domestically in the country of production, on the good or the materials used to make it, which it addressed in the normal value provisions of the statute. Congress was familiar with the concept of irrecoverable VAT and addressed it by enacting provisions under which irrecoverable VAT would neither increase nor decrease a dumping margin. In carefully crafting \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B) to apply only to export taxes and other charges imposed upon exportation of the good, and not to internal taxes imposed by the country of exportation (whether or not recoverable upon export), Congress made no exception for the determination of EP or CEP for goods exported from non-market economy countries. To the contrary, while such countries are treated differently as to the determination of normal value,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c), they are not treated differently as to the determination of U.S. price (EP or CEP),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a. It is noteworthy that the non-market economy provisions of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c) predated the URAA, having been enacted as part of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, replacing the more limited provisions relating to state-controlled economies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-418, \u00a7 1316(a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=102%20Stat.%201107\">\n    102 Stat. 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1186-87 (1988). The 1988 amendments did not make changes to \u00a7 1677a(d)(2)(B), which addressed export taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   From the time of the 1988 amendments to the present, there has been no indication that Congress intended for value-added taxes imposed by non-market economy countries to be treated differently under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(d)(2)(B) (1982) (now \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B) ) than those imposed by market economy countries. The reasoning Commerce put forth in\n   <em>\n    Methodological Change\n   </em>\n   , which applies only to certain non-market economy countries, is based on a contrary, and invalid, assumption. Broadly stated, normal value is the value at which a good\n   <em>\n    should be\n   </em>\n   sold in the U.S. market in order to be considered to be fairly traded under the antidumping duty laws. U.S. price (EP or CEP) is the adjusted price at which the good\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   sold in the U.S. market. Unlike the method of determining the former, the method of determining the latter does not change in the special situation in which the good is exported from a non-market economy country.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b. Under the correct implementation of the statute, irrecoverable VAT does not result in an increase or a decrease in a dumping margin, regardless of whether the exporting\n   country is a market economy country or a non-market economy country.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In the Final Issues and Decision Memorandum, Commerce attempts to distinguish China from other countries with respect to VAT. Commerce compared the Chinese VAT system with what it called a \"typical VAT system,\" according to which producers \"receive on export a full rebate of the VAT which they pay on purchases of inputs used in the production of exports ('input VAT'), and, in the case of domestic sales, the company can credit the VAT they pay on input purchases for those sales against the VAT they collect from customers.\"\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 22 (footnote omitted). According to Commerce, \"[t]hat stands in contrast to the PRC's VAT regime, where some portion of the input VAT that a company pays on purchases of inputs used in the production of exports is not refunded.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=102%20Stat.%201107\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (footnote omitted). Under the Department's flawed reasoning, Chinese irrecoverable VAT is within the scope of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B) simply because it is irrecoverable. Were this reasoning sound, any VAT not recovered or avoided by reason of exportation of the finished good, regardless of the country of exportation, would have to be treated the same way, i.e., to increase a dumping margin. As the history and purpose of the statute demonstrate, that is not what Congress intended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Because the Department's interpretation of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B) to allow it to deduct irrecoverable VAT from EP or CEP starting prices is not supported by plain meaning and is contrary to congressional intent, it must be set aside according to\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   Step One. Defendant cites decisions in which this Court concluded that the Department's interpretation is a reasonable one, Def.'s Br. 46-49, and the court notes that other decisions of this Court also have reached that conclusion. In these prior decisions, the issue of whether the Department's interpretation was consistent with statutory history and legislative purpose, and with legislative history as shown in the SAA, does not appear to have been argued, as that issue is not addressed in the various opinions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diamond Sawblades Mfrs.'

They argue that the AUV obtained from the Thai GTA import data was aberrational when compared to other record data and that it also was aberrational because it was higher than the surrogate values Commerce applied to natural rubber. According to Xugong and Qihang, the historical record data demonstrate that reclaimed rubber prices over the last thirty years always have been lower than the prices for natural rubber. Both argue that Commerce should have used, as the best available information, an AUV obtained from GTA data on Peruvian imports of reclaimed rubber, which was $0.53 per kilogram, and which was lower than the AUV shown in the Peruvian data for natural rubber.\n   <em>\n    See Provision of Initial Surrogate Values by Xuzhou Xugong Tyres Co. Ltd.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 7 (Mar. 19, 2015) (P.R. Docs. 128-32) (\"\n   <em>\n    Xugong Initial SV Submission\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The record contained GTA import data on reclaimed rubber from countries Commerce considered to be economically comparable to China that allowed Commerce to determine per-kilogram AUVs, based on quantities, as follows: Peru ($0.53, based on 1,102,938 kg.), Belarus ($0.73, based on 1,479,490 kg.), Bulgaria ($0.79, based on\n   367,000 kg.), Serbia ($0.82, based on 306,485 kg.), Ukraine ($0.90, based on 93,521 kg.), Ecuador ($0.99, based on 170,346 kg.), Romania ($1.07, based on 3,967,111 kg.), South Africa ($1.34, based on 312,374 kg.), Montenegro ($1.41, based on 839 kg.), Colombia ($1.84, based on 16,002 kg.), Algeria ($2.21, based on 58,157 kg.), Thailand ($2.49, based on 205,384 kg.), Jordan ($12.94, based on 249 kg.), and Paraguay ($19.57, based on 53 kg.).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Qihang's Br. 43. Commerce viewed the AUVs for Jordan and Paraguay as \"truly aberrational\" and excluded them from consideration.\n   <em>\n    Final Results of the 2013-2014 Administrative Review of the Antidumping Duty Order on Certain New Pneumatic off-The-Road Tires from the People's Republic of China: Surrogate Value Memorandum\n   </em>\n   6 (Apr. 12, 2016) (P.R. Doc. 336) (\"\n   <em>\n    Final Surrogate Value Mem.\n   </em>\n   \"). The small quantities on which the AUVs for Jordan and Paraguay were based (249 kg. and 53 kg., respectively) would appear to make these AUVs unsuitable for use as surrogate values for this reason as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Commerce concluded that the surrogate value based on the Thai GTA data was not aberrational, giving several reasons. Commerce recognized that the Thai AUV was approximately two-and-one-half times as large as the median value obtained from most of the other potential surrogate countries on the list prepared by its Office of Policy but stated that \"we do not find this price difference to be so substantial as to call into question the validity of the Thai value or constitute evidence of aberrationality.\"\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 55-56 (footnote omitted). It also found that the quantity of imports represented by the Thai reclaimed rubber value of $2.49, which was 205,384 kg., was \"a commercially viable quantity which is not distortive.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56-57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Commerce also addressed the issue of whether the Thai-based value of $2.49 per kilogram was aberrational because it was higher than the Thai-based values for natural rubber, ($2.01 per kilogram for technically-specified natural rubber and $2.28 per kilogram for ribbed smoked sheets). Commerce concluded it was not, citing record data showing that \"the price of natural rubber has dropped by 32-33 percent over the POR itself, and more so over the years before\" and that \"the value of reclaimed rubber, in comparison, has risen over the past years, 138 percent since 2009, and this rise has been at a generally steady increase.\"\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 56 (footnotes omitted). Commerce concluded that \"[w]ith such a significant decrease in price for natural rubber in the POR, that natural rubber may fall below the cost of the consistently steadily increasing reclaimed rubber does not signal that the reclaimed rubber value is aberrational or unusual.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Department's conclusion that the surrogate value of $2.49 per kilogram for reclaimed rubber is not aberrational lacks the support of substantial evidence on the record. The record includes data on the historical relationship between the price of natural rubber and that of reclaimed rubber, which is in the form of a table Commerce included in its final surrogate value memorandum (\"Chart C: Historical Price of Natural Rubber vs. Reclaimed Rubber\").\n   <em>\n    See Final Surrogate Value Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 10. The table shows that over the 30 years between 1983 and 2013, the price for reclaimed rubber consistently has been lower than the price of natural rubber and, as a general matter, much lower.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The chart shows that despite the rise in the value of reclaimed rubber and the fall in the price of natural rubber over the last several years that are shown in the table, the price of natural rubber, as of 2013 (the last year shown in the table), still was approximately 180% higher than the price of reclaimed rubber.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Commerce relied on the movement\n   in the prices of both commodities to conclude that the value of reclaimed rubber could be higher than the value of natural rubber, but this conclusion is refuted by the record evidence in the 30-year table. Also, record evidence that reclaimed rubber is used in production of off-the-road tires instead of natural rubber because of its cost advantage is not rebutted by other record evidence. And as Commerce itself acknowledged, the Thai AUV for reclaimed rubber was approximately two-and-one-half times the median value for this product obtained from import data from most of the other potential surrogate countries. Because the Department's finding that its surrogate value for reclaimed rubber is not aberrational is unsupported by the record evidence considered as a whole, Commerce cannot be said to have reached a valid finding that it valued reclaimed rubber according to the \"best available information\" as required by 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)(1). Commerce must reconsider that value and reach a new determination based on findings supported by substantial evidence on the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <em>\n    2. Surrogate Value for Foreign Inland Freight\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Xugong and Qihang claim that the surrogate value Commerce applied to foreign inland freight in China, which was based on data for Thailand, was not supported by substantial record evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Xugong's Br. 38-44; Qihang's Br. 15-33. Commerce used the Thai data to calculate a surrogate freight rate of $0.0015 per kilogram, per kilometer.\n   <em>\n    Final Surrogate Value Mem.\n   </em>\n   at Attach. I. Xugong and Qihang challenge the method by which the surrogate value was calculated. In the alternative, they argue that Commerce should have used record data other than the data Commerce used in determining the surrogate value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In calculating normal value according to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c), Commerce adds to the price of material inputs a surrogate cost for the expense incurred for inland transportation of the materials, i.e., truck freight, to the point of production. It also deducts from U.S. price (EP or CEP) a surrogate cost for the expense of transporting finished goods to the port of exportation. To calculate a surrogate value for this \"foreign inland freight\" in the sixth review, Commerce used a World Bank report entitled\n   <em>\n    Doing Business 2015: Thailand\n   </em>\n   , which estimated at $210 the cost of transporting products in a standard 20-foot shipping container weighing 10 metric tons from the largest city in Thailand, i.e., Bangkok, to the nearest seaport.\n   <em>\n    See Petitioners' First Surrogate Value Submission\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 9 (Mar. 19, 2015) (P.R. Docs. 138-39). The 2015 Doing Business report did not present information on the actual distance goods would have to travel to reach a seaport.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, to use the information in the 2015 report in calculating a per-kilogram, per-kilometer surrogate cost for foreign inland freight, Commerce estimated the average distance from 26 industrial districts in Bangkok to the nearest seaport, for use as the denominator in the calculation.\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 57-62. The distance Commerce used, both for the Preliminary Results and the Final Results, was 13.87 kilometers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60. Using this average distance, Commerce calculated its surrogate freight rate of $0.0015 per kilogram, per kilometer.\n   <em>\n    Final Surrogate Value Mem.\n   </em>\n   at Attach. I. Xugong and Qihang view this distance as unreasonably low (causing the rate derived therefrom to be excessively high) and unsupported by the record data. The 13.87 kilometer estimate was derived from information in a table listing various locations in Bangkok, submitted to the record by the petitioner.\n   <em>\n    See Petitioners' Second Surrogate Value Submission\n   </em>\n   at Attach. 8 (Aug. 31, 2015) (P.R. Docs. 253-54). The source of the table was a \"Bangkok Post\" document describing\n   various \"districts\" of Bangkok, located within \"clusters.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In addition to freight-cost information relating to Thailand, the record contained information relating to freight costs in Indonesia, submitted by Qihang,\n   <em>\n    see Qingdao Qihang Tyre Co. Ltd.-Initial Surrogate Value Submission\n   </em>\n   at Ex. SV-24 (Mar. 19, 2015) (P.R. Docs. 121-26), and information relating to freight costs in Peru, which Xugong submitted,\n   <em>\n    see Xugong Initial SV Submission\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 8. In the Final Issues and Decision Memorandum, Commerce did not discuss the information relating to freight costs in Indonesia and Peru, confining its discussion to the record data pertaining to Thailand.\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 57-62. Specifically, Commerce directed most of the discussion to the choice of data from which it could estimate an average distance from industrial locations in Thailand to the nearest port. Commerce concluded that the record was sufficiently developed to support consideration of only three \"usable\" distances in Thailand: the 13.87 kilometer average distance, a second calculated distance of 8.3 kilometers, which was the distance from downtown Bangkok to the port of Bangkok as determined in the Department's investigation of Certain Passenger Vehicle and Light Truck Tires from China that also used the 2015 Doing Business in Thailand report, and a distance of 9.51 kilometers, which was developed \"from a list of the distances to the Port of Bangkok from all Thai companies that provided information for\n   <em>\n    Doing Business in Thailand 2015\n   </em>\n   for which the World Bank provided an address.\"\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 61. Commerce concluded that \"given the paucity of information on the record supporting distances higher than 13.87 km, the Department has determined to use the same distance from the\n   <em>\n    Preliminary Results\n   </em>\n   in the final results in its calculation of inland freight for these final results.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Xugong and Qihang raise various objections to the Department's surrogate freight rate. Qihang objects that Commerce, in past proceedings, inconsistently has used various distances that the freight would travel in Thailand, most of which are much greater than 13.87 kilometers, Qihang's Br. 19-22, and should have considered the information in the Department's possession from past proceedings in determining the reasonableness of its determination,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 26. Qihang also argues that in past cases Commerce has used distances to two Thailand ports, the ports of Bangkok and Laem Chabang, rather than only the port of Bangkok.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23. Qihang further contends that, if the record did not contain sufficient data, Commerce should have taken \"steps to develop the record further to satisfy its statutory obligation to support its decision through substantial record evidence.\" Qihang's Br. 23;\n   <em>\n    see Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 61 (\"Parties did not provide significant comments or rebuttal distance information during the period of time made available for surrogate value information.\"). Additionally, Qihang points out that despite its \"suggesting that it was a superior source, Commerce failed to even acknowledge the data on the record with respect to the Peruvian truck price quote and distance map submitted by Xugong.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. Finally, Qihang argues that the Department unreasonably rejected Qihang's attempt to supplement the record with a more recent report,\n   <em>\n    Doing Business 2016: Thailand\n   </em>\n   , which contained freight distance information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Xugong argues that the Department's calculation of 13.87 kilometers as the distance from industrial locations in Bangkok to the nearest port was unsupported by substantial evidence because \"there is no record support for petitioners' assertion that the 26 districts selected by\n   petitioners are in fact 'industrial' districts.\" Xugong's Br. 40. Xugong also argues that \"[w]ith respect to which country's data contains the 'best available domestic inland freight data,' Commerce in fact has conducted no record analysis whatsoever concerning the Peruvian freight data.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Xugong's Br. 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Without ruling on the parties' other arguments, the court finds that on this final point Xugong is correct. Despite Qihang's argument in its case brief that \"the record evidence on inland freight costs from Peru does not pose the problems that exist with respect to the Thai data,\"\n   <em>\n    see Qingdao Qihang Tyre Co. Ltd.-Revised Administrative Case Brief\n   </em>\n   at 14 (Dec. 21, 2015) (P.R. Doc. 321) (\"\n   <em>\n    Qihang's Case Br.\n   </em>\n   \"), Commerce, in the Final Issues and Decision Memorandum, did not address the issue of whether the inland freight data from Peru could constitute the best available information on the record.\n   <em>\n    See Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 57-62. Defendant concedes that Commerce did not address Qihang's argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. 41.

Commerce was obligated to consider Qihang's argument that the inland freight data from Peru were better than the competing data from Thailand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SKF USA Inc. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052677\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/1365/#p1374\">\n    630 F.3d 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (\"Commerce also has an 'obligation' to address important factors raised by comments from petitioners and respondents.\" (citations omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   On this record, which contained alternate information that could be used in calculating a surrogate value, Commerce was obligated to determine what information constituted the \"best available information.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)(1). The regulation upon which defendant relies,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.408\">\n    19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2), does not compel a conclusion to the contrary. The regulation provides that \"the Secretary\n   <em>\n    normally\n   </em>\n   will value all factors in a single surrogate country.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.408\">\n    19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) (emphasis added). The regulation uses the word \"normally,\" indicating that Commerce retains the discretion to use data from more than one market-economy country in valuing the various factors of production. The statute contemplates situations in which Commerce may need to rely upon data from more than one surrogate country in order to fulfill its statutory obligation to value a\n   factor of production according to the \"best available information.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)(1) (\"the valuation of the factors of production shall be based on the best available information regarding the values of such factors in a market economy country\n   <em>\n    or countries\n   </em>\n   considered to be appropriate by the administering authority.\" (emphasis added) ). While the regulation expresses a preference for using information from only one surrogate country (except for the labor factor of production), the regulation cannot be read so broadly as to defeat the statutory directive that the factors of production be valued according to the best available information. In other words, the uniformity of data that results from having all surrogate values determined according to data from the same surrogate country may be a consideration in deciding which surrogate data to use for a particular factor of production. But in light of the statutory directive of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)(1) to use the best available information from a surrogate country \"or countries,\" it cannot be the\n   <em>\n    sole\n   </em>\n   consideration. The Department, therefore, impermissibly failed to weigh the relative merits of the Peruvian inland freight data because it determined that it had usable data from its primary surrogate country, where, as here, a party to the administrative review specifically argued that the Peruvian inland freight data were superior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The court, therefore, directs Commerce to reconsider its surrogate value for foreign inland freight. The court does not limit its directive to the reconsideration of whether to base the surrogate value used to calculate inland freight on data from Thailand or data from Peru. Upon remand, Commerce must reconsider that decision, but it may also reconsider other findings made that were necessary to the determination of the surrogate value for inland freight to ensure that its findings are supported by substantial record evidence. At this time, the court will not rule on the other arguments that Qihang and Xugong presented in contesting the foreign inland freight surrogate value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <em>\n    3. Xugong's Claim Challenging the Selection of Thailand as the Surrogate Country\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   As discussed above, the antidumping duty statute provides generally that Commerce will base the values of factors of production \"on the best available information regarding the values of such factors in a market economy country or countries\" Commerce considers appropriate. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)(1). Because it provides for the use of information from \"a market economy country\n   <em>\n    or countries\n   </em>\n   ,\" the statute does not confine Commerce to a single surrogate country, contemplating that Commerce may consider it necessary or appropriate to use information from more than one such country.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.408\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The Department's regulation, discussed previously, expresses a preference for valuing all factors of production, except labor, in a single country.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.408\">\n    19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) (\"Except for labor, ... the Secretary normally will value all factors in a single surrogate country.\").

Cir. 2010). A policy statement the Department issued explains that Commerce ordinarily will value the labor factor of production according to data (obtained from Chapter 6A of the International Labor Organization (\"ILO\") Yearbook) pertaining to the \"primary\" surrogate country.\n   <em>\n    Antidumping Methodologies in Proceedings Involving Non-Market Economies: Valuing the Factor of Production: Labor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Fed.%20Reg.%2036%2C092\">\n    76 Fed.

The concept\n   of a single \"surrogate country\" or a \"primary surrogate country\" is, therefore, one grounded only in regulation and practice, not in the statute. From the statutory standpoint, the obligation is that Commerce value factors of production according to \"the best available information,\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)(1), regardless of the number of market economy countries Commerce considers appropriate as sources for that information (subject to the additional requirement that Commerce use, to the extent possible, information from market economy countries that are economically comparable to China and that are significant producers of comparable merchandise).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   For the Final Results, Commerce designated Thailand as \"the surrogate country,\" i.e., the sole market economy country that would serve as the source for all information used in determining surrogate values for the normal value calculation.\n   <em>\n    See Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 42 (\"we continue to find that Thailand is the appropriate surrogate country in this review.\"). Xugong claims that the record evidence compelled Commerce to choose Peru instead. Xugong's Br. 6 (\"[T]he record supports the conclusion that Peru is not only the better choice, but the only choice for which there is substantial record evidence.\"). Because the court is requiring Commerce to reconsider two surrogate values it based on data from Thailand (reclaimed rubber and foreign inland freight) the court is not sustaining a decision to use Thai data exclusively in the normal value determinations for the mandatory respondents. But for the reasons discussed below, neither does the court find merit in Xugong's claim that Commerce was required to choose Peru as the sole or primary surrogate country.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   As grounds for its claim, Xugong argued before Commerce that Peruvian surrogate value data were superior to the Thai data for valuing natural rubber, for determining financial ratios, and for valuing reclaimed rubber.\n   <em>\n    See Resubmission of Xugong's Case Brief in the Administrative Review of New Pneumatic Off-The-Road Tires from the People's Republic of China\n   </em>\n   1-23 (Dec. 21, 2015) (P.R. Doc. 320) (\"Xugong's Case Br.\"). Before the court, Xugong offers two additional arguments. It argues that the ILO Chapter 6A data pertaining to Peru were superior to those pertaining to Thailand because the Peruvian data were specific to the rubber manufacturing industry whereas the Thai data were for manufacturing in general. Xugong's Br. 21-22. It argues also that record data pertaining to Peru were superior to those from Thailand for determining the surrogate inland freight cost.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Fed.%20Reg.%2036%2C092\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The court already has addressed the surrogate values for reclaimed rubber and foreign inland freight cost, in each case concluding that Commerce must reconsider these values.

Further to this argument, it asserts that in a past investigation of Chinese tires for passenger cars and\n   light trucks, Commerce declined to use Hwa Fong's financial statement due to record information that the company produced bicycle and motorcycle tires, which were not merchandise subject to that investigation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.408\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.408\">\n    at 13-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Xugong argues that in rejecting its argument in the Final Results, Commerce impermissibly relied on a \"2013 Tire Business Global Tire Report which states that Hwa Fong is a producer of agricultural, motorcycle, and industrial tires\" and that agricultural and industrial tires \"typically include off-the-road tires covered by the scope of the order.\"\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 49 (footnote omitted). Xugong points to other record evidence indicating that the Global Tire Report contained information that predated the POR and also was unreliable because it conflicted with record information pertaining to other Thai producers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.408\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.408\">\n    at 14-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Xugong's arguments concerning the nature of the merchandise produced by Hwa Fong during the POR might have merit, but they are to no avail. Commerce concluded that even if Hwa Fong could be shown to be only a producer of comparable and not identical merchandise, the financial statements for the Thai companies, which broke out energy costs and pertained to two producers of identical merchandise and one producer of comparable merchandise, still would be superior to the single usable Peruvian financial statement, which was of a producer of comparable merchandise.\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 49. This logical conclusion is supported by substantial evidence consisting of the financial statements on the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Xugong also argues that the financial statements of the two Peruvian companies that it submitted for the record, those of Goodyear del Peru S.A. (\"Goodyear Peru\") and Lima Caucho S.A. (\"Lima Caucho\"), are usable. Specifically, Xugong argues that the financial statement for the latter \"very clearly indicates 'fabrication costs' \" and that this category includes energy and labor, such that Commerce, having labor cost data, could derive the energy cost information. Xugong's Br. 19-20. Commerce responded to this argument for the Final Results, explaining, quite reasonably, that it prefers not to \"go behind\" the numbers in a financial statement or \"rely on supposition.\"\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Even were Commerce to have accepted Xugong's argument that it could have used both the Goodyear Peru and Lima Caucho statements, it still would have been left with a record upon which it had three statements from Thailand as opposed to only two from Peru. Xugong has not made the case that the record statements from Peruvian companies constituted, on the whole, a superior set of data compared to those from the companies in Thailand. Xugong appears to concede this point, stating that \"Commerce cannot point to substantial evidence that there is a significant difference in the overall quality of financial statement data on the record between Thailand and Peru.\" Xugong's Br. 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Xugong's argument concerning the natural rubber surrogate value is twofold. It argues, first, that the data Commerce used cannot be shown by substantial evidence to be free of tax and, in that respect, are inferior to GTA import data from Peru. Xugong's Br. 6-11. Second, it argues that the choice of surrogate value for natural rubber, which it argues was of negligible importance because this was but a minor production input, should not be a factor in favoring Thailand over Peru as the principal surrogate country.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.408\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.408\">\n    at 11-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Commerce chose a surrogate value of $2.01 per kilogram for technically specified natural rubber and a surrogate value of $2.28 for natural rubber in ribbed smoked sheets, both of which values it obtained by calculating an average of daily prices during the POR, as reported by the Rubber\n   Research Institute of Thailand (\"RRIT\") and compiled by the Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries (\"ANRPC\").\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 50-53;\n   <em>\n    see Final Surrogate Value Mem.\n   </em>\n   at Attach.

Commerce summarized its findings by stating that \"[a]s outlined above, both sources are tax and duty exclusive and both are publicly available. Concerning specificity, the RRIT prices are tracked daily and based on the two specific types of natural rubber used by respondents in production, whereas Peruvian import data from GTA are only a monthly value for imports under an HTS heading for natural rubber generally, indicating that the RRIT prices are at least as specific and accurate as import prices.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.408\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.408\">\n    at 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Before the court, Xugong again argues that the record evidence does not demonstrate that the RRIT data were free of taxes. Xugong's Br. 6-11. The court notes that Commerce did not reach an unqualified finding that the RRIT data were tax-exclusive. Responding to the objection of the mandatory respondents, Commerce asserted that \"the RRIT domestic prices are tax-exclusive (or at a minimum, that there is no affirmative evidence that they contain taxes,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   the discussion below), and no party contested the preliminary finding that they are publicly available, non-export, and product-specific prices for the POR.\"\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 51. The later discussion addressed the respondents' argument that a footnote pertaining to natural rubber prices in India indicated that the Thai natural rubber prices likely included domestic taxes.

This, too, is not an unqualified finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Xugong explains that it \"does not argue that the Thai data necessarily includes taxes, because as noted above, there is nothing explicit on the record one way or the other.\" Xugong's Br. 10. Xugong notes that Commerce has an established preference for the use of import data over domestic price data due to exclusivity from tax, as stated in the Department's \"Antidumping Manual.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.408\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.408\">\n    at 10-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court agrees with Xugong's argument that the Thai data are not shown by substantial evidence to be free of tax, which is one of the Department's factors for choosing surrogate values. The Department's other reasons for choosing the domestic Thai data were that the Thai data \"were at least as specific\" to the input and were obtained from the chosen surrogate country, Thailand. As to specificity, the record GTA data for Peru, as shown in Xugong's initial surrogate value submission, were contemporaneous\n   with the POR only for the tariff subheading Xugong listed for technically-specified natural rubber (September 2013 to August 2014) but were two years out of date for the tariff subheading it provided for natural rubber in smoked sheets (September 2011 to August 2012), for which Xugong supplied an inflator of 1.0607.\n   <em>\n    See Xugong Initial SV Submission\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Xugong challenged specifically the surrogate value for reclaimed rubber, as discussed previously in the Opinion and Order. The court does not interpret Xugong's Rule 56.2 brief as specifically challenging the natural rubber surrogate values. Instead, it raises the argument only in support of its claim that Commerce was required to choose Peru as the sole or primary surrogate country and, even in that context, minimizes the importance of the natural rubber surrogate values to the choice of surrogate country.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Xugong's claim does not persuade the court, if for no other reason than the financial data, which have a significant effect on the margins, do not favor Peru, as discussed above. Moreover, Commerce used Thai data to value numerous production inputs that were not challenged in this case. While the court has concluded that Commerce must reconsider its surrogate values for reclaimed rubber and for foreign inland freight, the record provides the court no valid basis to respond affirmatively to Xugong's claim that the record compelled Commerce to choose Peru as the sole or principal surrogate country by ordering reconsideration of all other surrogate values used by Commerce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <em>\n    E.

The court does not find merit in this claim. While invoking the \"substantial evidence\" element of the standard of review, Xugong does not dispute the principal finding supporting the use of facts otherwise available, which was that the augmented sales database Xugong submitted in its June 2, 2015 questionnaire response did not include all of its CEP sales that were direct-shipped during the POR but invoiced after the POR. Nor does Xugong make the case that Commerce erred in using an adverse inference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <em>\n    1. The Use of Facts Otherwise Available Is Warranted Because Commerce Reached a Valid Finding that Xugong Failed to Provide Requested Information\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a)(2)(B), when a respondent fails to provide requested information, Commerce is directed generally to use the facts otherwise available in reaching the applicable determination. Under \u00a7 1677e(a)(2)(D), Commerce is directed generally to use the facts otherwise available if the information provided cannot be verified. Commerce invoked both of these provisions in resorting to facts otherwise available.\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 15. The directive in the May 1, 2015 supplemental questionnaire to \"include any sales (if any) which shipped prior to the end of the POR but were not invoiced until after the POR,\" is unambiguous (albeit redundant as to the second inclusion of the word \"any\").\n   <em>\n    First Supp. Questionnaire\n   </em>\n   at 4. It made no exception for sales of merchandise that entered after the POR. Because Xugong did not report those direct-shipped, CEP sales that were shipped during the POR but were invoiced after the POR (a finding Xugong does not dispute), Commerce correctly invoked subparagraph (B) of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a). Therefore, the court does not reach the question of whether the information Xugong did provide was verifiable for purposes of subparagraph (D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Xugong advances various, and unavailing, arguments as to why Commerce should not have used the facts otherwise available. Xugong points out, first, that Xugong correctly followed the instructions on reporting of sales that unambiguously were set forth in the Department's initial questionnaire and were consistent with the Department's established practice. Xugong's Br. 46-52. It then argues that the supplemental questionnaire, which went beyond the \"standard\" reporting instructions, is inconsistent with the Department's past practice on the reporting of sales that will be used to determine a respondent's margin. According to Xugong's argument, the Department's practice, with two exceptions not here applicable,\n   is to analyze sales data on entries occurring during the POR, rather than all sales occurring during the POR.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.408\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.408\">\n    at 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These arguments are not persuasive because the relevant issue is whether Xugong submitted all of the information requested in the May 1, 2015 supplemental questionnaire. Because it did not, Xugong's compliance with the reporting requirements in the initial questionnaire is irrelevant.

In this case, the directive to report\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   sales shipped during the POR, with no stated limitation as to when the merchandise was entered, was not ambiguous or otherwise unclear, and it is a mischaracterization to describe the reporting requests as conflicting. Because the May 1, 2015 supplemental questionnaire required Xugong to report sales in addition to those Xugong previously reported, it was not merely a clarification of the initial information request.\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 9 (\"The Department requested that Xugong continue to report the same universe of sales that it had previously reported, but also to add these additional sales to its U.S. sales database.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Xugong also maintains that in its June 2, 2015 response to the supplemental questionnaires it \"made clear to Commerce that it had reported its direct-shipment CEP sales to Commerce based on having an entry date within the POR, and moreover that it did not report direct-shipment CEP sales shipped within the POR but which entered after the POR.\" Xugong's Br. 63.

These arguments incorrectly presume that Commerce may not use facts otherwise available in response to unreported information if it does not discover the deficiency and notify the submitter as soon as it possibly could have, or before it issues a second supplemental questionnaire on the same subject matter. Although the statute requires Commerce to notify a submitter promptly,\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(d), Commerce did so upon discovering the unreported sales at verification.

Xugong does not demonstrate that Commerce acted beyond its authority in deciding that the CEP sales of merchandise shipped during the POR but not entered or invoiced during the POR should be included in the universe of sales examined to determine a margin for Xugong. Although the statute provides that Commerce, as a general matter, will determine a dumping margin for \"each entry\" subject to an administrative review,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201675\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(ii), the statute does not require a perfect correspondence between examined sales and entries during a period of review, and often tying every U.S. market sale to a particular entry is not practicable.

If Xugong misinterpreted the request to mean that it should report only shipments of merchandise entered during the POR, its doing so could only have been the result of a lack of care in following the Department's unambiguous instructions and not a fault on the part of Commerce. Rather than argue that it used its best efforts in attempting to satisfy the Department's request for the additional sales information, it argues, unconvincingly, that Commerce somehow was at fault, for various reasons, in making the request and in structuring the various questionnaires in the way that it did. Based on the record evidence considered as a whole, Commerce was justified in invoking its authority under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b) to\n   use an adverse inference in choosing from among the facts otherwise available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   <em>\n    F.

Second, Trelleborg claims that even as an unexamined respondent it should not have been assigned the 70.55% rate because that rate was unreasonable as applied to Trelleborg, which received a zero margin in a just-completed new shipper review and asserts that it would have received a very low margin (which Trelleborg calculates as one between 1.79% and 2.03%) had it been examined individually in the sixth review.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.401\">\n    at 10-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The provision allows Commerce to limit its examination in two ways: it may limit its examination to a statistically valid sample of exporters, producers, or types of products,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1677f-1(c)(2)(A), or it may limit its examination to \"exporters and producers accounting for the largest volume of the subject merchandise from the exporting country that can be reasonably examined,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1677f-1(c)(2)(B). In explaining its decision to invoke its discretion under paragraph (B) of \u00a7 1677f-1(c)(2), Commerce stated its conclusion that the two respondents it selected, i.e., Xugong and Qihang, are representative of producers of the subject merchandise.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.401\">\n    at 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It argues, first, that failing to include Trelleborg was contrary to the statute because, \"the basic purpose of the statute\" being \"to compute fair and accurate dumping margins,\" Commerce must ensure that margins assigned to non-mandatory, cooperative separate rate respondents \"bear some relationship to their actual dumping margins\" rather than be \"untethered to actual record data for Trelleborg.\" Trelleborg's Br. 10-12. This argument does not convince the court. The method Congress expressly provided for in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(c)(2)(B) necessarily produces an \"all-others\" rate that is \"untethered to actual record data\" on the sales of individual, unexamined respondents. Any \"relationship to their actual dumping margins\" that exists under \u00a7 1677f-1(c)(2)(B) is, by definition, the relationship that exists because the examined respondents are treated as representative of other respondents by virtue of being the largest exporters. Commerce assigned a margin based on the margins of the two largest exporters to the unexamined (\"separate rate\") respondents because it concluded that the circumstance described in \u00a7 1677f-1(c)(2) existed, notwithstanding the margin that an unexamined respondent would have been assigned had it been individually examined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Trelleborg argues that the mandatory respondents are not representative of it because, as a foreign-owned company (in this case, one owned by a company in a market economy country, Sweden), it \"has a different pricing and cost structure than would be expected from Chinese-owned enterprises, regardless of whether they are state-owned or free from state control.\" Trelleborg's Br. 19 (citations omitted). As examples, it points out that it differed from Xugong in terms of its specific products, its market economy purchase inputs, its relative percentages of synthetic rubber, natural rubber, and reclaimed rubber used for all of its products, and its AUVs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to Trelleborg, \"Commerce is required to evaluate the commercial reality facing each company to determine whether the companies' economics are comparable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This argument presumes, incorrectly, that Congress intended to limit the application of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(c)(2)(B) according to a comparative analysis of the factors Trelleborg highlights.

The record evidence supports the Department's finding that the two mandatory respondents were not only the two largest (other than GTC, for which the review request had been withdrawn) but also accounted for a substantial portion of the subject merchandise exports of all exporters and producers for which Commerce had remaining requests for review.\n   <em>\n    See Selection of Second Respondent for Individual Review\n   </em>\n   at Attach. I (Dec. 19, 2014) (P.R. Doc. 38).

The Assignment of the 70.55% \"All-Others\" Rate to Trelleborg\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Trelleborg argues that assigning it the 70.55% rate had the effect of denying it any meaningful benefit from a new shipper review of Trelleborg, in which Commerce assigned Trelleborg a zero margin.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.401\">\n    at 15-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But if that is so, that result is a permissible one under the statutory scheme. Trelleborg is correct that the zero margin produced a rate that was in effect for entries made only during a limited time, the new shipper review having been completed on June 4, 2013, less than three months prior to the beginning of the POR (September 1, 2013 through August 31, 2014).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.401\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.401\">\n    at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the statute authorized-and, upon the receipt of a valid request, indeed required-the inclusion of Trelleborg in the sixth review.

This assertion relies upon information related to Trelleborg's own sales, which information Commerce did not examine because Trelleborg was not an individually-examined respondent.

Therefore, it is unavailing for Trelleborg to assert that it would have been assigned a margin between 1.79% and 2.03% had it been individually examined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <em>\n    3. The Department's Denial of Trelleborg's Request to Be a Voluntary Respondent\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   In the Preliminary Results, Commerce announced that it was rejecting a request by Trelleborg for voluntary respondent status under section 782(a) of the Tariff Act, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(a).\n   <em>\n    Prelim I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   6-10.

That circumstance exists when \"the number of exporters or producers subject to the investigation or review is not so large that any additional individual examination of such exporters or producers would be unduly burdensome to the administering authority and inhibit the timely completion of the investigation or review.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1677m(a)(1)(B).

In doing so, Commerce relied upon an amendment to the statute made by the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015, Pub. L.

Commerce mentioned that \"we have issued four supplemental questionnaires to Xugong and five supplemental questionnaires to Qihang in this review, which included numerous questions concerning the factors of production reporting methodologies, database issues, ownership issues, and general administrative issues.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20Stat.%20362\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   In apparent reference to the second factor, \"[a]ny prior experience of the administering authority in the same or similar proceeding,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(a)(2)(B), Commerce noted that \"this was the first time that we have reviewed Qihang as a mandatory respondent and, thus, the Department had to expend additional time gaining experience with Qihang's records and practices.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20Stat.%20362\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Commerce also mentioned that approving the request \"would necessarily have required a significant additional level of effort and resources\" that would be \"unduly burdensome,\" including the assignment of additional analysts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Trelleborg argues that Commerce, in denying its request for voluntary respondent status using the same rationale it used to limit the review to the two examined, i.e., mandatory, respondents, failed to recognize that denying such a request requires a higher threshold of agency burden than does limiting respondents generally. Trelleborg's Br. 26-30. According to Trelleborg, Commerce ignored the fact that Trelleborg was the only prospective voluntary respondent that submitted the necessary information and the fact that it previously examined Trelleborg in the new shipper review.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-30. Trelleborg submits that because it provided Commerce \"a dumping margin program that Commerce could have used if it wanted,\" the burden on Commerce \"was as minimal as it could be with any voluntary respondent\" and did not qualify as an \"undue\" burden.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Trelleborg's arguments are not persuasive. In the TPEA, Congress provided Commerce with broad discretion in deciding whether or not to accept a request for voluntary respondent status. In support of its decision, Commerce applied factors Congress considered appropriate, including complexity of the review and it other resource commitments, in rejecting Trelleborg's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <em>\n    G. The All-Others Rate as Applied to Full World and Weihai Zhongwei\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Full World and Weihai Zhongwei were assigned the all-others rate of 70.55% in the sixth review.\n   <em>\n    Final Results\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2023%2C272\">\n    81 Fed.

As plaintiffs in this case, they seek relief in the form of a redetermined all-others rate based on any revision to the rates of the examined respondents. At oral argument, defendant indicated that Commerce does not oppose this claim, should it be determined judicially that revision in the rates of the examined respondents is required. Because Full World and Weihai Zhongwei contested the Final Results as plaintiffs, they will qualify for any relief that ultimately is determined judicially to apply to their margins. Because it also contested the Final Results, Trelleborg will qualify for any such relief as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III.
