Thompson, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The plaintiffs, both individually and as representatives of a class of participants and beneficiaries in Yale's 403(b) Retirement Account Plan (the \"Plan\"), claim that defendants Yale University (\"Yale\"), Michael A. Peel (\"Peel\"), Yale's Vice President of Human Resources during the class period, and the Retirement Plan Fiduciary Committee (the \"Committee\") violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\") in three ways: (1) by breaching their fiduciary duties of prudence and loyalty under ERISA (Counts I, III and V), (2) by carrying out transactions prohibited by ERISA (Counts II, IV and VI) and (3) with respect to Yale and Peel, by failing to monitor Committee members to ensure compliance with ERISA's standards (Count VII). The defendants move to dismiss all seven counts for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and as time-barred. For the reasons set forth below, the defendants' motion to dismiss is being granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the purpose of deciding the motion to dismiss, the court accepts the following allegations, taken from the Amended Complaint (Doc. No. 57, \"Am. Compl.\"), as true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Yale offers to eligible employees the opportunity to \"participate\" in a 403(b) defined-contribution plan. Under such a plan, they put a portion of their income into personal retirement savings accounts and invest those savings in an array of investment options. Yale makes matching contributions under certain conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Two key aspects of maintaining a 403(b) plan are managing the plan's investment options and providing recordkeeping for plan participants. Plan fiduciaries typically contract with third-party vendors for both of these services. The process of selecting vendors and negotiating service fees can materially affect an employee's retirement income because every dollar spent on either recordkeeping or investment management is a dollar that is not contributing to increasing the amount of the employee's retirement savings. Over time, excessive service fees can erode an employee's retirement savings to the tune of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Bundling of Services\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Yale contracted with two investment management companies, \"Vanguard\" (which refers collectively to the Vanguard Group, Inc. and the Vanguard Fiduciary Trust) and \"TIAA-CREF\" (which refers to the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America and College Retirement Equities Fund). Each of these companies provided both investment management and recordkeeping services for the Plan, although in April 2015 the defendants discontinued having Vanguard provide recordkeeping services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   With regard to TIAA-CREF, the plaintiffs allege that a \"bundled\" services arrangement tethered TIAA-CREF's recordkeeping services and investment products to one of its premier products, the TIAA Traditional Annuity, such that if Yale wished to include TIAA's Traditional Annuity as an investment option in the Plan, Yale had to use TIAA's recordkeeping services and include the CREF Stock Account and the CREF Money Market Account in the Plan. According to the plaintiffs, this bundled services arrangement hurt Plan participants and beneficiaries in three ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   First, the plaintiffs allege that the defendants did not initially scrutinize every investment that was included in the bundled services arrangement, leading the Plan to take on unreasonably expensive or poor-performing investments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Second, the plaintiffs allege that after agreeing to the bundled services arrangement, the defendants failed to consistently monitor the investments or the recordkeeping costs. The plaintiffs further allege that even if the defendants had identified underperforming investments and high recordkeeping costs, the bundled services arrangement prevented the defendants from remedying either deficiency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As an example of the problem of poor investments, the plaintiffs point to two annuities, the CREF Stock Account and the TIAA Real Estate Account, that the defendants failed to remove from the Plan despite ten-year track records of poor performance, as measured against TIAA-CREF's chosen benchmark and several alternative investments. The plaintiffs claim that rather than accepting TIAA-CREF's offer of a bundled services arrangement, the defendants should have opted for an \"open architecture\" model, which would have allowed the defendants to monitor and freely reject imprudent investments or costly recordkeeping services. (Am. Compl., at \u00b6 60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Third, the plaintiffs allege that the fact that the higher-priced investments created more recordkeeping revenue for TIAA-CREF incentivized TIAA-CREF to pressure the defendants into taking on its recordkeeping services in tandem with the higher-priced investments, even if the two were not in the interest of Plan participants. The plaintiffs further allege that by allowing TIAA-CREF to get larger fees for higher-priced investments, the defendants placed the financial interests of TIAA-CREF above the interests of Plan participants and beneficiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Cost of Recordkeeping\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The plaintiffs also challenge the cost of the recordkeeping services. They allege that Yale grossly overpaid for TIAA-CREF's recordkeeping services because it used a revenue-sharing model rather than a flat annual fee approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Under a revenue-sharing model, the investment management company takes a portion of the fees (the \"expense ratio\") it receives for managing an investment and forwards it to a third-party company that provides the administrative services, e.g., recordkeeping. A 403(b) plan therefore pays for the cost of recordkeeping indirectly, passing funds that will cover the recordkeeping to the management investment firm, which then passes payment on to the recordkeeper. Because revenue-sharing is charged as a percentage of the assets in a plan, the amount of the expense for recordkeeping increases directly in proportion to the amount of money invested in TIAA-CREF's investment products, i.e. the higher the amount of money invested in its products, the more TIAA-CREF receives for recordkeeping. The plaintiffs also allege that the use of two providers led to duplicative reporting for at least some Plan participants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Flat fee arrangements, on the other hand, involve a fixed price based on the number of participants in a plan, rather than the total amount of assets invested. Thus, a plan with 100 participants and assets of $1 million, would pay the same recordkeeping fee as a plan with the same number of participants and $100 million in assets. The payment for the recordkeeping fee is made directly to the service provider, and any redundancies in service can be eliminated by selecting a single recordkeeper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The plaintiffs allege that a flat fee arrangement is better than revenue sharing for participants and beneficiaries because a flat fee arrangement ties costs directly to the \"actual services provided and does not grow based on matters that have nothing to do with the services provided, such as increase in plan assets due to market growth or greater plan contributions by employees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52.) As proof of the superiority and popularity of flat fee arrangements, the plaintiffs highlight four universities that shifted to single-recordkeeper systems around 2009 and cite a 2013 survey showing that 90% of 403(b) plans used a single recordkeeper. (The defendants eventually followed suit, switching over to a single recordkeeper in April 2015.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The plaintiffs also allege that the defendants' failure to negotiate a recordkeeping fee pegged to headcount (rather than total assets) led to excessive costs. Although the plaintiffs acknowledge that revenue sharing does not per se violate ERISA, they contend that revenue-sharing agreements tend toward unreasonable fees if not monitored for ballooning costs, assessed against competitive bids from other recordkeeping providers, and renegotiated periodically to ensure the best available price. The plaintiffs allege the defendants failed to follow any of these practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The plaintiffs also allege that the defendants failed to take advantage of the size\n   of the Plan effectively when negotiating recordkeeping fees. As of June 30, 2015, the Plan contained $3.8 billion in retirement assets and included 17,138 participants with active account balances. This placed the Plan among the largest 0.02% of all defined contribution plans in the United States, and the plaintiffs refer to it as a \"jumbo plan.\" The plaintiffs allege that the sheer size of the Plan should have resulted in reduced recordkeeping fees under either model, but did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Quantity, Quality and Cost of Investment Options\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In addition to the bundling services arrangement and the recordkeeping, the plaintiffs attack the quantity, quality and cost of the investments in the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Quantity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The plaintiffs allege that the defendants offered too many investment options in the Plan, resulting in decision paralysis, higher costs, and dilution of Yale's bargaining power. With respect to decision paralysis, the plaintiffs allege that the overwhelming number of options in each asset class, e.g. as many as 28 options for at least one of the asset classes, \"place[d] a monumental burden on the Plan participants in selecting options in which to invest.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 151.) Moreover, the plaintiffs allege, within asset classes, the various investment options were so similar in make-up that the only real difference between them was cost. The plaintiffs claim that the defendants therefore should have offered only the \"best in class\" investment option for each asset category. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 152.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The plaintiffs allege that because the best-in-class investments outperform and are cheaper than many of the options in which Plan participants are currently invested, participants would reap higher investment returns and save on management fees. Reducing the number of investment options would also concentrate the $3.8 billion in assets into a handful of funds and annuities, thereby increasing the defendants' ability to demand lower prices for those investments and meeting the minimum amount required to qualify for institutional shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Quality\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The plaintiffs allege that the defendants imprudently retained poor-performing investments in the Plan, noting that 57 out of the 99 investment options with at least a five-year track record \"underperformed their respective benchmarks over the previous five-year period.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 168.) The plaintiffs allege that had the defendants \"conducted a prudent investment review,\" many of these investments would have been eliminated or replaced. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 169.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The plaintiffs single out two investments to illustrate the kind of \"historically underperforming\" investment options placed in the Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 84.) With respect to the CREF Stock Account, the plaintiffs allege that it underperformed both TIAA-CREF's chosen benchmark fund (the Russell 3000) and several alternative funds (e.g., the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (Institutional Plus) and the Vanguard PRIMECAP-Admiral) over the course of one, three, five, and ten years. At least one industry analyst recommended removal of the CREF Stock Account from 403(b) plans. Similarly, the TIAA Real Estate Account underachieved over a one-, three-, five-, and ten-year period when compared to a similar investment, the Vanguard Real Estate Investment Trust (Institutional). In addition to the lackluster performance, both funds charged higher investment fees than the alternatives, cutting into already low annual investment returns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Cost\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The plaintiffs allege two missteps in the Plan's pricing of investments: a failure to\n   obtain volume pricing and a failure to eliminate extraneous fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   With respect to volume pricing, the plaintiffs allege that for 88 of the Plan's 115 investments, the defendants could have obtained exactly the same investment at a deeply discounted rate. That is because Vanguard and TIAA-CREF offer two versions of those 88 investments: a \"retail\" version and an \"institutional\" version. The plaintiffs allege the difference between the two is purely a matter of price: because large institutions generally purchase many more shares of an investment than an individual, they are given a steep discount on their purchases. The plaintiffs allege that the Plan offered participants only the higher-priced retail shares, when, given the Plan's $3.8 billion in assets, it should have been able obtain the lower-priced institutional shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   With respect to the extraneous fees, the plaintiffs criticize nine of the Plan's TIAA-CREF investments\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for including unreasonable costs or unbeneficial services in the expense ratio. The four layers of expenses break down into administrative expenses, distribution expenses (i.e., the 12b-1 fees), mortality and expense risk charges, and investment advisory expenses (a/k/a investment management fees).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The criticism of the administrative expenses mirrors that of the fees for recordkeeping (in part, because the administrative expense encompasses the recordkeeping fee): the growth in assets increases the amount of fees paid to TIAA-CREF, even if the basic administrative services do not change. Similarly, the criticism of the investment advisory expenses mirrors that with respect to retail shares versus institutional shares: the defendants should have negotiated for shares with lower advisory fees commensurate with the Plan's status as a \"jumbo\" plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   With respect to the distribution expenses and the mortality and expense-risk charges, the plaintiffs allege that Plan participants derive no benefit from either. The distribution fee covers marketing and distribution services, and the plaintiffs allege that because Yale selects the funds, neither service benefits the participants. The same goes for the mortality and expense-risk charges, which the plaintiffs allege \"only benefit[ ] a [Plan] participant if she elects at the time of retirement to annuitize her holdings in the account to provide for periodic income,\" something that few participants do. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 117c.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   With respect to the TIAA Real Estate Account, the plaintiffs allege that a fifth expense, a \"liquidity guarantee\" is not charged by comparable funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   When deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the court must accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint and must draw inferences in a light most favorable to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Scheuer v.
