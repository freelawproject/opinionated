Construing the FAC in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, Plaintiff's allegations that it was objectively reckless not to assess a detainee for possible head trauma after that person fell onto bare concrete from a height of five feet, struck her head, and was unable to walk following the fall is adequate to meet the second prong. The FAC also alleges that after the fall, \"Decedent faced a serious medical need for evaluation and treatment regarding possible traumatic brain injury and that in the case of traumatic brain injury immediate medical treatment is required to avoid bleeding in the brain, brain swelling, subdural hematoma, and other progressively serious results including death.\" FAC \u00b6 32. It alleges that the decision not to evaluate Decedent for brain trauma and to send her back to jail after the first fall left the injury untreated and led to delay in treatment, leading to further brain injury and Decedent's death.
