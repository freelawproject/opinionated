Kornyo. Plaintiff is black and a native of Ghana. During his tenure at Gonzaga, Plaintiff was in the United States on an H-1B visa. Plaintiff alleges that Gonzaga discriminated against him on the basis of his race and national origin. Now before the Court is Defendant's [8] Motion to Dismiss. Upon consideration of the pleadings,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the relevant legal authorities, and the record as it currently stands, the Court will GRANT Defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Court does \"not accept as true, however, the plaintiff's legal conclusions or inferences that are unsupported by the facts alleged.\"\n   <em>\n    Ralls Corp. v.

Cir. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to the Amended Complaint, Gonzaga hired Plaintiff as a teacher of ethics and philosophy in September 2006. Am. Compl., ECF No. 7, \u00b6 7. Plaintiff is black and a native of Ghana.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. During the interview process leading up to his hiring, Plaintiff alleges that he informed Defendant that he was in the United States on a student visa with a work permit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. According to Plaintiff, Defendant told him that due to Plaintiff's prior experience teaching and in the Seminary, Defendant was willing, contingent on Plaintiff's performance, to sponsor his application for a work visa or a green card.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. Plaintiff alleges that, based on his good work, the Headmaster at Gonzaga eventually agreed to sponsor his application for an H-1B visa.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. Plaintiff's visa application was approved.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Plaintiff then began the process of applying for a green card.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-25. He requested assistance in that process (including the completion of a \"labor certification\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   from the Headmaster, who took his request under advisement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Later, Plaintiff participated in a skit about the Headmaster at a school retreat.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-29. The skit allegedly portrayed the Headmaster holding an umbrella and saying \"good morning.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. Plaintiff alleges that, after the skit was over, the Headmaster confronted him and said \"why did you do a skit about me? It was very offensive, it should never be done, and is not acceptable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. Plaintiff apologized, but feared retaliation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff was subsequently approached about teaching a new course at Gonzaga in Bioethics.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. In order to prepare to teach this new subject matter, Plaintiff allegedly requested permission to take a course on Biotechnology at Georgetown University, and have Gonzaga reimburse him for the tuition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-35. Plaintiff alleges that the Headmaster originally agreed but, after Plaintiff was accepted in the program, retracted his support and informed Plaintiff that the school would not pay for Plaintiff to attend the course.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-40. The Headmaster allegedly determined that the program was not related to the subject Plaintiff taught at Gonzaga, and also cited concerns about the program's cost and Plaintiff's ability to successfully complete it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-40. Plaintiff attended and completed the program regardless, without reimbursement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. According to Plaintiff, other teachers at Gonzaga received reimbursement for their own educational pursuits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff approached the Headmaster in early 2011 and requested that he be allowed to take leave to care for his sick wife.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-51. He also asserted that he was entitled to a one year sabbatical under Gonzaga's employee handbook.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. Both requests were denied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52. Plaintiff was told that if he took long term leave he would be terminated and would have to re-apply for his job.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff missed an hour of work on February 24, 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. He alleges that he received permission to do so from \"a colleague temporarily coordinating class coverage\" while the Dean and Headmaster were travelling, but was nonetheless disciplined for his absence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-57. At a meeting during which he was disciplined, Plaintiff alleges that the Headmaster \"raised his voice and displayed furious anger,\" and stated \"that he has his own set of rules for the Plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. Plaintiff was given a probation letter for \"dereliction of duty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59. Plaintiff claims that as he was leaving that meeting, the Headmaster stated that \"if Plaintiff cannot attend school Plaintiff 'should be prepared to go back to the jungle.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Later in 2011, Plaintiff went on FMLA leave to care for his wife.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61. Upon returning, Plaintiff was allegedly instructed by the Headmaster \"to notify him of all travel plans domestic and international.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In late 2012, Plaintiff informed the Headmaster that he was on the final extension of his H-1B visa and asked the Headmaster whether he would support Plaintiff in the process of obtaining a green card and sign Plaintiff's labor certification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68. The Headmaster allegedly gave an uncertain response and did not sign the certification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2013, Gonzaga's Headmaster again declined to reimburse Plaintiff for the cost of tuition for educational courses Plaintiff had been accepted to attend, again on the grounds that the program Plaintiff sought to attend fell outside the scope of Plaintiff's teaching assignment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71. The Headmaster also told Plaintiff in 2013 that he had decided not to sign Plaintiff's labor certification for his green card, and that he was not comfortable offering Plaintiff a\n   permanent position at Gonzaga.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73. On April 30, 2013, Defendant's Dean of Faculty informed Plaintiff that his employment would not be renewed for the next semester.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At a ceremony on June 2, 2013, outside the presence of other colleagues, the Headmaster allegedly expressed to Plaintiff that he was surprised and angry that Plaintiff was present, and also allegedly used a racial slur to refer to Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff filed this lawsuit on June 2, 2017.

Assuming that a four year statute of limitations applies-and both parties appear to agree that it does,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 3; Pl.'s Opp'n at 6-Plaintiff was required to file suit before April 30, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He did not. This lawsuit was filed on June 2, 2017. Plaintiff's race discrimination claim (Count II) is therefore untimely and will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the accrual date for the statute of limitations can be extended by an alleged occurrence in June 2013, when Gonzaga's Headmaster allegedly used a racial slur to refer to Plaintiff. The Court does not understand Plaintiff to argue that this incident would constitute an act of discrimination that\n   <em>\n    alone\n   </em>\n   is actionable under Section 1981. Instead, Plaintiff argues that the incident can be viewed as the latest occurrence in a pattern that, taken together, could constitute a hostile work environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This argument lacks merit because Plaintiff has not alleged a hostile work environment claim.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Am.

Plaintiff has not moved to amend his Complaint to add this claim under Federal Rule 15, even after Defendant indicated in its reply brief (filed over five months ago) that the absence of that claim rendered his statute of limitations argument meritless. The Court will not ignore the untimeliness of the claims Plaintiff actually did assert by pretending that Plaintiff asserted other hypothetical claims. Accordingly, the Court will GRANT Defendant's\n   Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's race discrimination claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count II).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

An appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The Court's consideration has focused on the following documents:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n    \u2022 Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 8 (\"Def.'s Mot.\");\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n    \u2022 Pl.'s Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 11 (\"Pl.'s Opp'n); and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n    \u2022 Def.'s Reply to Pl.'s Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 12 (\"Def.'s Reply\").\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    In an exercise of its discretion, the Court finds that holding oral argument in this action would not be of assistance in rendering a decision.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    LCvR 7(f).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Defendant's Motion to Dismiss includes arguments regarding why Plaintiff could not obtain relief under laws other than Section 1981 (including Title VII) because Plaintiff has not exhausted his administrative remedies as required by those laws. Def.'s Mot. at 5-7. The Court need not address these arguments because Plaintiff has made clear that he is not suing under any law other than Section 1981. Plaintiff states that \"since [he] sued under \u00a7 1981, there is not a requirement that he exhaust all administrative remedies.\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 6.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    \"[S]ome \u00a7 1981 claims will be subject to a three-year limitations period; others, a four-year limitations period.\"\n    <em>\n     Graves v.
