Here, the defendants contend that law enforcement would have been alerted to the wrongdoings alleged in the instant action because the relator's \"prior\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   actions identified\n   <em>\n    Comstor\n   </em>\n   by name; alleged that\n   <em>\n    Comstor's\n   </em>\n   authorized re-sellers were selling non-TAA compliant Cisco products to the government; and that the same Comstor employee confirmed that the products being sold to the government were non-compliant.\" Defs.' Reply at 6 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The aspects of the complaints in the relator's other\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   cases highlighted by the defendants obscure the fundamental fact that those prior complaints assert no allegations against the defendants. First, only two of the\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   complaints even identify the defendants by name, and, in doing so, they only mention Comstor as \"a designated point of sale for Cisco products.\"\n   <em>\n    Apptis\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 19;\n   <em>\n    World Wide Technologies\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 19. The filings say nothing about the defendants' involvement in the alleged fraudulent scheme. Second, and relatedly, the allegations against the resellers are not directly linked to Comstor, especially since Comstor is alleged to be \"\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   designated point of sale,\"\n   <em>\n    Apptis\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 19;\n   <em>\n    World Wide Technologies\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 19, and not\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   designated point of sale. Finally, the fact that a Comstor representative confirmed the products being sold were non-compliant does not create an inference that Comstor participated in any scheme to defraud the government,\n   but rather suggests that the defendants were being\n   <em>\n    helpful\n   </em>\n   in working with a vendor to try to comply with TAA requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rel.'s Opp'n at 11 (\"The fact that some Cisco products are manufactured in non-designated countries was never a secret ..., [and] Relator asked the Comstor employee about the TAA-compliance status of certain Cisco products in order 'to avoid violating the TAA.' \") (quoting Defs.

Without any other factual allegations to show the configurable options items sold by the defendants were never \"transformed,\" the relator has not created an inference that these items needed to comply with the TAA.

The relator relies for his open market item allegations on specific regulations that are silent regarding TAA-compliance for open market items. For example, the \"FAR's only discussion of 'open market' sales appears in FAR 8.402,\" TAC \u00b6 88, which, in a single subsection, permits the government to procure open market items that are \"not on the [FSS]\" for \"administrative convenience ... \"only if\" certain requirements are met, including that \"[a]ll applicable acquisition regulations pertaining to the purchase of the items not on the Federal Supply Schedule have been followed (e.g., publicizing (Part 5), competition requirements (Part 6), acquisition of commercial items (Part 12), contracting methods (Parts 13, 14, and 15), and small business programs (Part 19) ).\" FAR 8.402(f)(1).

Nonetheless, none of these provisions specifically discuss imposing TAA requirements for sales of open market items, which by definition are outside the FSS contract. By contrast, the defendants rely on FAR regulations that explicitly discuss the application of the TAA when the items sold have a value over $191,000 (\"TAA-threshold\"),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.'
