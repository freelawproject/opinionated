The Count I retaliation claim brought under Title VII is also DISMISSED, insofar as it is based on pre-February 22, 2017 acts of retaliation.

No. 1. Initially hired as a \"Deputy Sheriff I\" (Compl. \u00b6 11), Pratt \"was promoted to Deputy Sheriff II\" in 2003 (Compl. \u00b6 12). As a Deputy Sheriff II, Pratt was \"assigned to various sections including the Criminal Investigation Unit [ ('CIU') ] of the Sheriff Division as an Investigator\" (Compl. \u00b6 13). In 2008, Pratt \"sought a transfer from warrants to [the] records department\" (Compl. \u00b6 24); in 2009, he\n   sought a transfer \"from the records department to Capitol Patrol\" (Compl. \u00b6 25); and in 2013, he sought a transfer again, this time to CIU (Compl. \u00b6 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pratt states that he has been \"open about his homosexuality\" since receiving a \"homosexual discharge by the military under DD-214\" in 1994.

From that time until 2007, Pratt claims to have been \"repeatedly and frequently sexually harassed by fellow deputy sheriffs, who would call him by female-gender names and scorn and ridicule him and his lack of dating women, and humiliate him by displaying homophobic behavior toward him.\" Compl. \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2008, Pratt filed an administrative complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") and the Hawai'i Civil Rights Commission (\"HCRC\") regarding this harassment.

DPS also \"took [Pratt's] gun away from him in May 2014.\" Compl. \u00b6 34.

[sic] Plaintiff had been assigned to regular duties during this time period, for Cummings assigned Plaintiff to investigate and complete at least 40 cases as Deputy Sheriff II from September 2014 through December 2016. Cummings' misrepresentation on the Employee Performance Appraisal form constitutes falsification of an official government document;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   b.

On February 17, 2017[,] [DPS] moved [Pratt] out of the Sheriff CIU office into the Hawai'i Paroling Authority office, changed his job title from Deputy Sheriff II to Office Assistant III, and demoted him from a Sheriff/Investigator in CIU to a secretary for the Hawai'i Paroling Authority, all of which were done against Plaintiff's voluntary consent;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   d. In April 2017, [Pratt] was warned by a person in HR that \"they retaliated against you.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   e. In April 2017, [DPS] transferred [Pratt] out of the Office Assistant job at the Sheriff's Division to the Hawai'i Paroling Authority making him Parole Officer III, also without his voluntary consent;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   f. In late April 2017, [DPS] coerced or attempted to coerce [Pratt] into signing an agreement withdrawing all grievances and future lawsuits against [DPS], which [Pratt] refused to sign;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   g. On June 28, 2017, [DPS] created a fraudulent Performance Appraisal System (\"PAS\") in which [DPS] falsely reported that [Pratt] had been doing \"unsatisfactory work\" as Parole Officer III, for [Pratt]'s signature on the PAS was forged, [Pratt] had not been on the job long enough to justify or warrant the PAS, and on December 12, 2017, [Pratt] learned from HR that the June 28, 2017 PAS was never in his\n   personnel file, confirming that the June 28th PAS was fabricated and forged; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   h.

As a result, any reasonable investigation by the EEOC into Pratt's retaliation claim based on the December 2016 badge removal that Pratt undoubtedly exhausted would also have been expected to result in the\n   EEOC's investigation into these allegedly retaliatory events as well, all occurring within a few months of each other.

Pratt suggests that these retaliatory actions were in response to his complaints of employment discrimination raised in the 2015 Lawsuit, which was dismissed pursuant to a settlement agreement on April 28, 2016. Order Dismissing 2015 Lawsuit at 2, Dkt. No. 9-10. As such, counsel for Pratt argued at the March 16, 2018 hearing that the time gap between the alleged protected activity on April 28, 2016 and the allegedly retaliatory removal of Pratt's badge on December 29, 2016, for example, is sufficiently narrow to support an inference of prima facie causation. However, the date of Pratt's protected activity is when he\n   <em>\n    filed\n   </em>\n   the 2015 Lawsuit (July 14, 2015), not the date that the suit\n   <em>\n    settled\n   </em>\n   (April 28, 2016). Thus, the relevant temporal gap is more than 17 months-from July 14, 2015 to December 29, 2016-far greater than even the delays of three and four months that courts have identified as too remote.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Moreover, even if the Court were to assume,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that the temporal gap in this case is the approximately five-month delay advocated by Pratt, the result would be the same. Pratt has failed to present additional evidence sufficient to raise the inference that his protected activity was the likely reason for the alleged misrepresentation on Pratt's annual Employee Performance Appraisal Form (Compl. \u00b6 36(a) ), the removal of Pratt's badge (Compl. \u00b6 36(b) ), and the CIU-to-HPA transfer (Compl. \u00b6 36(c) ).\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Serlin v.

Accordingly, Pratt cannot establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII with respect to the alleged wrongful acts described in paragraphs 36(a) through (c) of the Complaint, each of which is too temporally remote from the July 14, 2015 filing of Pratt's 2015 Lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Were there no other protected activity, then the other allegations in paragraph 36 of the Complaint would also be too temporally disconnected and remote, coming even later in time than the allegations\n   in paragraph 36(a) through (c). However, under Pratt's central theory-that the Department retaliated against him for complaining about a sexually hostile work environment and sex discrimination-Pratt's February 22, 2017 filing of the 2017 Charge represents renewed protected activity. In light of this filing date, paragraphs 36(d) through (h) of the Complaint (Dkt. No. 1)-which describe alleged incidents occurring in April 2017 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 36(d)-(f) ), on June 28, 2017 (Compl. \u00b6 36(g) ), and on November 22, 2017 (Compl. \u00b6 36(h) )-are not too remote to establish a pattern of alleged wrongdoings sufficient to support a prima facie claim for Title VII retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Accordingly, Count I for Retaliation under Title VII is DISMISSED insofar as it is grounded in the allegations described in sub-paragraphs 36(a), 36(b), and 36(c) of the Complaint (Dkt.
