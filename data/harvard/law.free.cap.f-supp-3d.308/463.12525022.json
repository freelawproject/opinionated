The plaintiff, Preferred Mutual Insurance Company, as subrogee of the homeowner, brings negligence and breach of warranty claims against (1) the product manufacturer, Stadler Form Aktiengesellschaft (\"Stadler Form\"), (2) the U.S. distributor, Swizz Style, Inc. (\"Swizz Style\"), and (3) the retail seller, Brookstone Company, Inc. Brookstone and Swizz Style have cross-claimed against Stadler Form. Stadler\n   Form has moved, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2), to dismiss the claims against it for lack of personal jurisdiction. Preferred Mutual and Swizz Style have opposed the motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I.

Facts Considered\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Using this prima facie standard, I rely on the following proffered facts:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The homeowner purchased the product at issue, a Viktor air purifier, in Kittery, Maine. The product allegedly caused a fire at the homeowner's house in Charlestown, Massachusetts, which resulted in substantial damage. Preferred Mutual paid the homeowner's claim and is subrogated to possible claims against the several defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Stadler Form is a foreign corporation with its principal place of business in Switzerland. Swizz Style, an Ohio corporation, is the exclusive, independent distributor of Stadler Form's products in the United States and has been such since its incorporation in 2006. There is no corporate relationship between Stadler Form and Swizz Style; their relationship is solely contractual. Swizz Style sells \"a high volume\" of Stadler Form products in Massachusetts. Swizz Style asserts that the Massachusetts market is important to Stadler Form because of the presence of large online retailers in the Commonwealth. From 2013 to 2016, Swizz Style employed Massachusetts sales representatives who sold Stadler Form products. Massachusetts sales of Stadler Form products by Swizz Style resulted in $992,652 of revenue to Swizz Style from 2010 to October 5, 2017, with annual revenue ranging from $62,253 in 2010 to over $185,972 in 2017. Stadler Form has been aware that significant quantities of Stadler Form products are\n   sold by Swizz Style in Massachusetts. Swizz Style has held monthly Skype meetings with Stadler Form in which Juerg Baenziger, the president and CEO of Swizz Style, presumably acting in Ohio, would inform Stadler Form, presumably acting in Switzerland, about important buyers, including Massachusetts buyers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Stadler Form, for its part, asserts that it is not incorporated in Massachusetts and has never maintained a place of business here. Stadler Form has never been registered or licensed to do business, never had a registered agent for service of process, and never employed any person in Massachusetts. There is no Stadler Form office, bank account, phone number, or company asset in Massachusetts. Stadler Form has not paid any taxes to the Commonwealth. No Stadler Form representative or employee has traveled to Massachusetts on behalf of Stadler Form in connection with events at issue here. Stadler Form did not itself advertise or market its products in Massachusetts. Rather, the company only sells its products to Swizz Style, which markets and sells them for its own account, in Massachusetts and elsewhere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The manufacture, testing, and inspection of Viktor air purifiers occurred either in Switzerland or China. Stadler Form alleges, and Swizz Style does not dispute, that Swizz Style has been and continues to be responsible for the sale and delivery of the air purifiers to retailers and end users in the United States. Swizz Style does not directly dispute Stadler Form's contention that Stadler Formdid not have control over where Swizz Style sold the air purifiers in the United States, and no Stadler Form approval was required for Swizz Style to make Massachusetts sales of Stadler Form's products. In designing the Viktor air purifier, Stadler Form did not create any Massachusetts-specific aspects of the product nor did Stadler Form design it to comply with Massachusetts-specific requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III. Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   There are two steps in determining whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant is proper: first, consideration of the applicable long-arm statute, and second, consideration of constitutional due process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    A Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086710\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/54/#p58\">\n    812 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   58 ;\n   <em>\n    SCVNGR, Inc. v. Punchh, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20Mass.%20324\">\n    478 Mass. 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20N.E.3d%2050\">\n    85 N.E.3d 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 52 (2017) (\"[A] determination under the long-arm statute is to precede consideration of the constitutional question.\") (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    A. Massachusetts Long-Arm Statute\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Subsection (d) of the long-arm statute, Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 223A, Section 3, authorizes jurisdiction over a defendant who has caused tortious injury in Massachusetts by an act or omission outside Massachusetts if the defendant \"derives substantial revenue from goods used or consumed\" in Massachusetts,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20N.E.3d%2050\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3(d). This provision of the long-arm statute is easily satisfied here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   First, the tortious injury-the fire-occurred in Massachusetts and arose out of the claimed negligent design and/or manufacture of the air purifier in either Switzerland or China. Second, although the annual revenue to Stadler Form from the sale of its products in Massachusetts is not directly shown in the record, it is an easy inference from the substantial amount of Swizz Style's Massachusetts-derived revenue from the sale of Stadler Form products that Stadler Form's derived revenue from those sales was not insubstantial as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Keds Corp. v. Renee Int'l Trading Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527966\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/888/215/#p219\">\n    888 F.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 219 (1st Cir. 1989) (holding $15,000 sale of products was sufficient) (citation omitted). Further, Stadler Form's\n   derivation of that revenue was not so indirect or attenuated as to defeat the assertion of jurisdiction under \u00a7 3(d).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heins v. Wilhelm Loh Wetzlar Optical Mach. GmbH &amp; Co. KG.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1156961\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/26/14/\">\n    26 Mass.App.Ct. 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=522%20N.E.2d%20989\">\n    522 N.E.2d 989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 991-94 (1988) (holding the substantial revenue requirement was met despite the fact the defendant, a West German corporation, sold its machines to a Swiss corporation, who in turn, sold the machines to the exclusive United States distributor of defendant's products). Because the long-arm statute authorizes suit under \u00a7 3(d), the constitutional analysis must be considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    B. Due Process\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Absent a showing of general jurisdiction, which plainly is inapplicable here, the First Circuit has required a three-part analysis to determine whether a defendant has the requisite minimum contacts with a forum so that it may be lawfully subjected to specific personal jurisdiction there.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Elec., Radio &amp; Mach. Workers of Am. v. 163 Pleasant St. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524033\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/960/1080/#p1089\">\n    960 F.2d 1080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1089 (1st Cir. 1992). The three aspects of this specific jurisdiction analysis are relatedness, purposeful availment, and overall reasonableness.\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054519\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/530/22/#p26\">\n    530 F.3d at 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Preferred Mutual and Swizz Style must satisfy all three in order to establish that the exercise of personal jurisdiction over Stadler Form comports with due process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    C.W.

Stadler Form's products reached consumers in Massachusetts (and Maine, in this case) because Swizz Style and downstream retailers like Brookstone made their own decisions about where to sell the products. Swizz Style does not point to any direction received from Stadler Form regarding the Massachusetts market. Swizz Style was the exclusive distributor for the entire United States; it appears that it could decide to target particular state markets or not. There is no evidence that Stadler Form designed the product for market in Massachusetts, advertised in Massachusetts, or had channels for communicating with customers in Massachusetts about the product. There is no assertion that Stadler Form representatives traveled to Massachusetts to provide advice to customers or to service the products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Swizz Style speculates that Massachusetts was an important market to Stadler Form because of the presence here of online retailers who might be bulk buyers, but apart from the speculation, it offers no specific facts to support the assertion. The record indicates that the regular Skype calls between Swizz Style and Stadler Form consisted of discussion of sales and buyers generally. If those calls had included urgings from Stadler Form personnel to target or pay attention to the Massachusetts market, one might have expected that fact to have been proffered in Swizz Style's affidavit and argument. Instead, while Swizz Style argues Stadler Form \"targeted\" Massachusetts, it provides no further facts or details regarding this contention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barrett v.

Indeed, a manufacturer's decision to sell through an independent distributor such as Swizz Style rather than a closely affiliated distributor subject to the manufacturer's control might well be specifically intended to try to limit the likelihood the company would have to answer suits anywhere in the world, wherever its products might foreseeably be sold by others.
