In March 2015, Spirit Cruises hired her as a deckhand, during which time her job duties included greeting guests, docking and undocking the ship, \"stand[ing] lookout,\" and assisting with some maintenance and cleaning.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030104\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030104\">\n    , \u00b6\u00b6 4, 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 25, 2015, Plaintiff's assigned vessel hit a few snags when trying to embark its passengers.

This necessitated a trip back to the dock, where the boat would need to be re-tied and the gangway re-set. Again, it was usually the first mate's responsibility to assist the Captain in these endeavors, but on this night, Grant was told to help. Initially, Plaintiff resisted because \"she could see the anger mounting in the Captain['\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   ]s face,\" but, not wanting to be the next one told to walk the plank, she ultimately relented and went to help.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030104\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the middle of preparing to lift the gangway, the Captain suddenly \"yanked the gangway ...

When Grant subsequently prepared to dock the boat again, the line became jammed.

Grant then disembarked and went to her car. As she began to dial 911, another deckhand appeared in her passenger window; fearing that the employee might have been sent to \"inflict more harm,\" Plaintiff \"feared for her life and fled the parking lot.\" SAC, \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Two years later, Grant filed two separate suits against Entertainment Cruises and Spirit Cruises in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. Both actions alleged three violations of the D.C. Human Rights Act and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 (Notice of Removal), Exh. A. Defendants successfully removed the cases to federal court, and this Court consolidated them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Minute Order of August 29, 2017. The cruise lines then moved to dismiss all of her claims as time-barred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 10. In response, Plaintiff requested leave to amend her Complaint, throwing the DCHRA and emotional-distress counts overboard in favor of four counts under D.C. labor-law statutes and a Jones Act claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 21; Case No. 17-1410, ECF No. 16. The Court granted her Motion to Amend the Complaint and, accordingly, denied Defendants' first Motion to Dismiss as moot. The cruise lines again moved to dismiss, which the Court largely granted. It allowed her to proceed on one count for unsafe working conditions and invited her to re-plead the Jones Act claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 24, 29. Grant took the Court up on this offer and successfully moved to file a Second Amended Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 33, 36. Again, Defendants moved to dismiss, this time arguing that the Jones Act preempts her D.C. claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 40. The Court agreed and dismissed her state-law cause of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 46.

Although Plaintiff's Opposition makes several mentions of the \"unseaworthiness\" of the ship,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 11-12, Defendants correctly note that such a claim was not pled in her Second Amended Complaint. Giving her the benefit of the doubt, however, the Court presumes these allegations relate to her Jones Act claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   According to Grant, Defendants were negligent by failing to (1) properly train the crew; and (2) provide her with proper safety or protective gear.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12. Although Plaintiff lists several instances that she believed constituted such unsafe working conditions, the only one tethered to her alleged injury here is a need for protective gear, specifically a helmet, when tying down the ropes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Grant Dep. at 81:1. Although a ship owner must provide adequate equipment to seamen,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

La. 2013), in order to show that Defendants were negligent in not furnishing her a helmet, Plaintiff must proffer some evidence from which a jury could infer that it was the industry standard or reasonable practice to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reveron v. Tycom, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%203186600\">\n    2004 WL 3186600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (D.N.J. 2004) (granting employer summary judgment when plaintiff did not produce evidence that issued safety equipment was inadequate). She has not done so here and thus cannot, as a matter of law, proceed on a direct-negligence claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Vicarious Liability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff's claim can also be interpreted as alleging that Defendants were vicariously liable for the tortious acts of the Captain, including both the assault and subsequent refusal of medical care. Just as under common law, an employer's Jones Act \"negligence\" can extend to intentional torts under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   if (1) they were committed by an employee in furtherance of the employer's business,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beech v.

Pa. 2009). Nothing in the record suggests that Defendants knew or had reason to know of the Captain's supposed violent nature. The latter ground of foreseeability is thus inapplicable, and the Court only addresses the former.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants assert that the Captain's \"duties consisted of ensuring proper navigation of the vessel and the safety of the passengers and crew.\" Mot. at 7. An assault of a crew member, they argue, is \"so clearly contrary to [Defendants'] business interests\" that no jury could find it was \"done in furtherance of his duties.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8. This, the Court believes, construes the scope of his employment too narrowly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The D.C. Circuit has not addressed\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   in the specific context of the Jones Act, but under common-law principles an employer is liable for the intentional torts of its employee committed within the scope of employment when the conduct \"is actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve\" the employer and, given the job duties, was \"not unexpectable\" by it.\n   <em>\n    Lamb v.
