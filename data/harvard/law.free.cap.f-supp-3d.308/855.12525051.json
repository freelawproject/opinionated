Plaintiff Nasir Finneman\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"Finneman\") alleges that Defendant Melody Campbell (\"Campbell\") violated his Fourteenth Amendment rights by falsely reporting to authorities that Finneman had attempted to rob and assault her. Based on Campbell's report, Finneman was arrested and spent five days in jail. Finneman now seeks damages from Campbell for malicious prosecution by initiating proceedings against him without probable cause. Following a bench trial, and pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a), this Memorandum constitutes the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law. Ultimately, for the following reasons, the Court will enter judgment for Campbell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Finneman filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   complaint on April 7, 2015, which contained claims against various defendants. ECF No. 3. Eventually, he obtained a lawyer, and his claims went through several rounds of pleadings and dismissal before discovery began. After several motions to dismiss and amended complaints, the Defendants filed motions for summary judgment as to the remaining claims. ECF Nos. 62, 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court granted the Defendants' motions for summary judgment as to all claims except those against Campbell, ECF Nos. 70, 71, leaving Campbell as the sole remaining defendant, and malicious prosecution (under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as state law) as the only remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court then held a bench trial, beginning on February 26, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 90. There, Campbell called three witnesses: SEPTA Police Sergeant Daniel Caban, SEPTA station manager William Dicks, and Campbell herself. Finneman called only himself as a witness. The Court has reviewed this testimony and Campbell's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 96, as well as the exhibits admitted at trial. Upon this record, including credibility determinations, the Court makes its findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the time of the incident, Campbell was employed by SEPTA as a cashier.

However, this testimony is undermined by other evidence. Caban observed Campbell's purse and its contents on the floor of the booth, Trial Tr.
