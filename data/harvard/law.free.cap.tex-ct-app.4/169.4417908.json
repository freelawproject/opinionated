A. Labbaite <em>v. </em>The State.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b179-9\">1. Final Judgment. \u2014By repeated decisions it is now well established that an appeal is maintainable only from a final judgment of conviction, and is not maintainable from a judgment overruling a motion for a new trial or in arrest of judgment.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b179-11\">2. Judges, Prosecuting Attorneys, and Clerks of Courts are commended to a study of the case of <em>Mayfield </em>v. <em>The State, </em>40 Texas, 289, for the requisites of final judgments; and are exhorted to conform thereto, and thereby avert a serious mischief illustrated by numerous decisions of the Supreme Court and this court.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b179-13\">Appeals from the District Court of Lampasas. Tried below before the Hon. W. A. Blackburn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-14\">Two cases against the same party were disposed of by the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b179-15\"><em>C.

In the first case his punishment was assessed, by the verdict of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>the jury, at imprisonment in the penitentiary for four, and in the second for six, years. So far as each case is necessary to be decided on appeal here, the questions are identically the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Th\u00e9re was no final judgment rendered in either case in the court below. A motion is made in both cases, by the attorney-general, to dismiss the appeal for want of a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">It is a rule now well established by repeated decisions in this state, that an appeal is not maintainable from a judgment overruling a motion for a new trial, or in arrest of judgment, but that a judgment final of conviction is an indispensable prerequisite. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>The State, </em>3 Texas Ct. App. 47; citing <em>Mayfield </em>v. <em>The State, </em>40 Texas, 289; <em>Auschinks </em>v. <em>The State, </em>43 Texas, 587; <em>Young </em>v. <em>The State, </em>1 Texas Ct. App. 64; <em>Butler </em>v. <em>The State, </em>1 Texas Ct. App. 638. In addition to these authorities, see, also, <em>Trimble </em>v. <em>The State, </em>2 Texas Ct. App. 303, and <em>Choate </em>v. <em>The State, </em>2 Texas Ct. App. 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">We again take occasion, as was done in several of the cases here cited, to call the special attention of county and district attorneys, and of county and district judges and clerks, to the case of <em>Mayfield </em>v. <em>The State, </em>40 Texas, 289, for the rules prescribing what is necessary to make a judgment of conviction in a criminal case final. After so many and repeated lessons upon a matter so vital to the interests of not only the defendant, but also of the state, it is not well perceived how such errors of omission are still committed in the conduct and disposition of criminal trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">The motion of the attorney-general, in each of these cases, is sustained, and the appeals in both cases are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">\n<em>Appeals dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
