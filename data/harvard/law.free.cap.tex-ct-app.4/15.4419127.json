Charge upon Seasonable Doubt.\u2014Upon the subject of reasonable-doubt, a charge couched in the language of the Code is all that is required, even in felony cases, and all that is advisable in any case. Attempts to elucidate that language are often mischievous and never necessary.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b25-11\">2. Same. \u2014 In a misdemeanor case the court charged the jury to acquit the-accused if they had a reasonable doubt of his guilt, \u201c deduced from the testimony.\u201d <em>Held, </em>in view o\u00a3 the character of the case and of the evidence,, that notwithstanding the interpolation, the charge is not error to the prejudice of the appellant.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b25-13\">3. Verdicts are to have a reasonable intendment and to receive a reasonable construction, and are not to be avoided unless from necessity originating-in doubt as to their import, immateriality of the issue found, or tendency to work injustice.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b25-15\">4. Same. \u2014 The verdict in a misdemeanor case assessed a \u201cfind\u201d against the accused of $100. <em>Held, </em>that the context shows that the word was intended-for \u201cfine,\u201d and it is susceptible of no other construction.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-17\">Appeal from the County Court of Lamar. Tried below before the Hon. S. C. Bryson, County Judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-18\">Information against the appellant for aggravated assault on William Stiles, with a pistol.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b26-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number><em>Hale &amp; Scott, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AR\">Our statute (Pasc. Dig., art. 3105) says that a defendant in a criminal cause is presumed to be innocent until his guilt is established by legal evidence; and in case of reasonable doubt as to his guilt, he is entitled to be acquitted. We think this provision of the statute is plain and simple, and that a county judge who can read and write ought to be able to give it to a jury. But in this case the court below tried to improve upon the statute, and charged the jury that the reasonable doubt \u201c must be deduced from the testimony; \u201d thus assuming that the doubt must be predicated upon, or produced by, evidence, when we understand the rule to be that the doubt arises from the want of testimony going to show the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>Bray </em>v. <em>The State, </em>41 Texas, 560.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-5\">The verdict of the jury, instead of assessing a \u201cfine\u201d against the defendant, is, \u201c assess the find,\u201d when \u201cfine\u201d and \u201cfind \u201d are two words of very different meaning. \u201c Fine,\u201d in its legal signification, means to assess or create a pecuniary obligation. \u201c Find\u201d means to discover; to search out something unknown. It will not do to say the jury meant to say \u201c fine \u201d instead of \u201c find.\u201d The court has no more right to supply a material omission in a verdict, or to substitute a material word of a different meaning to the one used by the jury, than it has to make a new verdict, different from the one returned by the jury. As to sufficiency of verdicts generally, see <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>36 Texas, 152; <em>Long </em>v. <em>The State, </em>34 Texas, 566; <em>Gibbs </em>v. <em>The State, </em>34 Texas, 134; <em>Kuhlman v. Medlinka, </em>29 Texas, 390; <em>Sheffield </em>v. <em>The State, </em>1 Texas Ct. App. 640.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b26-6\"><em>W. B. Dunham, </em>for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b26-7\">Winkler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6\">Counsel for appellant, in their brief, say: \u201c The assignment of errors in this cause raises but two distinct propositions of law: the legality of the charge of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>court below to the jury, and the sufficiency of the verdict in form and verbiage to authorize and sustain the judgment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">The particular objection taken to the charge of the court at the time of the trial below, as set out in the bill of exceptions embodied in the transcript, is as follows : \u201c Because the same is misleading, and, taken as a whole, is not a clear exposition of the law of the case.\u201d The verdict of the jury is in the following language, as we find it set out in the transcript, to wit: \u201c We, the jury, find the defendant guilty as charged, and assess the <em>find </em>against defendant one hundred dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">From an examination of the testimony as set out in the statement of facts, we are of opinion there was no room for controversy as to whether or not the accused drew a pistol on the person alleged to have been assaulted. On this subject the evidence is so clear and explicit as not to admit of question. The controversy seems to have been as to the intention with which it was drawn \u2014 whether to inflict injury upon the assaulted party, or whether it was drawn for the purpose of self-defense against danger from him. This seems to have been the question arising out of the evidence, and on this subject we are of opinion the charge was sufficiently clear not to have misled the jury as to their province in applying the facts to the law, upon the main issue raised by the proofs, and was substantially the law of the case as made by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">It is contended, however, in the assignment of errors and in argument, that the charge on the subject of <em>reasonable doubt </em>was wholly incorrect.' The charge on that subject is as follows : \u201c Should you have a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the defendant, deduced from the testimony, he is entitled to the benefit of that doubt, and you should acquit him.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Much trouble has been occasioned by judges attempting to explain to jurors what is meant by the expression \u201c reasonable doubt,\u201d employed in article 640 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Pasc. Dig., art. 3105), which is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-5\">\u201cA defendant in a criminal cause is presumed to be innocent until his guilt is established by legal evidence ; and in case of a reasonable doubt as to his guilt, he is entitled \u2022to be acquitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">A charge couched in the language of the article is all the law requires, even in felonies. <em>Murray </em>v. <em>The State, </em>1 Texas Ct. App. 417; <em>Black </em>v. <em>The State, </em>1 Texas Ct. App. 368; <em>Hampton </em>v. <em>The </em>State, 1 Texas Ct. App. 652. No further explanation is necessary or desirable.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">We find in the charge no material error of which the appellant can complain. In fact, the testimony was of a character not to leave in the minds of the jury any ground for a reasonable doubt as to his guilt, and the judgment ought not to be reversed on this ground. Being a case of misdemeanor, the court might have omitted to charge on the subject at all; and, under the proofs, we fail to discover that inserting in the charge the words that the reasonable doubt should be \u201c deduced from the testimony \u201d was\" error.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">As to the objection to the verdict. Verdicts are to have a reasonable intendment and to receive a reasonable construction,, and are not to be avoided unless from necessity originating in doubt of their import, or immateriality of the issue found, or of their manifest tendency to work injustice. 1 Waterman on New Tr. 159, cited in <em>Lindsay </em>v. <em>The State, </em>1 Texas Ct. App. 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">In <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>The People, </em>4 Scam. 333, the language of the verdict was: \u201c We, the jury, find the defendant guilty of the crime;\u201d and the court say: \u201c In a criminal case, a verdict is sufficient if the proper judgment to be rendered upon it can be pleaded in case of another indict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>ment for the same offense. The words \u2018 of the crime \u2019 * * * may be held surplusage.\u201d <em>Murray </em>v. <em>The State, </em>and cases there cited, 1 Texas Ct. App. 327.</p>\n<p id=\"A3p\">Testing the verdict in the present case, being a misdemeanor, it is sufficient to support the judgment. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty as to the fact that the jury found the defendant guilty. This they say in the verdict. \u201c Guilty as charged,\u201d could only relate to the charge in the information; so that the verdict is explicit, whether you look to the information for the charge, or regard the words as surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">The other feature of the verdict is in this language: \u201cAnd assess the find against defendant one hundred dollars.\u201d Evidently the jury intended, as the true context shows, to say, \u201c and assess the fine,\u201d where they wrote the word \u201c find.\u201d Standing in the position it does in the sentence it could have no other sensible meaning, and is susceptible of but one construction, and was so understood by the court in entering up the judgment upon it. There can be no question that the conviction and judgment could be successfully pleaded in bar of another prosecution ,for the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">After a careful examination of the whole case as disclosed by the record, we see no sufficient reason to reverse the judgment rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
