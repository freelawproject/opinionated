Admissions by Counsel. \u2014It is error ,to instruct the jury that a material allegation of the indictment is admitted by the counsel for the defense. No such admissions by a defendant\u2019s counsel are evidence against him, or a proper subject for the consideration of the jury.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b525-15\">Appeal from the District Court of Uvalde. Tried below before the Hon. T. M. Paschal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-16\">The opinion sets out the charging part of the indictment, and such other matters as are discussed by this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number><em>T. T Teel </em>and <em>A. A. Dial, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avq\">We believe that our motion in arrest of judgment should- have been sustained: (1) Because the indictment charges appellant with two distinct offenses \u2014 one for aiding and assisting prisoners lawfully detained in custody to <em>escape, </em>and to <em>attempt </em>to escape. \u201cAiding and assisting to escape\u201d is quite a different thing from \u201c aiding and assisting to <em>attempt </em>to escape.\u201d We do not believe there is any such offense as either \u201c aiding and assisting to escape,\u201d or \u201c aiding and assisting to attempt to escape.\u201d We contend that the offense contemplated in article 1946 of Paschal\u2019s Digest, under which this indictment is attempted to be framed, is a distinct and different offense from that set forth in the indictment. Had the district attorney followed the statute, without attempting to improve it, probably a good indictment could have been framed. (2) The indictment charges appellant with \u201c conveying \u201d and \u201c causing to be conveyed,\u201d etc. The statute is, \u201cif any person shall convey,\u201d etc. There is no such offense as \u201c conveying and causing to be conveyed.\u201d \u201cTo convey\u201d is something done by the first person; .causing to be conveyed, the act is done by a second person. It may be contended that the words \u201c and caused to be conveyed \u2019 \u2019 may be treated as surplusage ; but the appellant was charged and put upon his trial for the specific charge, \u201c convey and cause to be conveyed,\u201d etc. To say the least of it, it is a kind of double-geared fish-trap, that will catch in going up stream as well as down; and if I can\u2019t catch you for \u201c conveying \u201d I will catch you for \u201c causing to be conveyed,\u201d and if I can\u2019t catch you for the \u201c in.tent to aid and assist prisoners to escape,\u201d I will catch you for the \u201c intent to aid and assist prisoners to <em>attempt </em>to escape.\u201d Just here we will say that the \u201cintent\u201d is the main ingredient of all criminal actions. What must be the intent in a prosecution under article 1946, Paschal\u2019s Digest? Must it be to aid and assist? It is not so nominated in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>statute. The \u201cintent\u201d must be \u201c to facilitate,\u201d and the indictment nowhere charges that the offense was done with the \u201c intent \u201d to facilitate the escape of prisoners lawfully detained in custody ; hence we contend that our motion in arrest of judgment should have been sustained.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b527-6\"><em>George McCormick, </em>Assistant Attorney-General, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b527-7\">White, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aop\">This prosecution is based upon the following</p>\n<p id=\"ArC\">provisions of our Penal Code, viz.: \u201c If any person shall convey into any jail any disguise, instrument, arms, or anything useful to aid any prisoner in escaping, with intent to facilitate the escape of a prisoner lawfully detained in such jail on an accusation of .felony, or shall, in any other manner calculated to effect the object, aid in the escape of a prisoner legally confined in jail, he shall be punished by imprisonment in the penitentiary not less than two nor more than five years.\u201d Pasc. Dig., art. 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">The indictment charges \u201c that George Spears and Sweet Clayton, on the eighteenth day of the month of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand, eight hundred and seventy-eight, in said county of Uvalde, and state of Texas, with force and arms, and with the fraudulent, felonious, and unlawful intent to facilitate the escape of John Woods and Lark Clayton, prisoners lawfully detained and confined in the county jail of Uvalde County, Texas, on the charge of felony, to-wit, the crime of theft of a cow, did then and there fraudulently, feloniously, and unlawfully convey, and caused to be conveyed, into said jail of Uvalde County a certain instrument, to-wit, a file, said file being then and there an instrument useful to aid the prisoners, the said John Woods and Lark Clayton, in escaping from the said county jail of Uvalde County, in which said jail they, the said John Woods and Lark Clayton, were then and there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>lawfully, detained and confined on an accusation of felony aforesaid, said file being then and there an instrument as aforesaid, and having then and there so conveyed into said jail, as aforesaid, was then and there delivered to the said John Woods and Lark Clayton by the said George Spears and Sweet Clayton, as aforesaid, with the fraudulent, felonious, and unlawful intent to aid and assist the said John Woods and Lark Clayton, who were then and there in lawful custody, as aforesaid, to escape, and attempt to escape, from and out of the said county jail of Uvalde County, Texas,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Now, whilst this indictment may be obnoxious to the criticism that it is tautological and inartistically drawn, we are of opinion that it sufficiently charges the offense under the statute. The words \u201c and attempt to escape,\u201d in the last clause, as copied above, and which are objected to in defendant\u2019s motion in arrest of judgment, are mere surplusage, and may be stricken out without affecting the substance or sense of the indictment. A further reference to the beginning portion of the charge above set out will fully meet the other objection of counsel urged on the motion in arrest, to wit, that the intent must be <em>to facilitate, </em>and should be so charged. This the indictment does most explicitly.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The charge of the court, which was otherwise unexceptionable, presents an error which will necessitate a reversal of the case. In the fourth subdivision of the charge the jury are told that \u201c it is admitted by the defendant\u2019s counsel that John Woods and Lark Clayton were prisoners legally confined in the county jail of Uvalde County, on an accusation of felony, to-wit, theft of a cow.\u201d As was said in the case of <em>Nels </em>v. <em>The </em>State: \u201cThe prisoner\u2019s counsel had no authority to make any statement or admission to supply the place or have the force of evidence against him. No confession of theirs could bind or affect him. Their admissions could not in law prejudice or affect his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>rights; nor could they be in anywise jeopardized by the assumption of any grounds whatever upon which his defense may have been placed by his counsel. Whether those grounds were correct or incorrect, true or false, was wholly immaterial. That was not the question for the consideration of the jury, whose duty it was to decide the question of the guilt or innocence upon the law as given them by the court, and the evidence as given by the witnesses, irrespective of any admissions by the prisoner\u2019s counsel, or any grounds upon which they may have rested his defense.\u201d 2 Texas, 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">For this error in the charge of the court, the judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
