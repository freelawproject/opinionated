This had the effect of reversing the district court\u2019s holding that the act of production of that evidence was suppressed. It was our intention to affirm the holding of the district court suppressing the act of production and to reverse the district court\u2019s holding suppressing the physical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">Accordingly, the word \u201cREVERSED\u201d is deleted from the end of the panel opinion and the following is substituted therefor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtqC\">\u201cThe government acknowledged in oral argument that the district court was correct in suppressing the act of production of the physical evidence. That portion of its ruling is, therefore, AFFIRMED. Accordingly, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART and the matter is REMANDED to the district court.\u201d</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
