We find that his sentence was unreasonable, and remand for resen-tencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-28\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-29\">A bill of information charged Campbell with one count of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371 and 2, for conspiracy to commit mail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>fraud, and one count of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341 and 2, for the substantive offense. The bill alleged that Campbell owned and operated the American International Jewelry Corporation, and through newspaper advertisements and telephone contacts, he and his employees had recruited people to become manufacturing representatives for the company. Campbell promised each recruit that for $3,576 he or she would receive a \u201cstart up\u201d sales kit containing some earrings and twenty-four display racks. About 30 unsuspecting persons sent Campbell the money, but not one received a sales kit.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Campbell waived his right to indictment by a grand jury, and pleaded guilty on both counts. In sentencing Campbell, the district court grouped together the two counts against Campbell pursuant to Guideline \u00a7 3D1.2. It determined that the appropriate base guideline was Guideline \u00a7 2F1.1, \u201cFraud and Deceit,\u201d carrying a base offense level of 6. In consideration of the amount of money involved, 30 X $3,576 = $107,280, the court adjusted Campbell\u2019s offense level up 6 points under \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l)(G). Because the offense involved more than minimal planning and was aimed at more than one victim, the court added 2 more points under \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(2). The court then added 2 for Campbell\u2019s role as an organizer \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), and subtracted 2 for Campbell\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, \u00a7 3El.l(a). The resulting offense level of 14, when combined with Campbell\u2019s Criminal History Category I, resulted in a guideline sentencing range of 15 to 21 months. <em>See </em>Sentencing Table, Guidelines at 5.2 (October 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The district court noted that the guidelines recommended a sentence in the 15 to 21 month range, but departed from the guidelines \u201cdue to the magnitude of this offense directed at numerous unsuspecting victims, [reflecting] aggravating circumstances not adequately taken into consideration by the Guidelines.\u201d The court sentenced Campbell to the statutory maximum of sixty months of imprisonment on each of the two counts, to run concurrently, as well as 24 months of supervised release, restitution in the amount of $80,000, and the costs of his incarceration and supervision on supervised release. Campbell filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">This court will affirm a departure from the sentencing guidelines if the district court provides acceptable reasons for the departure, and the extent of the departure is reasonable. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e); <em>United States v. Velasquez-Mercado, </em>872 F.2d 632, 635 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">A district court shall impose sentence within the Guideline range recommended unless it finds \u201cthat there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines ...\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b). In making this determination, the district court considers only the sentencing guidelines, policy statements and official commentary of the Sentencing Commission. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">Section 5K2.0 of the guidelines states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-13\">[T]he court may depart from the guidelines, even though the reason for departure is listed elsewhere in the guidelines (e.g., as an adjustment or specific offense characteristic), if the court determines that, in light of unusual circumstances, the guideline level attached to that factor is inadequate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-14\">Guidelines at 5.36 (June 15, 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-15\">Adjustments in Campbell\u2019s offense level took into consideration the reason for the district court\u2019s departure: the magnitude of the offense. The court adjusted that level upward 6 points because of the amount of money involved, over $100,000, and up another 2 points because more than one victim was involved and because the offense required substantial planning.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-16\">The magnitude of Campbell\u2019s offense was not unlike that which is ordinarily involved in a mail fraud conviction. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>United States v. Buchanan, </em>544 F.2d 1322 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>432 U.S. 907, 97 S.Ct. 2953, 53 L.Ed.2d 1080 (1977) (solid-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>tations of franchisees through newspaper advertisements); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>536 F.2d 628 (5th Cir.1976) (sale of \u201carea managerships\u201d through newspaper advertisements). But the district court imposed on Campbell a sentence three to four times the recommended sentencing range. While the mere fact that a departure sentence exceeds by several times the guideline maximum is of no independent consequence in determining whether the sentence is reasonable, <em>United States v. Roberson, </em>872 F.2d 597, 606 and n. 7 (5th Cir.1989), it may indicate the unreasonableness of the departure viewed against the court\u2019s justification for that departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">In <em>Roberson, </em>the district court departed from the Guidelines and imposed a sentence 3V2 times the maximum recommended for the defendant\u2019s conviction of credit card fraud. This court determined that this departure was reasonable, based on the district court\u2019s reason for the extreme departure: the defendant burned the victim\u2019s body in a garbage dumpster after the victim died accidentally. This was plainly an occurrence the Sentencing Commission did not take into account when it considered credit card fraud. <em>Roberson, </em>872 F.2d at 602-08. In the instant case, the court departed based on a factor already considered in determining Campbell\u2019s offense level. That factor was not present to a degree substantially in excess of that ordinarily involved in a mail fraud conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">We are unsatisfied from the reasons advanced by the district court that Campbell\u2019s offense warranted such an extreme departure from the recommended guideline sentencing range. Accordingly, we cannot say that the extent of the district court\u2019s departure was reasonable. We therefore vacate Campbell\u2019s sentence, and remand to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
