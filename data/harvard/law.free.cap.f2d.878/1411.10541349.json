Dixon appeals the district court\u2019s decision to deny her application for an award of attorney\u2019s fees under the relevant provision of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 1132(g). For the reasons stated below, we conclude that the district court\u2019s decision should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1412\">*1412</page-number>Dixon originally filed suit seeking death benefits under the Seafarers\u2019 Welfare Plan (SWP), a multi-employer labor-management trust fund within the meaning of ERISA, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq. </em>Although Dixon\u2019s son was covered by the plan on the date of his death, SWP refused to pay out benefits to Dixon because it was the plan\u2019s \u201cpolicy\u201d to deny death benefits when the employee died by committing suicide. The district court concluded that SWP\u2019s action was arbitrary and capricious and that the death benefits section of the plan contained no exclusion for suicide. Thus, the district court granted Dixon\u2019s motion for summary judgment and a judgment of $20,000.00 was entered for Dixon. In a subsequent order, the district court denied her request under 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1132(g) for $5,082.75 in attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-4\">Section 1132(g) of ERISA provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1504-5\">In any action under this subchapter by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary, the court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and costs of action to either party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1504-6\">While this Court has acknowledged that ERISA\u2019s \u201cessential remedial purpose [is] to protect the beneficiaries of private pension plans,\u201d <em>Nachwalter v. Christie, </em>805 F.2d 956, 962 (11th Cir.1986), the Court has not adopted a presumption in favor of granting attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing beneficiary. <em>See McKnight v. Southern Life and Health Ins. Co., </em>758 F.2d 1566, 1572 (11th Cir.1985) (rejecting argument that because Section 1132(g) is part of remedial scheme, it should be liberally construed in favor of prevailing plan participant). Instead, this Court has interpreted the section to allow attorney\u2019s fees to be assessed against either party in accordance with the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1504-7\">In <em>Ironworkers Local No. 272 v. Bowen, </em>624 F.2d 1255 (5th Cir.1980), this Court\u2019s predecessor promulgated guidelines to assist the district courts in deciding whether to award attorney\u2019s fees under Section 1132(g):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1504-8\">In deciding whether to award attorney\u2019s fees to a party under section 502(g), therefore, a court should consider such factors as the following: (1) the degree of the opposing parties\u2019 culpability or bad faith; (2) the ability of the opposing parties to satisfy an award of attorneys\u2019 fees; (3) whether an award of attorneys\u2019 fees against the opposing parties would deter other persons acting under similar circumstances; (4) whether the parties requesting attorneys\u2019 fees sought to benefit all participants and beneficiaries of an ERISA plan or to resolve a significant legal question regarding ERISA itself; and (5) the relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1504-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 1266. This Court\u2019s review of the district court\u2019s analysis of the <em>Bowen </em>factors is limited to reversing the district court only when there has been a clear abuse of discretion. <em>See Fine v. Semet, </em>699 F.2d 1091, 1095 (11th Cir.1983) (\u201cThis standard of review permits an area of decision in which a district court could go either way without reversal on review.\u201d) (citing <em>Johnson v. Mississippi, </em>606 F.2d 635, 637 (5th Cir.1979)). The <em>Bowen </em>Court identified these five factors as \u201cnuclei of concern\u201d and stated that no one factor was necessarily decisive. <em>Bowen, </em>624 F.2d at 1266.</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-11\">In <em>McKnight, </em>this Court reviewed the denial of attorney\u2019s fees in a case with facts similar to Dixon\u2019s. McKnight was employed by Southern Life for three isolated segments of time before he finally retired. Upon his retirement, the administrator of Southern Life\u2019s pension plan determined that McKnight was entitled to pension benefits only for his last period of employment. McKnight then brought suit under ERISA, challenging the plan administrator\u2019s failure to provide retirement benefits for his previous periods of employment. Based on its interpretation of the pension plan and the summary provided to employees, the district court held that McKnight was entitled to benefits for all three periods of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-12\">However, the district court denied McKnight\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees under Section 1132(g) for the following reasons. First, although Southern Life erred in refusing to honor McKnight\u2019s rights, there was no evidence of bad faith. Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1413\">*1413</page-number>ond, the district court found no evidence of either party\u2019s ability to satisfy an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Third, McKnight\u2019s action did not directly benefit others because he was seeking only individual benefits. Fourth, the district court found that both parties presented \u201csubstantial arguments,\u201d although MeKnight\u2019s position ultimately prevailed. This Court concluded that these findings by the district court were adequate to support the conclusion that the district court was acting within the scope of its discretion in denying McKnight attorney\u2019s fees. <em>McKnight, </em>758 F.2d at 1572.</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-4\">Dixon also successfully challenged an administrator\u2019s interpretation of an employee benefits plan. Her request for attorney\u2019s fees, as in <em>McKnight, </em>was denied. In assessing the five <em>Bowen </em>factors, the district court found SWP in error but not guilty of bad faith. Second, the court found the record devoid of <em>any </em>evidence relative to either party\u2019s ability to satisfy an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Third, the district court found that Dixon neither sought to resolve a significant legal question regarding ERISA nor sought <em>directly </em>to benefit all beneficiaries of the plan. Fourth, the district court found that, while Dixon\u2019s position was stronger, both parties presented \u201csubstantial arguments.\u201d For these reasons, the district court ordered Dixon\u2019s petition for an award of attorney\u2019s fees denied. There was no abuse of discretion by the district court. We AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
