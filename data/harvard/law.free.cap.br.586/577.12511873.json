HARNER, U.S. BANKRUPTCY JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter requires the Court to consider how long a defendant may wait to raise defenses to an action, particularly where there appears to be no issues concerning notice and due process in the original proceeding. More specifically, may a defendant-with knowledge of a state court proceeding against him-take no action in that proceeding, but still contest the findings of the state court in a subsequent bankruptcy case? Does it matter that, in electing not to participate in the state court proceeding, the defendant allowed\n   a default judgment to be entered, an evidentiary damages hearing to be held, and a final judgment on damages to be entered with no appeal or challenge?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court believes that it does matter. Although the Court appreciates that a defendant may desire to take a different strategic approach in a bankruptcy case and may even have valid defenses to the asserted claims, a defendant may not sit on his rights or wait to challenge the claims in what he may perceive to be a more favorable venue. Such an approach prejudices other parties to the original proceeding and contravenes important policy objectives (including finality and judicial economy) that underlie the doctrine of res judicata. Accordingly, as more fully explained below, the Court finds that the particular facts of this adversary proceeding satisfy the doctrine of issue preclusion under Maryland law and that grounds exist to grant the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Relevant Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Damond Durant, Sr. (the \"Defendant\") and Sharae Durant (collectively with the Defendant, the \"Debtors\") filed this chapter 7 case on July 28, 2017. The Debtors list approximately $452,146.00 in debt on the schedules to their chapter 7 petition. The overwhelming majority of this debt relates to a single judgment entered against the Defendant by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on April 12, 2016 (the \"State Court Judgment\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petition, Case No. 17-20232, ECF 1, 23; Ex. D, Am. Mot. Summ. J., ECF 24-6. This adversary proceeding concerns the dischargeability of the State Court Judgment under section 523(a)(4) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The State Court Judgment is based on the Defendant's conduct with respect to certain inheritance funds in the amount of $75,803.83 (the \"Inheritance Funds\") belonging to the Defendant's son, Damon Durant, Jr. (the \"Plaintiff\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.

B, Am. Summ. J. (the \"Complaint\") at 2-3, ECF 24-4. Under the terms of the Will, the Defendant was given custody of the Inheritance Funds because the Plaintiff was still a minor at the time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. When the Plaintiff turned 21 years old, the Defendant gave him $100.00.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4; State Court Tr. 19-20, ECF 24-3. According to the Plaintiff, the Defendant told him that the remainder of the Inheritance Funds was gone and that he should do whatever he needed to do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at 4; State Court Tr. 19-20, ECF 24-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Plaintiff initiated litigation against the Defendant in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (the \"State Court\") on January 16, 2015. The Plaintiff's complaint against the Defendant contained four counts sounding in fraud/intentional theft, breach of fiduciary duties, conversion, and unjust enrichment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, ECF 24-4. The complaint sought actual damages, attorneys' fees, and other appropriate relief.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The State Court's docket indicates that the Writ of Summons was\n   served on the Defendant on March 19, 2015, but that no Answer or other response was filed by the Defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. F., Am. Mot. Summ. J., ECF 24-7. Accordingly, the State Court entered a default judgment against the Defendant on September 29, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The State Court then held an evidentiary hearing on damages relating to the default judgment. Only the Plaintiff and his counsel appeared at the damages hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   State Court Tr. 37, ECF 24-3. The State Court proceeded to hear evidence on the damages request, including the Plaintiff's testimony. The Plaintiff testified that the Defendant would not allow him to use any of the Inheritance Funds until he turned 21 years old, but then when he requested the money, the Defendant told him that all of the money was gone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-16, 18-20. Although the Plaintiff testified that he did not know what happened to the money, he observed certain changes in the Defendant's spending habits, including the purchase of a motorcycle shortly after the Defendant received the Inheritance Funds, and various vacations that the Defendant and his wife took after that time.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The State Court made several findings and observations that are relevant to this adversary proceeding, including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 \"[The Defendant] has failed to appear having been given notice of today's hearing, having failed to respond to any process or notices from this Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 \"I've looked at the conduct of [the Defendant] and I find it to be, as I said at the outset, aside from being heartbreaking to hear that somebody's been treated like this, it's reprehensible.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 \"The fact that [the Defendant] made repeated statements to [the Plaintiff] knowing full well that they were false, that he couldn't touch the money while he was spending it on himself, to me, clearly shows, by clear and convincing evidence, that there was actual malice, that [the Defendant] knew exactly what he was doing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After a full review of the record, the State Court entered the State Court Judgment, awarding the Plaintiff $75,804.83 in actual damages (\"Actual Damages\"), $70,000.00 in non-economic damages (\"Non-Economic Damages\"), and $227,414.49 in punitive damages (\"Punitive Damages\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. D, Am. Mot. Summ. J., ECF 24-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The State Court Judgment was indexed and recorded on April 12, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. F., Am. Mot. Summ. J., ECF 24-7. Also around this time, the Plaintiff garnished the Defendant's wages and was in the process of discovery and other efforts to enforce and collect on the judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Defendant filed a Suggestion of Bankruptcy in the State Court on August 23, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The State Court then entered an order providing that the \"action [was] STAYED as to all claims against [the Defendant] and the proceedings deferred to the Bankruptcy Court in accordance with Section 362 of Title 11 of the United States Code.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following the commencement of this chapter 7 case, the Plaintiff initiated this adversary proceeding by filing a complaint against the Defendant under section 523(a)(4) of the Code (the \"Adversary Complaint\"). ECF 1. The Adversary Complaint\n   was timely filed in accordance with section 523(c) and Bankruptcy Rule 4007(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   By the Adversary Complaint, the Plaintiff seeks a determination that the entire amount of the State Court Judgment-i.e., $373,219.32, plus post-judgment interest and cost-is nondischargeable in this chapter 7 case under section 523(a)(4) of the Code. The Defendant filed an Answer to the Adversary Complaint on December 18, 2017, asserting, among other things, that the State Court Judgment, which was a judgment entered by default, is not binding in this proceeding. ECF 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Shortly thereafter, the Plaintiff filed his Amended Motion for Summary Judgment (the \"Motion\"). ECF 24. By the Motion, the Plaintiff posits that the State Court's findings of fact made during the evidentiary hearing on the damages award memorialized by the State Court Judgment are binding on this Court under the doctrine of issue preclusion. The Defendant filed an Objection to the Motion, arguing that the State Court Judgment has no res judicata effect (under either the claim or issue preclusion doctrine) because it was a default judgment. ECF 29. The Court held a hearing on the Motion and the related pleadings on February 22, 2018 (the \"Hearing\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the Court's invitation, both parties filed post-hearing briefs.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The bankruptcy discharge is a hallmark of U.S. bankruptcy law. It provides a debtor with that coveted fresh start, and it is one of the primary policy objectives underlying the Code.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grogan v. Garner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223600\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/279/#p286\">\n    498 U.S. 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 286,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6121506\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/111/654/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223600\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/279/#p286\">\n    112 L.Ed.2d 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991). As such, courts generally interpret the exceptions to discharge set forth in section 523 of the Code narrowly, and the objecting creditor bears the burden of proof.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hoak v.

That section provides, in relevant part, that \"[a] discharge under section 727, 1141, 1228(a), 1228(b), or 1328(b) of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt ... for fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity, embezzlement, or larceny ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4). The Plaintiff argues that the alleged conduct of the Defendant in connection with the Inheritance Funds, which underlies the State Court Judgment, qualifies as fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity under section 523(a)(4). The Court must consider the standards for assessing conduct under section 523 of the Code and the effect, if any, of the State Court Judgment on that assessment to resolve the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standard for Reviewing Debts Under Section 523(a)(4)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Courts evaluating claims under section 523(a)(4) of the Code generally require proof of a traditional fiduciary relationship and evidence of fraud or defalcation by the debtor while acting a fiduciary capacity. Notably, section 523(a)(4) is satisfied with evidence of either fraud or defalcation. For purposes of section 523(a)(4), fraud means \"positive fraud, or fraud in\n   fact, involving moral turpitude or intentional wrong.\"\n   <em>\n    Neal v.

They do not agree, however, concerning the preclusive effect, if any, of the State Court Judgment. This dispute concerns not only whether the State Court Judgment rests upon evidentiary findings sufficient to meet the Plaintiff's burden under section 523(a)(4), but also whether, in the first instance, a default judgment can bind the Defendant in this proceeding.

The Court understands and appreciates this distinction but finds it difficult to reconcile with the notion that a default judgment is an admission of liability under Maryland law. Moreover, in the absence of a defect in notice or other due process concerns, a defendant's choice to not participate in litigation from the start versus its decision to stop participating after the filing of an answer or a notice of appearance by counsel merits little distinction. In both instances, the defendant knows of the litigation and allows the plaintiff and the legal process to proceed in her absence. A defendant should not be able to use the bankruptcy process to eviscerate the deliberative findings of the state court in either scenario-again, assuming proper service and an opportunity to be heard in the state court litigation.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     M &amp; M Transmissions, Inc. v.

When applied to bankruptcy proceedings, the Supreme Court has admonished that res judicata effect will not be afforded dischargeability issues which could have been, but were not, litigated in an earlier proceeding.... Applying those principles here, I believe that the issues were actually and necessarily litigated and that, under the holding of\n    <em>\n     Combs,\n    </em>\n    Raynor should not now be given another opportunity to litigate them.\") (internal citations omitted).
