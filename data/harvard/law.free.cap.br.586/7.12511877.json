[Case No. 16-33704, Doc. # 1]. The Debtor listed her potential claims against Defendant in Schedule B, in response to the question at No. 33: \"Claims against third parties, whether or not you have filed a lawsuit or made a demand for payment\". [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. # 1, p. 14]. Debtor's response listed: \"Claim: Nationwide Insurance For Fraud/ unliquidated\", with the amount listed as \"unknown\". [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   An Order of Discharge was entered on March 23, 2017. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. # 32]. Because Plaintiff-Trustee anticipated that the value of the estate would exceed her estimate of the cost of administration and the payment of all timely filed claims, with interest, Plaintiff-Trustee filed a Motion for Order Regarding Surplus Funds on June 23, 2017. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. # 37]. The court granted the Motion the same day. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. # 38]. Even after the extended bar date for the filing of claims against surplus funds, it appears all creditors who filed claims will be paid in full. Per Plaintiff-Trustee's Interim Report filed on October 4, 2017, Debtor's estate only needed $13,000.00 to fully pay all bankruptcy costs and filed claims. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. # 40, pp. 1-2]. The required funds are likely to come from an inheritance from Debtor's mother, in the estimated amount of $30,000, that she became entitled to acquire within 180 days of the filing of her Chapter 7 case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5)(A).

Ohio 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The court finds that a number of the aforementioned factors weigh heavily in favor of permissive abstention, particularly factors (1), (2), (5), (6), and (11).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In terms of the first and sixth factors, dealing with efficient administration and the degree of \"relatedness\" to the bankruptcy proceeding, Debtor's bankruptcy case is nearing its end, or as Plaintiff-Trustee puts it, \"is in its 12th hour.\" [Doc. # 14, p. 5]. It appears likely that Debtor's estate will be fully funded soon, allowing the Plaintiff-Trustee to pay both administrative expenses and all creditor's claims without regard to the outcome of the removed state court action. [Doc. # 14, p. 5; Case No. 16-33704, Doc. # 40, pp. 1-2]. Thus, the court's decision to abstain will have very little, if any, impact \"on the efficient administration of the estate\" and the removed state court action is only remotely related to a main bankruptcy case that will probably be administratively closed before the lawsuit against the Defendant is concluded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11185838\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/253/211/#p214\">\n    253 B.R. at 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Under the second factor of the \u00a7 1334(c)(1) balancing test, the parties do not dispute that the allegations contained in Plaintiff-Trustee's Complaint are based solely on Ohio law. [Doc. # 2, p. 30]. Accordingly, state law issues not only predominate over bankruptcy issues in this case, Ohio law is the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   basis for Plaintiff's requested relief. Moreover, the removed state court action's relationship with bankruptcy law is limited to the fact that Debtor's cause of action against Defendant is property of the bankruptcy estate while Debtor's bankruptcy case is pending. Given the evidence presented that Debtor's bankruptcy case is nearing its conclusion [Doc. # 14, p. 5], the removed state court action's relationship to bankruptcy law may soon be non-existent. Consequently, this factor weighs heavily in favor of permissive abstention because \"state issues substantially predominate.\"\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11185838\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/253/211/#p214\">\n    253 B.R. at 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The fifth factor also supports permissive abstention. Both parties agree that the only basis for bankruptcy court jurisdiction\n   is \"related to\" jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The claims here are non-core, state law claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636621\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/50/\">\n    458 U.S. 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636621,6553077\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/102/2858/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636621\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/50/\">\n    73 L.Ed.2d 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982) (plurality opinion). There appears to be no other basis for jurisdiction in the federal courts, as the Complaint does not assert any claims under federal law, and Defendant does not dispute that there is no diversity of citizenship, as Nationwide is a corporation with its principal place of business in Ohio. [Doc. # 6, p. 1, \u00b6 3]. Further, although Defendant offered to waive the statement during oral argument, the Notice of Removal states that: \"Nationwide does not consent to the entry of final orders or judgments by the bankruptcy court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Doc. # 1, p.3, \u00b6 12].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Thus, this court's jurisdictional connection with Plaintiff-Trustee's removed state court action is tenuous at best, and that fact weighs in favor of abstention. In fact, as noted by the court at the February 14 hearing, if this action were allowed to go forward in the bankruptcy court, there is a strong possibility that Debtor's bankruptcy case would come to an end before the removed state court action could be concluded. If that were to happen, this court's \"related to\" jurisdiction under \u00a7 1334(b) would be extinguished, and the case would have to go back to state court where it would be governed by Ohio's procedural and evidentiary rules. This forced transition from federal procedural and discovery rules, as well as pivoting from preparation for dispositive motions or trial under the Federal Rules of Evidence, is an additional reason for finding permissive abstention to be appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The eleventh factor-the existence of a right to a jury trial-also supports permissive abstention. The Plaintiff-Trustee's Complaint includes a jury trial demand. [Doc. # 2, p. 20]. While bankruptcy courts can, with the written consent of the parties, conduct jury trials under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9015(b), Local Bankruptcy Rule 9015-1(b) suggests that the joint or separate consents should be filed \"no later than the time the initial pretrial is held\". Here, the initial pretrial was scheduled with the hearing on the Plaintiff-Trustee's Motion for Remand and Abstention. While Local Bankruptcy Rule 9015-1(b) does provide that the time for filing the statements of consent can be \"as otherwise ordered by the Court\", at present neither party has consented to this court conducting a jury trial on this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In deciding a somewhat similar issue, in the context of granting relief from stay and allowing the liquidation of a claim in state court, this court noted that where the issues in pending litigation involve only state law, it has been held that the expertise of the bankruptcy court is unnecessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Rombkowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201103527\">\n    2017 WL 1103527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *3, 2017 Bankr.

While bankruptcy courts regularly deal with issues of state law, conducting a jury trial on state law issues appears to be in the wheelhouse of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, and somewhat outside the wheelhouse of this bankruptcy court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, the general principle that \"unless the balance is strongly in favor of the defendant, the plaintiff's choice of forum should rarely be disturbed\" is an additional factor favoring permissive abstention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"354212\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/330/501/#p508\">\n    330 U.S. 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 508,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"354212\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/330/501/#p508\">\n    67 S.Ct. 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 843,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"354212\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/330/501/#p508\">\n    91 L.Ed. 1055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1947). In the context of a venue analysis, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has stated that while \"a plaintiff's choice of forum should be given weight when deciding whether to grant a motion to change venue, this factor is not dispositive.\"\n   <em>\n    Lewis v. ACB Business Services, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11867782\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/135/389/#p413\">\n    135 F.3d 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 413 (6th Cir. 1998). In contrast, where the issue was dismissal of a case based upon\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit reversed dismissal of a complaint based upon the district court failing to \"apply the deference required for a forum choice made by a U.S. plaintiff...\".\n   <em>\n    Duha v.

While the exact parameters of the deference to be given Plaintiff-Trustee's choice of forum are not clear, what is clear is that Plaintiff-Trustee's decision to file in the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is a factor favoring permissive abstention and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For all of these reasons, the court thus finds that the interests of judicial economy weigh against this court hearing the removed state court action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Courts that have declined to abstain from hearing a matter under \u00a7 1334(c)(1) have focused on the extent to which core matters are present and intermingled with non-core matters,\n   <em>\n    Bavelis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180158\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/453/832/#p881\">\n    453 B.R. at 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a removed action's mixture of core and non-core matters does not weigh in favor of permissive abstention), whether permissive abstention would send the removed action to an entirely new court,\n   <em>\n    Meritage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4142953\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/474/526/#p573\">\n    474 B.R. at 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding permissive abstention inappropriate where it would involve an entirely new court unfamiliar with the removed proceedings), and the involvement of multiple parties and possibility of duplicative, overlapping discovery.\n   <em>\n    Natl.

The court finds that none of those concerns are present here. The removed action concerns purely non-core, state law claims, the litigation was originally commenced in the same state court where the removed action will be returned, and the action is a single case implicating only Plaintiff-Trustee, Debtor, and Defendant. Additionally, discovery is only in its earliest stages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In sum, the court finds permissive abstention appropriate here because the removed state court action is only tenuously related to Debtor's Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, a case that is in its final stages. Further, the removed state court action is a non-core proceeding under \u00a7 157 that deals exclusively in Ohio law and Plaintiff-Trustee has demanded a jury trial. Accordingly, the court will abstain from hearing the removed state court action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Equitable Remand\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The court also finds that equitable remand is appropriate with regard to the removed state court action. Section 1452(b) provides that \"[t]he court to which [a \u00a7 1452(a) ] claim or cause of action is removed may remand such claim or cause of action on any equitable ground.\" Equitable remand under \u00a7 1452(b), much like permissive abstention, requires that courts utilize a flexible, factor-based balancing test, the application of which \"will vary with the particular circumstances of each case....\"\n   <em>\n    Natl.

First, the non-core nature of the removed state court action, Plaintiff-Trustee's demand for a jury trial, and the lack of consent by the parties regarding this court's entry of final orders and ability to conduct a jury trial would lead to the uneconomical use of judicial resources. Second, the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, a state court of general jurisdiction, is well-suited to resolving the removed state court action given its familiarity with and routine application of state law. Third, the removed state court action is only distantly related to Debtor's bankruptcy case and bankruptcy law. Further, the court finds that the interests of comity support resolution of these issues by a state court in light of the removed action's dependence on state law. Accordingly, the court finds equitable remand of the removed state court action to be warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In conclusion, the court finds it appropriate to abstain from further exercising federal jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Trustee's proceeding against Defendant under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1).

Thus, there is no need to determine if claims denominated as \"core\" are \"really\" core, nor is there any need to sever the non-existent core claims from the state law claims.
