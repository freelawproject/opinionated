Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The relevant facts are undisputed. Wallace worked for SMB when the two entered into the SERP in December 2008. Pursuant to the SERP, Wallace deferred until retirement some of the compensation he earned while working for SMB. The SERP required Wallace to work for SMB for a specified number of years and reach one of several specified retirement ages to receive deferred compensation payments. Wallace retired from SMB prior to filing bankruptcy, and SMB began making the SERP payments to Wallace. According to the Shieldses' Schedule I and Wallace's testimony, Wallace receives $2,285.06 each\n   month under the SERP. SMB is obligated to make the SERP payments to Wallace until August 2027. In their amended Schedule C, the Shieldses claim that the SERP payments are entirely exempt under (10)(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   SMB made three loans to Wallace and Deborah before they filed bankruptcy. One loan is secured by the Shieldses' home and is not at issue in this matter. SMB filed a proof of secured claim for each of the other two loans and a motion for relief from stay seeking permission to exercise its right of setoff against the SERP payments it owes Wallace. The Shieldses objected to those claims arguing the SERP payments are exempt under (10)(e). SMB objected to the Shieldses' claimed exemption arguing that the SERP payments are not exempt under (10)(e). In its trial brief, SMB contends that it has the right to offset the SERP payments it owes Wallace against the two loans that are not secured by the home until those two loans are satisfied. The aggregate amount SMB owes Wallace in SERP payments exceeds the amount Wallace and Deborah owe SMB on those two loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties submitted briefs and exhibits on whether the SERP payments are exempt under (10)(e) and whether SMB has a valid and enforceable right of setoff. On October 26, 2017, the court heard the parties' oral arguments, and Wallace testified. After taking this matter under advisement, the court is ready to rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

The court is aware that two other bankruptcy courts have addressed whether a SERP or other 409A plan is exempt in Illinois and Virginia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Jokiel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180553\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/453/743/\">\n    453 B.R. 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

E.D. Va. May 7, 2015) (concluding that 409A plan did not qualify for exemption under Virginia law). The requirements under the Illinois and Virginia exemption statutes, however, differ from (10)(e)'s requirements; so, those cases are not helpful here. Although there are no cases applying (10)(e) to a SERP and there is a dearth of case law guidance on SERP exemptions in general, the court finds guidance from cases interpreting \u00a7 522(d)(10)(E) because \"[t]he Missouri exemption provision [found in (10)(e) ] is virtually identical to that found in [ \u00a7 522(d)(10)(E) ].\"\n   <em>\n    Checkett v.

The court will now determine whether the SERP payments are exempt under (10)(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Missouri's (10)(e) exempts payments from certain deferred compensation programs to the extent the payments are reasonably necessary for the support of a debtor and his or her dependents. Determining whether the SERP is exempt under (10)(e) requires two analytical steps. First, the SERP does not qualify for exemption under (10)(e) if:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (1) The plan or contract was established \"by or under the auspices of an insider that employed [the debtor] at the time [the debtor's] rights arose\" under the plan;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (2) The payment is made \"on account of age or length of service\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (3) The plan or contract does not qualify under Internal Revenue Code \u00a7\u00a7 401(a), 403(a), 403(b), 408, 408A or 409.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20513.430.1\">\n    Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 513.430.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10)(e). If the SERP meets all three of these disqualifying criteria, then the Shieldses may not exempt any portion of the SERP payments.\n   <em>\n    In re Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6114069\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/33/549/#p551\">\n    33 B.R. 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 551-52 (Bankr.

The parties agreed at the hearing that SMB was not Wallace's insider when his rights arose under the SERP. Because it does not meet the first disqualifying criterion, the SERP is not disqualified from exemption under (10)(e), and the court may proceed to the second step of the (10)(e) analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   If a deferred compensation plan is not disqualified from the (10)(e) exemption, a debtor may exempt payments under that plan:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (1) if the right to receive payment is from \"a stock bonus, pension plan, disability or death benefit plan, profit-sharing plan ... or annuity, or similar plan or contract\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (2) if the right to receive payment is \"on account of illness, disability, death, age, or length of service\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (3) \"to the extent\" the payments are \"reasonably necessary [for the]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   support\" of the debtor and his or her dependents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Rousey v.

Because the SERP is not any of those plans, the court must determine whether the SERP is a sufficiently similar plan or contract. Generally, a plan is a similar plan or contract if the plan's payments function as a substitute for wages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 330-31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870372,9017535\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/125/1561/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Other courts have interpreted this requirement broadly and commented that non-qualified deferred compensation plans are exempt.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Threewitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6551701\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/24/927/#p930\">\n    24 B.R. 927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 930 (D. Kan. 1982) (addressing \u00a7 522(d)(10)(E) and stating that it \"exempts the right to receive payments necessary for support from a wide range of sources,\n   <em>\n    tax-qualified or not\n   </em>\n   , including, for example, Christmas stock bonuses paid upon 25 years of service, or profit-sharing restricted to senior employees, or an annuity purchased to provide income to a worker disabled in an industrial accident.\" (emphasis original) ). The SERP payments to Wallace represent compensation that Wallace deferred into retirement and clearly function as a substitute for wages during Wallace's retirement years. The court, therefore, concludes that the SERP is a deferred compensation plan similar to the plans and contracts enumerated in (10)(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    B. \"On account of Illness, Disability, Death, Age, or Length of Service\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The second element, \"on account of illness, disability, death, age, or length of service,\" means the employee/debtor receives payments from the deferred compensation plan \"because of [an employee/debtor's] illness, disability, death, age, or length of service.\"\n   <em>\n    Rousey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870372\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/320/#p325\">\n    544 U.S. at 326-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870372,9017535\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/125/1561/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The SERP required Wallace to work for SMB for a specified number of years and reach one of the several specified retirement ages before becoming eligible to receive the SERP payments. Wallace presumably met those age and service requirements because SMB began making SERP payments to Wallace prepetition. SMB does not suggest otherwise and even agreed at the hearing that Wallace receives the SERP payments on account of age or length of service. The SERP satisfies the second requirement because it entitles Wallace to receive payments because of both his age and length of service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Reasonably Necessary\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Under the final requirement, a debtor may exempt payments under (10)(e) only to the extent those payments are reasonably necessary for support. For the reasons set forth below, the court concludes that $1,285.06 of each SERP payment is reasonably necessary for the Shieldses' support and, therefore, exempt, but the remaining $1,000 of each SERP payment is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Neither the Missouri exemptions statutes nor the Bankruptcy Code sets standards for determining whether payments are reasonably necessary for (10)(e) purposes. As a result, courts must determine whether those payments are reasonably necessary on a case-by-case basis, examining all circumstances surrounding a debtor's present and future needs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Boykin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6111812\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/118/716/#p718\">\n    118 B.R. 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 718 (Bankr.

Courts routinely distinguish between young, healthy, and highly trained debtors, on the one hand, and elderly, sick, or retired debtors on the other.

Wallace is 71-years-old. Though neither party presented evidence concerning Deborah's age, she has worked as a substitute teacher for 34 years, and so the court concludes her age also limits her earning capacity. Though Wallace once worked as a part-time Avis shuttle driver and Deborah currently works as a substitute teacher, Wallace has ceased work entirely and Deborah is retiring in May 2018. As a result, when both Wallace and Deborah fully retire by May 2018, they will rely entirely on their combined Social Security income and Wallace's SERP payments to pay their expenses. Similarly, while Wallace and Deborah once enjoyed skills sufficient to support themselves as a bank employee\n   and schoolteacher, the court does not presume those skills serve them indefinitely. The court discounts any job skills, education, and training Wallace and Deborah might have because they can no longer apply such skills, education, and training to build or supplement existing retirement funds. The Shieldses no longer have time to save for retirement, and their ability to build or maintain their retirement funds with part-time work has diminished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   These factors reveal that the Shieldses are at the point in their lives when they must rely upon the SERP payments, together with their Social Security income, for their support. The Shieldses, therefore, may exempt at least a portion of the SERP payments as reasonably necessary to support their basic needs. The amount of the exemption, however, turns on the final\n   <em>\n    Flygstad\n   </em>\n   factors: the Shieldses' assets and present and anticipated income and expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Factors Weighing Against Finding the SERP Payments Reasonably Necessary\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The court considers the remaining relevant\n   <em>\n    Flygstad\n   </em>\n   factors-(1) present and anticipated living expenses, (2) present and anticipated income from all sources, (7) other assets, including exempt assets, and (8) asset liquidity-to determine how much supplemental income the Shieldses need to meet their basic needs.

D. Conn. 1981).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Here, the Shieldses' assets, income, and expenses weigh in favor of finding less than the full amount of each SERP payment exempt. The Shieldses possess substantial assets, many of which they purchased on credit within a short time before filing bankruptcy. For example, according to their schedules and information in proofs of claims filed by several creditors, on the filing date, the Shieldses owned several vehicles, including three motor vehicles with a combined value of more than $43,000 (a 2015 Ford Taurus, a 2015 Ford Fiesta, and a 2016 Ford F-150 pickup, all purchased new less than two years before they filed this Chapter 13 case), one 2014 Georgetown Motor Home purchased new in late 2013 for more than $132,000, two 2017 trailers valued at a combined $3,000, and two 2016 Polaris ATVs valued at $4,000 each. Their Chapter 13 Plan indicates they intend to surrender the motor home and the Polaris ATVs, but they propose to retain both trailers and all three motor vehicles. The Shieldses also own a home worth $138,000. Though their claimed exemption is somewhat supported by\n   <em>\n    Flygstad\n   </em>\n   factor eight, the illiquid and encumbered nature of the assets (the vehicles appear to be fully encumbered by Ford Motor Company liens), these substantial assets undermine the Shieldses' claim that they reasonably need all of the SERP payments for support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Similarly, though the Shieldses' present and anticipated living expenses exceed their present and anticipated income, not all of those expenses are reasonably necessary\n   for their support. As to their income, the Shieldses currently receive $3,172.90 in Social Security income each month. At the time of filing their bankruptcy petition, they each worked part-time. However, Wallace testified each of them will fully retire by May 2018. At that time, they will rely entirely on their combined Social Security income of $3,172.90 per month and the SERP payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Shieldses spend their income on approximately $5,700 in monthly expenses, including three car payments totaling more than $1,060 each month. Those current monthly expenses exceed their combined monthly Social Security income ($3,172.70) plus a SERP payment ($2,285) by approximately $250. Because the Shieldses' monthly expenses exceed their monthly income, the court must determine whether those expenses are reasonably necessary for their support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Many of the Shieldses' expenses are reasonable and necessary for their support. For example, they spend reasonable amounts on their home mortgage payment, home ownership expenses, and utility expenses. However, some of their other expenses are excessive. In particular, the Shieldses could reduce the following monthly expenses: $750 for food and housekeeping supplies, $500 for transportation (fuel and vehicle maintenance), $600 for charitable contributions and religious donations, and $1,060 for three motor vehicle installment payments.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Schlee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6111422\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/60/524/#p529\">\n    60 B.R. 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 529 (Bankr.

C.D. Cal. 1992) (reducing transportation costs). It is unclear to the court under what circumstances a retired couple in Chapter 13 needs to own and maintain three relatively new vehicles for their support. Under their current circumstances, it is unreasonable for the Shieldses to include the monthly loan payments on all three of those vehicles in calculating the extent to which the SERP payments are reasonably necessary. They can and should further reduce their expenses by surrendering or selling one or more of their vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Though the court does not purport to specify by what amount the Shieldses must reduce each unnecessary or excessive monthly expense, it encourages them to reduce those expenses from the amounts listed to levels that are truly necessary to support their basic needs. Because the Shieldses may, and should, reduce their expenses, the court concludes that only $1,285.06 of each SERP payment is reasonably necessary for the Shieldses' support. This amount, when combined with their Social Security income, should adequately serve their basic needs. The remaining $1,000 is not exempt under (10)(e). Having determined that the Shieldses may exempt $1,285.06 of each SERP payment, the court next considers whether SMB has a valid right of setoff that it may exercise against any portion of each SERP payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

Here, SMB has not cited any statute granting it the right of setoff. Rather, SMB argues it has a common law right to offset the SERP payments against the two loans. SMB also argued that it has a contractual right of setoff with respect to the loan evidenced by Claim 4-2. But SMB's contractual right of setoff only becomes enforceable after default and notice, and SMB's counsel confirmed at the hearing that the Shieldses were not in default on that loan prior to the petition date and that SMB did not send any notice of default to the Shieldses.

SMB's Right of Setoff Yields to the Shieldses' Exemption in the SERP Payments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Courts seem to disagree about whether a debtor's property exemption claim yields to a creditor's valid right of setoff. Some courts prioritize the debtor's \"fresh start\" and conclude that the exemption prevails over a competing setoff right, while other courts conclude that a creditor's right of setoff prevails because the text of \u00a7 553 does not refer to \u00a7 522(c) or a right to claim exemptions as an exception to the preservation of a creditor's right to setoff.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S., I.R.S. v. White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2952926\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/365/457/\">\n    365 B.R. 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (M.D. Pa. 2007) (summarizing case law adopting each approach and concluding the latter approach is correct).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Whether a debtor's exemption yields to a creditor's right of setoff arises in a variety of factual contexts. Recently, a large majority of the cases addressing this issue have arisen in the context of a debtor who wishes to exempt a federal tax refund but who happens to owe a debt to a governmental entity that seeks to offset that debt\n   against the tax refund. Those cases typically favor the right of setoff over the claim of exemption. Understandably, SMB cites three tax refund cases-\n   <em>\n    In re Baucom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2703103\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/339/504/#p506\">\n    339 B.R. 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 506-07 (Bankr.

E.D. Tenn. 2001) -because those cases seem to support SMB's position that its right of setoff is superior to any exemption in the SERP payments. But under the facts and circumstances of this case, the court disagrees with that outcome and the rationale of automatically elevating a creditor's right of setoff over a debtor's right to an exemption in all cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The tax refund cases are distinguishable here because in those cases the federal government enjoyed statutory authority, under the Internal Revenue Code, to reduce government claims from any tax overpayments before the taxpayer was entitled to a refund. As this court noted several years ago, \"the IRS's nonbankruptcy right to setoff stems from\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206402\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   which provides that the IRS may credit overpayments to other liabilities that the taxpayer may owe and\n   <em>\n    that only after those credits have been applied\n   </em>\n   do the taxpayers receive a 'refund.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re Pace\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11145193\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/257/918/\">\n    257 B.R. 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 919 n.1 (Bankr. W.D. Mo. 2000) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). In other words, a debtor's tax refund claim-and thus the debtor's exemption-is net of any credits authorized under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206402\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). The statutory language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206402\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which creates the right of setoff in those cases, is clear. Just as clear is \u00a7 553 and its preservation of a creditor's right of setoff that arises under non-bankruptcy law. So, it is easy to understand why the government's setoff rights usually prevail over a debtor's claim of exemption in a tax refund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Unlike the tax refund cases, SMB does not have a statutory right of setoff that is superior to the (10)(e) exemption. Instead, SMB has a common law right of setoff under Missouri law. The Bankruptcy Code neither enhances nor diminishes that right, except to impose the automatic stay under \u00a7 362(a)(7) to delay its exercise. This court already recognized in the non-tax refund context that even if a creditor has a valid \"right of setoff against nonexempt property of the debtors, it has no right to set off its debt against exempt assets\" under Missouri law.\n   <em>\n    In re Arnold\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6459257\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/193/897/#p899\">\n    193 B.R. 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 899 (Bankr.
