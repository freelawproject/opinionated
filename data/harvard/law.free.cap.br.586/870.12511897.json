Tucker, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Section 362(b)(10) of the Bankruptcy Code says that the automatic stay of\n   \u00a7 362(a) does not apply to any act by a lessor to obtain possession of property it leased to the bankruptcy debtor under a nonresidential lease of real property,\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   the lease \"has terminated by the expiration of the stated term of the lease,\" either before the bankruptcy case was commenced, or during the case. And Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 541(b)(2) says that in that situation, any interest of the debtor under the lease is not property of the bankruptcy estate. This Chapter 11 case requires the Court to decide what it means to say that a lease of nonresidential real property has terminated by \"the expiration of the stated term of the lease.\" Specifically, does this statutory phrase include a lease that has been terminated\n   <em>\n    early\n   </em>\n   , by the lessor's exercise of a right given in the lease to terminate the lease early, due to the debtor-lessee's default? The Court concludes that it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case came before the Court for a hearing on May 17, 2018, on the motion filed by the Indianapolis Airport Authority (the \"IAA\"), entitled \"Indianapolis Airport Authority's Motion for Relief From the Automatic Stay and for Other Relief\" (Docket # 15, the \"Motion\"). The Debtor, Indiana Hotel Equities, LLC, filed an objection to the Motion, and then a concurrence in that objection was filed by a creditor, Indiana Hotel Ventures, LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the May 17, 2018 hearing, the Court entered an Order permitting briefing by the parties on a specific issue, having to do with Indiana law on collateral estoppel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Order also scheduled a final hearing for June 13, 2018 (later adjourned to June 20, 2018), at which time the Order stated that the Court intends to issue an oral opinion on the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court has considered the post-hearing briefs filed by the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the Court has considered all of the oral and written arguments of the parties regarding the Motion, and the exhibits and other items filed in support of and in opposition to the Motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court has decided to issue a written decision on the Motion, rather than give an oral opinion. This Opinion and the order to follow will constitute the Court's decision on the Motion, and the June 20, 2018 hearing will be cancelled, as no longer necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For the following reasons, the Court will deny the Motion, without prejudice to the extent described below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

This contested matter is a core proceeding, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A) and 157(b)(2)(O).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In addition, this contested matter falls within the definition of a proceeding \"arising under title 11\" and of a proceeding \"arising in\" a case under title 11, within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Matters falling within either of these categories in \u00a7 1334(b) are deemed to be core proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allard v.

And this is a proceeding \"arising in\" a case under title 11, because it is a proceeding that \"by [its] very nature, could arise only\n   in bankruptcy cases.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allard v.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Based on facts presented by the parties that are undisputed, the Court finds and concludes as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Debtor operates a hotel, located at 2500 South High School Road in Indianapolis, Indiana, near the Indianapolis airport. But the Debtor does not own the land or building where the hotel is located. That real property (the \"Property\") is owned by the IAA. The Debtor leased this Property from the IAA, beginning in January 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The lease was first made in September 1960, between predecessors-in-interest of the IAA and the Debtor. Beginning in January 2016, the IAA as lessor, and the Debtor as lessee, were the parties to the lease, by virtue of an agreement called the \"Lease Amendment,\" dated January 6, 2016. (A copy of this lease amendment, the \"Lease Amendment,\" is included within Exhibit 6-A to the IAA's Motion. A copy of the entire Lease, including the Lease Amendment (the \"Lease\"), appears at Exhibit 6-A to the IAA's Motion).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Under the Lease Amendment, the stated term of the Lease was \"for a term of seventy-two (72) years, commencing July 1, 1962, and ending on June 30, 2034.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Lease is a lease of \"nonresidential real property\" within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(10) and 541(b)(2), quoted below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   By virtue of the Lease Amendment, the Lease contained certain requirements that the Debtor had to meet in order to avoid a default, and the Lease provided certain remedies to the IAA in the event of a default by the Debtor, including cancellation of the Lease. In a letter to the Debtor dated May 11, 2017 (the \"May 11, 2017 Termination Letter\"), the IAA stated that the Debtor had defaulted under the Lease, and purported, under \"Section 15 of the Lease,\" to cancel the Lease \"in its entirety effective at 12:00 midnight on July 11, 2017.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This led to litigation between the parties. The Debtor filed suit against the IAA on July 12, 2017, in the Marion County, Indiana Superior Court, in the case titled\n   <em>\n    Indiana Hotel Equities, LLC v. Indianapolis Airport Authority\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 49D01-1701-PL-027076 (the \"Indiana Lawsuit\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties eventually filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On March 28, 2018, the court in the Indiana Lawsuit denied the Debtor's motion and granted the IAA's motion, thereby entering summary judgment for the IAA. The Indiana court did this by means of a 27-page written opinion and order, filed on March 28, 2018 (the \"State Court Decision\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Among other things, the State Court Decision ruled, in part expressly and in part by clear, necessary implication, that: (1) the Debtor defaulted under the Lease and Lease Amendment in certain specified ways; (2) the IAA had a right to terminate the Lease because of the Debtor's default; (3) the IAA did validly terminate the Lease, by means of the May 11, 2017 Termination Letter, effective (as that letter stated) at 12:00 midnight on July 11, 2017; (4) because of such termination of\n   the Lease, the Debtor had no right to possession of the Property; and (5) the IAA's receipt and retention of monthly rent checks from the Debtor after the July 2017 Lease termination was neither a waiver of the IAA's right to terminate the Lease nor a waiver of the IAA's actual termination of the Lease. In addition to granting summary judgment for the IAA, the Indiana court ordered that the Debtor and the Debtor's hotel manager, Indiana Hotel Ventures, LLC, \"shall vacate and turn over possession of the Hotel to the IAA by April 14, 2018.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Debtor filed this Chapter 11 bankruptcy case on April 10, 2018, and remains in possession of the Property. Shortly before filing this bankruptcy case, the Debtor also filed, in the Indiana Lawsuit, a notice of appeal (filed April 6, 2018) and a motion for a stay pending appeal (filed April 10, 2018). The Indiana court has not yet ruled on the Debtor's motion for a stay pending appeal, presumably because of the Debtor's bankruptcy filing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The IAA's Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Although the IAA's Motion is labeled, in part, as a \"Motion for Relief from the Automatic Stay,\" the Motion actually does not seek relief from the automatic stay. Rather, the Motion only seeks an order confirming\n   <em>\n    that the automatic stay does not apply\n   </em>\n   , with respect to actions the IAA wishes to take to obtain possession of the Property, based on Bankruptcy Code \u00a7\u00a7 362(b)(10) and 541(b)(2). The Motion states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The Indianapolis Airport Authority (the \"IAA\") ... hereby moves for an order, pursuant to section 362(d) of title 11 of the United States Code (\"Bankruptcy Code\") and Rules 4001(a) and 4001(d) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure (\"Bankruptcy Rules\"): (i) confirming that a certain lease (the \"Lease\") between the IAA and debtor Indiana Hotel Equities, LLC (the \"Debtor\"), which was terminated prepetition, is not property of the Debtor's bankruptcy estate pursuant to section 54l(b)(2); (ii) further confirming that the automatic stay does not apply pursuant to section 362(b)(l0) of the Bankruptcy Code so that the IAA is free to exercise its contractual and state law remedies with respect to the Lease and the subject property; and (iii) waiving the 14-day stay of any Order granting this Motion pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 4001(a)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The IAA's proposed order filed with the Motion is consistent with the foregoing Motion language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The parties' dispute about Bankruptcy Code \u00a7\u00a7 362(b)(10) and 541(b)(2)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Based on the language of Bankruptcy Code \u00a7\u00a7 362(b)(10) and 541(b)(2), the issue now before the Court is this: whether, before the April 10, 2018 bankruptcy petition was filed, the Lease was \"terminated\" \"at\" or \"by\" \"the expiration of the stated term of such lease.\" The Court will decide this issue in two parts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Lease was terminated pre-petition.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   First, the Court concludes that the Lease was indeed \"terminated\" before the April 10, 2018 petition date. The Court is bound to conclude this because of the March 28, 2018 State Court Decision, described above. That state court decision is a final judgment of the Marion County, Indiana Superior Court, and is conclusive\n   on the issues it decided, under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This Court previously has explained how collateral estoppel applies in bankruptcy cases, under the federal Full Faith and Credit Statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201738\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   :\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   In determining whether a state court judgment precludes relitigation of issues under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, the Full Faith and Credit Statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201738\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , requires bankruptcy courts to \" 'consider first the law of the State in which the judgment was rendered to determine its preclusive effect.' \"\n   <em>\n    Bay Area Factors v.

Rep. No. 98-65, at 68 (1983).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court agrees with the Debtor's statutory interpretation. In this case, the date of \"the expiration of the stated term of the lease\" was and is June 30, 2034, and obviously that date has not passed yet. So the expiration of the stated term of the lease did not happen before the filing of this bankruptcy case, and has not happened yet. For this reason, neither \u00a7 362(b)(10) nor \u00a7 541(b)(2) applies, and the IAA's Motion must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   This conclusion is consistent with the language of the Lease in this case. Section 2 of the Lease, as amended by the Lease Amendment, explicitly and unambiguously defines the \"Term\" of the Lease as \"a term of seventy-two (72) years, commencing July 1, 1962, and ending on June 30, 2034.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no language in the\n   Lease's definition of the Lease's \"Term,\" or anywhere else in the Lease, that limits that stated term of the Lease by the IAA's right, set forth in Section 15 of the Lease, to \"cancel\" the Lease \"in its entirety\" by written notice, upon the Debtor's default.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, Section 15 of the Lease sets forth grounds upon which the IAA could end the Lease early, before the expiration of its stated term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court is not persuaded by the IAA's statutory interpretation argument, and the Court respectfully disagrees with the cases that support the IAA's position. The IAA does not actually articulate\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   the Court should agree with its statutory interpretation. And neither do any of the cases cited by the IAA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court concludes that under the only reasonable reading of the statutory language at issue, the lease termination in this case was a termination\n   <em>\n    other than\n   </em>\n   at or by \"the expiration of the stated term of the lease.\" It clearly was a termination of the Lease earlier than at the end of the Lease's stated term, due to Debtor's default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The IAA's interpretation of the statutory language is not reasonable. The IAA's interpretation would make the statutory wording at issue superfluous. In effect, it would read the following bolded wording out of \u00a7 362(b)(10) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   a lease of nonresidential real property that has terminated\n   <strong>\n    by the expiration of the stated term of the lease\n   </strong>\n   before the commencement of or during a case under this title ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   (Emphasis added). So the IAA's interpretation would, in effect, read the statute as if it said this:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   a lease of nonresidential real property that has terminated before the commencement of or during a case under this title ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The same is true of the IAA's reading of the same language in \u00a7 541(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Congress knew how to write a statute that applies broadly to all lease terminations, including early lease terminations. It did so in Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 365(c)(3), which states that a lease may not be assumed or assigned if \"such lease is of nonresidential real property and has been terminated under applicable nonbankruptcy law prior to the order for relief.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20365\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3). This provision was enacted as part of the 1984 amendments to the Bankruptcy Code, at the same time current \u00a7\u00a7 362(b)(10) and 541(b)(2) were enacted. The limiting words in the latter sections, at or by \"the expiration of the stated term of the lease,\" narrow the type of lease termination that is covered, to something narrower than terminations covered by \u00a7 365(c)(3), and must be given\n   some meaning. The IAA's interpretation does not do that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Reading these statutes the IAA's way would be contrary to often-repeated instructions of the United States Supreme Court, which was repeated by the Supreme Court in a bankruptcy case decided earlier this month.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lamar, Archer &amp; Cofrin, LLP v.

The IAA's present Motion must be denied. And if the IAA wishes to seek relief from the automatic stay, it must file a new motion seeking such relief.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   As indicated in Part III.B of this Opinion, the Court construes the IAA's present Motion as limited to only seeking an order confirming\n   <em>\n    that the automatic stay does not apply\n   </em>\n   , with respect to actions the IAA wishes to take to obtain possession of the Property, based on Bankruptcy Code \u00a7\u00a7 362(b)(10) and 541(b)(2). Because the Court rejects the IAA's interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 362(b)(10) and 541(b)(2), the IAA's Motion must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   It follows that the automatic stay\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   apply, and it prevents the IAA from taking any action to enforce the State Court Decision to dispossess the Debtor of the Property.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), 362(a)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counsel for the IAA conceded during the hearing that this is so, if, as the Court has now ruled, \u00a7 362(b)(10) does not apply. The Court does not construe the IAA's present Motion as seeking relief from the automatic stay, for example, based on any of the provisions of Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 362(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   To the extent the IAA attempted, in its reply brief, or during the hearing on the Motion, to broaden its Motion to include seeking relief from stay, or to argue that its Motion actually sought relief from stay in the first place, the Court rejects this attempt. The Motion itself, to which the Debtor filed its written response, clearly did not seek relief from the automatic stay. And the Court agrees with the Debtor that it would be unfair and inappropriate for the Court to allow the Motion to be transformed into one seeking relief from stay. That would deprive the Debtor of a full and fair opportunity to file a written response to such a request for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   There is an additional reason that counsels against the Court allowing the IAA's present Motion to slide into one seeking stay relief. The question of whether the Court should grant relief from the automatic stay, to permit the IAA to obtain possession of the Property at this time, is not a simple one. Rather, it is a difficult and complex question, potentially involving several disputed issues that the parties have not yet fully briefed. It is fair and appropriate for the Court to require the parties to flesh these issues out by briefing and arguing them in the context of a new motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The complexity of the stay relief question arises, in part, because the Debtor has an appeal pending in the Indiana courts that could result in a reversal of the State Court Decision that the lease terminated, such that the Lease would no longer be deemed terminated. If the Debtor were to lose possession of the Property now, that could quickly ruin the Debtor's hotel business and destroy any chance of a successful reorganization, so that any later success by the Debtor in its state court appeal would be a useless victory. But if the automatic stay remains in place, the IAA may have valid arguments that some form of adequate protection must be ordered, to protect its ownership interest in the Property while the Debtor's state court appeal proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   For all of these reasons, but especially because of the way the Motion is worded, the Court construes the present Motion as not seeking relief from the automatic stay. And it follows that the Court's denial of the present Motion will not preclude the IAA from filing a new motion that expressly seeks relief from the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
