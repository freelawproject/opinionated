McCracken to determine the dischargeability of certain debt owed to it by McCracken. Heritage alleges that McCracken's debts to it are nondischargeable pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B) and, alternatively,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). Heritage moved for summary judgment on its nondischargeability claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Heritage's motion for summary judgment is granted as to his \u00a7 523(a)(2)(B) claim. Heritage's motion is denied as to his \u00a7 727(a)(3) claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   McCracken applied for a loan from Heritage in May 2015. (ECF No. 23 at 2). As part of his loan application, McCracken submitted his 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 tax returns, as well as a financial statement dated May 5, 2014. (ECF No. 23 at 2). The May 5 financial statement listed McCracken's net worth as $734,000.00, which included $217,000.00 worth of cattle and bulls, and $626,000.00 in total liabilities, which included $160,000.00 in livestock liabilities. (ECF No. 23-2 at 1). Based upon the value of McCracken's cattle, a portion of which he pledged as collateral for the loan, McCracken executed and delivered a promissory note to Heritage in the amount of $100,000.00 on June 12, 2014. (ECF No. 23 at 2). McCracken executed and delivered to Heritage a security agreement securing his repayment of the June 2014 note, granting Heritage a security interest in all of McCracken's cattle, the proceeds of those cattle, and McCracken's entire inventory (including farm products, feed, and supplies). (ECF No. 23 at 2-3; ECF No. 23-4). Heritage perfected its security interest in the collateral through a UCC Financing Statement on June 17, 2014. (ECF No. 23 at 3; ECF No. 23-6). McCracken used the note proceeds to satisfy an existing loan with First State Bank. (ECF No. 23 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the satisfaction of McCracken's First State Bank loan, Heritage understood that it held a first lien on all of McCracken's cattle and that his total livestock debt remained at $160,000.00. (ECF No. 23 at 3; ECF No. 23-30 at 2). However, unbeknownst to Heritage prior to the June 2014 note, McCracken owed Prosperity Bank at least $151,323.16 as of May 2014. (ECF No. 23 at 4; ECF No. 23-23 at 4). This debt was secured by a lien on the cattle covered by Heritage's security agreement. (ECF No. 23 at 3; ECF No. 23-30 at 2.\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 28 at 2). Consequently, McCracken apparently understated his total livestock liabilities on his May 5, 2014 financial statement. (ECF No. 23 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 23, 2014, Heritage agreed to increase the amount of the June 2014 note by $10,000.00 in order for McCracken to purchase additional cattle. (ECF No. 23 at 5). McCracken executed and delivered a new note to Heritage in the principal amount of $110,000.00, an updated commercial security agreement covering McCracken's cattle and the proceeds from those cattle, and a business loan agreement. (ECF No. 23 at 5; ECF No. 23-11; ECF No. 23-12; ECF No. 23-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 31, 2014, Heritage agreed to again increase McCracken's June 2014 note by $20,000.00 in order for McCracken to purchase additional cattle. (ECF No. 23 at 6). McCracken executed and delivered a new note to Heritage in the principal amount of $130,000.00, an updated commercial security agreement covering\n   McCracken's cattle and the proceeds from those cattle, and a business loan agreement. (ECF No. 23 at 6; ECF No. 23-14; ECF No. 23-15; ECF No. 23-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On or about February 15, 2015, McCracken submitted a financial statement to Heritage representing his net worth to be $884,600.00, the value of his cattle to be $272,000.00, and his total liabilities to be $515,000.00 (including a cattle loan of $160,000.00). (ECF No. 23 at 6; ECF No. 23-17). Heritage alleges that this financial statement was inaccurate because it failed to list a liability to Prosperity Bank of at least $178,123.61 secured by McCracken's cattle. (ECF No. 23 at 6-7; ECF No. 23-8 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In April 2016, Heritage learned of McCracken's debt to Prosperity Bank and the related lien on McCracken's cattle. (ECF No. 23 at 7; ECF No. 23-30 at 3). Heritage determined Prosperity Bank's lien on the cattle to be superior to its own lien. (ECF No. 23 at 7; ECF No. 23-30 at 3). Consequently, Heritage agreed to loan McCracken funds to satisfy his debt to Prosperity Bank in order to secure a first lien position for Heritage on all of McCracken's cattle. (ECF No. 23 at 7; ECF No. 23-30 at 3). Heritage consented to this transaction because the cattle's value, as listed within McCracken's financial statements, was sufficient to cover the debt owed to it by McCracken in addition to the amount required to satisfy Prosperity Bank's first lien. (ECF No. 23 at 7). Heritage asserts that it would not have extended any additional credit to McCracken but for this perceived value of the cattle. (ECF No. 23 at 9). McCracken completed this transaction by executing and delivering a revised note to Heritage in the principal amount of $250,000.00, an updated commercial security agreement covering McCracken's cattle and the proceeds from those cattle, and a business loan agreement on or about June 30, 2016. (ECF No. 23 at 7; ECF No. 23-19; ECF No. 23-20; ECF No. 23-21). Heritage perfected this security interest through a UCC Financing Statement on September 1, 2016. (ECF No. 23-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Prior to the June 2016 note's approval, McCracken provided Heritage with an updated financial statement dated May 6, 2016. (ECF No. 23 at 8; ECF No. 23-23). Heritage alleges that this statement was inaccurate because it failed to include amounts owed to Prosperity Bank before their satisfaction. (ECF No. 23 at 8). McCracken also provided Heritage with a copy of his 2015 tax return, which listed the value of his cattle purchased and owned as $357,327.00. (ECF No. 23 at 8; ECF No. 23-25 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On or about August 30, 2016, McCracken met with a Heritage representative and confirmed that he owned 129 head of cattle as of that date; Heritage subsequently funded the June 2016 note on August 31, 2016. (ECF No. 23-30 at 3). However, on or about February 22, 2017, McCracken advised Heritage that he was unable to pay his debts and was selling his home. (ECF No. 23-30 at 3). Heritage subsequently discovered that McCracken sold most of the cattle securing his debt to Heritage in June 2015 without notice to Heritage. (ECF No. 23-30 at 4; ECF No. 23-31 at 1). The sold cattle remained in the pastures where they were located prior to their sale. (ECF No. 23-31 at 2). McCracken's 2015 tax return-submitted to Heritage and listing the value of his cattle-failed to reflect this sale. (ECF No. 23 at 10; ECF No. 23-24). Because of these factors, Heritage alleges that it could not have known of McCracken's sale of the cattle. (ECF No. 23 at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   McCracken refutes Heritage's claim that it did not know of the June 2015 sale, asserting that he remitted the proceeds of\n   the sale-$40,000.00-to Heritage, which was reflected on Heritage's history of the June 2014 note as a $40,000.00 \"Payment-Extra to Principal\" payment made on June 11, 2015. (ECF No. 23-7 at 1; ECF No. 28-1 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Upon learning of McCracken's undisclosed sale of his cattle, Heritage declared the June 2016 note to be in default and began to foreclose on the cattle securing its lien. (ECF No. 23 at 11). On February 28, 2017, Heritage filed its original petition and request for injunctive relief in state court (Cause No. 90596-CV) seeking the June 2016 note's balance, a judicial foreclosure of its security interest in the collateral securing the loan, injunctive relief, and a writ for sequestration of certain collateral. (ECF No. 23 at 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   McCracken and his wife Suzanne McCracken filed for chapter 13 bankruptcy on March 24, 2017. (Case No. 17-80084, ECF No. 1). The McCrackens' bankruptcy Schedule A/B lists that the couple owned only 18 heads of cattle valued at $36,000.00 as of the petition date. (Case No. 17-80084, ECF No. 1 at 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On April 28, 2017, Heritage recovered and sold McCracken's 18 remaining cattle. (ECF No. 23 at 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On May 19, 2017, McCracken filed a Statement of Financial Affairs in which he claims that he \"moved over 100 cattle to Cameron/Maysfield area to avoid the flood. Cattle remained in that area for a number of months. Cattle had not been branded prior to the flood. Over 85 cattle are unaccounted for.\" (Case No. 17-80084, ECF No. 48 at 5). McCracken asserts that this loss of cattle resulted in $190,000.00 of lost property value. (Case No. 17-80084, ECF No. 48 at 5). Heritage contests McCracken's claim of lost cattle. (ECF No. 23 at 11). Instead, Heritage alleges that McCracken could have owned no more than 42 cattle subsequent to the June 2015 sale. (ECF No. 23 at 12; ECF No. 23-32 at 2; ECF No. 23-33 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Within its Notice of Rule 2004 Exam of Debtor and Amended Notices, Heritage requested the production of documents regarding all cattle sold, transferred, moved, or unaccounted for by McCracken. (Case No. 17-80084, ECF No. 73 at 2; Case No. 17-80084, ECF No. 78 at 2; Case No. 17-80084, ECF No. 80 at 2). McCracken failed to produce any relevant documents. (ECF No. 23 at 16-17). On March 29, 2017, Heritage issued a subpoena requesting documents related to McCracken's cattle. (ECF No. 15 at 5-6). McCracken responded that he failed to unearth any such documents. (ECF No. 23 at 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After applying all offsets and credit, McCracken is indebted to Heritage in the amount of $228,158.10. (ECF No. 23 at 19; ECF No. 23-34 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On May 18, 2017, Heritage filed this adversary proceeding against James W. McCracken in order to determine the dischargeability of the debt owed by McCracken to Heritage. (ECF No. 1). Heritage first claims that McCracken's debt to it is nondischargeable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B) because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 McCracken's disclosed financial information-including his financial statements and tax returns-induced Heritage into providing McCracken with credit;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 this disclosed financial information was materially false as it related to McCracken's financial condition at the time of the loans because it failed to accurately disclose and account for all of McCracken's assets and liabilities; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 McCracken executed and delivered this false financial information to Heritage with the intent to deceive Heritage in order to induce it to\n   extend credit to McCracken under the June 2016 note because he prepared and submitted the information knowing that it failed to accurately disclose all of his assets and liabilities. (ECF No. 1 at 9).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Alternatively, Heritage claims that McCracken's debt to it is nondischargeable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) because McCracken failed to produce complete and accurate financial records when requested, including documentation related to his cattle and other assets. (ECF No. 1 at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On September 13, 2017, Heritage filed a motion for summary judgment regarding his nondischargeability claims. (ECF No. 23). McCracken filed a response to Heritage's motion for summary judgment on January 5, 2018, in which he opposes the motion. (ECF No. 28). On January 29, 2018, Heritage filed a reply to McCracken's response. (ECF No. 29).

(ECF No. 23-30 at 2). Based upon this uneventful business relationship between Dees and McCracken, this factor weighs in favor of Heritage's reasonable reliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   While Dees' previous business dealings with McCracken gave rise to no red flags regarding the accuracy of McCracken's produced financial statements and tax returns, such a red flag did arise from Heritage's and McCracken's credit relationship. As pointed out by McCracken, Heritage learned of his alleged concealment of Prosperity Bank's lien on his cattle in April 2016. (ECF No. 23 at 7; ECF No. 28 at 7; ECF No. 23-30 at 3). Yet, even in the face of this red flag calling into question McCracken's trustworthiness, Heritage agreed to enter into the June 2016 note with McCracken. (ECF No. 23 at 7; ECF No. 23-19). McCracken asserts that this red flag consequently placed a burden on Heritage to inquire further into his financial statements and tax returns in order to determine their accuracy, which it failed to do. (ECF No. 28 at 7; ECF No. 28-7 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The alleged concealment of Prosperity Bank's lien on McCracken's cattle did alert Heritage to the potential unreliability of McCracken's financial statements and tax returns. However, when faced with this red flag, Heritage took multiple steps to discern the accuracy of these financial documents. Prior to executing the June 2016 note, Heritage requested and obtained McCracken's May 6, 2016 financial statement and 2015 tax return. (ECF No. 29 at 7; ECF No. 23-23; ECF No. 23-24; ECF No. 23-25). These documents confirmed that the value of McCracken's cattle at that time covered both Prosperity Bank's lien and Heritage's lien. (ECF No. 29 at 8; ECF No. 23-25). These documents, however, did not reflect any sale of the cattle or remittance of any sale proceeds to Heritage. (ECF No. 29 at 8; ECF No. 23-25). Additionally, McCracken confirmed in person the number of cattle he owned-129-with Angela Dees on or about August 30, 2016, one day before the June 2016 note was actually funded by Heritage. (ECF No. 23-30 at 3). This number of cattle does not reflect any cattle sold in 2015. McCracken does not dispute these facts. (ECF No. 28 at 3). Heritage's investigation thus failed to reveal any of the inaccuracies in the values of McCracken's assets or liabilities listed within his financial statements and tax returns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Even a more robust investigation into the number and value of McCracken's cattle would have failed to reveal the inaccuracies in his financial documents. For example, although McCracken sold most of the cattle securing his debt to Heritage in June 2015, he did so without notice to Heritage and the cattle were not removed from the pasture where they were located prior to their sale. (ECF No. 23-30 at 4; EF No. 23-31 at 1-2). Heritage consequently could not have discovered that McCracken sold the cattle by looking at either his disclosed financial statements or the actual cattle in the pasture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Without any additional evidence or argument from McCracken refuting Heritage's\n   submitted proof, no genuine dispute exists as to this element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    V. Use of a statement in writing that the debtor caused to be made with an intent to deceive\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Section 523(a)(2)(B)(iv) finally requires that the written statement used to obtain a debt be made by the debtor with an intent to deceive the creditor. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(B)(iv). Unless a debtor admits to having an intent to deceive a creditor, a court looks at the totality of the circumstances to infer whether the statement was knowingly false or made with a \"[r]eckless disregard for the truth or falsity of [the] statement combined with the sheer magnitude of the resultant misrepresentation ....\"\n   <em>\n    In re Morrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3339913,5584515\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/555/473/\">\n    555 F.3d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 482 (5th Cir. 2009) (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10523599,6120407\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/39/301/\">\n    39 F.3d 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 305 (11th Cir. 1994) ). The court may consider such factors as the debtor's knowledge of and experience in financial matters, as well as whether the debtor exhibited a clear pattern of purposeful conduct when inferring deceitful intent of a debtor.\n   <em>\n    In re Morrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5740566\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/361/107/#p123\">\n    361 B.R. 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 124 (Bankr.

Instead, \"where a debtor testifies as to her subjective intent, the bankruptcy court must make a credibility determination, considering the debtor's testimony, along with other objective circumstantial evidence of the debtor's subjective intent.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Mercer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11108411\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/246/391/#p409\">\n    246 F.3d 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 409 (5th Cir. 2001).

Nonetheless, evidence exists from which to infer McCracken's intent to deceive. McCracken blatantly failed to disclose all of his liabilities and the value of his cattle on each of his produced financial statements even though he had provided Prosperity Bank a lien on his cattle and sold most of his cattle in June 2015. (ECF No. 23-2; ECF No. 23-17; ECF No. 23-23; ECF No. 23-30 at 4; ECF No. 23-31 at 1). Additionally, McCracken failed to disclose the cattle he sold on his 2015 tax return. (ECF No. 23-24). These misrepresentations and omissions within McCracken's financial documents show McCracken's clear pattern of knowingly or recklessly deceitful conduct. When coupled with the fact that these false financial documents caused Heritage to extend tens of thousands of dollars in credit to him, McCracken's use of his materially false financial documents gives rise to an inference that he supplied those documents intending to deceive Heritage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   McCracken failed to submit any evidence demonstrating a genuine dispute as to whether he caused his materially false financial documents to be made with an intent to deceive Heritage. The Court has carefully reviewed McCracken's response to the summary judgment motion (ECF No. 28). Most tellingly, McCracken does not deny that he intended to deceive the Bank. (ECF No. 28 at 1-9). Instead, McCracken's affidavit indicates that he was not keeping up with his financial affairs because he was absent from the State. (ECF No. 28 at 2). His affidavit never states that he held an honest belief that his financial representations to Heritage were accurate. (ECF No. 28 at 1-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Accordingly, no genuine dispute exists as to this element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Because no genuine dispute exists as to the existence of the \u00a7 523(a)(2)(B) elements in this proceeding, summary judgment is granted as to this nondischargeability claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Nondischargeability under \u00a7 727(a)(3)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Heritage alternatively argues that McCracken's debt to it is nondischargeable under \u00a7 727(a)(3) because McCracken failed to keep or preserve any financial records related to the disposition of the cattle he claims to have owned. (ECF No. 23 at 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20103\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), \u00a7 727 is inapplicable to chapter 13 bankruptcy cases.
