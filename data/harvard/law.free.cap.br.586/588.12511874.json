The Court finds that this is a contested matter as defined under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9014. As such, the Court makes the following findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7052. The Court took this matter under advisement and finds that confirmation of Debtor's First Amended Plan is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Debtor filed a chapter 13 petition for relief on December 1, 2017 (ECF No. 1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   On the same day, Debtor filed her Schedules, Statement of Financial Affairs (\"SOFA\"), and Chapter 13 Plan (ECF Nos. 1 and 2). Debtor filed her Amended Schedules and First Amended Chapter 13 plan on February 13, 2018, two days before the confirmation hearing. (ECF Nos. 14-16). The Court considered confirmation of the Debtor's First Amended Chapter 13 Plan (\"Plan\") on February 15, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to the District Form Chapter 13 Plan (\"District Plan\") used in the Western District of Texas, Debtor proposes to pay 100% of all of Debtor's allowed administrative, secured, and priority claims, and 12% of Debtor's nonpriority unsecured claims (ECF No. 16, p. 1-2). The proposed Plan payment is $1,440.00 for months 1-4 of the Plan and $1,505.00 for months 5-60 of the Plan. (\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at p. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court considered the Plan at the February 15, 2018 confirmation hearing wherein the Trustee made oral objections to the Plan. Trustee filed her Objection on March 1, 2018, in response to the Debtor's First Amended Chapter 13 Plan filed on February 13, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Trustee objected to the Plan because Debtor's counsel struck through Section 4.1 of the District Plan regarding the treatment of tax refunds. (ECF No. 16, p. 2). Trustee argued that Debtor could not strike through any of the provisions contained in the District Plan. The District Plan contains a non-standard provision that allows a debtor to add additional terms to the District Plan if the non-standard provision is contained in Section 8. In this case, Debtor indicated in Section 1.3 of the District Plan that there are non-standard provisions in Section 8 of the Plan, yet there are not any non-standard provisions listed in Section 8 of the Plan. As such, it is unclear what Debtor intended regarding any non-standard provisions. Moreover, with Debtor's striking of Section 4.1 of the Plan, it is unclear what Debtor's intentions are regarding the disposition\n   of tax refunds. Trustee also contends that without the inclusion of Debtor's tax refund, Debtor's Plan is infeasible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Debtor testified at the confirmation hearing. The Court admitted a number of exhibits, but Debtor's testimony focused on Debtor's tax returns and refunds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Debtor is single with two dependents. Debtor works as a medical assistant and earns $2,644.16 per month. Debtor's Schedule I (Statement of Income) pro-rates Debtor's refund for 2017 of $3,261.00 in the monthly amount of $272.00 per month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    DISTRICT FORM CHAPTER 13 PLAN\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Bankruptcy courts have the statutory and rule making authority to propose and use local bankruptcy rules.

Debtor believes that Debtor should be able to pro-rate Debtor's future tax refunds on an annual basis by allocating 1/12 of the annual tax refund as income on Debtor's Schedule I. Debtor argues that the Court cannot require Debtor to turn over any tax refund because Schedule I (Official Form 106I, Part 2) requires Debtor pro-rate her annual tax refund by dividing the tax refund by 1/12 and including it on Schedule I. Further, Debtor argues that requiring Debtor to turnover tax refunds results in capturing non-disposable income instead of disposable income, and, as such, contravenes\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Debtor further asserts that Section 4.1 of the District Plan, which conditions Debtor's retention of a tax refund if only certain requirements are met, violates the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Trustee argues that Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3015.1 allows a court to use a chapter 13 form plan and that Debtor may not deviate or alter the approved form plan. Further, Trustee argues that tax refunds are disposable income under \u00a7 1325(b) and must be turned over to Trustee. Trustee maintains that allowing Debtor to keep $2,000.00 per year is for unexpected expenses that arise during the year. Trustee notes that the Official Form Plan requires debtors to account for tax refunds on the form. Trustee asserts that pro-rating Debtor's tax refund is not permitted under\n   the District Plan and is required under the Bankruptcy Code. Trustee states that the instructions to Schedule I do not require that tax refunds be pro-rated per month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Debtor's Plan and Trustee's Objection require the Court to analyze a number of issues involving the Court's adoption of a District Plan. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3015.1 is clear that a District may require a local form plan be used in a chapter 13 case in place of the Official Form. This Court adopted a District Plan in consultation with the chapter 13 trustees in this District and allowed the bar and any interested parties the opportunity to comment and object to the District Plan. The Court considered all comments and objections before adopting a District Plan and concluded that it was in the best interest of the Court and its constituents to use a District Plan as opposed to Official Form Plan. This Court stated in its Consolidated Standing Order for the Adoption of a District Form Chapter 13 Plan on October 16, 2017, that a form chapter 13 plan be used throughout the Western District of Texas. (Order # 17-02). The Court concluded that the adoption of a District Plan is necessary for the efficient and orderly administration of Chapter 13 cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9009 states that the Judicial Conference of the United States prescribes the Official Forms that shall be used in federal courts without alteration. Trustee argues that the inclusion of the language striking Section 4.1 of the Plan impermissibly alters the District Plan. Debtor argues that because the District Plan includes a standard provision (Section 4.1) that is contrary to the Bankruptcy Code and Rules, Debtor may strike through the provision. Debtor also argues that because\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201321\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   states that \"[t]he debtor shall file a plan[,]\" the Bankruptcy Code authorizes only a debtor to propose the form and terms of a chapter 13 plan. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As an initial matter, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure provide that a bankruptcy court may use a district form chapter 13 plan. Allowing any debtor the ability to modify the form or terms of the District Plan would render its use meaningless. The purpose of Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3015.1 was to establish an Official Form of chapter 13 plan so that creditors and litigants could rely upon the same chapter 13 plan being used throughout the country without regard to variances in local practice or rules. Further, to accommodate a number of bankruptcy courts and judges who took issue with the Official Form Plan, Rule 3015.1 provides in the alternative that a bankruptcy court can adopt a district plan. This was the compromise reached between the Rules Committee and the bankruptcy judges. The court in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Solitro\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3543555\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/382/150/#p152\">\n    382 B.R. 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 152 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2008) correctly noted the rationale behind district form plans:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Using a uniform plan permits the Chapter 13 trustees and attorneys for creditors frequently appearing to review the plans more quickly and efficiently. It also enables debtors' attorneys to prepare plans more quickly and efficiently. Uniformity helps to control the costs of pursuing a chapter 13 case through confirmation and prevents chapter 13 plans\n   from taking on the time and expense associated with chapter 11. Chapter 13 was intended as a special vehicle available to qualifying individuals to use so they would not have to bear the expense of chapter 11. Even if additional provisions do nothing more than restate parties rights under the law, including Bankruptcy Code and Rules, they thwart the goal of providing individuals with a streamlined method for reorganizing their debts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Section 1321 states that \"[t]he debtor shall file a plan.\" The Court recognizes that a chapter 13 debtor has the exclusive right to file a plan.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Euler\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11199542\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/251/740/#p745\">\n    251 B.R. 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 745 (Bankr. M.D. Fla. 2000) (citing H.R. Rep. No. 595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 143 (1977), U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1977 p. 5963; S. Rep. No. 989, 95th Cong. 2d Sess. 141 (1978), U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1977 p. 5787;\n   <em>\n    Collier on Bankruptcy\n   </em>\n   (15th ed. Rev.), \u00b6 1321.01 at 1321-2) ). The exclusive right to file a chapter 13 plan, however, does not mean that a chapter 13 debtor is the only party who can determine the form of a chapter 13 plan. The distinction between\n   <em>\n    filing\n   </em>\n   a chapter 13 plan and\n   <em>\n    determining the form\n   </em>\n   of a chapter 13 plan is captured in Rule 3015(b) (setting deadlines for a debtor to file a plan) and (c) (requiring debtor to use either an Official Form or Local Form for a plan). Moreover, as discussed herein, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure provide that bankruptcy courts may impose both local rules and a form plan. Under Debtor's argument, any debtor could propose a chapter 13 plan in any form a debtor wanted, thereby creating an administrative nightmare for the court and the litigants in reviewing every provision of every plan filed, which increases the cost of chapter 13 and significantly reduces efficiency in the process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court finds Debtor's argument unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The crux of Debtor's argument relates to the tax refund language in Section 4.1 that allows a debtor, without any interference from the Court, Trustee, or creditors, the right to retain the first $2,000.00 of a debtor's annual tax refund. The purpose of this provision was to give all chapter 13 debtors the unfettered right to retain up to $2,000.00 of any annual tax refund a debtor (or debtors) receives to assist a debtor with paying for unexpected expenses that invariably occur in chapter 13 cases. In addition, the Court recognized that many chapter 13 budgets as proposed are tight in that a debtor has little room to pay an unanticipated expense without the availability of excess funds. As such, this Court determined that allowing a debtor to keep some of the debtor's tax refund enhances the prospect of a debtor completing a chapter 13 plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   As Debtor notes, Section 4.1 provides how this Court treats tax refunds. Any tax refund in excess of $2,000.00 in a case in which debtors have not proposed a 100% payment to nonpriority unsecured creditors must be provided to the Chapter 13 Trustee because this Court finds that tax refunds are disposable income. Debtor maintains that tax refunds are not disposable income under \u00a7 1325(b)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court\n   has held otherwise.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Pautin\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310950\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/521/754/\">\n    521 B.R. 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 763 n. 9 (Bankr. W.D. Tex. 2014) (noting that several courts in the Fifth Circuit have held that, in a chapter 13 case, tax refunds are property of the estate and the debtor must turn over tax refunds to the chapter 13 trustee).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 4.1 is consistent with this Court's view that tax refunds are disposable income under \u00a7 1325(b)(2) and must be turned over to the Chapter 13 Trustee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Debtor also argues that the instructions to Schedule I require Debtor to account for annual tax refunds as monthly income. The instructions for Official Form 106I, Part 2 (Schedule I) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   In Part 2, give details about the monthly income you currently expect to receive. Show all totals as monthly payments, even if income is not received in monthly payments. One easy way to calculate how much income per month is to total the payments earned in a year, then divide by 12 to get a monthly figure. For example, if you are paid seasonally, you would simply divide the amount you expect to earn in a year by 12 to get the monthly amount.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Instructions: Bankruptcy Forms for Individuals, p. 26 (2017), http://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/instructions_individuals_0.pdf. The Court notes that despite the Schedule I instructions, the accompanying national Official Form 113 provides Debtor with the ability to determine how Debtor's income tax refunds will be treated under a plan, which could also\n   conceivably contradict the instructions to Schedule I.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Chapter 13 Plan, p. 2, http://www.uscourts.gov/forms/individual-debtors/chapter-13-plan (allowing debtors to decide whether a debtor will (1) \"retain any income tax refunds received during the plan term\"; (2) \"supply the trustee with a copy of each income tax return filed during the plan term within 14 days of filing the return and will turn over to the trustee all income tax refunds received during the term plan\"; or (3) propose a different treatment of income tax refunds). Accordingly, the Court is not persuaded by Debtor's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Debtor notes that at least two courts have similarly found that a Chapter 13 Trustee cannot require a debtor to turn over a tax refund to a trustee where the debtor has amortized a tax refund on a monthly basis in Schedule I. These courts have both held that a debtor must, according to the Bankruptcy Code and instructions to the Official Forms, account for tax refunds as income on Schedule I.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     In re Blake\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272877\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/565/871/#p876\">\n    565 B.R. 871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 876 (Bankr.
