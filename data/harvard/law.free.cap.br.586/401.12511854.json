(the \"Debtor\") is the chapter 7 debtor in this case filed on February 3, 2016. John S. Pereira is the Debtor's chapter 7 trustee (the \"Trustee\"). The Debtor was formed in 1999 by its sole shareholder, Henry S. Moyer, Jr. (\"Moyer\"), and was in the business of selling employee benefits insurance to individual and commercial customers. One of its competitors, TWG Insurance Agency, LLC d/b/a The Westport Group (\"TWG\"), sued the Debtor in 2014 for more than $3 million for alleged breach of a non-disclosure agreement, claiming that the Debtor's employees disclosed TWG's confidential information about insurance products to TWG's competitors. The Trustee contends that Debtor's unadjudicated liability to TWG rendered the Debtor insolvent \"no later than June 3, 2014.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 17 (ECF Doc. # 16).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In February 2018, the Trustee filed an adversary complaint, amended in May 2018, against the estate of Moyer (Moyer died in April 2017) and others seeking to avoid and recover preferential and fraudulent transfers allegedly made by and/or received by the defendants, and recover damages for the defendants' conduct on a variety of theories. The Amended Complaint alleges fourteen causes of action, only one of which-the Eleventh Claim for Relief (Unjust Enrichment)-is the subject of the currently pending motion to dismiss (the \"Motion,\" ECF Doc. # 8) filed by defendant Frenkel Benefits, LLC (\"Frenkel\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The factual predicate for the Eleventh Claim for Relief (Unjust Enrichment) and several other claims is the sale of the Debtor's business in October 2014 to Frenkel for $2,320,000, plus an earn-out (later calculated as an additional $294,807.04) (the \"Final Payment\"). The Trustee alleges that the Debtor's sale to Frenkel was for less than reasonably equivalent value at a time the Debtor was insolvent because the Debtor only received approximately $837,000 of the total consideration paid by Frenkel. The sale of the Debtor's business was structured under the parties' Asset Purchase Agreement (the \"APA\") so that Frenkel paid Moyer (individually) approximately $928,000, and paid another of Debtor's \"insider,\" defendant Robert Rogers (\"Rogers\"), (individually) approximately $555,000. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-22.) As explained by the Trustee, Frenkel's payments to Moyer and Rogers were structured as payments for\n   <em>\n    their\n   </em>\n   \"Goodwill\" (the \"Goodwill Transfers\"). (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21 (\"Although all of the Acquired Assets sold to Frenkel belonged to the Debtor, the APA was structured to defraud the Debtor's creditors by incorrectly claiming that part of the Debtor's Goodwill sold to Frankel belonged to Moyer and Rogers, instead of the Debtor.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23 (\"The Trustee contends that any Goodwill acquired by Frenkel pursuant to the APA actually belonged to the Debtor and not to Moyer or Rogers, notwithstanding that the APA described goodwill as belonging to them.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Trustee alleges that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the Goodwill sold to Frenkel was property of the Debtor, and none of it was property of Moyer and Rogers in their individual capacities. The issue of whom the Goodwill sold under the APA belongs to-the Debtor,\n   as alleged by the Trustee, or Moyer and Rogers, as alleged by the defendants-is the central issue in this adversary proceeding. Indeed, in the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Claims for Relief, the Trustee seeks to recover the \"Goodwill Transfers\" to Moyer and Rogers as fraudulent transfers recoverable under state or federal avoidance statutes, and Frenkel is named as a defendant in each of those Claims for Relief, none of which it has moved to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Eleventh Claim for Relief against all defendants, including Frenkel, alleges that the Goodwill Transfers are also recoverable based on the state law theory of unjust enrichment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. at 23-25.) Frenkel's Motion to dismiss argues that the portion of the Eleventh Cause of Action for unjust enrichment dealing with the Goodwill Transfers (the only portion of the claim asserted against Frenkel) must be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Frenkel also seeks to dismiss the Trustee's claim for recovery of the Final Payment under that same theory, but as explained below, the parties now agree that the Final Payment was never paid by Frenkel, and Frenkel has agreed to pay the Final Payment to the Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The issue of to whom the Goodwill sold under the APA belonged is an interesting legal issue that will no doubt have to be resolved with respect to the other causes of action, but it is unnecessary to resolve that issue now to decide Frenkel's Motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint's unjust enrichment claim. For the reasons explained below, Frenkel's Motion to dismiss the unjust enrichment claim is granted because the Amended Complaint does not allege that Frankel was enriched by receiving consideration for which it did not pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Frenkel's Motion argues that the Eleventh Claim for Relief based on unjust enrichment must be dismissed under Bankruptcy Rule 7012(b) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (ECF Doc. # 8.) The Plaintiff filed a memorandum of law in opposition to the Motion (the \"Opposition,\" ECF Doc. # 29).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Frenkel filed an untimely reply in support of its Motion (the \"Reply,\" ECF Doc. # 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Debtor is a New York corporation formed in 1999 by Moyer, an officer, principal, and the sole shareholder of the Debtor. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 14.) Moyer passed away in April 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) The Debtor was engaged in the business of selling employee benefits insurance to individual and commercial customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On or about June 3, 2014, TWG filed a complaint against the Debtor in the Superior Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts captioned\n   <em>\n    In re:\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    TWG Insurance Agency, LLC v. The Moyer Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Civil Action No. 2014-1777 (the \"TWG Action\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) TWG sought damages from the Debtor in excess of $3 million for the Debtor's alleged breach of a non-disclosure agreement, as certain employees of\n   the Debtor allegedly disclosed confidential materials to TWG's competitors related to insurance products developed by TWG. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Moyer, together with Rogers, an insider officer and director of the Debtor, agreed to sell substantially all of the Debtor's assets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 18.) On or about October 28, 2014, the Debtor, Moyer, and Rogers entered into the APA to sell substantially all of the Debtor's assets, tangible and intangible, to Frenkel in exchange for $2,320,000 plus an earn-out (the \"Asset Sale\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) The earn-out was based on Frenkel's earnings from the Debtor's clients from months 13 to 24 after the closing of the APA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Pursuant to the APA, Frenkel paid the Debtor approximately $837,000 from the sale of its assets, and Frenkel paid Moyer and Rogers, in their individual capacities, approximately $928,000 and $555,000, respectively, in consideration for the business' Goodwill. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 26.) The closing for the Asset Sale took place on November 1, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Amended Complaint alleges that on or after January 6, 2017, Frenkel paid Moyer a Final Payment of $294,807.04 pursuant to the APA's earn-out. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) The Motion, however, states that Frenkel is holding the Final Payment and never paid it to Moyer. (Mot. at 3 n.2.) During oral argument of the Motion, counsel agreed that Frankel is holding the Final Payment of $294,807.04; Frankel's counsel stated that the funds will be turned over to the Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Finally, although not directly relevant to this Motion, the Complaint also alleges that in the period between 2012 through 2015, Moyer engaged in a pattern of writing off his personal debts to the Debtor, altering the Debtor's financial statements to reflect inaccurate balances based on those write-offs, and making transfers to the Defendants, for no consideration. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-45.) The Amended Complaint also seeks to recover those other write-offs and transfers, but none of those claims is asserted against Frankel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Frankel's Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Frenkel moves to dismiss the Eleventh Claim for Relief (Unjust Enrichment) under Bankruptcy Rule 7012(b) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. (Mot. at 3.) Frenkel argues that the Trustee only asserts the following allegations in support of his claim against Frenkel for unjust enrichment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 Defendants have taken the value and benefit of the assets and proceeds of Debtor's business;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 Defendants, therefore, have been unjustly enriched at the expense of Debtor's estate; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 By reason of the foregoing, the Trustee is entitled to recover on behalf of Debtor's estate damages for the diminished value of Debtor's business (and its assets and proceeds) while held and operated by Defendants in the following amounts:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   a. $928,000 from Defendants Moyer and Frenkel, jointly and severally, on account of the Goodwill Transfers;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   b. $555,000 from Defendants Moyer, Rogers, and Frenkel, jointly and severally, on account of the Goodwill Transfers;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   c. $294,807.04 from Defendant Moyer and Frenkel, jointly and severally, on account of the Final Payment transfer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Frenkel argues the unjust enrichment claim should be dismissed against it for two reasons. First, the unjust enrichment\n   allegations are threadbare: The Trustee has alleged no facts that demonstrate how Frenkel benefited at the Debtor's expense, nor has the Trustee alleged any facts as to why equity and good conscience require restitution from Frenkel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Second, because a valid and enforceable written contract ordinarily precludes recovery in quasi contract, and because, Frenkel contends, the validity of the APA is not disputed, the APA governs the terms of the transaction and bars any claims by the Trustee for unjust enrichment or other quasi-contractual theory. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Trustee's Opposition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In his Opposition, the Trustee contends that the Amended Complaint has met the pleading requirements necessary to assert a claim for unjust enrichment. The Trustee alleges that the Amended Complaint states that after the Debtor became insolvent, Frenkel, Moyer and Rogers purposefully manufactured, or helped to manufacture, the Asset Sale in a way to personally profit Moyer and Rogers through the Goodwill Transfers, rather than to provide reasonably equivalent consideration to the Debtor in exchange for its own goodwill and related assets. (Opp. at 8-9 (citing Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 21-23, 27).) By doing so, the Trustee submits, Frenkel was complicit in fraudulently transferring and conveying assets that belonged to the Debtors and/or the Debtor's creditors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 (citing Am. Compl. \u00b6 108-11).) The Trustee contends that \"it is clear from the Amended Complaint that equity and good conscious [sic] should not permit Frenkel to retain that benefit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Trustee disputes Frenkel's argument that a claim for unjust enrichment may not lie where there is valid contract between the parties governing the same subject matter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Trustee argues that the \"Amended Complaint does not assert a breach of contract claim, and in any event, Frenkel's contention is premature at this stage of the proceeding because 'courts in this district have routinely allowed plaintiffs to advance past the pleading stage on an alternative theory of unjust enrichment,' particularly where 'it remains unsettled whether an enforceable contract in fact governs the dispute.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 (citing\n   <em>\n    Dervan v. Gordian Group LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20819494\">\n    2017 WL 819494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 28, 2017) (internal citations omitted) ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Frankel's Reply\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In its Reply, Frankel argues that \"[i]n the Complaint, the Trustee does not allege that the\n   <em>\n    total\n   </em>\n   consideration paid by Frenkel for the assets transferred under the APA for $2,320,000 was less than the reasonably equivalent value of such assets.\" (Reply at 3 (emphasis in original).) Rather, according to Frenkel, the Amended Complaint only alleges that the payments made by Frenkel to Moyer and Rogers for $1,483,000 were for the Debtor's property and those transfers should be avoided for the benefit of the estate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Frenkel argues that the Amended Complaint does not allege (i) how or why Frenkel was enriched by acquiring the assets in exchange for $2,320,000; or (ii) why it would be inequitable to permit Frenkel to retain the assets it acquired under the APA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Further, Frenkel submits that \"New York law provides that an unjust enrichment claim is available\n   <em>\n    in the absence\n   </em>\n   of an express agreement,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (emphasis in original) ), and explains that in this case the Trustee does not seek to void the APA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) \"Rather, the Trustee has specifically alleged the validity of the APA and that it governed the transactions that are the subject of his action.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Pursuant to the APA, Frenkel paid a total of $2,320,000 to acquire both the Debtor's tangible assets and the Debtor's Goodwill (assuming, as argued by the Trustee, the Goodwill sold under the APA belonged to the Debtor). While the Trustee argues that the Debtor only received part of the consideration paid under the APA for the sale of the Debtor's assets and Goodwill, the Trustee does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   allege that Frenkel purchased the tangible and intangible assets, including Goodwill, for less than the assets were worth. While the Amended Complaint contends that the Debtor should have received the\n   <em>\n    total\n   </em>\n   consideration for the Asset Sale, the Trustee does not contend that the Debtor's tangible assets and Goodwill were worth more than the $2,300,000 paid by Frenkel. In other words, there is no allegation that Frenkel was enriched by paying less than\n   reasonable equivalent value for the assets it purchased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Rather, the Trustee contends that the Debtor was defrauded because Moyers and Rogers received payment, in their individual capacities, for the Debtor's Goodwill. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Am. Compl. \u00b6 21 (\"Although all of the Acquired Assets sold to Frenkel belonged to the Debtor, the APA was structured to defraud the Debtor's creditors by incorrectly claiming that part of the Debtor's Goodwill sold to Frenkel belonged to Moyers and Rogers, instead of the Debtor.\").) But the Trustee only contends that the amount received\n   <em>\n    by the Debtor\n   </em>\n   for the assets transferred was less than a reasonably equivalent value for its tangible assets and Goodwill. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 27 (\"Frenkel did not provide adequate consideration\n   <em>\n    to the Debtor\n   </em>\n   in exchange for the Debtor's assets it purchased in the Asset Sale.\") (emphasis added).) Had the Trustee contended that the assets sold under the APA were worth more than $2,300,000, the Trustee may have been able to prevail on Frenkel's Motion to Dismiss. But the Trustee did not do so. It is true that the Amended Complaint states that \"[t]he Debtor received only approximately $837,000 from the sale of its assets,\n   <em>\n    even though the value of those assets was significantly greater\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26 (emphasis added).) This allegation does not save the Trustee's claim. The $2,300,000 paid by Frenkel for the assets is obviously greater than the $837,000 paid to the Debtor. But this contention does not support the argument, made by Trustee's counsel during argument, that the value of the assets sold to Frenkel was greater than $2,300,000. Accordingly, the Amended Complaint does not plead that Frenkel was unjustly enriched by the transfers under the APA. Therefore, the Amended Complaint does not state a claim against Frenkel for unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Trustee may be correct that Moyer and Rogers were unjustly enriched by the payments to them for the Debtor's Goodwill (assuming that the Trustee is correct that all of the Goodwill belonged to the Debtor), and that equity and good conscience would in that case demand restitution to the Debtor. It also may be that Frenkel is liable on one of the other claims for relief, including with respect to the amount of the Goodwill Transfers, but the current Motion addresses only the unjust enrichment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   For these reasons, Frenkel's Motion to dismiss the Eleventh Claim for Relief with respect to the Goodwill Transfers is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For the avoidance of doubt, the Court rejects Frenkel's argument that the existence of the APA precludes recovery in\n   <em>\n    quasi contract\n   </em>\n   . Although the disputed transfers were made pursuant to the APA, the Amended Complaint alleges that the APA was structured to defraud creditors. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 21.) While a binding contract generally precludes recovery in quasi contract,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clark-Fitzpatrick, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4407766\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/70/382/#p388\">\n    70 N.Y.2d at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=521%20N.Y.S.2d%20653\">\n    521 N.Y.S.2d 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=516%20N.E.2d%20190\">\n    516 N.E.2d 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a valid and enforceable written contract governing a particular subject matter ordinarily precludes recovery in quasi contract for events arising out of the same subject matter), if a contract is structured to defraud creditors, there is no basis at the pleading stage to dismiss claims based on other theories, including quasi-contract and unjust enrichment. Here, the Amended Complaint alleges that the disputed transfers should be avoided as actual and constructive fraudulent transfers. Frenkel does not contest the sufficiency of the fraudulent transfer claims in the Amended Complaint. The Court therefore concludes there is a\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   dispute as to the validity and enforceability of the APA. Under these circumstances,\n   the Court would not dismiss the unjust enrichment claim (which is also asserted against Moyer and Rogers) when the validity of the contract remains unsettled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dervan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20819494\">\n    2017 WL 819494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12 (holding that where \"it remains unsettled whether an enforceable contract in fact governs the dispute at hand, ... the Court sees no reason not to permit [the Plaintiff] to proceed with the unjust enrichment theory of liability\");\n   <em>\n    Kottler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4207150\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/607/447/#p468\">\n    607 F.Supp.2d at 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"where there is a bona fide dispute as to the existence of a contract or where the contract does not cover the dispute in issue, a court should not dismiss a claim of unjust enrichment at the motion-to-dismiss stage\") (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Frenkel's counsel cited four cases in support of his argument that dismissal of the unjust enrichment claim was warranted based on the existence of the APA. None of those cases is applicable to this case. For instance, in\n   <em>\n    EBC I, Inc. v. Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   , the New York Court of Appeals dismissed the plaintiff's unjust enrichment claim because of the existence of a valid contract governing the subject matter.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"984089\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/5/11/\">\n    5 N.Y.3d 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"984089\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/5/11/\">\n    799 N.Y.S.2d 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"984089\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/5/11/\">\n    832 N.E.2d 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 33 (2005). In\n   <em>\n    EBC I\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff did not dispute the validity and enforceability of the contract, but had only asserted a claim for fraud under New York and New Jersey law, which had been dismissed with leave to replead.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"984089\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/5/11/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"984089\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/5/11/\">\n    799 N.Y.S.2d 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"984089\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/5/11/\">\n    832 N.E.2d at 30-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
