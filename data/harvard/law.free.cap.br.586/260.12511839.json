Mercury also moves to vacate the Agreed Order Regarding Review of Debtor's Software, which authorizes review of Mercury's primary asset, its software source code [ECF No. 13 (the \"Agreed Order to Review Software\") ]. Petitioning Creditors (hereafter defined) object and argue Mercury should remain in chapter 7 under the direction of Mark Miller, the Chapter 7 Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   An evidentiary hearing was held on May 24, 25, and 30, 2017. For the reasons stated herein, Mercury's Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Convert are denied. Mercury's Motion to Vacate Agreed Order is granted to allow the parties to consider the substantial additional information available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Mercury Data Systems.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mercury is a software company attempting to develop high accuracy navigation technology. John Taylor is the sole owner and President of Mercury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mercury is developing a system for a non-GPS location device called TrakPoint. According to a preliminary business plan created by Taylor to solicit investors, Mercury began developing the current version of the TrakPoint system in 2013 after reaching a performance threshold of 99% accuracy 99% of the time. [Exh. 3, ECF No. 63-3.] Mercury represented that it planned to release the TrakPoint system in 2016 and the technology was so advanced that the Army expressed interest in awarding procurement contracts even before full development of the product. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Taylor represented that he anticipated completing the TrakPoint development by July 2018. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The preliminary business plan also claimed Mercury would meet certain milestones in 2016, including completing a market analysis, acquiring 5 patents, and acquiring exclusive licensing rights to\n   three different algorithms. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.] Mercury met few of the milestones in 2016 or otherwise, and did not obtain a procurement contract either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 29, 2016, Mercury entered a Note Purchase Agreement with several investors, including Quantum IT Global Holdings Pty Ltd. (\"Quantum\") and PSP Services Pty Limited (\"PSP\"). The financing provided $700,000.00 for continuation of research and development on the TrakPoint system and other software. [Exh. 19, ECF No. 68-1.] Mark O'Reilly (\"O'Reilly\"), owner of PSP and Head of Innovation at Quantum, signed the Note Purchase Agreement on behalf of the investors. The Note Purchase Agreement provided that Mercury would issue convertible promissory notes maturing in 18 months, on or about October 29, 2017. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mercury encountered financial problems despite the funds received from the investors. Taylor and O'Reilly testified that both knew Mercury was running out of money by March 2017. On March 30, 2017, Quantum agreed to provide additional funds pursuant to a document called Agreed Terms-MDS and A3 Funding (\"Agreed Terms\"). [Exh. 10, ECF No. 63-9.] O'Reilly signed the Agreed Terms on behalf of Quantum. O'Reilly had concerns about the investment, so Mercury agreed to develop an updated business plan by April 14 for \"Plan B Funding\" and provide Katherine Bennett, a certified public accountant hired by Mercury, full access to Mercury's financial records. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Bennett was given the promised access, but Taylor did not prepare an updated business plan. Therefore, O'Reilly and Bennett worked on an updated business plan to facilitate solicitation of additional financing that the parties refer to as the \"Live Plan.\" [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exh. 34, ECF No. 72-12.] They completed the Live Plan in June 2017 and presented it to Taylor for review. [\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In July 2017, Mercury ran out of money and stopped paying its debts. Alex Stuhl, described in testimony as a key player in TrakPoint's development, and another employee quit. Bennett continued to perform work for Mercury, including aiding O'Reilly with the Live Plan, but her invoices were not paid. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exh. 8, ECF No. 63-7 at 5-6.] Mercury's landlord threatened a forcible detainer action, but has not acted. Taylor continued to work on the TrakPoint system, but his visits to the office to perform his managerial duties dwindled to the point that he appeared in the office only once or twice a month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The loss of employees, potential for eviction, and approaching maturity of the convertible promissory notes caused significant concern for O'Reilly and Bennett. Taylor acknowledged the problems and agreed they had cause for worry. O'Reilly therefore arranged a meeting with Taylor and an Australian company called Codan Limited to discuss a technology partnership with Mercury that would bring in necessary capital and allow Taylor to focus on development issues. [Exh. 48, ECF No. 72-26 at 3.] Taylor expressed no interest in discussing a partnership with Codan. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   O'Reilly continued his attempts to find ways to fund development of the TrakPoint system and pay Mercury's creditors without success. Taylor rebuffed O'Reilly's efforts and took no action to find additional funding for Mercury or address Mercury's financial crisis. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exh. 51, ECF No. 72-29.] The relationship between O'Reilly and Taylor soured to the point that Taylor ceased communication with O'Reilly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Involuntary Chapter 7 Petition.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   PSP, Peter King, and Bennett (\"Petitioning Creditors\") filed the involuntary\n   chapter 7 petition against Mercury on February 7, 2018. Mercury did not respond, so the Order for Relief was entered on March 5, 2018. [ECF No. 4.]\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Chapter 7 Trustee was appointed and took possession of Mercury's assets. This included changing the locks on the office and discussions with Mercury's employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The Chapter 7 Trustee also obtained approval to allow Quantum to \"review the quality and efficacy of the Debtor's software\" through the Agreed Order to Review Software.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At some point in March, Taylor attempted to access Mercury's office. He discovered the locks were changed, so he could not enter the building. Taylor contacted Chris Creech, a Kentucky lawyer that assisted Mercury with certain transactional matters. Creech discovered the bankruptcy filing and Taylor caused Mercury to become active in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On April 11, Mercury filed the Motion to Vacate Agreed Order and Motion to Convert. The Chapter 7 Trustee and Petitioning Creditors objected to both motions. [ECF Nos. 18, 19, 20.] On April 18, Mercury filed its Motion to Dismiss asking to set aside the Order for Relief under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9024 (incorporating Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   [ECF No. 21.] Following a preliminary hearing on April 19, the matters were also set for an evidentiary hearing. [ECF No. 29.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Petitioning Creditors then filed several amendments to the involuntary petition to add Stuhl [ECF No. 33], Qi Liu [ECF No. 36], Bruce Skeeter [ECF No. 37], Richard J. Tobiano [ECF No. 40], and Edward Kaleel [ECF No. 41] as additional petitioning creditors. Liu and Skeeter are employees of Mercury who are owed outstanding wages. Tobiano and Kaleel invested in Mercury. Also, Mercury supplemented the record with evidence of its ability to operate upon conversion to Chapter 11. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 57.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Taylor, O'Reilly, and Bennett testified at the evidentiary hearing regarding their involvement with the company and the financial crisis. Creech, Skeeter, and Liu also testified about their work for Mercury. The parties filed numerous proposed exhibits before the evidentiary hearing and the following are admitted without objection: Exhibits 2-5, 8-10, 12-14, 16-19, 21, 26, 30, 32, 34, 36-39, 42-46, 48-53, 59, and 63-67.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mercury and/or Petitioning Creditors moved to admit the following Exhibits, but admission was denied for the reasons stated on the record: Exhibits 7, 22, 31, and 35. The remaining Exhibits are not admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Request to Set Aside the Order for Relief and Dismiss the Case is Denied.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Mercury moves to set aside the Order for Relief and dismiss this case based on problems with the involuntary petition. Mercury alleges PSP, through O'Reilly, joined as a Petitioning Creditor in bad faith, and there is a bona fide dispute as to Bennett's claim. Mercury argued in its papers and at the evidentiary hearing that these defenses arise out of \u00a7 303 and it is\n   entitled to an award of fees, costs and damages pursuant to \u00a7 303(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Arguments of bad faith and the validity of a petitioning creditor's claim are ripe during the 21-day answer period allowed for objections to the involuntary petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) ; FED. R. BANKR. P. 1011(a) and (b). These issues were effectively decided in favor of Petitioning Creditors upon entry of the Order for Relief. \"An adjudication, and concomitantly an order for relief, is ... a conclusive determination of the debtor's status in bankruptcy, and\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   between the actual parties to the proceeding to all the facts and subsidiary questions of law on which it is based.\"\n   <em>\n    Mason v.

Mercury has not, however, presented sufficient grounds to set aside the Order for Relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Petitioning Creditors served the involuntary summons on Mercury Data Systems, ATTN: John Essex Taylor, Registered Agent, at two different Lexington addresses on February 8, 2018. [ECF Nos. 2 and 3.] Mercury did not contest service of process and service satisfies the Bankruptcy Rules. FED. R. BANKR. P. 1010(a), 7004(b). The 21-day answer period ended March 1, 2018, and Mercury did not timely respond to the involuntary petition.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) ; FED. R. BANKR. P. 1011(a), (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The failure to timely object to the involuntary petition thus required entry of the Order for Relief under \u00a7 303(h) and resolved all questions related to Mercury's status as a chapter 7 debtor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mason,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6126365,11342983\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/709/1313/\">\n    709 F.2d at 1315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, any defenses that Mercury could have raised in defense of the involuntary petition pursuant to \u00a7 303 are only considered if the Order for Relief is set aside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Mercury Did Not Prove the Requirements for Civil Rule 60(b)(2) Relief.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Mercury initially argued Civil Rule 60(b)(2) warrants setting aside the Order for Relief. Civil Rule 60(b)(2) allows relief from an order if there is \"newly discovered evidence that, with reasonable\n   diligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b).\" FED. R. CIV. P. 60(b)(2). \"The movant needs to show by clear and convincing evidence (1) that it exercised due diligence to obtain the evidence and (2) that the evidence is material,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , would have clearly resulted in a different outcome.\"\n   <em>\n    Luna v.

The evidence confirms Mercury knew of the existence of the facts supporting the alleged bad faith and claim dispute at least as early as October 2017 and did not act with diligence. The discussion of the proof related to Civil Rule 60(b)(6) herein verifies Mercury's concession and this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Mercury Did not Prove the Requirements for Civil Rule 60(b)(6) Relief.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Mercury argues that O'Reilly participated as a petitioning creditor in bad faith and Bennett does not have a claim, both of which justify relief under Civil Rule 60(b)(6). Civil Rule 60(b)(6) permits a court to grant relief from a final judgment or order \"for any other reason that justifies relief.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 60(b)(6). The subsections of Civil Rule 60(b) are mutually exclusive, so relief under Civil Rule 60(b)(6) is rarely granted.\n   <em>\n    Pioneer Inv. Serv. Co. v. Brunswick Assoc. Ltd.

Mercury argues that O'Reilly, acting on behalf of PSP, joined in the involuntary petition only as a means to obtain the TrakPoint source code. Proving an involuntary petition was filed in bad faith under \u00a7 303 by a preponderance of the evidence generally supports dismissal for an improper purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adell v.

Also, the equities must weigh in favor of Mercury. Mercury has not satisfied its burden because Taylor knew of the issues with O'Reilly and Bennett at least as early as October 2017. Further, Taylor did not act diligently after the involuntary petition was filed, so Mercury is not entitled to equitable relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Taylor Knew of the Alleged Bad Faith and Potential Objections to Bennett's Claim in 2017.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Taylor initially suspected O'Reilly was not acting in Mercury's best interest when he found out about the Live Plan in July 2017. Taylor refused to draft the plan, as promised in the Agreed Terms with Quantum. Taylor also testified that he did not direct O'Reilly to draft the Live Plan, did not authorize Bennett to help, and did not agree with the plan's contents when he reviewed it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Taylor believed his suspicion that O'Reilly was acting in his own self-interest, or that of the entities he represented, was confirmed when O'Reilly aggressively pushed to create sources of revenue for Mercury before the convertible notes came due. Despite Mercury's financial problems, Taylor believed that the proposals presented by O'Reilly and Codan in late September were only motivated by a desire to obtain Mercury's source codes for little or no compensation. Taylor went so far as to cease all communication with O'Reilly in late 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The evidence clearly shows Taylor knew about O'Reilly's alleged bad faith at least by October 2017. Taylor also found out about the alleged problems with Bennett's claims at the same time. Taylor testified that he learned Bennett exceeded the limits of her engagement in early October 2017 when he asked for and received copies of her invoices. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exh. 8, ECF No. 63-7.] Despite his knowledge of the problem, Bennett testified that Taylor never raised any issues with her invoices or directed her to cease communications with O'Reilly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Taylor's prior knowledge prevents any conclusion that Mercury was faultless in the failure to raise the bad faith argument or claim dispute before entry of the Order for Relief. Taylor attempted to provide excuses for his delay, but the excuses do not justify equitable relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Taylor Abandoned Mercury and Does Not Deserve Equitable Relief.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Mercury did not act with reasonable diligence to timely raise the disputed issues due to Taylor's own lack of attention and negligence. Taylor testified he did not know of the involuntary bankruptcy until he attempted to access Mercury's facility and discovered the locks were changed. The Chapter 7 Trustee was not appointed until after the Order for Relief, so Taylor was at least absent from the business premises from February 7 through March 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The evidence confirms Taylor began ignoring Mercury's financial needs at least by Spring 2017. Taylor agreed in April 2017 to clean up Mercury's financials and prepare the updated business plan pursuant to the Agreed Terms with Quantum. [Exh. 10, ECF No. 63-9.] O'Reilly testified, however, that Taylor told him he had to work on development of the TrakPoint system. So Taylor directed him to work with Bennett on the Live Plan. Bennett also testified that Taylor was always \"too busy\" when he was asked to work on Live Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Taylor completely abrogated his fiduciary duty to deal with the financial needs of Mercury in July 2017, when all parties agree Mercury ran out of money. Skeeter testified that Taylor's attendance at the office dwindled after Mercury stopped paying its bills in July, to the point Taylor only appeared once or twice a month. Incoming mail piled up as Taylor did not delegate something as simple as opening the mail on a daily basis. The evidence shows that Taylor continued to work on the TrakPoint system, but he checked out of the business operations of Mercury in mid-2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Taylor attempted to excuse his absence around the time of the filing of the involuntary petition by explaining he suffered from the flu for three weeks. If Taylor was truly that sick, he should have appointed an employee to review Mercury's mail as part of his responsibility as a fiduciary. But the evidence confirms Taylor was not dealing with the mail by the time he had the flu anyway. Also, the evidence shows Taylor worked remotely during the period he claims to have had the flu. [Exh. 17, ECF No. 63-16.] Taylor's assertion he could not get to the office for an additional two-week period because his car had a dead battery lacks any credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Taylor's lack of attention to the business affairs of Mercury does not show due diligence from the President and sole owner of a financially troubled entity. Mercury had a pre-existing obligation to raise the issues it claims as support for a Civil Rule 60(b)(6) action through a well-established procedure for involuntary proceedings created by the Bankruptcy Code and rules of procedure. This did not occur through Taylor's own inadvertence and negligence, so Mercury is not entitled to equitable relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The request to set aside the Order for Relief based on Civil Rule 60(b)(6) is denied. The conversion analysis herein also supports this conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Part II.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Request to Dismiss Under \u00a7 707(a) is Denied.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Mercury argues that it may still seek dismissal for bad faith under \u00a7 707(a), even if it may not pursue the bad faith claims under \u00a7 303.

Petitioning Creditors have shown these factors weigh against conversion and Mercury's evidence does not contradict the presentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Taylor Has Consistently Ignored His Financial Obligations.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The preceding discussion confirms Taylor began abrogating his management responsibilities in early 2017. Taylor allowed O'Reilly and Bennett to take on management duties after signing the Agreed Terms with Quantum. Bennett had full access to Mercury's financial system, even having authority to pay her own invoices. Taylor thereafter cast blame on O'Reilly and Bennett for Mercury's problems, ignoring his primary responsibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   For example, Taylor complained that O'Reilly pushed him to send product to Qatar and that increased Mercury's costs. But Taylor had the authority as the President of Mercury to refuse to do something he thought wasted resources. Taylor also said he determined Bennett worked outside the scope of her employment in October 2017, and Bennett's January 2018 invoice confirms this conclusion. But the evidence shows Taylor made no attempt to call off Bennett, despite his belief she was acting beyond the scope of her duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Taylor also did nothing to address Mercury's cash needs.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.A.3.ii. There is no evidence Taylor attempted to secure additional funds after Mercury ran out of money in July 2017. Instead, Taylor quit coming into the office on a regular basis and refused any attempts to find a new revenue source. Even if Taylor disagreed with O'Reilly's efforts, it is reasonable to expect the President and sole owner would do something to find additional resources to allow completion of the company's only viable product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Liu testified that Taylor told the employees the money problems would solve themselves if they completed the TrakPoint system. This is a myopic and misguided view of the duties of the sole manager of an entity. The evidence overwhelmingly shows Taylor refused to manage the company or address Mercury's financial needs, critical components of a successful reorganization in chapter 11. Taylor is not equipped to manage a debtor in a chapter 11 reorganization proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Failure to File Required Tax Returns Jeopardizes the Chances of a Successful Reorganization.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Taylor retained Bennett to prepare Mercury's 2016 tax returns, but she said that cannot occur until Mercury amends the 2015 tax returns. Bennett believes Mercury earned additional income in 2015 and more tax is due. Taylor testified that Bennett double counted 2014 income in the 2015 year. He said the mistake was obvious, but he could never persuade Bennett to change her view. Mercury did not present any evidence to support the alleged error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Taylor's failure to resolve the conflict with Bennett confirms his inability to operate Mercury. It is not credible to believe Bennett would maintain her position if the necessary changes were so simple or accurate. The more likely conclusion is Taylor refused to engage with Bennett on this issue, just like he failed to address other financial matters facing the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The failure to file tax returns has implications affecting reorganization beyond the obvious feasibility concerns involving the cost to complete the returns and exposure to additional tax, interest and penalties. The typical package used to solicit investors includes completed tax returns. It is also possible, and maybe likely, that any federal government contract will not issue to an entity that has not filed its tax returns. The lack of current tax returns show Mercury's plans for operation in chapter 11 are unrealistic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Mercury also failed to pay employee payroll taxes of at least $75,000.00. Ignoring a trust fund tax confirms Taylor's lack of financial sophistication and opens him up to liability that could interfere with his ability to manage Mercury in a chapter 11 proceeding. Taylor's failure to address Mercury's tax obligations emphasize why conversion is not appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Mercury's Projected Completion Date for the TrakPoint System is Not Realistic.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The 2016 business plan promised completion of the TrakPoint system to the next readiness level by July 2018. [Exh. 3, ECF No. 63-3.] Taylor projects only a one month delay in completion, until August 2018, in his summary reorganization plan. [Exh. 1, ECF No. 63-1.] But Taylor's testimony confirmed Mercury realized very few of the promises and projections in the 2016 business plan and the cumulative evidence presented confirms the original estimate was overly optimistic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Taylor also specifically identified the bankruptcy filing as a cause of the failure to meet the July 2018 completion deadline. The bankruptcy case is four months old, and Mercury missed an important April demonstration. These facts, and the failure of most of the 2016 predictions, mean Taylor's projection of only a one-month delay in completion of the TrakPoint system is unlikely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Mercury' Proposed Budget is Unrealistic.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The TrakPoint system requires substantial work to take it to the next readiness level. Taylor presented some possible avenues to finance additional development [Exh. 1, ECF No. 63-1], but he admitted additional funding is only possible when the next stage of development is complete. Despite Taylor's testimony to the contrary, the evidence presented makes it more likely than not that Mercury needs at least one additional employee to bring the TrakPoint system to the next level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Taylor tasked former employee Stuhl with designing hardware necessary to run tests for the TrakPoint system's development. Testimony from Skeeter and Liu credibly suggest a person with Stuhl's expertise is required. Taylor admitted that finding an employee with Stuhl's knowledge is difficult, which means it is not likely to happen in time to support Taylor's projections. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exh. 16, ECF No. 63-15, at 2.] Even if a person is found, the $23,190.00 remaining at the end of the 3-month budget leaves very little to support a salary for an additional employee, particularly since Mercury's budget does not address other necessary costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In addition to potential tax obligations, the proposed budget does not address reorganization costs. It is clear Taylor cannot adequately project financial needs and resources of a reorganized entity, but there is no fee for an accountant to assist with this task. The legal fees are inadequate to cover preparation of a disclosure statement and plan, so Mercury does not contemplate proposing a plan in the next three months. Again, the funds remaining at the end of the budget period do not\n   leave any room for additional, necessary costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Petitioning Creditors Have Satisfied Their Burden of Proof.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The cumulative evidence shows it is unlikely Mercury will complete TrakPoint's development to the next level by August 2018 or obtain additional funding. The funds remaining at the end of August do not leave room for error or delay, and are not sufficient to fund preparation of a reorganization plan. Petitioning Creditors have therefore shown that a successful reorganization is not feasible under the current circumstances pursuant to \u00a7 1129(a)(11) and Mercury cannot propose a confirmable plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   It is also very apparent that Taylor is not equipped to manage a debtor in a chapter 11 proceeding. Taylor's claim of inattention for over a month due to the flu and a failed car battery highlight his inability to understand his responsibility as the leader of Mercury. Taylor believes in his product, but he has unrealistic expectations that prevent extending credibility to his estimated time lines and financial assertions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Allowing Mercury to convert would further prejudice creditors, some of whom have gone unpaid since July 2017. Mercury has not offered sufficient evidence to counter Petitioning Creditor's evidence. The Motion to Convert is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Motion to Alter the Agreed Order to Review Software is Granted.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Chapter 7 Trustee and Petitioning Creditors entered into the Agreed Order to Review Software to allow Quantum to review Mercury's source codes. Mercury argues that O'Reilly's and Quantum's only goal is obtain the TrakPoint source code without compensating Mercury's estate. [ECF No. 14.] Petitioning Creditors supplemented the record with the Affidavits of O'Reilly and Guthrie White, the CEO of Quantum, to provide additional support for the Agreed Order to Review Software. [ECF Nos. 52 and 53.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The need for an order to permit inspection is not the usual course of action for a trustee, who liquidates assets in the ordinary course of duties.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Normally, a trustee would enter into a confidentiality agreement in this situation to protect the integrity of the asset. Counsel for Petitioning Creditors stated that a confidentiality agreement was drafted and ready for execution. But the Chapter 7 Trustee explained at the May 24 hearing that he required an order because of the developing dispute between Mercury and Petitioning Creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The course of the case has changed since entry of the Agreed Order to Review Software. Mercury and Taylor began to participate in the case and Petitioning Creditors filed the affidavits of O'Reilly and White in the record. Also, the three-day evidentiary hearing revealed substantial additional information that the Chapter 7 Trustee may need to consider before moving forward with any hardware or software review. Therefore, the Motion to Alter the Agreed Order is granted without prejudice to the right of any party to seek the same or similar relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
