Additionally, three declarations were filed in opposition to the Motion: Declaration of Trustee's Counsel (Dckt. 88), Declaration of Trustee (Dckt. 89), and Declaration of Counsel for Class Action Settlement (Dckt. 90). The Trustee filed documentary evidence opposing the Motion and asserting the interests of the bankruptcy estate in this case (\"Bankruptcy Estate\") in the claims, which included the Debtor's Schedules, Class Action Settlement documents, and the FDA July 2011 Urogynecologic Surgical Mesh Update (same as submitted by Debtor).

E.D. Cal. Gen. Order 182, 223. The Supreme Court provides in Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7001 that an adversary proceeding is necessary to determine the issues presented. In their respective declarations, counsel for Debtor (Declaration \u00b6 5, Dckt. 77) and counsel for the Chapter 7 Trustee (Declaration \u00b6 19, Dckt. 88) state that they and their clients consent to have these interests and rights adjudicated as a contested matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the February 1, 2018 hearing, the court addressed this procedural issue with the parties.

The Class Action lawsuit (Debtor was not the class action plaintiff, but subsequently determined to be a class member) has resulted in the claims and rights at issue having a value of $240,000.00-the \"Class Action Settlement Proceeds\" distribution for Debtor's claim. Debtor has now claimed an exemption of $240,000.00 pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 704.140 in the Class Action Settlement Proceeds on Amended Schedule C. Dckt. 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Debtor's bankruptcy case was filed on February 6, 2009, with Debtor receiving her discharge on May 19, 2009 (Dckt. 31). Debtor relates that she had a transvaginal mesh patch implanted on August 22, 2003 (five and one-half years prior to the bankruptcy case being filed), which resulted in subsequent medical issues, leading to\n   Debtor pursuing her rights to the class action recovery in 2015. Dckt. 78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Debtor argues that she did not \"know\" about any \"legal claim\" that was available to her until 2014, and as such, the claim was not \"sufficiently rooted\" in her prepetition past such that it would be an interest of the Bankruptcy Estate. Debtor argues that her claim did not accrue until 2014 when she learned of a United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") warning and when she subsequently that year learned about being able to sue the manufacturer of her transvaginal mesh patch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Therefore, Debtor argues that the settlement proceeds are not part of the Bankruptcy Estate in this case and requests that the court issue an order holding the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Debtor's Authorities and Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Debtor's legal basis for this argument begins with citing to\n   <em>\n    Butner v.

Specifically, Debtor asserts that the federal court shall look to state law to determine when a claim \"accrues,\" and that the property of the bankruptcy estate pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   consists only of the interests of Debtor as of the commencement of the bankruptcy case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Focusing on the assertion that as of the commencement of the bankruptcy case no claim had \"accrued\" for Debtor, and therefore no claim could exist for purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) to make it property of the Bankruptcy Estate, Debtor directs the court to California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 312, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00a7 312. Commencement of civil actions\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Civil actions, without exception, can only be commenced within the periods prescribed in this title, after the cause of action shall have accrued, unless where, in special cases, a different limitation is prescribed by statute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As addressed at the hearing, this is the general rule governing civil actions requiring them to be timely prosecuted. Debtor focuses on the use of the word \"accrued\" in this provision setting forth the general rule against the presenting of stale claims arising under California law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Debtor's discussion continues, directing the court to the proposition that a cause of action does not accrue (for purposes of the running of the statute of limitations on bringing an action) until all of the elements of the claim exist. Debtor directs the court to\n   <em>\n    Norgart v.

Reply, Dckt. 94. Debtor argues that after consulting with an attorney in 2005 about the device, she was informed by that attorney that there was no factual or legal basis to believe that the mesh implant was defective at that time, meaning that she had no knowledge of a viable claim. Therefore, because Debtor asserts she did not know of a claim, then no claim could have existed when this case was filed because the running of the statute of limitations was tolled under the Delayed Discovery Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Debtor agrees with the Chapter 7 Trustee's reading of\n   <em>\n    In re Goldstein\n   </em>\n   that the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel \"found that if a claim could have been [brought], it has accrued.\" Debtor contends that no claim could have been brought because she did not know she had a claim when the bankruptcy case was filed. Debtor believes that it is the existence of the July 2011 FDA Update that caused her to \"know\" of a claim, thus the claim cannot exist before July 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   It appears that Debtor asserts an \"all for me and nothing for you\" position, contending that all of the claims and rights, from which the Class Action Settlement Proceeds flow, are either: (1) Debtor's post-petition property because Debtor asserts that she did not have \"knowledge\" of such rights or possible claim; or (2) Bankruptcy Estate Property if the claims existed prepetition. As presented by Debtor, the existence or non-existence of the claim, rights, and Class Action Settlement Proceeds turns on the Debtor's personal, non-legal, \"knowledge\" of the law and the existence of such existing, enforceable rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    CHAPTER 7 TRUSTEE's OPPOSITION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Michael McGranahan (the \"Chapter 7 Trustee\") filed an opposition on January 17, 2018. Dckt. 86. The Chapter 7 Trustee alleges that determination of whether the settlement proceeds are property of the estate will depend on the date Debtor's claim accrued.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Chapter 7 Trustee concurs that determination of the interests in the claim is a matter of state law, not federal law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:18-19 (citing\n   <em>\n    Goldstein v.

November 14, 2005, excision of mesh pieces and clips.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Chapter 7 Trustee argues that Debtor knew or suspected that she had a claim around 2005 when she first consulted an attorney.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit to Amended Schedule B, Dckt. 54 (stating that \"wife consulted an attorney regarding a possible claim\" around 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Thus, the Chapter 7 Trustee would appear to cede to Debtor that the only issue being presented to the court in determining the interests in the claim for the prepetition medical treatment with the Device\n   is when it \"accrues\" for purposes of computing the (procedural) statute of limitations under California law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Chapter 7 Trustee relies heavily on the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Goldstein v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (In re Goldstein)\n   </em>\n   , for a similar legal scenario about a legal claim becoming available post-petition based on prepetition facts. In that case, the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel rejected the debtor's contention that his claim did not accrue until post-petition when he learned certain facts. Instead, the Panel focused on California law holding that accrual happens \"upon the occurrence of the last element essential for the cause of action.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4019291\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/526/13/#p21\">\n    526 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   21 (citing\n   <em>\n    Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. v.

Dckt. 87. He argues that Exhibit A (FDA safety notice) has been introduced without any evidentiary basis and has not been properly authenticated in violation of Federal Rule of Evidence 901. Further, the Chapter 7 Trustee argues that Debtor is not a medical specialist or expert who can introduce the FDA safety notice as part of her expert opinion by Federal Rules of Evidence 702 through 706. He also argues that the document is hearsay under Federal Rule of Evidence 801 to which no exception applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In her Declaration, Debtor bases her testimony on personal, first-hand knowledge and does not present herself as an expert witness.

Debtor does not give any other reference to the exhibit, not even saying that she read it and learned about any defect. Instead, Debtor testifies that she learned about the mesh implant defect \"when [she] was contacted by an attorney in 2014 about representing [her] regarding any potential claim [she] had.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:14.5-15.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Debtor's statements are not in the form of authenticating evidence. She does not even state that she is the one who obtained a copy the FDA safety notice provided as an exhibit. She appears to allege that the statements within the report are true (hearsay), but her counsel does not present any argument in the Motion for a hearsay exception to apply. Even after the Chapter 7 Trustee filed his Objection, Debtor and her counsel have not responded. The court finds that Debtor's Exhibit A has not been properly authenticated in violation of Federal Rule of Evidence 901, and it contains hearsay statements that have not been presented under an exception to Federal Rule of Evidence 801. The court does not address the Exhibit's admissibility under Federal Rules of Evidence 702 through 706 because Debtor does not hold herself out as an expert witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Objection to Exhibit A is sustained and Debtor's Exhibit A is not admitted into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   However, the Trustee has submitted the same July 11, 2011 FDA Update on Safety and Effectiveness of Transvaginal Placement for Pelvic Organ Prolapse.

This Update begins with an Executive Summary which includes the following information:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    In October 2008\n   </strong>\n   , the FDA issued a Public Health Notification (PHN)\n   <strong>\n    to inform\n   </strong>\n   clinicians and\n   <strong>\n    patients of adverse events related to\n   </strong>\n   urogynecologic\n   <strong>\n    use of surgical mesh\n   </strong>\n   , and to provide recommendations on how to mitigate risks and how to counsel patients. Following the PHN, the FDA continued to monitor the outcomes of urogynecologic use of surgical mesh. A search of the FDA's Manufacturer and User Device Experience (MAUDE) database from the last 3 years (January 1, 2008-December 31, 2010), identified 2,874 Medical Device Reports (MDRs) for urogynecologic surgical meshes, including reports of injury, death, and malfunctions. Among the 2,874 reports, 1,503 were associated with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) repairs, and 1,371 were associated with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) repairs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   The FDA also conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature to learn more about the safety and effectiveness of POP and SUI using surgical mesh. The FDA determined that (1) serious adverse events are NOT rare, contrary to what was stated in the 2008\n   <em>\n    PHN\n   </em>\n   , and (2) transvaginally placed mesh in POP repair does NOT conclusively improve clinical outcomes over traditional non-mesh repair.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   The FDA is providing this update to advise the public and the medical community of complications related to transvaginal POP repair with mesh. The FDA plans to convene an advisory panel meeting of outside experts in September 2011 to discuss these findings and the types of clinical studies necessary to better assess the risks and benefits of using mesh to treat POP and SUI.

The bankruptcy court approved a settlement between Ross and the trustee for the estate's asserted rights in certain real property.

Ross asserted that she had the procedure in 1999, was unaware of any claim when she filed bankruptcy in 2006, and did not learn of a possible claim until after the 2011 FDA Update was issued. Thus, Ross asserted that no claim existed to be property of the bankruptcy estate when her bankruptcy case was filed in 2005. However, as stated in the\n   <em>\n    Mendelsohn\n   </em>\n   Decision, no such claims existed to become property of the estate.

The \"accrual\" does not destroy or constitute a novation of the rights subject to a condition subsequent. Neither party has directed the court to any statute which would delay Debtor having acquired the rights, only legal principles that the (procedural) statute of limitations would not begin to run under the Delayed Discovery Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    The Claims of Debtor and Class Action Settlement Proceeds Are Property of the Bankruptcy Estate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Contrasted to the debtor in\n   <em>\n    Mendelsohn\n   </em>\n   for which there was no prepetition injury, Debtor now before the court has claims and product liability rights not merely \"rooted\" in the prepetition period, but which germinated, sprouted, grew, blossomed, and became anchored prepetition. Debtor had, and the Bankruptcy Estate acquired, the products liability claim that existed prepetition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The Bankruptcy Code requires only that the legal interest existed at the commencement of the case.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The court has noted that all of the essential elements for a successful products liability case existed for Debtor during the mid-2000s. Debtor may not have realized that she had a valid claim, but the claim (the legal interest) existed nonetheless. That she did not act upon her claim until after this case had closed initially does not prevent her prepetition claim and rights, and the Class Action Settlement Proceeds thereof, from being part of the Estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The court determines and shall issue a judgment (order form, Fed.

Further, the\n    <em>\n     existence of an injury was a necessary element of there being a claim\n    </em>\n    . Therefore, there could have been no claim in existence at the time the case was filed for it to become property of the bankruptcy estate because there was no injury. In substance, it appears that the debtor in\n    <em>\n     Mendelsohn\n    </em>\n    was agreeing to settle any potential future claims which might arise, there being no actual injury upon which any present claim could have been based.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    It appears that the court in\n    <em>\n     Mendelsohn\n    </em>\n    conflates the word \"accrues,\" which is the terminology used in the California Statute of limitations, with the word \"acquires,\" as the later word is used to describe when all of the necessary elements have occurred for someone to have obtained rights and a claim against another.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    The court in\n    <em>\n     Mendelsohn\n    </em>\n    considers, notwithstanding there being no injury and no claim that could have existed as of the commencement of the\n    <em>\n     Ross\n    </em>\n    bankruptcy case, whether the claim was so sufficiently rooted in past event that it would be property of the estate. That court stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n    Here, appellee's pre-bankruptcy past did not create an interest that manifested itself in the settlement agreement. Instead, it was the\n    <strong>\n     combination of an event that occurred in her pre-bankruptcy past\n    </strong>\n    (the implantation of the medical device)\n    <strong>\n     and certain post-bankruptcy events\n    </strong>\n    (the FDA issued an advisory opinion regarding possible defects with the medical device; appellee became aware of the possible defects)\n    <strong>\n     that created the interest that resulted in the settlement proceeds\n    </strong>\n    . Without the post-bankruptcy events,\n    <strong>\n     the pre-bankruptcy event would be rendered meaningless insofar as plaintiff's ability to obtain settlement proceeds\n    </strong>\n    is concerned. Thus, under the particular facts of this case, it simply cannot be said that her interest was \"sufficiently rooted in the pre-bankruptcy past\" to render the settlement proceeds property of the bankruptcy estate.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 525-526 (emphasis added). Here the \"knowledge\" of the \"possible\" future \"injury\" that might possibly manifest itself was the basis for Ross' claim in\n    <em>\n     Mendelsohn\n    </em>\n    -there being no injury which had occurred or manifested itself as of the bankruptcy filing or even at the time of the settlement upon which any prepetition claim could be based. Ross was settling her possible future injuries that might occur, and the worry that such future injuries might occur, at which time a future claim would arise.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    For the claims now before this court, the evidence clearly shows that substantial injuries were suffered by Debtor prepetition. The Debtor acquired the prepetition claim which became property of the bankruptcy estate. Debtor now seeks to recover the damages for the prepetition injuries exclusively for herself.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
