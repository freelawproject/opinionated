District and bankruptcy courts outside the Ninth Circuit that have confronted the question all agree that the interplay between these statutes is confusing but disagree on the answer to the question.

In this appeal, the Court reviews the Memorandum Decision of Chief Judge Laura S.

She was represented by the Doan Law Firm throughout her bankruptcy proceedings and in this instant appeal. In her bankruptcy schedules, Mather stated an intention to reaffirm a 2014 Toyota RAV4 (\"Vehicle\") as a secured debt. AR 250. Her schedules erroneously described Toyota as a lender with a claim secured by a lien against the vehicle, when in actuality Toyota was the lessor of the Vehicle. As such, Mather should have completed part 2 of the Statement of Intention which requires specificity as to her intention to assume the lease of the Vehicle.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6118456\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/109/943/#p946\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Pursuant to Section 365(d)(1), Ms. Mather's chapter 7 trustee had the right to assume the Lease during the first 60 days of the bankruptcy case, but did not do so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6118456\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/109/943/#p946\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As of October 31, 2016, the Vehicle was not an asset of the estate and the automatic stay as to the vehicle was terminated pursuant to Section 365(p)(1). Section 365(p)(2) provides that where a trustee fails to timely assume a lease, a debtor has the right to attempt assumption by advising her lessor \"in writing\" of her desire to assume the lease.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20365\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (p)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mather did not send any \"writing\" to Toyota. However, on September 8, 2016, she called Toyota and requested that she be allowed to continue payments to retain the vehicle. AR 251. Toyota's agent, National Bankruptcy Services LLC (\"NBS\") advised Mather that she needed to assume the lease to retain the vehicle. On September 16, 2016, the NBS prepared an assumption agreement and sent it to Mather's attorney at the Doan Law Firm. Mather, who was traveling and attempting a marital reconciliation, did not immediately execute the Lease Assumption Agreement until December 5, 2016. AR 252 Despite the fact that this may have been untimely under \u00a7 365(p)(2)(B), Toyota accepted her request for assumption and acknowledged\n   receipt of the executed document on December 6, 2016.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20365\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mather received her discharge on December 6, 2016, and her case closed on December 12, 2016.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20365\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While Mather was not in default on the lease when she entered bankruptcy and made payments during the bankruptcy proceedings, in November 2016 she stopped lease payments despite the execution of the Lease Assumption Agreement in December. Toyota does not dispute that it engaged in collection activity between December 20, 2016 through approximately February 25, 2017.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20365\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The bankruptcy judge observed that Mather provided hearsay testimony that Toyota had called her parent's home while she was traveling prior to her discharge, but that there was no record of any such calls, and particularly that there was no evidence that they related to collection attempts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 2, 2017, Debtor surrendered the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20365\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mather advised Toyota that her bankruptcy precluded collection attempts and that her assumption of the Lease was ineffective as it was not coupled with reaffirmation. On February 25, 2017, Plaintiff, through the Doan Law Firm, requested an Order to Show Cause re: Violation of the Automatic Stay and Violation of the Plan Discharge. AR 253. In that request, Mather alleged significant emotional distress and requested over $50,000 in compensatory and punitive damages, remedial or coercive sanctions as appropriate, and attorneys' fees. The Bankruptcy Court issued the OSC, which was followed by several rounds of briefing and two hearings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20365\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On November 16, 2017, the bankruptcy court issued its Memorandum Decision. On November 27, 2017, Mather filed her Notice of Appeal from the bankruptcy court, and elected to have its appeal heard by the United States District Court for the Southern District of California instead of the Ninth Circuit's Bankruptcy Appellate Panel. Dkt. No. 1 at 2. Appellant filed their Opening Brief on February 1, 2018. Dkt. No. 9. Appellee filed it Responsive Brief on March 12, 2018. Dkt. No. 15. Appellant filed a Reply on March 26, 2018. Dkt. No. 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The instant bankruptcy appeal addresses three issues: (1) whether Appellant waived a challenge to the bankruptcy judge's order that Toyota did not violate the automatic stay; (2) whether a Section 365(p) lease assumption must always be coupled with a judicially approved Section 524(c) reaffirmation for personal liability to attach post-discharge; and (3) whether Mather actually assumed the lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Waiver of any Argument Challenging that Toyota Did Not Violate the Automatic Stay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Chief Judge Taylor found that Toyota did not violate the automatic stay as the automatic stay had already terminated by the time Toyota commenced collection activities. AR 254. The bankruptcy court found that there was limited hearsay evidence that Toyota may have made calls to Mather between November 9, 2016 and December 12, 2016, but that this evidence was not conclusive and that the calls could have been unrelated to collection activities, such as for Mather's pending Lease assumption or the recovery of the Vehicle.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20365\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Next, the court found that Toyota's transmission to Mather of a lease assumption agreement was not a stay violation because it was requested from the debtor and because it had been transmitted only to the Doan Law Firm and not Mather directly. AR 255.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Appellees contend as a threshold matter that Mather has waived any claim\n   that Toyota violated the automatic stay by failing to challenge this issue on appeal. The Court agrees. Appellant did not raise this issue in her Opening or Reply Briefs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 9, 16. Moreover, Appellant solely framed the \"Issue Presented\" in this case as \"[d]oes 11 USC 365(p) override the discharge protections of 11 USC 524 ?\" Dkt. No. 9 at 1. Accordingly, the Court finds that to the extent Appellant sought to challenge the bankruptcy court's finding that Toyota did not violate the automatic stay, Appellant has waived that argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Meehan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187450,12137916\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/659/437/\">\n    659 F.

If the trustee did not exercise the right of assumption as to a particular lease, a chapter 7 debtor was free to enter into a reaffirmation agreement as to his or her obligations under the lease (with lessor approval), but \"assumption\" was not an option for the chapter 7 debtor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Creighton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3803438\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/427/24/#p25\">\n    427 B.R. 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 25 (Bankr.

Requiring compliance with reaffirmation procedures renders Congress's choice to add \u00a7 365(p)(2) effectively meaningless-a debtor simply could submit a reaffirmation agreement and forego the \u00a7 365(p)(2) process entirely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Bailly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5771290\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/522/711/#p716\">\n    522 B.R. at 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Further, requiring reaffirmation leads to an anomalous result in that a lessor could wind up being\n   <em>\n    bound\n   </em>\n   by a lease assumption-through 365(p) which does not require judicial approval-but the reaffirmation-which does require judicial approval-could be denied by the court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bailly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5771290\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/522/711/#p716\">\n    522 B.R. at 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The bankruptcy judge bolstered this argument by reference to the difference in economics between a true lease and a secured transaction.

In contrast, a lessor agrees to make an asset available for possession and use in exchange for periodic payments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20213.2\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 213.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1)-(2). The economic value of, for example, a leased car is \"calculated based on its ability to generate a stream of income in exchange for use and, typically, the declining value of the car through normal use.\" Consequently, giving the car back to the lessor does not equate into compensation for missed rental income. AR 264, pg. 18. The bankruptcy judge reasoned that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Once the economics of a vehicle lease are considered squarely, it is clear that an assumption that does not create personal liability for ongoing lease payments gives the lessor nothing; the lessor does not get realizable compensation for a debtor's use of the leased vehicle or for the decline in vehicle value while a debtor uses the car. The argument renders \u00a7 365(p)(2) nonsensical.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   This reasoning is persuasive. Section 365(p) is meant to allow the lessee to retain assumption of the leased asset. To do so, the lessor necessarily must retain a right to go after the lessee in personal liability, otherwise there would be no incentive to enter into a 365(p) assumption with the lessee. This sentiment was echoed by the Court in\n   <em>\n    In re Garaux\n   </em>\n   which ultimately held that reaffirmation was required, but wisely observed that its ruling would \"render much of \u00a7 365(p) meaningless\" because \"it is unlikely that creditors will accept a lease assumption that does not revive a debtor's liability, the requirements of Section 524(c) will supplant those of \u00a7 365(p).\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%205193779\">\n    2012 WL 5193779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The bankruptcy judge also raised another timing issue. Reaffirmation must take place before a discharge pursuant to Section 524(c)(1). In contrast, Section 365(p)(2) is not so limited and the negotiation of a Section 365(p)(2) assumption can take place after a discharge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20365\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (p)(2)(C) (\"The stay under section 362 and the injunction under section 524(a)(2) shall not be violated by notification of the debtor and negotiation of cure under this subsection.\"). As such, the court's reasoning-\"If successful reaffirmation must precede discharge, it makes no sense to allow negotiation of a \u00a7 365(p)(2) assumption after discharge if it is valid only if coupled with a reaffirmation that is an impossibility\"-is persuasive and shows a further nonsensical result that results from requiring reaffirmation.

According to Chief Judge Taylor, the \"either\" before the options to retain the property and the \"or\" between the description of 524(c) reaffirmation and Section 365(p) assumption provides a clear indication that reaffirmation and assumption are independent actions. To support this analysis, the bankruptcy court cited to\n   <em>\n    In re Dumont\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4122803,5756044\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/581/1104/\">\n    581 F.3d 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1113-14 (9th Cir. 2009) which stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   As before, the debtor must \"file timely any statement of intention required under section 521(a)(2).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4122803,5756044\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/581/1104/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But now, he must \"indicate in such statement that\" he will do one of four things: surrender,\n   redeem, reaffirm, or assume an unexpired lease.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4122803,5756044\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/581/1104/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To be specific, he must indicate \"either\" surrender \"or\" retention; if he chooses the latter, he must indicate \"either\" redemption, reaffirmation, \"or\" assumption.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4122803,5756044\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/581/1104/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Either\" means \"[t]he one or the other.\" American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 572 (4th ed. 2000).

However, the \"either ... or\" disjunction has always meant that one of the listed alternatives must be satisfied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Court agrees that the use of the disjunctive is indicative of independent actions that can take place without each other. If retention is chosen, the statute indicates that reaffirmation \"or\" assumption are viable options.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dumont\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4122803,5756044\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/581/1104/\">\n    581 F.3d at 1113-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (he must indicate 'either' reaffirmation, 'or' assumption.). If one were to view assumption and reaffirmation to be bound together, then the bankruptcy code and Ninth Circuit would have stated reaffirmation \"and\" assumption, to indicate the interdependence between the two sections. The Court finds that the use of the disjunctive in Section 362(h) is a further statutory reason to dispense with a requirement for reaffirmation of a Section 365(p) lease agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Judicial Supervision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Chief Judge Taylor made two findings regarding judicial supervision: (1) that the bankruptcy code does not require close judicial supervision of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   reaffirmations and (2) the absence of Court approval of Section 365(p)(2) lease assumption does not require a different conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   First, the bankruptcy court found that the Bankruptcy Code does not require close judicial supervision of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   reaffirmations. Consequently, it was not incongruous to assume that Congress would allow personal property lease assumptions without judicial supervision. AR 259. At oral argument before the bankruptcy court, Mather conceded that Congress did not take a consistent position that judicial supervision is\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   required when a debtor converts a pre-petition obligation to a post-petition debt. One example of this inconsistency is that Congress does not require judicial supervision when a pro se consumer debtor assumes a consumer loan secured by real property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20524\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(6)(B) (Subparagraph (A), which requires judicial approval, \"shall not apply to the extent that such debt is a consumer debt secured by real property\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The presence of one part of Section 524 that does not require judicial approval is indicative of congressional willingness to not\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   require reaffirmation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Second, Chief Judge Taylor also found that the absence of court approval for Section 365(p) lease assumptions did not compel a different conclusion. AR 264. To begin, the court reasoned that reaffirmation does not always require judicial oversight. Next, the bankruptcy court distinguished Section 365(p) assumptions, which creates obligations of the\n   <em>\n    debtor\n   </em>\n   and is generally payable from assets not generally available to pre-petition creditors, from Section 365(a) assumptions-which require court\n   approval. The court reasoned that Section 365(a) assumptions merited judicial involvement because they involved the estate, debtor in possession, chapter 13 debtor, or reorganized debtor and have a \"direct impact on the availability of assets to pay other creditors, particularly in a chapter 7 context.\" AR 264. Finally, the bankruptcy court observed that Section 365(b) provides non-debtor parties with the right for cure and adequate assurance, but that Section 365(p) gives the lessor the unilateral right to decide whether to allow assumption and establish conditions, thus judicial oversight of a lessor's unilateral right was not warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   This conclusion is supported by the Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    In re Perlman\n   </em>\n   concluding that Court has \"no judicial role to play in \u00a7 365(p)(2) lease assumption.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5729827\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/468/437/#p439\">\n    468 B.R. at 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There, criticizing the practice of filing Section 365(p)(2) lease assumption agreements as \"reaffirmation agreements\" under Section 524, the court concluded that doing so wasted the \"time and resources\" of the court and the parties by implicating unnecessary hearings.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5729827\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/468/437/#p439\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court finds this reasoning to be persuasive and in line with the conclusion that Section 365(p) leases do not require judicial approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Specific Provisions Control\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The bankruptcy judge found that the specific provisions of Section 365(p)\"arguably\" controlled over the general provisions of Section 524.

The bankruptcy court viewed Section 365 as the \"more specific provision\" because it deals specifically with personal property leases. In contrast, Section 524(c) is a broader statute addressing only the impact of discharge. The Court agrees that Section 365(p) is a more specific provision, but observes that \"reasonable minds can differ as to which statute is more specific.\" AR 258. As Mather points out, Section 524 may actually contain more procedural steps and more words than that required in Section 365(p). Dkt. No. 16 (observing that Section 524 -which contains 2,591 words-is over twenty times longer than Section 365(p) ). Nevertheless, Section 365(p) deals with a narrower issue-assumption of leases when a trustee does not seek to assume-than Section 524 which applies more generally to post-discharge liabilities. Accordingly, the Court finds that Section 365(p) is a more specific provision than Section 524(c) and that this canon of construction weighs in favor of not requiring reaffirmation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    6. BAPCPA Amendments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Chief Judge Taylor held that the fact that Congress did not require reaffirmation disclosures relevant to consumer personal property lease transactions when it significantly amended the reaffirmation disclosure provisions of Section 524(k) strongly suggests that Congress did not intend to require a debtor to both assume a lease under Section 365(p)(2) and also obtain reaffirmation under Section 524. AR 261. The bankruptcy court observed that BAPCPA simultaneously added both Section 365(p) and Section 524(k),\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   which outlines\n   the detailed disclosures required for reaffirmation. In doing so, the court observed that the vast majority of Section 524(k)'s provisions applied only as to secured transactions, rather than personal property leases.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20524\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k)(2)-(3)(E) (requiring conspicuous disclosure of an \"annual percentage rate\"); 11 U.S.C. 524(k)(3)(E)(i)-(ii) (referencing \"credit\" and \"open end credit plan\" as defined in Section 103 of the Truth in Lending Act).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Next, the bankruptcy court observed that the TILA \"requires specific disclosures in relation to consumer personal property leases that are the counterpart to those required in consumer credit transactions. For example, it requires detailed disclosure about liabilities at lease termination ... But no such disclosures were required by BAPCPA and new \u00a7 524(k)(1).\" AR 261. Instead, the BAPCPA amendments only reference credit transactions portions of the Truth in Lending Act and do not reference provisions related to a consumer lease transaction. Consequently, the bankruptcy court reasoned that the fact that Congress did not require reaffirmation disclosures relevant to consumer personal property lease transactions when it amended Section 524(k) in BAPCPA suggests that Congress did not intend to require that a debtor both assume a lease under Section 365(p)(2) and obtain reaffirmation under Section 524.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20524\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To Chief Judge Taylor, it was \"illogical to assume that Congress would require reaffirmation in a personal property lease assumption situation yet require not a single disclosure relevant to a consumer lease beyond the amount assumed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20524\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   This reasoning is supportive, to a limited extent, of a rule not requiring reaffirmation. As the bankruptcy court acknowledged, Section 524(k)'s requirement to disclose could broadly be applied in the lease context.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Creighton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3803438\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/427/24/#p25\">\n    427 B.R. at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting substantially similar argument and concluding that \"[t]he disclosures required by \u00a7 524(k) are flexible enough to accommodate a wide variety of debts.\"). Moreover, the Court does not view the lack of a reference to TILA's consumer lease transaction provisions in the BAPCPA disclosure amendments to significantly support that Congress did not intend to require reaffirmation in this context. Accordingly, this portion of the bankruptcy court's decision is only somewhat persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    7. Coherent Statutory Scheme\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The bankruptcy court held that it was \"not inconsistent with anything in the Bankruptcy Code to assume that Congress would create more than one method for allowing claims to survive discharge\" as the bankruptcy code (1) identifies numerous claims that are never dischargeable; (2) allows creditors under certain circumstances to obtain a determination that a particular claim is not appropriate for discharge; (3) Section 365 involves a method to convert dischargeable executory contract claims into non-dischargeable post-petition claims through assumption. AR 258. This follows from the canon of construction to construe statutory language as a whole.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Duparquet Huot &amp; Moneuse Co. v.

Doing so may somewhat threaten the \"fresh start\" being offered by the bankruptcy proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   On the other hand, the Court must also consider the impact of requiring reaffirmation. Doing so renders the Section 365(p) statutory process superfluous-If Congress had intended to require reaffirmation then it could have simply required the negotiation and assumption process of Section 365(p) to be a part of the reaffirmation procedures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Bailly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5771290\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/522/711/#p716\">\n    522 B.R. at 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, requiring reaffirmation could lead to strange results.

In reaching this conclusion, the Court finds particularly persuasive that: (1) Section 365(p) is rendered superfluous by requiring reaffirmation; (2) requiring reaffirmation leads to anomalous results; (3) Section 362(h)'s use of the disjunctive indicates that assumption and reaffirmation are independent actions; (4) judicial supervision is not required of all reaffirmations and the lack of judicial approval makes sense in the context of the Section 365(p) which allows a lessor the power to choose whether to allow assumption; and (5) Section 365(p) is more specific than Section 524(c). The Court finds less compelling (1) that amendments to BAPCPA delineate between secured transactions and lease assumptions and (2) that the bankruptcy scheme as a coherent whole supports this conclusion. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Section 524(c) reaffirmation is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   required for a Section 365(p) lease to be enforced post-discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

Appellant argues that the Lease Assumption Agreement did not comply with writing and time requirements that she asserts are \"mandatory\" under 365(p)(2). Dkt. No. 9 at 30. Appellant asserts that it was error for the bankruptcy court to ignore (1) the requirement for Mather to have provided an initial writing requesting lease assumption under 365(p)(2)(A) and (2) that Mather acted on December 5, 2016 well past the thirty day requirement established in 365(p)(2)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Chief Judge Taylor found that although there was \"arguably\" a written notification based on Mather's indication in her statement of intention that she intended to enter into a reaffirmation agreement with Toyota, the court did not find that sufficient to constitute a written notification regarding assumption of leases within the meaning of \u00a7 365(p)(2)(A). AR 269. However, the bankruptcy court concluded that written notification was \"not absolutely required\" as Toyota had the right to waive the writing requirement. AR 269-270.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Section 365(p)(2) provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    (A)\n   </strong>\n   If the debtor in a case under chapter 7 is an individual, the debtor may notify the creditor in writing\n   that the debtor desires to assume the lease.

E.D.N.Y. 2011), as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   In what some refer to as a \"handshake,\" the debtor must first offer in writing to the lessor\n   <sup>\n    7\n   </sup>\n   to assume the lease obligations, the timing of which is not established by the Bankruptcy Code or Rules. The lessor then must decide whether to accept such offer, the timing of which is also not specified. If the lessor determines that it is willing to allow the debtor to assume the lease, it will then notify the debtor of this decision, and may condition such assumption on cure of any outstanding defaults on terms set by the contract. Section 365(p) does not provide that the lessor is under any obligation to accept the debtor's offer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   Once the debtor has notified the lessor of its desire to assume the lease under Section 365(p)(2)(A), Section 365(p)(2)(C) provides the lessor with a safe harbor to notify debtor it has accepted the request to assume the lease and to negotiate a cure, without violating either the automatic stay of Section 362 or the discharge injunction under Section 524(a)(2). The third and final step required by the statute is that a writing between the lessor and the debtor be signed to memorialize the terms of the lease assumption.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <em>\n    In re Ebbrecht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3760273\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/451/241/#p245\">\n    451 B.R. 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 244-45 (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 2011) (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   As the bankruptcy court found, the written notification requirement accomplishes three distinct purposes: (1) alert the lessor that debtor is interested in an assumption-the \"handshake\"; (2) provides the lessor with safe harbor protections under Section 365(p)(2)(C) so that the lessor may enter into negotiations without violating the automatic stay or discharge order; and (3) a filed written statement forestalls the termination of an automatic stay under Section 362(h). AR 269. Chief Judge Taylor found that the writing requirement was only relevant to be a passport to safe harbor and a method to preserve the automatic stay, and was not an absolute requirement for assumption to occur. Consequently, the lessor negotiated at its own risk in the event that a debtor denied initiating the procedure or extending the handshake and could waive this requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%202731191\">\n    2016 WL 2731191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (allowing waiver of procedural requirements of Section 365(p) where lease assumption was eventually entered into by both parties). The Court agrees that in a case where an assumption agreement is ultimately signed, the lack of a written notification does not invalidate it, and that Toyota had the right to waive the requirement of a writing in the lease negotiation process. AR 270.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Next, the bankruptcy court concluded that the lease was properly assumed despite the fact that Mather did not notify Toyota in writing that the lease was assumed within 30 days as required by Section 365(p)(2)(B). Section 365(p)(2) requires that the debtor notify the lessor in writing that \"the lease is assumed no later than 30 days after the lessor notifies the debtor that it is willing to have the lease assumed. The Court affirms this conclusion because the 30-day period is for the benefit of the lessor and can be waived by the lessor if it so chooses to engage in the assumption.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

As the bankruptcy court observed, \"the policy of allowing a debtor to assume a personal property lease obligation, particularly for something as critical as an automobile, is not well served if assumption is impossible in the absence of strict compliance with the writing and timing requirements.\" AR 270. Notably, while the debtor loses the right to compel lease assumption if the lease is not assumed timely, the lessor takes on a risk when it proceeds with an assumption in the absence of an oral request. Where both lessor and debtor remain willing to proceed on an oral request for assumption, and where the lessor remains willing to allow assumption after 30 days, it does not make sense to establish strict requirements with the statute that would deprive the debtor of the opportunity to assume. Accordingly, as a policy matter, it makes sense to allow Toyota to waive the written notification and timing requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMS\n   </strong>\n   the bankruptcy court determinations that Toyota obtained a valid lease assumption because the written notification and the 30-day requirement could be waived by Toyota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   For the reasons stated above, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the November 16, 2017 Bankruptcy Court Order is\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    The Court observes that Appellants' brief refers to Melissa Carin Mather Bobka as \"Mather\" and will accordingly adopt this shorthand.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    AR refers to the Appellate Record in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    The facts as stated are largely taken from the Memorandum Decision of the Bankruptcy Judge.
