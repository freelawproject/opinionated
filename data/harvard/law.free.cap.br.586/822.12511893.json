Woodard, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n   This matter came before the Court for hearing on February 8, 2018, on the Objection to Claim of the Internal Revenue Service (the \"Objection\")(Dkt. # 110) filed by debtors Dr. David R. Donaldson and Cynthia A. Donaldson. The Donaldsons appeared at the hearing, along with their attorney, Robert Gambrell. Samuel Wright, Assistant United States Attorney, appeared on behalf of the Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In the Objection, the Donaldsons seek a reallocation of funds received prepetition by the IRS that were applied to non-debtor Impact Missions, Inc.'s (\"IMI\") prepetition tax obligations. The IRS has deemed Dr. Donaldson a \"responsible person\" who is liable for IMI's failure to pay certain trust fund taxes and assessed a Trust Fund Recovery Penalty (\"TFRP\") against him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Donaldson contends that all of the funds received should be applied to these trust fund taxes, rather than split between the trust fund taxes and other taxes for which he has no personal liability. Dr. Donaldson testified at the hearing, as did Brian Redden, former IMI chairman, Wes Edwards, a former IMI board member, and Terry Griffith, IMI's former CPA and consultant. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court requested additional briefing from the parties. All briefs have now been filed (Dkt. # 160, 161, 163, and 164).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Court has considered the Objection, the IRS's response, the briefs, the arguments of counsel, the evidence, and the applicable law. For the reasons set forth below, the Objection is due to be overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     JURISDICTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction over the Objection pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20151\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 157(a) and 1334(b) and the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi's Order of Reference of Bankruptcy Cases and Proceedings Nunc Pro Tunc dated August 6, 1984. The consideration of an objection to a proof of claim is a core proceeding arising under Title 11 of the United States Code as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A), (B), (I), and (O). The threshold issue in the Court's consideration of the Objection, however, is whether the Court has jurisdiction to order the IRS to reallocate payments it received prepetition for a non-debtor's tax liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     FINDINGS OF FACT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   IMI was a non-profit charity whose primary purpose was to provide services to abused and neglected children through 24-hour residential homes and protective custody. Dr. Donaldson served on IMI's Board of Directors from 1999 until he resigned on September 10, 2004. During the tax periods at issue, Dr. Donaldson also served as the President and Chief Executive Officer of IMI. Beginning in 2012 and lasting until it ceased operations and dissolved in 2015, IMI suffered financial difficulties due to the loss of multiple grants and other sources of funding. During this time, IMI fell behind on many of its obligations, including federal taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Beginning in 2012, IMI accumulated significant trust fund tax liabilities due to IMI's failure to withhold, file returns, and pay required quarterly trust fund taxes\n   related to employee payroll.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trust fund tax liabilities continued to accrue through 2013 and 2014 due to IMI's continued failure to account for and remit payroll withholding taxes. Dr. Donaldson testified that he first became aware of IMI's trust fund tax delinquency in the first quarter of 2013. Despite Dr. Donaldson's knowledge of the tax arrearage, IMI continued to fail to pay its ongoing trust fund tax obligations. The liabilities at issue are the TFRP assessments issued against Dr. Donaldson for all four quarters of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014, while he was president and CEO of IMI.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Although IMI suffered from a lack of cash flow, it did have three assets that Dr. Donaldson believed were sufficient to satisfy all of IMI's past due and continuing tax liabilities: two parcels of real property and a contingent claim filed with the BP Deepwater Horizon Settlement Claims Administrator (the \"BP Claim,\" and together with the two parcels of real property, the \"Contingent Assets\"). Because he chose to rely on the future liquidation of the Contingent Assets, after 2012, Dr. Donaldson never used, or suggested that IMI use, other funds, such as operating funds, to pay current or past due amounts owed to the IRS. Even after Dr. Donaldson became aware that the withholding taxes were not being paid, he testified that he continued to pay IMI's other operating expenses with funds that could have been used to pay the IRS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Dr. Donaldson testified that he believed that the Contingent Assets had sufficient equity to fully pay IMI's past due and accruing tax liabilities. To that end, IMI's former CPA, Terry Griffith, testified that he facilitated a meeting at his office on June 19, 2014, between Cathy Aders, an IRS Revenue Agent, and Dr. Donaldson to discuss the past due taxes and IMI's plans to use the Contingent Assets to pay those taxes. At the meeting, Dr. Donaldson told Ms. Aders that IMI had submitted the BP Claim in 2013 and that IMI intended to use the proceeds of that claim (the \"BP Funds\"), along with excess proceeds from the sale of the real property, to pay IMI's past due tax obligations. Mr. Griffith testified that IMI intended that the BP Funds be designated as a voluntary payment to the IRS to be used first for the satisfaction of IMI's past due payroll tax obligations. Mr. Griffith further testified that he assisted Dr. Donaldson and the IMI Board in drafting a resolution intended to memorialize the meeting and IMI's plan to pay its past due tax obligations. Dr. Donaldson testified that he was instrumental in passing the resolution and that he specifically included a provision to attempt to direct the application of the BP Funds as a voluntary payment to the IRS. This was an internal IMI document. The IRS was not a party to any agreement to designate the BP Funds in this manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Due to the past-due taxes, the IRS issued a notice of levy on the BP Claim in February 2015 (the \"Notice of Levy\"). The Notice of Levy effectively gave the IRS a nonconsensual lien on the BP Funds and was issued prior to the claims administrator's final decision on the BP Claim. Dr. Donaldson contends that the IRS issued the Notice of Levy at his insistence, but even if true, his permission was not required. Neither IMI nor Dr. Donaldson had any basis to oppose the IRS's levy on the BP Claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The BP Funds were received by the IRS in September 2016 with a designation on the settlement check that the funds be applied to the trust fund taxes. The IRS ignored this designation and instead applied the funds to both trust fund and non-trust fund tax obligations of IMI. Dr. Donaldson received a substantial benefit from the IRS's application of the BP Funds, as the funds were partially applied to his TFRP liability and resulted in a decrease of that liability. The IRS received no funds from the liquidation of the two parcels of real property, which were foreclosed upon by prior lienholders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Donaldsons filed their chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on November 22, 2016 (Dkt. # 1). The IRS timely filed its proof of claim on May 26, 2017 (Claim # 10) in the amount of $87,564.09, consisting of Dr. Donaldson's TFRP liability for all four quarters of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014. On August 22, 2017, the Donaldsons filed the Objection seeking a reallocation of the BP Funds solely to trust fund taxes for which Dr. Donaldson has TFRP liability. The Donaldsons contend that IMI made a \"voluntary payment\" designation of the BP Funds, and that, therefore, the IRS should have applied all of the BP Funds to periods for which Dr. Donaldson was assessed a TFRP as a responsible person. The IRS argues that the Donaldsons' Objection should be overruled, first on jurisdictional grounds, but also on substantive grounds.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Responsible person liability is governed by\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206672\">\n     26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6672\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"\u00a7 6672\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    To the extent any findings of fact are conclusions of law, they are adopted as such, and vice versa.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    IMI also became delinquent on its non-trust fund federal taxes.

Thus, while the Court has jurisdiction under \u00a7 505 to determine Dr. Donaldson's tax liability under \u00a7 6672, it does not have jurisdiction under \u00a7 505 to\n    re-allocate prepetition tax payments received as a result of the levy on IMI's assets, because the taxpayer, IMI, is not a debtor here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Having determined that the Court does not have \u00a7 505 jurisdiction, the Court now must determine whether it has jurisdiction to order the reallocation under the general bankruptcy jurisdiction statute,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

As such, third-party tax matters cannot be adjudicated by the bankruptcy court even if they could conceivably affect the debtor's estate, as \"such a reading would render superfluous \u00a7 505's grant of jurisdiction to determine the tax liabilities of\n    <em>\n     the debtor\n    </em>\n    or\n    <em>\n     the estate\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9377519\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/316/542/#p549\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (emphasis in original).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    The Debtors argue that \u00a7 105 of the Bankruptcy Code provides the authority for their requested reallocation.

Dr. Donaldson testified that he knew of IMI's past due 2012 liabilities in the first quarter of 2013. He further testified that he pursued other sources of funding, and contends that in doing so, he was taking all reasonable action to ensure that the taxes would be paid. The Court disagrees. The testimony and evidence presented at trial reveal that even though Dr. Donaldson knew of the past-due 2012 trust fund taxes, IMI continued to fail to pay its current trust fund obligations. The taxes at issue here are those assessed against Dr. Donaldson for all of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014-all of which accrued after he became aware IMI was not collecting and paying trust fund taxes. While it is true that IMI lost several sources of funding during 2013, Dr. Donaldson testified that IMI continued to receive other funds, which were used to fund operations and make payroll obligations. Dr. Donaldson testified that he paid other bills with funds that could have been used to pay the IRS trust fund taxes. Even though IMI was paying its employees and other operating expenses, it not only failed to pay the arrearage, it failed to pay the ongoing withholding taxes as they came due.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Dr. Donaldson did not seek to defraud the IRS and had no evil intent. It is clear from Dr. Donaldson's testimony that he believed that IMI would receive a large sum of money from the liquidation of the Contingent Assets which would be sufficient to cover all of IMI's past due obligations to the IRS. Equally clear is that the sale of the property and the BP Funds\n    did not result in sufficient proceeds to pay all the trust fund taxes. Dr. Donaldson's gamble that these Contingent Assets would cover the past due taxes does not relieve him of his liability under \u00a7 6672 for the shortfall. Dr. Donaldson's argument on this point actually supports the Court's conclusion that his failure to pay the taxes was willful, because federal law requires trust fund taxes to be paid quarterly. During 2013 and into 2014, Dr. Donaldson willfully and knowingly caused or permitted other obligations of IMI to be paid while continuing to ignore IMI's past due and current obligations to the IRS, assuming that future contingent assets would cover this debt. The fact that his assumption proved incorrect does not constitute \"reasonable cause\" to relieve him of his responsibility for these taxes under \u00a7 6672, especially in light of his continued failure to pay over trust fund taxes after he admittedly became aware of IMI's prior failure to do so.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    Dr. Donaldson's use of those funds to pay other creditors when he knew that delinquent taxes were owed to the IRS establishes his willfulness, as a matter of law.\n    <em>\n     Logal\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1738224\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/195/229/#p232\">\n     195 F.3d at 233\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    <strong>\n     IV.\n     <em>\n      CONCLUSION\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The Court lacks the authority to reallocate prepetition payments applied to IMI's tax debts, because the Court does not have jurisdiction to determine a non-debtor's tax liability.
