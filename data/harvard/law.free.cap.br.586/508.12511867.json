Brown (\"Roy\") (together, the \"Plaintiffs\") commenced this action against K &amp; L Gates, LLP (\"KLG\"), Edward M. Fox (\"Fox\", together with KLG the \"Defendants\") as well as a recently dismissed individual defendant, Eric T. Moser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The claims in this action arise from a related bankruptcy proceeding. Therefore, the case was automatically referred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of New York (the \"Bankruptcy Court\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 1, 2014, the Defendants filed a motion, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) ; Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure (\" FED. R. BANKR. P. \") 5011 ; and Local Bankruptcy Rule 5011-1, to withdraw the automatic reference and have the case proceed before this Court. On or about January 14, 2015, while that motion was pending, the Defendants filed a second motion, pursuant to FED. R. BANKR. P. 7012 and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\" FED. R. CIV. P. \" or \"Rule\") 12(b)(6), to dismiss the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 28, 2015, this Court withdrew the reference from the Bankruptcy Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 21, 2015, the Court granted the Defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) on the grounds that res judicata bars the Plaintiffs' claims for breach of fiduciary duty, tortious interference and common law fraud (\"2015 MTD Decision\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 14, 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the Court's judgment issued pursuant to the 2015 MTD Decision, ruling \"[b]ecause the plaintiffs' claims are not of the sort that should have been raised in the underlying bankruptcy proceedings nor do they implicate the validity of the asset sale confirmed in the bankruptcy proceedings, res judicata does not bar them.\" Docket Entry (\"DE\") 18 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 8, 2018, Eric T. Moser was voluntarily dismissed from this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Presently before the Court is the motion by the Defendants, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss the Plaintiffs' entire complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. As stated above, the previous decision that dismissed the complaint was vacated and remanded by the Second Circuit for further proceedings consistent with its opinion. For the following reasons, the Defendants' motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Unless otherwise noted, the following salient facts are drawn from the complaint and are construed in favor of the Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Brown Media is a Delaware Corporation, which was established in March 2010 for the express purpose of acquiring the assets of an entity known as Brown Publishing Company and its affiliated entities (collectively \"Brown Publishing\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Roy is an individual residing in Cincinnati, Ohio. He presently owns the substantial majority of the stock of Brown Media, and is the former CEO, shareholder, and director of Brown Publishing. Roy is also a part of Brown Publishing's management group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendant, KLG, is an international law firm with approximately forty-five offices located throughout the United States and abroad. The individual defendant Fox and former defendant Moser are attorneys and former partners at KLG, both of whom currently reside in New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Pre-Bankruptcy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Brown Publishing was a closely-held corporation, which was controlled by Roy; his brother Clancy; his parents, Bud and Joyce; the company's former General Counsel, Joel Dempsey (\"Dempsey\"); and one Joel Ellingham (\"Ellingham\") (collectively, the \"Managers\"). Brown Publishing was a family business, having been founded in 1920 by Roy's grandfather.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At an unspecified time, Brown Publishing received financing from a company known as Windjammer Capital (\"Windjammer\"). In connection with their financing arrangement, Windjammer allegedly retained an equity option, so that, in the event the loan was not repaid, Windjammer could exercise its option and force the sale of Brown Publishing's assets to recoup its investment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   For reasons not set forth in the complaint, it is alleged that in late 2008, although not yet in default, the Managers feared that Windjammer might soon exercise its option, which would result in their losing control of Brown Publishing. As a result, the Managers sought legal advice as to how best to maintain control of the enterprise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In this regard, on or about December 12, 2008, allegedly on behalf of himself and the other Managers, Dempsey contacted Fox and KLG. On that date, Dempsey allegedly supplied Fox and KLG with a document entitled the \"Warrant Put Memo\" (the \"Memo\"), which sets forth the issues about which the Managers required legal advice. It is unclear who prepared\n   the Memo, but, as to its contents, the complaint alleges as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The [ ] Memo ask[ed] KLG for advice related to, inter alia, the legal ramifications of a proposed transaction whereby the Managers create a new LLC and Managers Roy, Dempsey, and Ellingham acquire the assets of Brown Publishing through the new LLC. This proposed transaction was to take place outside of bankruptcy. Legal issues specifically identified in the [ ] Memo included what actions to take, if any, with regards [sic] to Windjammer Capital, possible successor liability related to the proposed transaction, what state would be an advantageous one for incorporation of the new LLC, the tax consequences to the Managers, shareholder disclosure requirements, if any, and other issues pertaining to Brown Publishing's lenders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   It is alleged that the Memo did not contemplate a bankruptcy. In fact, as noted above, Brown Publishing allegedly was not in default of any loans at this time and the Managers were specifically seeking advice about how to retain equity control through a non-bankruptcy transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Allegedly, in response to the Memo, KLG and the individual Defendants provided advice directly to Roy and Dempsey, and billed the Managers for the time spent providing these legal services. In particular, KLG allegedly advised the Managers on ways to reduce the possibility of so-called successor liability-i.e., the possibility that the new LLC would succeed to the debts and liabilities of Brown Publishing after acquiring its assets. In order to minimize this possibility, KLG allegedly advised Roy not to participate in any eventual transaction, and advised Dempsey to relinquish his shares in an entity known as Brown Media Holdings Company (\"Media Holdings\"), so that he could become the majority owner of the new LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   By March 2009, Brown Publishing was in imminent danger of defaulting on its loan agreement with Windjammer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 26. Accordingly, the Managers allegedly took a series of actions to protect Brown Publishing's interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In or about March 2009, the Managers allegedly decided to enter into a non-bankruptcy transaction that was structured similarly to the one contemplated by the Defendants in the Memo. The complaint does not provide many supporting details concerning this transaction. From the complaint, the Court cannot determine the parties to the transaction or any of the relevant terms or conditions. However, it is alleged that, in proceeding with this transaction, the Managers followed advice provided by KLG, namely, Roy did not participate and Dempsey relinquished his shares in Media Holdings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   At or about the same time, in March 2009, Windjammer allegedly commenced a lawsuit in Ohio, seeking to invalidate this transaction. Again, the complaint does not provide many supporting details, including the identities of the parties to that action. Nor does it specify whether the action was commenced in state or federal court; or what legal theory Windjammer asserted. Nevertheless, an unidentified Ohio court allegedly approved the transaction and authorized it to move forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   However, again for reasons not explained in the complaint, at some unspecified time, the Managers allegedly rescinded the March 2009 transaction and, on the advice of KLG, proceeded to bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In this regard, it is alleged that when \"[t]he March 2009 transaction did not solve the problems associated with Brown Publishing's debt,\" Dempsey contacted Fox in early May 2009 for advice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 26. From May 2009 to June 2009, KLG allegedly advised the Managers that a sale of Brown Publishing's assets in bankruptcy was their best strategy in order to retain control of the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Further, KLG apparently advised Roy and Dempsey, in their individual capacities, to attempt to purchase Brown Publishing's assets through a sale pursuant to Section 363 of the United States Bankruptcy Code,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20363\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" \u00a7 363\"), which authorizes the bankruptcy court to conduct a sale of a bankruptcy debtor's assets outside of the ordinary course of business. The complaint alleges that KLG suggested that, if the Managers, acting through the new LLC, purchased Brown Publishing's assets in a sale pursuant to \u00a7 363, they \"could eliminate successor liability and related tax concerns, and that Roy's family members could potentially join the purchase.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In June 2009, KLG allegedly notified Roy and Dempsey that the firm was interested in representing Brown Publishing in its bankruptcy proceeding. According to the complaint, KLG did not disclose any conflict of interest created by simultaneously (a) representing Brown Publishing in connection with its bankruptcy filing; and (b) advising the Managers in connection with their efforts to retain control of Brown Publishing and acquire its assets. In particular, KLG allegedly did not seek or obtain a waiver from the Managers. Nor did the firm seek consent to represent both the Managers and Brown Publishing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In July 2009, Brown Publishing allegedly retained KLG as counsel. After being so retained, KLG allegedly continued to advocate for a sale of Brown Publishing's assets to the Managers by way of a sale in bankruptcy pursuant to \u00a7 363, despite the Managers' expressed preference for an out-of-court restructuring. In this regard, KLG allegedly began preparing a strategy by which the Managers would maximize their odds of prevailing in a public auction for the company's assets. In particular, in August 2009, KLG and Dempsey began preparing a \"stalking horse asset purchase agreement.\" (the \"APA\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Although not described in the complaint, the Court will take judicial notice of the basic concept of a stalking horse bid in bankruptcy. As one court has noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A stalking horse bidder in a bankruptcy proceeding makes an initial bid to purchase the assets of a debtor on the theory that the initial bidder's \"initial research, due diligence, and subsequent bid may encourage later bidders.\"\n   <em>\n    In re 310 Associates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9090850,9083395\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/346/31/\">\n    346 F.3d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 34 (2d Cir. 2003). Stalking horse bidders often contract to receive a \"break-up fee\" compensating it for its bidding activities should a higher bid ultimately emerge and win an eventual asset auction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Integrated Res., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6513846\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/147/650/#p659\">\n    147 B.R. 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 659 (S.D.N.Y. 1992).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    In re MSR Resort Golf Course LLC\n   </em>\n   , 13-cv-2448,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%2067364\">\n    2014 WL 67364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 7, 2014). As the Second Circuit has succinctly stated: \"A 'stalking horse' contract is a first, favorable bid strategically solicited by the bankrupt company to prevent low-ball offers.\"\n   <em>\n    In re WestPoint Stevens, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223021,3802862\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/231/\">\n    600 F.3d 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 239 n.3 (2d Cir. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In addition to preparing the APA, KLG also allegedly provided the managers with specific advice concerning,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , how much to bid and how to frame their bid so as to maximize the chances that a bankruptcy court would approve an eventual sale. Further, KLG allegedly provided advice regarding the formation of Brown Media, the entity into which the purchased assets of Brown Publishing would be transferred, namely, the \"stalking horse.\" KLG also allegedly provided advice as to\n   the benefits of filing the bankruptcy petition in New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The complaint alleges that KLG was also active in seeking funding for the Managers' planned purchase of Brown Publishing's assets. In this regard, allegedly, \"KLG provided advice to the Managers on the price they should offer, and revised documents drafted by the Managers and sent to potential capital [investors].\" Compl. \u00b6 35. In addition, Fox allegedly referred the Managers to a friend of his at W &amp; L Ross, a company that acquires other distressed companies, and participated in a conference call with the Managers and individuals at Goldman Sachs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Allegedly, KLG provided advice to Roy and Dempsey regarding the Managers' efforts to convince Brown Publishing's lenders to finance the Managers' purchase. Among other things, KLG allegedly made extensive edits to a memo prepared by Roy on behalf of himself and the other Managers for this purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   It is further alleged that the Managers eventually obtained a funding commitment from Guggenheim Partners (\"Guggenheim\") to support their purchase offer. The complaint alleges that KLG worked directly with Guggenheim and the Managers to prepare the APA and encouraged Guggenheim to provide a debtor-in-possession loan to infuse capital into Brown Publishing during the Chapter 11 proceeding and preserve the value of its assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   However, shortly before Brown Publishing's bankruptcy filing, KLG allegedly urged the Managers, and Brown Media, to obtain separate counsel. In particular, Fox allegedly recommended that the Managers retain his friend and former partner, Richard Levy, Esq. The Managers agreed to retain Levy. However, by the time they did so, Brown Media had already been formed for the purpose of placing a stalking horse bid and ultimately acquiring Brown Publishing's assets; and substantive portions of the APA were already negotiated and in place. Around the same time, at KLG's suggestion, Brown Publishing hired Tom Carlson (\"Carlson\") as an independent director with a mandate to manage the sales process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Bankruptcy Filing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On April 30, 2010, Brown Publishing filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the Eastern District of New York. The complaint alleges that, \"[a]s part of the filing, KLG sought to be and was eventually retained as [Brown Publishing's] Counsel.\" Compl. \u00b6 45. Apparently, KLG submitted a disclosure statement (the \"Disclosure Statement\") in furtherance of the Bankruptcy Court's approval of its retention as counsel for Brown Publishing. Allegedly, this Disclosure Statement failed to disclose KLG's prior representation of the Managers. The complaint also alleges that the Disclosure Statement did not disclose \"the extent of Defendants' relationships with all of the members of the Bank Group and many other major creditors.\" Compl. \u00b6 47. However, the complaint does not define the term \"the Bank Group\"; does not identify alleged creditors, other than Windjammer; and, in using this term, does not assert any factual allegations regarding KLG's purported relationships with the so-called Bank Group or any other creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   After the bankruptcy filing, but shortly before the execution of the APA, Brown Publishing allegedly received a credit bid by an entity referred to in the complaint as \"the PNC Bank Group.\" This term is also not defined and, except as discussed later in this opinion, is not otherwise described in the complaint. Apparently, the PNC Bank Group's bid was rejected as inferior to the Managers' stalking horse bid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On May 4, 2010, Brown Publishing, allegedly through Carlson and KLG, executed the APA and sought the Bankruptcy Court's approval of the sale of its assets to the Managers, through Brown Media. The APA allegedly included an assumption of contracts and leases in the purchase price, which the parties represented to the Bankruptcy Court was \"a necessary component of the bargain that [Brown Publishing], in the exercise of [its] sound judgment, ha[d] reached with Brown Media.\" Compl. \u00b6 49. The bankruptcy court approved the Managers' bid, and, at the same time, approved procedures for the eventual sale of Brown Publishing's assets should an auction become necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   It also appears that, at some unspecified time, an unsecured creditors committee was formed. Again, the complaint fails to assert any facts relating to this process, but the Court notes that Section 1102 of the Bankruptcy Code provides, in relevant part, that: \"as soon as practicable after the order for relief under Chapter 11 of this title, the United States trustee shall appoint a committee of creditors holding unsecured claims and may appoint additional committees of creditors or of equity security holders as the United States trustee deems appropriate.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201102\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). This committee \"shall ordinarily consist of the persons, willing to serve, that hold the seven largest claims against the debtor of the kinds represented on such committee.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1102(b)(1). Among other things, the committee: (i) provides access to information to other unsecured creditors who are not appointed to the committee; (ii) solicits and receives comments from such creditors; and (iii) is subject to court orders that may compel reports and/or disclosures to such creditors.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1102(b)(3)(A)-(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On June 1, 2010, KLG apparently requested that Roy \"brief\" the unsecured creditors committee that was formed pursuant to Brown Publishing's filing. Fox allegedly instructed Roy on how to answer the members' questions concerning his personal interests relative to Brown Publishing. In this regard, the Plaintiffs allege that, although the Managers had retained attorney Levy to represent them, KLG \"continued to treat them as clients.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On June 16, 2010, Fox, Roy, and Dempsey met for lunch to discuss issues relating to the bankruptcy proceeding. Allegedly, attorney Levy was not present, nor did Fox suggest that he should be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Foreclosure Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   According to the complaint, CRJ Investments, LLC (\"CRJ\") was an affiliate by common ownership of Brown Publishing. In particular, CRJ was owned by Roy, Dempsey, and Roy's brother, Clancy. CRJ allegedly owned the real property where Brown Publishing conducted all of its manufacturing and a substantial majority of its profit-generating operations. Apparently, CRJ was also a party to valuable leases with Brown Publishing, although no particular leases are identified. The complaint suggests that, pursuant to the terms of the APA, the Managers would acquire these leases through the ultimate acquisition of Brown Publishing's assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   It is alleged that CRJ's \"sole lender\" was Huntington Bank (\"Huntington\"). Allegedly, Huntington is a member of the PNC Bank Group, which, as described above, had submitted a last-minute competing offer for Brown Publishing's assets. In addition, Huntington is a creditor of Brown Publishing and, importantly, a client of KLG.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The complaint does not specify the type of \"lending\" in which Huntington engaged, or whether Huntington possessed a security interest in the subject real property owned by CRJ. However, on June 14,\n   2010, Huntington allegedly filed a foreclosure action against CRJ in an Ohio state court, a move designed to reduce the value of Brown Media's assumption of the CRJ leases. The Plaintiffs assert that Huntington's commencement of the foreclosure action violated the automatic bankruptcy stay pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and was intended solely to undermine the Managers' efforts to acquire Brown Publishing's assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Allegedly, in his capacity as Brown Publishing's General Counsel, Dempsey directed KLG to promptly file a motion to enforce the automatic stay. KLG, through Fox, allegedly agreed to do so, but, according to the complaint, waited until after the auction of Brown Publishing's assets before filing the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   It is alleged that KLG's delay in filing the motion to stay the foreclosure action was strategic and designed to benefit Huntington, another of its clients. In particular, the complaint appears to depict the following fraudulent scheme allegedly perpetrated by KLG. The PNC Bank Group, of which Huntington is a part, submitted a competing bid for Brown Publishing's assets. That bid was rejected as being inferior to the Managers' stalking horse bid. However, the PNC Bank Group's bid was deemed inferior, in part, because the APA assigned a substantial value to CRJ's leases with Brown Publishing. In order to make the PNC Bank Group's bid superior to the Managers' stalking horse bid, KLG, with privileged knowledge of the strategic importance to the Managers of the CRJ leases obtained through its representation of the Plaintiffs, allegedly maneuvered to reduce the value of CRJ's leases-a result that could be accomplished if a foreclosure action were pending against it at the time of the action. Thus, the complaint asserts that KLG deliberately refrained from interrupting the foreclosure action so that CRJ's leases would be stripped of their value in the bankruptcy proceeding, and the PNC Bank Group, which included a client of KLG's, would have the prevailing bid for Brown Publishing's assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Based on the circumstances outlined above, KLG and Carlson allegedly declared that the PNC Bank Group's bid was the superior bid, thereby necessitating an auction of Brown Publishing's assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Auction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   On July 19, 2010, the auction for Brown Publishing's assets was held at KLG's New York offices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Having been outbid by the PNC Bank Group for substantially all of Brown Publishing's assets, the Managers allegedly bid on a lesser group of assets than those which were envisioned in the APA. Despite initially being declared the high bidder for those assets, Guggenheim allegedly withdrew its funding before the Managers could close the transaction. In this regard, the complaint vaguely alleges that Guggenheim's decision to withdraw was influenced by \"the Huntington Foreclosure and other problems in the closing process related to the fact that Brown Media was not able to acquire all of the assets envisioned by the APA.\" Compl. \u00b6 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The PNC Bank Group was allegedly successful in acquiring most of Brown Publishing's assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   After the conclusion of the auction, KLG successfully moved in the Huntington foreclosure action to enforce the automatic bankruptcy stay. However, by then, the PNC Bank Group had already acquired Brown Publishing's assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the Court must\n   accept the factual allegations set forth in the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

However, reading the complaint in a light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, it is clear that Brown Media submitted a bid and therefore lost the resulting bid deposit. The Court cannot glean from the complaint that Roy suffered any loss relating to the bid deposit, and, as discussed in Section II.B.2, Roy is unable to receive relief for damage done to Brown Media.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gordon v.
