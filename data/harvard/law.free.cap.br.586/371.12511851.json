Salvatore (the \"Defendant\"), filed a voluntary Chapter 7 petition. The deadline to file objections to discharge or dischargeability of a debt was set as August 24, 2015. No objections were filed, and the Debtor received a discharge on August 26, 2015. (ECF No. 17). On January 9, 2016, the Chapter 7 Trustee filed a report of no distribution and the bankruptcy case was closed on January 13, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 19, 2017, Michele Salvatore (the \"Plaintiff\"), filed a motion to reopen the case. After a hearing held on June 27, 2017, the Court entered an Order Granting the Plaintiff's Motion to Reopen Bankruptcy Case in Order to Obtain Determination of Nondischargeability Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (the \"Order Reopening the Case,\" ECF No. 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 24, 2017, the Plaintiff filed an adversary complaint against the Defendant (the \"Complaint,\" Adv. Pro. ECF No. 1), seeking a determination of nondischargeability of a debt owed to her pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(B) (\"Count One\") and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6) (\"Count Two\"), and a revocation of discharge under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) (\"Count Three\"). On September 26, 2017, the Defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss Adversary Proceeding (Adv. Pro. ECF 7) and a Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Dismiss Adversary Proceeding (Adv. Pro. ECF 8) (collectively, the \"Motion to Dismiss\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Motion to Dismiss asserts that Count One and Count Two should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, lack of notice, and failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. The Defendant also asserts that dismissal of Count Three is appropriate due to a \"lack of disclosure,\" and because the claim is time-barred. On November 1, 2017, the Plaintiff filed an Objection to the Motion to Dismiss (Adv. Pro. ECF 14), and a Memorandum of Law in Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss (Adv. Pro. ECF 15) (collectively, the \"Objection\"). On November 20, 2017, the Defendant filed a Reply to the Objection (the \"Reply,\" Adv. Pro. ECF 17).
