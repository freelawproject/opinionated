Because Count I of Nussbeck's complaint alleged that Gray had breached the Agreement, one component of which was the discharged personal loan, the Missouri court's judgment against Gray on Count I would be void to the extent that it is a determination of Gray's liability on the discharged personal loan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, because of the \"credit\" Nussbeck applied to the amount owed by Gray under the Agreement, the extent (if any) to which the Missouri court's judgment on Count I included Gray's liability on the discharged personal loan was initially unclear to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Accordingly, on February 21, 2018, the Court entered the following order:\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) allows this Court to abstain from deciding an issue \"in the interest of comity with State courts or respect for State law.\" This matter having come before the Court on its own motion, the Court holds that abstention under section 1334(c)(1) is appropriate here. The extent (if any) to which the Missouri court's judgment on Count I\n   includes Gray's liability on his discharged personal loan shall be decided by the Missouri court. The parties shall return to the Circuit Court of Jackson County that originally entered judgment in\n   <em>\n    Nussbeck v. Gray\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 1316-CV27930, for a final judgment on that issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Gray filed that order with the Missouri court, which provided the requested clarification by its own order on March 28, 2018: \"This Court specifically finds that no portion of the judgment entered herein included any liability for any debt which had been discharged in Defendant Gray's bankruptcy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, no portion of the Missouri court's judgment on Count I determined Gray's liability as to the discharged personal loan. Two conclusions follow. First, \u00a7 524(a)(1) does not operate to void any portion of the Missouri judgment. Second, Nussbeck and Odrowski's pursuit of that judgment, following application of the $33,500 credit, involved only non-discharged debts and therefore could not have violated the \u00a7 524(a)(2) discharge injunction (which by its terms applies only to discharged debts).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court now turns to whether either of the defendants violated the discharge injunction prior to application of the $33,500 credit. As many courts (including this one) have observed, the purpose of \u00a7 524 is to afford a debtor a \"fresh start.\" Section 524(a)(2) operates as \"an equitable remedy precluding the creditor, on pain of contempt, from taking\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   actions to enforce the discharged debt.\"\n   <em>\n    Espinosa v.

Here, because Gray incurred no additional expenses due to the inclusion of the discharged personal loan in the Agreement, and made no payments on the loan following discharge, the only damages Gray could have suffered as a result of Nussbeck's violation of the discharge injunction would have been emotional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Tenth Circuit has not addressed the issue of whether \u00a7 105 authorizes damages for emotional distress caused by a violation of the discharge injunction. While a number of bankruptcy courts have held that \u00a7 105 does authorize such damages, those courts have required a showing of (1) a causal connection between the emotional distress and the violation of the discharge injunction as well as (2) egregious conduct from the creditor or significant emotional harm to the debtor.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Nibbelink\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4082670\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/403/113/#p120\">\n    403 B.R. 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 120-21 (Bankr.

N.D. Ohio 2003). Having considered the entire record, the Court is unable to find evidence that Gray suffered any emotional distress, significant or otherwise, caused specifically by Nussbeck's inclusion of the discharged personal loan in the Agreement. Moreover, although Nussbeck's actions violated the discharge injunction, they were taken pursuant to assurances by Gray's attorney and cannot be considered egregious. Under these facts, the Court holds that Gray is not entitled to damages for emotional distress. It follows that although Nussbeck is liable for civil contempt under \u00a7 105, he is not subject to monetary sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Odrowski\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Following Gray's breach of the Agreement, Odrowski sent Gray a collection letter and filed the Missouri case, both on Nussbeck's behalf. The record contains no evidence that Odrowski knew the discharge injunction was applicable to the personal-loan component of the Agreement when he performed these tasks. Because there is no evidence that Odrowski knew the discharge injunction applied, Odrowski cannot be subject to contempt sanctions. Put differently, although Odrowski's actions constitute a slight technical violation\n   of \u00a7 524(a)(2), sanctions for civil contempt under \u00a7 105 are not indicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, summary judgment will be entered (1) in favor of plaintiff Gray as to his complaint against defendant Nussbeck, with no damages awarded; and (2) in favor of the Odrowski Defendants as to Gray's complaint against them.

This credit far exceeded the balance Gray owed on the discharged personal loan. However, because the records before this Court did not identify the specific components of the agreement to which the credit applied, the Court was initially unable to determine whether Nussbeck still sought to collect any portion of the discharged loan via the Agreement. At the Court's request, however, the Missouri court provided clarification.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    page 352-53\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    ECF 36-3.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    ECF 83-3 at 110.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    ECF 36-4.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    ECF 36-5.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    ECF 36-6. Because the Agreement was based in part on the discharged personal loan, and because the Agreement did not comply with the reaffirmation-of-debt requirements of \u00a7 524(c), the Agreement was unenforceable under the Bankruptcy Code.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20524\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c) (providing that an agreement between a creditor and debtor, the consideration for which is based in part on a discharged debt, can be enforceable only if the agreement complies with the reaffirmation-of-debt requirements of that subsection).
