Orrick, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Appellant Warren Havens (\"Havens\") filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition against the Leong Partnership on August 24, 2016. Appellee Dr. Arnold Leong (\"Leong\") moved to dismiss that petition and eventually secured summary judgment arguing, in part, that the \"Leong Partnership\" is a non-existent entity. The Bankruptcy Court granted Leong's motion for attorneys' fees and costs under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i). Havens appeals the order granting fees and costs, asserting that the Bankruptcy Court erred in granting the award because \u00a7 303(i) only allows fees and costs to be granted to a \"debtor\" and Leong was not the named debtor, and arguing in any event that the amount of fees and costs awarded was unreasonable. I conclude that the Bankruptcy Court was within its powers to determine that Leong was the debtor for purposes of the petition\n   and that, in light of the 20% reduction in fees imposed on two of Leong's three law firms, the amount of attorney's fees awarded was not an abuse of discretion. The Bankruptcy Court's Order Granting Fees and Costs Under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 303(i) is AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 1998, Havens and Leong began a business relationship involving purchase of radio spectrum licenses from the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\"). Bankruptcy Court Order Granting Summary Judgment (\"MSJ Order\") at 3 [Dkt. No. 4-121]. A disagreement arose about the existence of an oral agreement regarding the percentage of ownership interest each had in the business relationship.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That disagreement has resulted in more than fifteen years of litigation, culminating most recently with a Receiver being appointed by the Alameda County Superior Court to preserve the value of the FCC licenses on a request by Leong. Appellee's Supplemental Appendix at 12 [Dkt. No. 7-1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following the appointment of the Receiver, Havens filed two Chapter 11 cases. MSJ Order at 3-4. This appeal arises from the second Chapter 11 case, where Havens filed an involuntary Chapter 11 petition (\"Petition\") against the \"Leong Partnership.\" The existence of the \"Leong Partnership\" was heavily disputed in the Bankruptcy Court proceedings. Leong, in his individual capacity, moved to dismiss the Petition because the named debtor, the Leong Partnership, did not exist and Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 303(a)(B) requires at least three creditors to file an Involuntary Petition, but Havens' Petition was filed only by two. Mot. to Dismiss at 2 [Dkt. No. 4-62]. Havens opposed, arguing that \u00a7 303(a)(B) was satisfied because at the time of the filing of the Petition, there were three petitioning creditors and that the Leong Partnership did exist. Oppo. to Mot. to Dismiss at 4, 8 [Dkt. No. 4-75]. At the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss, on September 22, 2016, U. S. Bankruptcy Judge Charles Novack denied the Motion to Dismiss, but suggested that Leong \"answer the Petition\" and file a motion for summary judgment to raise the argument that the Leong partnership does not exist. Tr. Sept. 22, 2016 at 12 [Dkt. No. 4-87].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After Leong filed an Answer to the Petition, Answer [Dkt. No. 4-85], Havens argued in a Status Conference that Leong, as an individual, was not authorized to respond or make filings on behalf of the Leong Partnership because Leong denied there ever was a Leong Partnership (and, therefore, could not be a general partner who could represent the Partnership). Tr. Oct. 31, 2016 at 4 [Dkt. No. 4-92]. Havens asked the Bankruptcy Court to enter an order for relief because the Petition was not timely responded to.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Judge Novack rejected that argument and allowed Leong to file on behalf of the alleged debtor, reasoning that while Bankruptcy Rule 1011 provides that only \"the debtor\" named in the petition may contest the petition, there was a question whether the debtor exists and \"Leong is as close to being the debtor as anyone or anything.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    at 4-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In opposition, Havens asserted that the Leong Partnership is an existing partnership comprised of Leong, Mark Griffith, and Channing Jones. MSJ Order at 8. In a series of declarations, Havens proffered the reasons why he believed the Leong Partnership exists. Havens Decl. for Oppo. \u00b6 2a [Dkt. No. 4-107]. However, both Leong and Griffith filed declarations stating that the Leong Partnership never existed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ultimately, the Bankruptcy Court concluded that a bona fide dispute existed regarding the existence of the \"Leong Partnership,\" which made the pursuit of the Involuntary Petition impermissible and led to the grant of Leong's motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Leong then filed a motion for attorneys' fees and costs under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 303(i) as the prevailing party to the Involuntary Bankruptcy Petition. Mot. for Fees at 1 [Dkt. No. 4-123]. Havens objected, arguing that as a \"non-debtor\" Leong had no right to fees under Section 303(i) because fees can only be awarded to a \"debtor.\" Oppo. for Fees at 1 [Dkt. No. 4-131].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In its order, the Bankruptcy Court acknowledged that \"serious questions of fact exist regarding the very existence of the Leong Partnership.\" Bankruptcy Court Order Granting Fees and Costs (\"Fee Order\") [Dkt. No. 1-3] at 3. The court determined, based on the evidence filed in the Involuntary Petition proceedings, that Havens \"had filed the Petition to interfere with the receiver's efforts to sell the radio spectrum licenses\" and that \"only Dr. Leong was affected by the involuntary petition, and he was its target. Dr. Leong was therefore caught in a 'Catch 22': acknowledge the existence of the Leong Partnership and his role as a general partner in order to respond to the involuntary petition and obtain fees and costs under \u00a7 303(i), or deny the above and respond (somehow) to the involuntary to preserve the Alameda County Superior court receivership.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court determined that under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 101(13),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Leong was \"the debtor\" and that Bankruptcy Rule 9001\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   authorized Leong to respond to the Petition. It concluded that \"given the serious questions regarding the existence of the Leong Partnership and the\n   identity of the true target of the involuntary petition, Dr. Leong is the debtor herein under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 101(13).\" Fee Order at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Havens also objected to the amount and reasonableness of the attorneys' fees and costs sought by Leong, who sought recovery for time incurred by three separate law firms (when only one had made an actual appearance in the bankruptcy proceedings). Havens contended a 60% reduction of fees was warranted because: (1) the time spent on tasks was excessive and the result of duplication of efforts; (2) there were multiple, unnecessary attorneys at hearings, meetings, and conferences; (3) non-bankruptcy attorneys billed time researching basic bankruptcy issues; (4) firms used block billing time; and (5) the firms billed for travel time. Oppo. for Fees at 9-10. The Bankruptcy Court held that the firm representing Leong in the bankruptcy proceedings (the Pachulski firm) could recoup all fees in full, but the two litigation firms who had not made an appearance (Bertrand and Shopoff firms)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   would have their fees reduced by 20% bringing the total attorneys' fees award down to $262,070.50.

I find the rationale of\n   <em>\n    Jansen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Synergistic\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Fox\n   </em>\n   are not undermined by\n   <em>\n    Miles,\n   </em>\n   which addressed a wholly different factual predicate.\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   had a debtor that participated in the involuntary petition proceedings.

Similarly, Leong was as close to the named debtor as possible, was (as found by the Bankruptcy Court) to be the party in interest and was the party whose efforts in the underlying Receivership Havens was attempting to thwart. Leong was not a \"third party\" as were the spouse and daughters in\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Law\n   </em>\n   is inapposite because, by defining Leong as the debtor and granting him fees and costs, the Bankruptcy Court was not using its equitable powers under \u00a7 105 to contravene an express limitation in the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Bankruptcy Court recognized Leong as \"the debtor\" by examining the definitions of the term \"debtor\" in Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 101(13) (the person upon whom the bankruptcy case has been brought) and Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9001 (if the named debtor is a partnership the court can designate a person in control of the partnership to perform any act required by the debtor).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fee Order at 4.

THE FEES AWARDED WERE REASONABLE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Leong's request for fees included time billed by three law firms who worked on contesting the Involuntary Petition. Fee Order at 6. The general bankruptcy counsel (Pachulski) billed $146,558.50 in fees and the two litigation firms which represent Leong in the Alameda County Superior Court proceedings (Bertrand and\n   Shopoff) billed $52,500 and $91,890 respectively. Mot. for Fees at 16, 64, 85. The Bankruptcy Court found that Leong needed that expertise to address the issues, and that a significant amount of time was \"necessary to understand the more than decade long litigation between Havens and Dr. Leong, Havens's litigation with the other alleged Leong Partnership partners, and the relationship between the involuntary bankruptcy proceeding and the Alameda County Superior Court receivership.\" Fee Order at 7. It concluded that Pachulski's fees were reasonable and awarded those fees in full. Fee Order at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   However, the Bankruptcy Court found multiple issues with the request with respect to the litigation firm fees. Specifically:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Dr. Leong's counsel did not explain why both litigation firms needed to brief Pachulski on the Alameda County Superior court litigation. Both firms participated in numerous conference calls with Pachulski, and reviewed and revised virtually all of Pachulski's pleadings. The Bertrand Fox and Shopoff firms also assisted Pachulski in researching bankruptcy issues, and regularly billed time reviewing this court's routine orders. While this court does not question the litigation expertise and integrity of these firms, neither of them have Pachulski's bankruptcy experience, and they should have limited their time to ensuring that Pachulski fully understood the pre-petition litigation and accurately described it in its pleadings. While this court presumes that they reviewed Pachulski's pleadings with this in mind, why were two sets of attorneys necessary for this task? Their time records are also clouded by their clumping of time. It is difficult to assess the reasonableness of work done when the time spent on discrete projects are commingled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As a result, the Bankruptcy Court reduced the litigation firms' fees by 20%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.

Appellant Br. at 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In the Ninth Circuit, a court may \"impose a small reduction, no greater than 10 percent-a 'haircut'-based on its exercise of discretion and without a more specific explanation.\"\n   <em>\n    Moreno v.

Here, the Bankruptcy Court went further, imposing a 20% reduction because of the duplication of effort and block billing problems it identified. Reductions of fees between 10-30% for block billing have been approved.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Welch v. Metro. Life Ins.

Considering the Bankruptcy Court's order, as\n   well as the lack of specificity in the arguments made to me,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   I conclude that the Bankruptcy Court appropriately reduced the fees sought by the two litigation firms by 20% to account for the concerns identified (the block billing by the Shopoff firm and by the duplication of effort by both firms).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As to the arguments Havens believes were unaddressed or inadequately addressed by the Bankruptcy Court, Havens reiterates his objections to the block billing by Shopoff and the duplication of efforts (both of which have been addressed), as well the unnecessary work performed by the litigation firms researching bankruptcy law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29.
