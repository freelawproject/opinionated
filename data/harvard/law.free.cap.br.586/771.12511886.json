E.D. Pa. 1981) (finding sufficient equities in the case to vacate discharge to allow hearing on reaffirmation agreement which had been filed 3 days after discharge was entered where the agreement would settle litigation with a secured creditor that started a little more than a month before the discharge hearing and had not been settled before the discharge hearing).\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Eccleston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6103796\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/70/210/#p213\">\n    70 B.R. 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 213 (Bankr. N.D.N.Y. 1986) (finding the equities did not support exercise of the Court's equitable powers to vacating the discharge, noting that \"a debtor seeking relief under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9024 (Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) ) must show 'extraordinary' circumstances which prevented relief through usual channels.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In this case, Debtors received their discharge nearly six years before this Motion was filed. There is no authority under the Bankruptcy Code for the Court to approve a reaffirmation agreement entered into six years after discharge was entered. Debtors do not seek to vacate their discharge to allow entry into and approval of a reaffirmation agreement. Even if they did, it would be inequitable to do so because Debtors have been relieved of any personal\n   liability on all of their discharged debts, including the mortgage loan, for six years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Thus, Debtors have not demonstrated, pursuant to \u00a7 350(b), that filing a reaffirmation agreement is \"cause\" to reopen this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Debtors have not provided any legal authority demonstrating that the Court has jurisdiction to enter an order post-discharge granting relief based solely in state law.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   With respect to Debtors' request that if the case were reopened, they would seek an order from this Court compelling Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC to report all payments made to the credit bureau, Debtors have not presented any legal authority establishing this Court has jurisdiction to grant the relief requested after discharge has been entered and the case closed. Bankruptcy courts' jurisdiction is limited to \"core\" matters that arise under Title 11 or arise in a case under Title 11, and on a lesser basis, noncore matters that are \"related-to\" cases under Title 11.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While jurisdiction over core matters remains unchanged after the case is closed, courts have held that a close nexus to the bankruptcy case is required for non-core matters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re John Richards Homes Bldg. Co., L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087707\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/405/192/#p210\">\n    405 B.R. 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 210 (E.D. Mich. 2009) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Burch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11934678\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/88/686/#p690\">\n    88 B.R. 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 690 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 1988).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Here, all of the legal authority cited in the underlying motion is state law. It is, at best, subject to \"related-to\" jurisdiction. Debtors have not demonstrated a close nexus to the six-year-old bankruptcy case to establish jurisdiction over these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   While a violation of the discharge injunction would be a core proceeding over which this Court clearly has jurisdiction, Debtors are not asserting such a violation. Even with liberal interpretation, the Court cannot infer a violation of the discharge injunction from the papers before it. In particular, the email from Ocwen attached to the Motion as Exhibit B is not sufficient to establish that violation of the discharge injunction occurred. In response to Debtors' request to report payments, Ocwen responded: \"As per our records, during bankruptcy chapter 07, you had never reaffirmed with prior servicer. Hence we cannot report the loan as reaffirmed.\" Motion, Ex. B, Dk. 18, pg. 15. Ocwen's statement appears to be merely an accurate statement of facts: Debtors did not reaffirm the loan, and therefore Ocwen cannot report the loan to the credit bureaus as having been reaffirmed. Debtors have not presented any evidence that demonstrates Ocwen pressured Debtors into reaffirming a discharged debt post-petition or otherwise violated the discharge injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Debtors have not provided any legal support to establish that this Court has jurisdiction, post-discharge, to enforce state law reporting requirements under these circumstances. Thus, Debtors have not demonstrated, pursuant to \u00a7 350(b), \"cause\" to reopen their case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, no valid reaffirmation agreement may be entered into or filed and the Court does not have jurisdiction over the state law claims. In short, reopening the case for either of these purposes would be futile. Thus, there is no cause to reopen the Debtor's bankruptcy case. The Motion is DENIED without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    ECF docket entries for this bankruptcy case,\n    <em>\n     In re Judson\n    </em>\n    , Case No. 6:12-bk-21167, are cited as \"Dk.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
