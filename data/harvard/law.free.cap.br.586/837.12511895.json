Appellees are representatives of two groups seeking to assert claims against the Debtor: (1) successors-in-interest to an assignment executed in 1913 by John Hamman to Producers (\"the Hammans\"); and (2) Successors-in-interest to an assignment executed in 1919 by Dan A. Japhet,\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   to Humble (\"the Japhets\"). In 2004 the Japhets filed a lawsuit against various defendants in the 14 9th District Court of Brazoria County, Texas (Cause No. 30776-CV), alleging that under a chain of title descending from Dan A. Japhet, they own an undivided 52/60th working interest of the net profits realized by Humble's successors from the operations conducted on 20 acres leased under the 1919 assignment. In their state court lawsuit the Japhets sought\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   specific performance of the 1919 lease, judgment for damages and prejudgment interest arising from the defendants' failure to pay the net profits interest when required; and a declaration that, due to defendants' defaults under the lease, the lease terminated and the rights reverted back to them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 19, 2009, the Japhets added the Debtor as a defendant in their state court case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 25, 2013, Henry R.

Since, moreover, subsequent filings in both the Japhet and the Hamman adversary cases kept the Bankruptcy Court and the Debtor apprised of the Appellees' demands upon the Debtor and intent to hold the Debtor's estate liable before, during, and after the period for filing Proofs of Claim, Appellant's argument that the filings were untimely lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    The Bankruptcy Court Did Not Abuse It's Discretion by Concluding that Recognition of the Informal Proofs of Claims Is Equitable\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Appellant argues that the Bankruptcy Court abused its discretion by analyzing the fifth prong of the\n   <em>\n    Nikoloutsos\n   </em>\n   test-whether allowance of the claim would be equitable under the circumstances-by focusing solely on the effect that not recognizing Appellees' informal claims would have had upon the Appellees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   Asserting that \"[t]he Bankruptcy Court balances this effect against the fact that Houston Bluebonnet had notice of the state law causes of action against it,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant argues that \"[b]y focusing on notice in analyzing the equitable prong, the Bankruptcy Court failed to address Houston Bluebonnet's equitable considerations, which, as stated below, are significant.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant argues that equities the Bankruptcy Court failed to consider include the fact that the Appellees are represented by well-qualified counsel and were well aware of the Bar Date but waited until the eve of the disclosure statement hearing to take any action regarding their potential, unfiled claims.

Moreover, to allow Debtor's insiders and their attorneys to be the only parties to receive distributions from the Debtor's estate would be a travesty, totally at odds with the core concepts in bankruptcy: providing debtors with a fresh start, or the basic\n   means of survival, while also providing for the \"equality of distribution among unsecured creditors.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In concluding that allowance of Appellees' informal proofs of claim would be equitable under the circumstances, the Bankruptcy Court reasoned as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   [T]he Japhets and Hammans, persistently prosecuted their claims against Houston Bluebonnet throughout the existence of the state court and bankruptcy proceedings. Additionally, each of the adversary proceedings stemming from Houston Bluebonnet's bankruptcy case (Case Nos. 16-3251, 16-3225) deal solely with the Japhets' and Hammans' claims against Houston Bluebonnet.

Houston Bluebonnet commenced its bankruptcy case only after the state court found it liable to the Japhets, but before the state court determined the amount of damages for which Houston Bluebonnet was liable. Appellant does not dispute that the Japhets and the Hammans are the only non-insider creditors, and that proceedings that have occurred since the Debtor filed bankruptcy include a trial held in March of 2018, resulting in a jury verdict for the Japhets of over $1.3 million.\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   The amount in question is substantial, and denying Appellees the ability to pursue their claims against the Debtor would be extremely harsh.

Although the difference between the\n   <em>\n    Nikoloutsos\n   </em>\n   claimant and the Appellees weighs against recognizing the Appellees' informal proofs of claim, this difference does not outweigh the prejudice that failing to recognize the informal proofs of claim would cause the Appellees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Appellant's argument that it has been able to raise sufficient funds to pay its creditors in full based on the assumption that the Appellees were not filing proofs of claim, and that recognition of Appellees' informal proofs of claim would unfairly delay resolution of the bankruptcy case by making its filed plan infeasible, weighs only slightly in favor of Appellant because Appellant has neither argued nor presented any evidence capable of establishing that the Debtor or any other creditors will\n   be prejudiced by recognition of the Appellees' informal proofs of claims. If the Appellees' claims have merit, disallowing them would create a windfall for the remaining creditors, and if the claims have no merit, the Debtor will still have the opportunity to object to them, and the Bankruptcy Court will have the opportunity to deny them. Under these circumstances, the court concludes that the Bankruptcy Court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that recognition of the Appellees' informal proofs of claims is equitable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Conclusions and Order\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   For the reasons stated in \u00a7 III, above, the Bankruptcy Court's Order Granting Movants' Motion for Approval and Determining Their Informal Proofs of Claim Lack Prima Facie Validity, signed October 10, 2017 (\"Order Approving Informal Proof of Claims\"), Docket Entry No. 68; is\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Notice of Appeal from Order Granting Movants' Motion for Approval and Determining Their Informal Proofs of Claim Lack Prima Facie Validity (Docs. 68 and 69), Docket Entry No. 1-1, p. 1 \u00b6 2 (citing Exhibit A).\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    Bankruptcy Record on Appeal (\"BROA\"), Docket Entry No. 4-2, p. 132.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11498520,1753223\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/199/233/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    BROA, Docket Entry No. 4-2, pp. 133-142.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Brief of Appellant Houston Bluebonnet, L.L.C.
