ECF No. 1. Approximately four months later, on April 8, 2015, the Trustee initiated the instant adversary proceeding against the University. In Count One of the adversary proceeding complaint (\"Complaint\"), the Trustee seeks to avoid two payments allegedly made by Mr. and Mrs. DeMauro to the University-a December 4, 2012 payment and a March 12, 2013 payment, both in the amount of $8,754.00-as constructive fraudulent transfers and to recover the funds pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B), 550(a), and 551.

In Count Two of the Complaint, the Trustee seeks to avoid eight payments (collectively, the \"Eight Payments\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   allegedly made by Mr. and Mrs. DeMauro as constructive fraudulent transfers and to recover the funds pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) and the Connecticut Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (\"CUFTA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   AP-ECF No. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The University moved to dismiss the Complaint asserting the payments-all of which were Direct PLUS Loan proceeds-were not property of Mr. and Mrs. DeMauro and not subject to \u00a7 548 because they were restricted funds disbursed under the Federal Direct PLUS Loan program. AP-ECF No. 8. The motion to dismiss also asserted that the allegation in Count One regarding a payment dated December 4, 2012 should be dismissed as it fell outside of the two year limitation period set forth in \u00a7 548(a). AP-ECF No. 8. Upon the agreement of the parties, the court (Manning, C.B.J.) struck the allegation in Count One regarding the December 4, 2012 payment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   AP-ECF No. 25. The court ordered, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(d), that the motion to dismiss be considered as a motion for summary judgment and ordered the parties to submit statements of fact in accordance with D. Conn. L.Civ.R. 56(a)(1) and (a)(2). AP-ECF No. 25. In addition to the parties submitting their respective statements of facts, the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of Rhode Island, Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of Massachusetts and the Connecticut Conference of Independent Colleges filed an\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   brief in support of the University's motion to dismiss. ECF No. 37. At the conclusion of the hearing held on December\n   2, 2015, the court (Manning, C.B.J.) denied, without prejudice, the University's motion. ECF No. 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A little less than one year later, the University filed the present Motion seeking summary judgment as to Counts One and Two of the Complaint, arguing that 1) Mr. and Mrs. DeMauro did not have a property interest in the Federal Direct PLUS Loan proceeds and did not make the transfers; 2) the University was not the first or initial transferee and therefore is entitled to a \"good faith\" defense; and 3) Mr. and Mrs. DeMauro received reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the payments to the University. ECF No. 72. The Trustee objected and the court heard oral argument on June 22, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 76, 77, 92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The following material facts are undisputed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   1.

Support of this proposition is found not only in the purpose of\n   \u00a7 548 but additionally in the restrictions and limitations set forth in the Direct PLUS Loan Program. As noted previously, the purpose behind \u00a7 548 is to recover assets that-but for the transfer-would have been assets available for distribution to creditors. Meanwhile, the HEA's-and specifically the Direct PLUS Loan Program's-purpose is to provide parents with the opportunity to fund their dependent children's secondary education. To protect this purpose, the regulations restrict the use of the Direct PLUS Loan proceeds to education expenses of the dependent child and expressly require that the funds be transmitted directly to the college or university, rather than to the parent-borrower. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1087b. Most importantly, \u00a7 1097(a) imposes a criminal penalty on the misuse of Direct PLUS Loan proceeds. This comprehensive statutory and regulatory scheme of the HEA indicates a clear intent by Congress to channel the Direct PLUS Loan proceeds to educational institutions to pay tuition, and to protect the proceeds from any misuse that might occur in the absence of the direct transfer to the educational institution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   A conclusion that the Direct PLUS Loan proceeds are property of the debtor for purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 544 and 548 and therefore available for distribution to a debtor's creditors would undermine the purposes of the HEA and disregard the parent-debtor's lack of possession and control over the Direct PLUS Loan proceeds.

In that case, the Third Circuit addressed whether a debtor's tax status-at the time of the petition-as a qualified subchapter S subsidiary (\"QSub\") constituted property of the estate pursuant to \u00a7 541. The Third Circuit examined the Internal Revenue Code's specific provisions pertaining to QSub status and noted that a debtor with QSub status did not possess an unrestricted right to the use, enjoyment, and disposition of that status, but that its QSub status was dependent on a number of factors outside of the debtor's control.\n   <em>\n    The Majestic Star Casino, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176410,6047414\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/736/\">\n    716 F.3d at 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Capacious as the definition of \"property\" may be in the bankruptcy context, we are convinced that it does not extend so far as to override rights statutorily granted to shareholders to control the tax status of the entity they own. \"[T]he Code's property definition is not without limitations....\"\n   <em>\n    Westmoreland\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Human Opportunities, Inc. v.

If the transfer of the Direct PLUS Loan proceeds to the University had not been made prior to the petition date, Mr. DeMauro would not otherwise have been in possession of the Direct PLUS Loan proceeds to pay his creditors or for any other purpose. Additionally, Mr. DeMauro had no legal or equitable right to demand use of the Direct PLUS Loan proceeds in the event the USDOE denied his application. To find that the Direct PLUS Loan proceeds are property within the meaning of \u00a7 541 and therefore, property that the Trustee may recover to pay creditors would provide the Trustee with a greater interest in the Direct PLUS Loan proceeds than Mr. DeMauro had at the commencement of his Chapter 7 case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As noted above, \u00a7 548 seeks to prevent the debtor from depleting the assets that but for the transfer would be available to creditors.
