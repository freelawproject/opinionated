Neblett (\"Neblett\"), Chapter 7 trustee for the bankruptcy estate of the Debtor, AEH Trucking LLC (\"Debtor\"), filed a three count Complaint against the United States of America, acting by and through the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"). Neblett seeks the avoidance and recovery of alleged preferential transfers from the IRS. Alternatively, he seeks turnover of the funds seized and damages. Neblett filed a Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Motion\") as to Counts I and II and the IRS filed a Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Cross-Motion\"). Neblett's Motion as to Counts I and II is denied. The IRS's Cross-Motion is granted in part and denied in part as to Count I, and granted as to Count II.

The Debtor performed hauling contracts for the United States Postal Service (\"USPS\") and was owed a balance for accounts receivable due from USPS. The IRS levied against the Debtor's USPS account and recovered $731,727.50 on January 29, 2016. This amount was applied towards the employment taxes obligations for the periods ending June 30, 2013, through June 30, 2014.

I find that there is no genuine dispute of material fact regarding the classification of the debt as employment/trust fund taxes, nor is there a dispute regarding the amount of the seizure from the bank account as $1,403.86. Section 547(c)(9) is therefore dispositive as to this matter. I find that the threshold amount has not been met to avoid the transfer of funds from the Debtor's bank account under \u00a7 547. When considering the Motion and Cross-Motion, I must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all inferences in that party's favor. Viewing the facts in a light most favorable to the IRS, Neblett's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Count I for the bank account seizure is denied. Viewing the facts in a light most favorable to Neblett, the IRS's Cross-Motion as to Count I is granted in part for the $1,403.86 bank account seizure.

I find that the USPS is indeed a federal government agency, thereby satisfying the mutuality requirement. For the reasons stated above, I find that the possibility that the IRS seized funds as part of a valid setoff under \u00a7 553 presents a genuine dispute of material fact.

I note that in the Complaint, Neblett does not contest the validity of a potential setoff, and therefore any potential recourse for a trustee to recover is only available under \u00a7 553.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Hurt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268913\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/579/765/#p769\">\n    579 B.R. 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 769 (Bankr.

At this stage, I do not have a sufficient record to decide whether \u00a7 553(b) would permit recovery by Neblett as the trustee.

In that case, the Supreme Court found that because the IRS had seized tangible personal property to satisfy a tax lien pre-petition, the Debtor maintained a legal or equitable interest in the property under \u00a7 541(a)(1).\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Board complied with the notice of levy and paid the IRS the money it owed Debtor before she filed for bankruptcy. The IRS had no need to conduct a sale or take further action in order to use the money to reduce Debtor's tax liability. Consequently, Debtor's property interest in the money terminated once the Board turned it over to the IRS.
