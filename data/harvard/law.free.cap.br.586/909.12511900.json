Her attorney, Catherine Molnar-Boncela (\"\n   <em>\n    Molnar-Boncela\n   </em>\n   \"), filed this case on her behalf. Subsequently, Neville Reid was appointed to serve as the chapter 7 trustee (the \"\n   <em>\n    Chapter 7 Trustee\n   </em>\n   \") for the Debtor's bankruptcy case. On the Petition Date, the Debtor signed and filed various required documents including the schedules [Dkt. No. 1] (the \"\n   <em>\n    Original Schedules\n   </em>\n   \") and the statement of financial affairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the Original Schedules filed on the Petition Date, the Debtor disclosed her ownership of real and personal property. On Schedule B, in response to Question 7 which requests debtors to disclose their interests in \"[f]urs and jewelry,\" the Debtor disclosed interests in \"costume jewelry\" valued at $500.00 and a \"wedding ring\" valued at $459.00. On her schedules, the Debtor also reported secured debts totaling $10,366,950.96 and unsecured debts totaling $519,191.09. At the meeting of creditors under section 341 of the Bankruptcy Code held on June 5, 2014 (collectively with the continued meeting dates, the \"\n   <em>\n    341 Meeting\n   </em>\n   \"), the Debtor affirmed the accuracy of all of her bankruptcy documents filed on the Petition Date, including the information contained in the Original Schedules. The 341 Meeting was continued to July 31, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Three days prior to the continued 341 Meeting, on July 28, 2014, the Debtor amended her schedules and statement of financial affairs [Dkt. No. 20] (the \"\n   <em>\n    Amended Schedules\n   </em>\n   \"). Molnar-Boncela filed the Amended Schedules on the Debtor's behalf. On Schedule B of the Amended Schedules, in response to Question 7 (requiring a debtor to input the value of the \"[f]urs and jewelry\" in which they have a property interest), the Debtor increased the reported value of her \"costume jewelry\" from $500.00 to $1,500.00. The Debtor also made additional disclosures of a \"diamond ring\" with an \"unknown\" value, and a \"diamond wedding set\" valued at $5,295.00. The \"wedding ring,\" valued at $459.00, remained unchanged in the Amended Schedules. The Debtor also added more specific details about other personal property disclosed in the Amended Schedules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The day before the continued 341 Meeting, the Debtor retained Greg Stern as additional co-counsel for her bankruptcy case. The Debtor appeared and testified at the continued 341 Meeting on July 31, 2014, and the meeting was again continued to September 11, 2014. This meeting, however, was never conducted on the September date and was instead further continued to October 27, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At the 341 Meeting session held on October 27, 2014, the Debtor testified regarding the diamond ring with \"unknown\" value that was disclosed on the Amended Schedules. In her testimony, the Debtor described the ring as an approximately three carat diamond ring, given to her by her husband for their 25th anniversary three years prior. She further testified that she did not consult with her husband regarding the value of the ring and did not have an appraisal for the ring. The Debtor stated that the value was listed as \"unknown\" because she did not know the value of the ring and that she would need to get the ring appraised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The October session of the 341 Meeting was continued a final time to November 17, 2014. Following the October meeting, the Debtor turned over the diamond ring pursuant to a request by the Chapter 7 Trustee. The final 341 Meeting session was thereafter held on November 17, 2014, where the Debtor again testified and agreed to produce various documents for the U.S. Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On December 15, 2014, the U.S. Trustee issued a subpoena pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 2004 seeking several documents, including \"[c]opies of all appraisals for the last 5 years on any and all jewelry owned or held by Defendant.\" In response, on January 12, 2015, the Debtor, through Molnar-Boncela, submitted the following documents:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (1) A 2010 appraisal of a \"solitaire engagement ring\" valued at $459.00 (relating to the \"wedding ring\" as\n   disclosed on the Debtor's bankruptcy schedules);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (2) An appraisal dated July 24, 2014, for a 14-karat, white-gold, wedding set, valued at $5,295.00 (relating to the \"wedding set\" as disclosed on the Amended Schedules); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (3) An appraisal dated July 25, 2014, for a 3.7 carat, trillion cut, diamond ring, valued at $44,142.00 (relating to the \"diamond ring\" as disclosed on the Amended Schedules).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   All of these appraisals were labelled as being for insurance purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Over two years later, on March 30, 2016, the Debtor filed a seconded amended Schedule B [Dkt. No. 81] (the \"\n   <em>\n    Second Amended Schedules\n   </em>\n   \") through Molnar-Boncela. In the Second Amended Schedules, in response to Question 7 of Schedule B requesting the value of the Debtor's \"[f]urs and jewelery,\" the defendant described her interest as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (1) \"wedding ring ($459 insurance appraisal)\" valued at \"unknown\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (2) \"diamond ring ($44,142 insurance appraisal)\" valued at \"unknown\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (3) \"diamond wedding set ($5,295 insurance appraisal)\" valued at \"unknown\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Second Amended Schedules were the final schedules filed by the Debtor in this case. The Debtor admits that as of the Petition Date, she maintained an interest in all of the jewelry, including the diamond ring and the diamond wedding set.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   FINDINGS OF FACT\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   From the review and consideration of the procedural background, as well as the evidence presented at the Trial, the court determines the salient facts to be and so finds as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (1) The Debtor is a homemaker.

The Debtor also admits that she had an interest in the diamond ring and wedding set as of the Petition Date and the filing of the Original Schedules. Thus, the omission of the rings from the Original Schedules rendered them objectively false, satisfying\n   the second requirement. There seems therefore little question that the Debtor knew or should have known that the missing jewelry items on the schedules constituted false omissions, as she admits that she knew as of the Petition Date that she owned interests in the jewelry at issue. Therefore, the third requirement is also satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Setting aside the fourth\n   <em>\n    Stamat\n   </em>\n   requirement for the moment, the omission of the wedding set and diamond ring satisfies fifth element; the materiality element of\n   <em>\n    Stamat\n   </em>\n   . The Debtor argues that the U.S. Trustee cannot prove the materiality element because the Debtor's estate was not administered and the Chapter 7 Trustee filed a No Asset Report in the case. This, the Debtor argues, indicates that the Debtor did not own anything of significant value, including the diamond ring and diamond wedding set, and that the omission of the rings in the Original Schedules was therefore immaterial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   That premise is faulty. \"In determining whether or not an omission is material, the issue is not merely the value of the omitted assets or whether the omission was detrimental to creditors.\"\n   <em>\n    Stamat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874464,4029774\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/635/974/\">\n    635 F.3d at 982\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because the jewelry was owned by the Debtor at the time of her bankruptcy filing, it is presumed property of the estate, and its omission from the Original Schedules constitutes a material omission under section 727(a)(4)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Returning to the fourth and now final requirement, the U.S. Trustee must show that the Debtor acted with the requisite intent, or at the very least reckless disregard, to harm the bankruptcy estate when she made the omissions. At no point during the Trial did the Debtor indicate that she intentionally excluded the omitted jewelry from the Original Schedules. While actual intent under section 727(a)(4)(A) may also be proven by \"circumstantial evidence or by inference based on a course of conduct,\"\n   <em>\n    Fink\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8452401\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/351/511/#p527\">\n    351 B.R. at 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , instead of doing so the U.S. Trustee argues that the Debtor acted with a reckless disregard for the truth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The U.S. Trustee argues that the Debtor did not put enough time into completing her Original Schedules in which she omitted the diamond ring and the wedding set. Subsequently, the U.S. Trustee contends that the Debtor swore under oath at the first session of the 341 Meeting on June 5, 2014 that she reviewed her schedules and believed them to be true and accurate, a statement that was inaccurate due to the omissions. In addition, the U.S. Trustee argues that even the Amended Schedules were prepared hurriedly, which evidences that the Debtor did not take her obligation to submit accurate schedules seriously. Last, the U.S. Trustee argues that the Debtor did not provide the Chapter 7 Trustee with information regarding the appraisals of the omitted rings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In turn, the Debtor argues that the omission of the two rings was simply a mistake. She states that, because she used the same bankruptcy attorney in the 2014 bankruptcy as she did in her 2009 bankruptcy, they used the same schedules and\n   merely updated them, which caused her to review the schedules less critically than she otherwise would have. She also maintains that she was honest and candid at all sessions of the 341 Meeting and answered the Chapter 7 Trustee's questions as accurately as possible, allegations that are supported by the Chapter 7 Trustee's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Original Schedules submitted by the Debtor were false, due to the omission of the jewelry. A few months after the Petition Date, the Debtor filed the Amended Schedules, which disclosed all of her interests in jewelry, albeit listed the diamond ring as having \"unknown\" value. The U.S. Trustee argues that a debtor may not escape a false oath claim by amending her schedules after the fact. For this proposition, the U.S. Trustee points to\n   <em>\n    Clean Cut Tree Serv., Inc. v. Costello\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Costello\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9092555\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/299/882/#p889\">\n    299 B.R. 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 889-900 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2003) (Schmetterer, J.). The debtor in the\n   <em>\n    Costello\n   </em>\n   case, however, omitted and concealed numerous property interests from the court in a systemic manner, as well as executed an affidavit stating that he had turned over all business records to the other party when he had, in fact, failed to do so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9092555\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/299/882/#p889\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9092555\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/299/882/#p889\">\n    at 888-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The differences between the facts of the\n   <em>\n    Costello\n   </em>\n   case and the facts in the matter before this court are significant. Here, the Debtor was never prompted to amend any schedules, nor was she \"caught\" trying to mislead the court. The Debtor independently amended her schedules approximately four months after the Original Schedules were filed when she again reviewed her schedules for the first continued 341 Meeting. Once the Amended Schedules were filed, the court and the Chapter 7 Trustee were aware of all of the Debtor's interests, if not the exact value of all of those interests. \"Although subsequent voluntary disclosure through testimony or an amendment to the schedules cannot expunge the falsity of an oath, subsequent disclosures are evidence of innocent intent.\"\n   <em>\n    Rafool v.

In this matter, the Debtor amended her schedules voluntarily, which evidences an innocent intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   It must also be noted that a debtor has a right to amend her bankruptcy schedules throughout her entire bankruptcy case. Bankruptcy Rule 1009(a) provides that a debtor's bankruptcy schedules \"may be amended by the debtor as a matter of course at any time before the case is closed.\" This Bankruptcy Rule is interpreted to allow liberal and free amendment of a debtor's schedules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Yonikus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6527849,10515839\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/996/866/\">\n    996 F.2d 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 871-72 (7th Cir. 1993) (\"a debtor may amend a voluntary petition pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 1009(a) 'as a matter of course at any time before the case is closed.' \") (quoting Advisory Committee note to Bankruptcy Rule 1009),\n   <em>\n    abrogated on other grounds by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Law v.

He asserts that the Original Schedules were false due to the omission of the jewelry, and that the Debtor made false oaths during the 341 Meeting when, in particular, the Debtor testified at the June 5, 2014 meeting that her schedules were true to the best of her knowledge. The U.S. Trustee also takes issue with the fact that the Amended Schedules provided the appraised value of the wedding set, but valued the diamond ring as \"unknown.\" At subsequent sessions of the 341 Meeting, the Debtor discussed needing to get the diamond ring appraised as she did not know how much it was worth, but did not disclose or indicate that it was being appraised. The U.S. Trustee argues that the Debtor did not sufficiently explain why she had obtained the appraisal for the wedding set, but not the diamond ring, at the time she filed the Amended Schedules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In this matter, the Debtor omitted two rings from the Original Schedules filed on the Petition Date. She then attended the June 341 meeting in which she affirmed that the schedules were true and correct to the best of her knowledge. The Debtor argues that, before the continued 341 Meeting in July 2014, she and Molnar-Boncela reviewed the Original Schedules, at which time she first noticed the omission of the diamond ring and wedding set. The Debtor, with the help of her attorneys,\n   added the missing jewelry items and filed the Amended Schedules. The Amended Schedules were filed, not at the direction of a creditor or the Chapter 7 Trustee, but because the Debtor found the omission and chose to remedy it through disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The U.S. Trustee also takes issue with the fact that the Debtor indicated on the Amended Schedules that the value of the diamond ring was \"unknown.\" At the Trial, the Debtor testified that while she had taken both the wedding set and the diamond ring to be appraised by a jeweler, she had not received the appraisal of the diamond ring at the time that the Amended Schedules were filed. Tr. at pp. 114-15, Mar. 20, 2018. Despite of the appraisal of the diamond ring being dated on July 25, 2014, both the Debtor and Molnar-Boncela testified that the appraisal was not in their possession as of July 2014. While the testimony did not necessarily clarify the reason why they did not have the appraisal on that date, the court found the combined testimony to be credible. Further testimony explained why, on the advice of counsel, the Second Amended Schedules continued to reflect a value of \"unknown\" for the diamond ring, even though the ring's description included the appraised amount.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Other actions taken by the Debtor also help to establish that she did not have the requisite intent under section 727(a)(4)(A). The Debtor willingly turned over both the diamond ring to the Chapter 7 Trustee, who proceeded to personally get the ring appraised. The Debtor also timely responded to the subpoena which requested all appraisals for any jewelry owned by the Debtor, and she was thorough and complete in her response. There is no indication by the Debtor's actions that she was actively intending to conceal the jewelry. By contrast, the Debtor was cooperative with the Chapter 7 Trustee's investigation of the assets and the Chapter 7 Trustee credibly testified that he believes the Debtor was honest and forthcoming throughout. The U.S. Trustee has not given any reason for this court to believe that the omissions were anything but an innocent, albeit negligent, error. The Debtor's own testimony which described the omission as an intentional mistake was credible to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Guidance from the Seventh Circuit indicates that when considering whether a debtor's actions rise to the level of reckless disregard, the debtor's level of education and business experience should be considered.\n   <em>\n    Stamat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874464,4029774\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/635/974/\">\n    635 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   982 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schryver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344224\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/558/856/#p860\">\n    558 B.R. at 871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In determining whether a debtor has shown reckless indifference to the truth, the court may consider the debtor's level of education and experience.\"). The Debtor in this matter left high school and received a G.E.D. while in her twenties. While she did attend phlebotomy school and obtain a college degree in general studies, the Debtor has not worked outside the home since the early 1990's. By any measure, the Debtor is not a sophisticated debtor in the manner of business expertise. This also serves to mitigate her intent under section 727(a)(4)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In light of the Debtor's testimony, and the other testimony heard from other witnesses, the court cannot conclude that the omissions were made with fraudulent intent. The Debtor's trial testimony regarding\n   her lack of intent was credible, and no witnesses were presented to the contrary. There appears to be no reckless disregard for the truth in failing to list the wedding set and diamond ring on the Original Schedules. While these items were inadvertently omitted, the Debtor disclosed all jewelry items on the Amended Schedules and turned over the diamond ring upon the request of the Chapter 7 Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The court therefore finds that the U.S. Trustee failed to carry its burden of proof with respect to Count III of the Complaint. The U.S. Trustee has failed to establish that the Debtor acted with the requisite intent with respect to the omitted jewelry items. Accordingly, the court declines to deny the Debtor's discharge under section 727(a)(4)(A), and judgment in favor of the Debtor on this count, the last remaining count in this Adversary, will be entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In this case, the court has been given little or no cause to exercise the drastic remedy of denial of discharge. The Debtor's actions did not constitute a reckless disregard for the truth. The Debtor has proven to be a credible witness, testifying in a straightforward and candid manner. The other witnesses who provided testimony at the Trial appeared to likewise be truthful and credible. That testimony belies the fraudulent intent the U.S. Trustee would have the court find. To deny the Debtor a discharge on the facts at bar would be unjust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court finds that the U.S. Trustee has failed to carry its burden under section 727(a)(4)(a). As a result, judgment in favor of the Debtor will be rendered on Count III of the Complaint. A separate judgment will be issued concurrent with this Memorandum Decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    JUDGMENT ORDER\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The matter before the court arises out of the Complaint Objecting to Debtor's Discharge and for Other Relief pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(A) [Adv.
