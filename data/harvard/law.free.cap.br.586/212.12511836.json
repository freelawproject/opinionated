HARNER, U.S. BANKRUPTCY JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This matter presents what would appear to be a relatively simple question-i.e., what qualifies as a \"consumer debt\" under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   But appearances can be deceiving. The Code defines a consumer debt as one incurred for a personal, family, or household purpose.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8). The purpose of the debt is the critical inquiry. The debt at issue in this matter is multi-faceted and, as such, has potentially more than one purpose. It arises both from use of certain specified funds by one of the above-captioned Debtors, as well as from a state court judgment imposing actual damages, non-economic damages, and punitive damages. As more fully explained below, based on a review of the relevant facts and applicable law, the Court concludes that a portion of the subject debt qualifies as a consumer debt for purposes of sections 101(8) and 707(b) of the Code. The Court does not determine whether this conclusion requires the dismissal or, with the Debtors' consent, conversion of the Debtors' chapter 7 case under section 707(b). That determination must await additional briefing and action by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Debtors list approximately $452,146.00 in debt on the schedules to their chapter 7 petition. The overwhelming majority of this debt relates to a single judgment entered against the Debtor by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on April 12, 2016 (the \"State Court Judgment\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2, Mot. Part. Summ. J., ECF 29-2. The State Court Judgment is based on the Debtor's conduct with respect to certain inheritance funds in the amount of $75,803.83 (the \"Inheritance Funds\") belonging to the Debtor's son, Damon Durant, Jr. (the \"Creditor\").\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Transcript of Feb. 17, 2016 State Court Hearing (\"State Court Tr.\") 36-41.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Creditor's late grandmother left him the Inheritance Funds in her Last Will and Testament (the \"Will\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot.

The State Court proceeded to hear evidence on the damages request, including the Creditor's testimony. The Creditor testified that the Debtor would not allow him to use any of the Inheritance Funds until he turned 21 years old, but then when he requested the money, the Debtor told him that all of the money was gone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    at 14-16, 18-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court offers no opinion on the policy objectives in either section 101(8) or 707(b) of the Code. It references the legislative history to section 707(b) only to highlight that the arguably broader approach to the definition of consumer debt suggested by the Fourth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Kestell\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Runski\n   </em>\n   (and some courts in other jurisdictions) is not inconsistent with the legislative history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Nevertheless, as suggested above, the Court finds no need to rely on legislative history and focuses solely on the language of the statute itself. Indeed, a review of the relevant terms used in the definition of consumer debt quickly clarifies its scope.

In addition, courts have interpreted the term \"incur\" to mean \"to become liable to or to bring it down on oneself\"; the term \"primarily\" to mean \"of the first importance or ... fundamental\"; and the term \"purpose\" to mean \"an intention or an object set before oneself as an aim.\"\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6121491\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/49/869/#p872\">\n    49 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   872 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    West\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20746250\">\n    2017 WL 746250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (defining \"incur\" to mean \" 'to suffer or to bring on oneself' \") (internal citations omitted);\n   <em>\n    In re Grillot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204286882\">\n    2017 WL 4286882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (Bankr.

The core of the consumer debt definition thus concerns debt that an individual debtor undertakes to serve her private affairs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Application of Consumer Debt Definition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In this matter, the Debtor chose to use the Inheritance Funds \"for his own purposes,\" as explained by the State Court. State Court Tr. 39. Whether that entailed purchasing a motorcycle or paying for vacations, the Debtor made a decision to use money that was not his to obtain personal or family goods or aims. Moreover, as admitted by the Debtor in the context of the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment,\n   \"[e]ach expenditure of the Inherited Money that Debtor made was made primarily for a personal, family, or household purpose.\" Order at 2, ECF 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Notwithstanding these facts, the Debtor argues that the real \"debt\" is the State Court Judgment and that such judgment is a non-consumer debt. The Debtor's argument has some merit, particularly with respect to the Punitive Damages. A punitive damages award by its very nature does not serve a personal, family, or household purpose (at least from the debtor's perspective), and is akin to a penalty. The Debtor's argument has significantly less force with respect to the Actual Damages and the Non-Economic Damages. The Court addresses each component of the State Court Judgment below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Actual Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Actual Damages relate to the Debtor's use of the Inheritance Funds for his own, personal purposes. Notably, the Creditor had a \"claim\" against the Debtor for the repayment of those funds even before the entry of the State Court Judgment. That claim arose upon the Debtor's decision to use the Inheritance Funds-a decision made of his volition-for his own purposes. The Court agrees with the U.S. Trustee that this repayment obligation is similar to that arising when a debtor borrows money from a bank or a friend and uses the money to purchase personal, family, or household goods. In both scenarios, the debtor must repay the money (unless the parties agree otherwise). The fact that the debtor is directed to repay the money by a court order rather than a private contract does not change the \"purpose\" underlying the claim on which the debtor has liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"Courts determine the debtor's purpose as of the time the debt was incurred.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Cherrett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266695,12269879\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/1060/\">\n    873 F.3d 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1067 (9th Cir. 2017). The Debtor's purpose in using the Inheritance Funds was personal and for his own benefit. He is deemed to have conceded this point in the Request for Admissions; and the State Court reached this same conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   State Court Tr. 39. Although the State Court Judgment memorializes and enforces the Creditor's claim against the Debtor for the Inheritance Money, the claim itself arose well before the State Court litigation. The point in time at which the Debtor used the money (and the Creditor's right to repayment arose) governs the determination of the debt's purpose under section 101(8) of the Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The facts supporting the characterization of the Actual Damages as a consumer debt are very different from those leading courts to determine that a debt is non-consumer, but not a business debt. Courts commonly refer to these kinds of debts as \"interstitial.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    West\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20746250\">\n    2017 WL 746250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 ;\n   <em>\n    Grillot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204286882\">\n    2017 WL 4286882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Peterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338474\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/524/808/#p813\">\n    524 B.R. 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 813 (Bankr.

Debts falling into this category include tax claims (characterized as involuntary with a purpose to benefit the public) and some tort claims (frequently automobile accidents in which the resulting debt is characterized as involuntary with a purpose to compensate the victim). Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    West\n   </em>\n   , the court (after finding a profit\n   motive and in the alternative) determined that the debt at issue arose from the creditors' motion for discovery sanctions against the debtor, which was involuntary and not incurred for the debtor's aims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    West\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20746250\">\n    2017 WL 746250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10. This case is different, and the Court concludes that the portion of the State Court Judgment relating to the Actual Damages is a consumer debt under section 101(8) of the Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Punitive Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The portion of the State Court Judgment awarding the Punitive Damages looks more like the kinds of debts deemed interstitial by courts and treated as non-consumer under section 101(8) of the Code. The Court must, however, consider the directive of\n   <em>\n    Kestell\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Runski\n   </em>\n   and whether the non-profit aspect of the Punitive Damages classifies even this portion of the debt as consumer debt.\n   <em>\n    Kestell\n   </em>\n   involved a lump-sum amount that the debtor owed to his former wife under a divorce judgment. The Fourth Circuit's characterization of the judgment at issue in\n   <em>\n    Kestell\n   </em>\n   is clear and succinct: \"Since this debt was not incurred with a profit motive or in connection with a business transaction, it is considered 'consumer debt' for purposes of section 707.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6459937,7649796\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/99/146/\">\n    99 F.3d at 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fourth Circuit did not, however, necessarily rule out a possible third category of interstitial debt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   At least one lower court in this Circuit has suggested that the Fourth Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Kestell\n   </em>\n   did not contemplate certain kinds of involuntary debts, such as tax debt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Stovall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"440345\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/209/849/\">\n    209 B.R. 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1997). In\n   <em>\n    Stovall\n   </em>\n   , the court acknowledged the dichotomy between consumer debt and business debt articulated by the Fourth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Kestell\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Runski\n   </em>\n   , but concluded that the personal property tax debt before it was not a consumer debt in light of the purpose of the debt.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"440345\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/209/849/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"440345\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/209/849/\">\n    at 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"the opinions in\n   <em>\n    Runski\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kestell\n   </em>\n   look to the\n   <em>\n    purpose\n   </em>\n   of the transaction giving rise to the debt\") (emphasis in original). The court explained, \"A tax, however, is not 'incurred,' but rather, is involuntarily imposed by a government for the public welfare. Such public purpose is sufficient, in the court's view, to take the debt outside the scope of a consumer debt. In this connection, the court notes that a tax is not the only kind of liability that falls into this 'interstitial' area of debts that are not consumer debts, but yet are not business debts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"440345\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/209/849/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Although the Court generally agrees with the court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Stovall\n   </em>\n   , the debt before the Court is closer in kind to the debt in\n   <em>\n    Kestell\n   </em>\n   -both debts involved state court judgments that arguably could serve a personal, family, or household purpose and arguably could be classified as involuntary. The\n   <em>\n    Kestell\n   </em>\n   decision does not provide much information about the divorce judgment, other than that \"[t]he divorce judgment required Kestell to pay Atkinson alimony, support for three of the couple's five children, a lump-sum award, attorney's fees, and a share of profits from a rental property.\"\n   <em>\n    Kestell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6459937,7649796\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/99/146/\">\n    99 F.3d at 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . One potential difference between the divorce judgment in\n   <em>\n    Kestell\n   </em>\n   and the State Court Judgment is the penalty nature of the Punitive Damages. The Court thus\n   must evaluate the purpose of the Punitive Damages, as mandated by the language of section 101(8) and the Fourth Circuit's guidance in\n   <em>\n    Kestell\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Runski\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Runski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11310078,7638302\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/102/744/\">\n    102 F.3d at 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In determining whether debt is for 'personal, family, or household purposes' under \u00a7 101(8), courts look to the purpose for which the debt was incurred.\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Zolg v.

That is very different from the purpose underlying a punitive damages award. Courts historically have awarded punitive damages to punish the defendant and to deter the defendant and others from committing similar conduct in the future.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beverly v. Vitran Exp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203772579\">\n    2012 WL 3772579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (D. Md. Aug. 28, 2012) (explaining that Maryland law seeks to further \"the historical purposes of punitive damages-punishment and deterrence\") (citation omitted). The punishment and deterrence objectives of a punitive damages award are often necessary and very appropriate under applicable law, but differ in significant ways from a \"personal, family, or household purpose.\" Like the tax debt in\n   <em>\n    Stovall\n   </em>\n   and the sanctions debt in\n   <em>\n    West\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds that the Punitive Damages do not meet the definition of consumer debt in section 101(8) of the Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Non-Economic Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finally, with respect the Non-Economic Damages, the Court finds that the purpose of this portion of the State Court Judgment is akin to interest charged on a loan. The interest component of a loan compensates the creditor for the debtor's use of the funds and, as such, is tied directly to the purpose served by the debtor's use of those funds. In awarding the Non-Economic Damages, the State Court stated, \"So for me, I look at a seven-year period from which you became aware that you were being denied access to the money and be[ing] given this bogus response. So I'm awarding at a rate of $10,000 a year for seven years, so non-economic damages in the amount of $70,000.\" State Court Tr. 39. Based on the entirety of the record in this matter, the Court finds that the Non-Economic Damages are compensation for the Debtor's use of the Inheritance Funds for a personal, family, or household purpose and constitute consumer debt under section 101(8) of the Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court concludes that the Actual Damages and the Non-Economic Damages qualify as consumer debt under sections 101(8) and 707(b) of the Code. The Court further concludes that the Punitive Damages,\n   though not for a profit motive or associated with a business transaction, do not serve a \"personal, family, or household purpose\" and, consequently, do not qualify as consumer debt. The Court does not determine herein whether these findings require the dismissal or, with the Debtors' consent, conversion of the Debtors' chapter 7 case under section 707(b).

Section 101(8) does not exclude debt secured by real property or a residential mortgage from the definition of consumer debt. Rather, it defines consumer debt as 'debt incurred ... for a personal, family, or household purpose.' This Court interprets \u00a7 101(8) to mean\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      all debt\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    incurred for such purposes, rather than all debt except debt secured by real property.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11667044\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/235/493/#p495\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11667044\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/235/493/#p495\">\n     at 496\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis in original).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    With respect to section 101(8), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit explained that \"[t]he legislative history of [section 101(8) ] indicates that the definition is adapted from the definition used in various consumer protection laws.\"\n    <em>\n     Booth\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10533221,6489373\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/858/1051/\">\n     858 F.2d at 1054\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This same legislative history, however, demonstrates that Congress used the term \"consumer debtor\" to mean \"individual debtor.\" For example, the House Report states, \"Though this Report is divided between consumer debtors and business debtors, the Bill itself makes no such distinction. The provisions of Chapter 7, Liquidation, for example, apply equally to business and consumer cases.\" H.R. Rep. 95-595, 6, 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5963, 5968. As such, the term \"consumer\" does not necessarily refer to an individual's acts or conduct solely as a \"consumer\" in the marketplace.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Some courts require a debtor's act to be voluntary or of her own volition in order to classify the resulting debt as a consumer debt.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     West\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20746250\">\n     2017 WL 746250\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at *10. As explained below, the Court finds that the Debtor made a decision-of his own volition-to use the Inheritance Funds for his own purposes. Moreover, the Court's decision regarding the classification of the Punitive Damages is based on the purpose of that award, and not the fact that a court judgment might be viewed as involuntary. Thus, the Court does not address whether an involuntary judgment that satisfies the purpose element of section 101(8) of the Code may nonetheless qualify as a consumer debt because, for example, the debtor brought the liability on herself-i.e., \"incurred\" the debt. The Fourth Circuit's decision in\n    <em>\n     Kestell\n    </em>\n    would suggest, however, such a result.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    At the Hearing, the U.S. Trustee posited that litigation over a debtor's nonpayment of credit card debt would not change the classification of the debt as consumer debt if the underlying use of the credit card and resulting charges involved a personal, family, or household purpose. The Court agrees. The debtor's use of the funds-regardless of how the resulting debt ultimately is enforced-should inform a court's analysis of whether the debt was \"incurred for a personal, family, or household purpose\" under section 101(8) of the Code.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The Court acknowledges that the debate concerning whether consumer debt is only one subset of non-business debt or, rather, the only alternative to business debt was contemplated by courts prior to the Fourth Circuit's decision in\n    <em>\n     Kestell\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6121491\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/49/869/#p872\">\n     49 B.R. at 872\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Nevertheless, the Fourth Circuit did not address this debate directly in either the\n    <em>\n     Kestell\n    </em>\n    or\n    <em>\n     Runski\n    </em>\n    decision, and the Fourth Circuit's holding in each case was based on the facts before it. Accordingly, as explained below, the Court considers, and is guided by,\n    <em>\n     Kestell\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Runski\n    </em>\n    based on the facts of this matter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The Fourth Circuit is not as direct on the purpose aspect of section 101(8) of the Code in\n    <em>\n     Kestell\n    </em>\n    , but the Court notes that\n    <em>\n     Runski\n    </em>\n    was decided after\n    <em>\n     Kestell\n    </em>\n    and that two of the three members of the panel were the same in both cases. The Fourth Circuit's language in\n    <em>\n     Runski\n    </em>\n    also suggests that not all non-business debt is consumer debt in that the Fourth Circuit stated that \"business debt\" is not consumer debt, thus focusing on the precise language of section 101(8) and what kinds of debt fall within that definition. Moreover, although\n    <em>\n     Runski\n    </em>\n    involved the use of the term consumer debt in section 722 of the Code, as the Fourth Circuit explained, \"[b]ecause the rules of statutory construction require us to presume that these terms have the same meaning throughout the same act, ... we turn to cases construing the language of \u00a7 101(8) for aid in determining the proper meaning of the nearly identical language found in \u00a7 722.\"\n    <em>\n     Runski\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11310078,7638302\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/102/744/\">\n     102 F.3d at 746-47\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
