Durkin, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n<p id=\"p-10\">\n   Appellant Generation Capital I, LLC (\"Generation Capital\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   has appealed the\n   bankruptcy court's order (1) disallowing its claim in its entirety as a discovery sanction, and (2) the subsequent confirmation of debtor John W. Fliss's Chapter 13 Plan. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C \u00a7 158 because the case involves the appeal of a final judgment entered in the bankruptcy court. For the following reasons, the Court vacates the bankruptcy court's judgment and remands the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-11\">\n<strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n<footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-12\">\n   These consolidated appeals stem from Generation Capital's bankruptcy claim based on a state court judgment (the \"Claim\") against Fliss's bankruptcy estate. During the bankruptcy proceedings, the bankruptcy court disallowed the Claim because Generation Capital failed to comply with discovery orders. As a result, the bankruptcy court held there were no objections to Fliss's Chapter 13 Plan (the \"Plan\") and confirmed the Plan without hearing Generation Capital's Claim on its merits. Generation Capital now argues that the bankruptcy court committed an error of law or abused its discretion in disallowing the Claim in its entirety as a discovery sanction, and that the bankruptcy court committed an error of law or abused its discretion when it confirmed the Plan.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-13\">\n<strong>\n    A. The State Court Judgment\n   </strong>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-14\">\n   On or about April 2009, a promissory note was executed by Duraguard Services, LLC and Polymeric Solutions, LLC in favor of Barrington Bank and Trust Company, N.A. to borrow $200,000 (the \"loan\"). The note was personally guaranteed by Fliss, Mark E. Barr, Lawrence E. Wojciak, and The Sherry R. Wojciak Revocable Trust dated February 16, 1999 (the \"Trust\"). In September 2011, Barrington Bank filed a complaint and confession of judgment against the borrowers Duraguard and Polymeric and against all of the individual guarantors (the \"litigation\"). A judgment of confession was entered against all of the defendants in that case-against Fliss, Barr, Wojciak, and the Trust for $204,797.70, against Duraguard for $208,733.08, and against Polymeric for $205,950.55. In February 2012, Barrington Bank and Generation Capital entered into a note sale and assignment agreement (the \"note agreement\"). The note agreement transferred all of Barrington's rights under the loan and the litigation to Generation Capital in exchange for payment of $240,000. Evidence of a wire transfer in that amount from Generation Capital II, LLC (\"Generation II\") on behalf of Duraguard was introduced in the state court proceedings. R. 20-1 at A-22.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-15\">\n   Also in February 2012, Barrington Bank, Wojciak, and the Trust entered into a settlement agreement (the \"settlement agreement\"). The settlement agreement provided that in exchange for payment of $240,000 by Wojciak and/or the Trust to Barrington Bank, Barrington Bank would transfer all of its rights under the loan and the litigation to Generation Capital, and Barrington Bank, Wojciak, and the Trust would release each other from liability on any claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at A-23. There was no evidence in the state court record that\n   Wojciak or the Trust ever made this payment to Barrington Bank.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at A-24.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-16\">\n   In May 2012, pursuant to the note agreement, the state court substituted Generation Capital for Barrington Bank. Generation Capital subsequently filed a motion to turnover assets against Fliss and Barr in the litigation. In November 2014, Fliss and Barr filed a motion to determine the amount owed pursuant to the judgment. In that motion, Fliss and Barr argued that the judgment in the litigation had been extinguished by the payment of $240,000 from Generation Capital pursuant to the settlement agreement. But because no evidence had been presented that the payment from Wojciak and/or the Trust had been made to Barrington Bank, the state court held that the settlement agreement was not satisfied, the litigation was not settled, and the release of liability between Barrington Bank, the Trust, and Wojciak was void.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (opinion entered May 12, 2015). As a result, the state court held that Barrington Bank could sell the rights pursuant to the note agreement to Generation Capital, and Generation Capital had a live cause of action against Fliss, Barr, Wojciak, and the Trust for the outstanding judgment amount of $204,797.70.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at A-25.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-17\">\n<strong>\n    B. The Bankruptcy Proceedings\n   </strong>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 28, 2015, Fliss filed a voluntary Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. The Chapter 13 Plan stated that Generation Capital had a claim against Fliss's estate secured by the \"memorandum of judgment recorded against real property,\" but that the collateral \"either has no value or [ ] is fully encumbered by liens with higher priority,\" causing the Claim to be treated as unsecured. A-19 at 3. On November 1, 2015, Generation Capital objected to the Plan on the grounds that: (1) the Plan did not adequately provide for Generation Capital's secured claim pursuant to 11 U.S.C \u00a7 1325(a)(5),\n   <em>\n    et seq.;\n   </em>\n   and (2) pursuant to 11 U.S.C \u00a7 1322(b)(2). Generation Capital filed a timely proof of claim on December 31, 2015.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 24, 2016, Fliss filed an objection to the Claim and made the same arguments he made in the state court motion for determination. Specifically, he argued that Generation Capital's Claim had been released by the payment of the settlement amount to Barrington Bank. A-25. He also argued that Generation Capital did not own the Claim, and that the Claim was overstated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Like in the state court motion, Fliss argued that the settlement agreement payoff was made on behalf of Duraguard and Polymeric and thus extinguished any claims Barrington Bank had against them, as well as against their guarantors (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Fliss, Barr, Wojciak, and the Trust).\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-20\">\n   Fliss further argued that Generation Capital is an alter ego of Wojciak and the Trust. He noted that although the note agreement provided for the assignment of the loan and litigation to Generation Capital, the note agreement was executed by Wojciak, and the only evidence of payment was from an account in the name of Generation II. Fliss thus questioned who actually owned the Claim-Generation II, Wojciak, or Generation Capital. Again, as in the state court motion, Fliss argued that because the payment was made, the payment released the obligation of all of the guarantors as well. In response, Generation Capital argued that the objection should be denied because the state court judgment was not subject to challenge based on res judicata, the Rooker-Feldman Doctrine,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and full faith and credit.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-21\">\n   On October 25, 2016, the parties appeared for a hearing on Fliss's objection to the Claim. The bankruptcy court indicated there was a question as to whether the Claim had been paid and that it intended to conduct an evidentiary hearing. A-136 at 10. The bankruptcy court ordered the parties to exchange witness lists, exhibit lists, and exhibits on or before November 21, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. The bankruptcy court also set a status for November 22, 2016 to determine whether discovery was needed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-22\">\n   On November 21, 2016 and November 22, 2016, Fliss issued discovery requests to Generation Capital and indicated to the bankruptcy court that there was a question as to whether the Claim had been paid and that he thought the Generation Capital entities were alter egos of Wojciak and the Trust. A-149 at 3. Fliss's attorney represented that Generation Capital and the related entities had not produced any operating agreements, bank statements, or tax returns.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. The bankruptcy court told Generation Capital's attorney that \"if you don't produce [the documents], [the court would] sustain the objection.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The bankruptcy court ordered Generation Capital to produce the documents by December 9, 2016, over Generation Capital's representation to the bankruptcy court that it had received the requests the day before, that there were 16 requests, and that it had consistently been Generation Capital's position that Fliss's objection was barred by the state court judgment under either res judicata or the Rooker-Feldman principle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, 7.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-23\">\n   Generation Capital failed to produce the documents on December 9, 2016, allegedly because its counsel were in a trial that ended up taking several days longer than anticipated. A-158 at 4. Fliss did not contact Generation Capital or file a motion to compel. Instead, on December 12, 2016, Fliss filed a motion to disallow the Claim as a sanction for Generation Capital's failure to produce documents. A-109. Generation Capital responded to the requests by December 14, 2016. A-158 at 4. During argument on the motion to disallow on December 19, 2016, Generation Capital argued that the document requests asked for documents that did not belong to Generation Capital, and that Generation Capital produced hundreds of pages of documents in response to the requests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-24\">\n   The bankruptcy court ordered Generation Capital to produce information regarding the ownership of the Generation Capital entities by December 21, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The bankruptcy court also reminded Generation Capital's counsel, Mr. Sheldon, that the information had to be disclosed. Mr. Sheldon responded that the information the bankruptcy court and Fliss were looking for had already been produced:\n  </p>\n<blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   THE COURT: I just remembered, this isn't the first time I've made it clear that this information has to be disclosed. I remember being incredulous, and nobody knows where what is this, $300,000 payment?\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   MR. SCHECHTER: 240,000.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   THE COURT: 240, and nobody knows-\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   MR. SHELDON: Which we provided proof of.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   THE COURT:-who made it, and where it is.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   MR. SHELDON: Which we provided proof of, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   THE COURT: But you got to convince me you're making sense.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   MR. SHELDON: Judge, you haven't seen the documents, respectfully.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   THE COURT: He hasn't seen them because you won't give them to him.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   MR. SHELDON: No, you haven't seen them. Mr. Schechter has documents. Respectfully, Your Honor, everything Mr. Schechter argues seems to be taken as the gospel.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   THE COURT: It doesn't, we just want the information. We don't know what-\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   MR. SHELDON: He has information, Your Honor. He has hundreds of pages about this.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   THE COURT: We'll talk about it Wednesday. I want to-you tell them who these other entities are, who their principals are, and we'll see whether your response will remain in good faith.\n  </blockquote>\n<p id=\"p-38\">\n<em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-39\">\n   On December 21, 2016, the parties appeared again before the bankruptcy court. Fliss's counsel represented that Generation Capital had not fully complied with the production requests because it had not produced operating agreements of the allegedly related entities, tax returns, bank statements, or anything related to the Trust. A-167 at 4. Fliss's counsel received the ownership information of the entities at issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n<em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. The bankruptcy court then ordered Generation Capital to turn over its bank records, stating that otherwise it would disallow the claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. Fliss's counsel asked the bankruptcy court if he could also have bank records from non-parties Generation II and the Trust.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. Over objection, the bankruptcy court ordered Generation Capital, as well as non-parties Lawrence Wojciak, his wife Sherry, his son Matthew, Generation II, and the Trust to produce bank records, financial account records, and tax returns from April 2009 to December 2016-all by December 30, 2016. A-131.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-40\">\n   On January 5, 2017, the parties appeared before the bankruptcy court. Generation Capital's counsel indicated that it had filed two affidavits with the court that indicated that all available documents had been produced by December 30, 2016, and that the Wojciaks had requested additional documents from their bank regarding the Generation Capital entities. A-186 at 2; A-Supp. 1; A-Supp. 3. The affidavits also attested to the ownership of the Generation Capital entities and to the payment made from Generation II to Barrington Bank. A-Supp. 3 at \u00b6 12. When the bankruptcy court questioned why the full records had not been produced, Generation Capital's counsel argued that the Wojciaks were given approximately one week to produce seven years of bank statements. A-186 at 8. The bankruptcy court responded to that assertion by stating, \"The bank can do it. Pay them whatever, a $15 fee, and they can pull it up on a computer....This is the age of digital information. All sorts of information are available instantly. That's our new claim to fame....I didn't say your client is a liar. I'm saying I'm not convinced that the information is not available.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. The bankruptcy court and Generation Capital's counsel then had the following exchange:\n  </p>\n<blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   MR. SHELDON: Why would we withhold it knowing, Your Honor, we would come here today-\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   THE COURT: I'm just a judge. I can't read somebody's mind.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   MR. SHELDON: Let's think about this logically, Your Honor. Knowing-considering\n   every time come here, I'm on the defensive, even though we have a state court judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   THE COURT: You're not on the defensive.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   MR. SHELDON: Every time.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   THE COURT: You have full, unlimited opportunity to cooperate with court orders.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   MR. SHELDON: And that's what we're trying to do. So think about this logically. Mrs. Wojciak, according to Your Honor, is going to make this statement knowing that I'm going to come to court today and either order-\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   THE COURT: What do you mean \"according to Your Honor\"? What does that mean \"according to Your Honor\"?\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   MR. SHELDON: I'm asking-under what you just said, I'm asking you to consider this logically. Mrs. Wojciak is going to make this statement\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   THE COURT: I'm not logical?\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   MR. SHELDON: No. I'm asking Your Honor to think about this logically from our perspective. Mrs. Wojciak is going to put this in an affidavit that she made this request knowing that we're going to come to court today and, again, be on the defensive, and Your Honor is either going to disallow our claim or order us to produce these documents. So why lie about that? We will produce the documents as soon as we get them from Charles Schwab.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   THE COURT: I didn't say anybody was lying.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   MR. SHELDON: You just said it's a digital age, and Charles Schwab should have given them to us immediately.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   THE COURT: You haven't given me any information that Charles Schwab could not or would not produce all the information.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   MR. SHELDON: It says in the affidavit attached-\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   THE COURT: I have to hear that from Schwab.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   MR. SHELDON: So I should get an affidavit from Schwab?\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   THE COURT: I'm not telling you what to do. Anything further?\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   MR. SHELDON: If we could just have some reasonable timeframe to produce seven years of tax-I'm sorry-of bank statements. That's all I'm asking, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n<p id=\"p-60\">\n<em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-11.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-61\">\n   Fliss's counsel informed the bankruptcy court that Generation Capital had produced two pages of a 16 page statement for the month that allegedly included the wire transfer between Barrington Bank and Generation II.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Mr. Sheldon responded that that was the first time Fliss's counsel addressed the issue with him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. The bankruptcy court then asked Fliss's counsel, \"Mr. Schechter, what are you asking me to do?\" to which he responded, \"I'm asking you to disallow the proof of claim filed by Generation Capital I, LLC, as a sanction for failure to comply with the court's order.\" A-186 at 13. The bankruptcy court granted the motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The bankruptcy court made no effort to verify the truth of Fliss's counsel's representations or determine whether Generation Capital had in fact produced the relevant documents.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-62\">\n   Generation Capital's counsel asked for a rationale for the bankruptcy court's disallowance of the Claim based on the state court judgment. The bankruptcy court responded that it \"[didn't] know what a state court judge did or said.\" Mr. Sheldon continued to press the court for a rationale:\n  </p>\n<blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   MR. SHELDON: You have [the judgment].\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   THE COURT: You filed a proof of claim. We want to know what the history of payment is.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   MR. SHELDON: And you've seen it.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   THE COURT: I have a duty to figure out whether the debtor has a right to some kind of credit or offset for some prior payment.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   MR. SHELDON: Your Honor, you have the judgment. You have three years of litigation in state court.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   THE COURT: I do. I have the judgment. But I've also been told there is a transfer. You won't give me the information about the transfer.\n  </blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   MR.

A-132. On January 12, 2017, the bankruptcy court held the confirmation hearing. Because Generation Capital's Claim was disallowed and no other objections were pending, the bankruptcy court confirmed the Chapter 13 Plan.

Generation Capital was given until December 9, 2016-less than three weeks, despite the Thanksgiving holiday-to respond to 16 discovery requests. On December 21, 2016, the bankruptcy court ordered Generation Capital to produce seven years of records of information related to the Generation Capital entities, the Wojciaks, and the Trust, by December 30, 2016. This nine-day period included the Christmas holiday. The Wojciaks filed affidavits on December 30, 2016, indicating that they had produced the documents they had in their possession and had requested the remaining documents. The bankruptcy court disregarded those affidavits and instead relied only on representations made by Fliss's counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The bankruptcy court made no effort to verify the truth of Fliss's representations, even after Mr. Sheldon informed the bankruptcy court that there were disputes as to what information had been produced.

The court noted that despite the lesser sanctions of attorney's fees, the debtors had continued to defy the court by failing to turn over the required documents. The record here, however, does not reveal that the bankruptcy court gave any consideration to alternative, lesser sanctions. In fact, it appears the bankruptcy court was inclined to disallow the Claim from the very first hearing (A-136 at 9), and made its rulings based on that initial presumption. It never considered imposing lesser sanctions such as monetary sanctions before imposing the harsh sanction of dismissal. And it appeared to give little consideration to the affidavits filed by the\n   Wojciaks or even the state court judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-86\">\n   Other courts have imposed less severe sanctions for much worse conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<em>\n    e360 Insight,\n   </em>\n<extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836363\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/637/#p642\">\n    658 F.3d at 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming decision of district court to impose monetary sanctions for a party's repeated failure to appear for deposition and provide answers to discovery);\n   <em>\n    Cohn v.

There is no indication Fliss would have been prejudiced by waiting a few more weeks to receive the bank records or that the parties were on a tight timeline. Further, it is unclear how the dismissal sanction could serve the purpose of punishment or deterrence after Generation Capital repeatedly represented to the bankruptcy court through both affidavits and oral argument that the Wojciaks did not have the records in their possession.
