(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 21, 22) Prior to May 1, 2014, LaRocca was a member of the Debtor's board of directors. (Compl. \u00b6 15; Mot., Ex. C, pp. 3-4) Beginning in 2010, the officers of the Debtor concocted and implemented four schemes that enabled the Debtor to charge national exchange carriers with illegal tariffs. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-70) In 2012 and in response to these tariffs, the carriers began to withhold payments from the Debtor. (Compl. \u00b6 71)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The officers first disclosed to the board that the carriers were disputing the tariffs levied by the Debtor in January 2013. (Compl. \u00b6 73) However, the officers did not reveal the true nature of these disputes. (Compl. \u00b6 73) Instead, the officers described them as \"billing disputes\" that were mere \"collection issues.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 73, 105)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 26, 2014, certain carriers filed an informal complaint against the Debtor and its alleged third party co-conspirators with the Federal Communications Commission (the \"FCC\"). (Compl. \u00b6 75) The officers provided the board with a copy of the informal complaint in early March 2014, but did not disclose the true nature of the disputes or the risks associated with them. (Compl. \u00b6 75; Mot., Ex. A, p. 3) Instead, the officers informed the board at a board meeting on March 6, 2014 that the informal complaint was an \"\n   <em>\n    opportunity\n   </em>\n   that would 'hopefully bring negotiations to a head' \" and continued to refer to the carriers' complaints simply as billing disputes. (Compl. \u00b6 75 (emphasis in original); Mot., Ex. A, pp. 3-4) During the board meeting, the officers disclosed to the board that the carriers were withholding $25 million from the Debtor as a result of the billing disputes. (Compl. \u00b6 75; Mot., Ex. A, p. 2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At no time between 2010 and April 2014 did the officers mention to the board their schemes or the carriers' specific complaints, many of which had been communicated to the officers in writing. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 74, 121) The officers' concealment of their schemes \"began to crumble as of April 2014\" when another carrier filed a second informal complaint with the FCC that actually detailed the officers' schemes. (Compl. \u00b6 79) The board was informed for the first time in April 2014 that the Debtor was losing money and that cash flow was \"extremely tight.\" (Compl. \u00b6 79) According to the minutes from the board meeting on April 28, 2014, \"the total amount due from the [carriers was] between $50 and $60 million.\" (Mot., Ex. B, p. 2) The officers apprised the board that the Debtor would need to seek capital infusions or new loans to \"cover growth\" while it sought to resolve the billing disputes. (Compl. \u00b6 79; Mot., Ex. B, p. 2) Three days later, LaRocca's term on the board expired.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Mot., Ex. C, pp. 3-4)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The facts underlying the officers' schemes were \"likely\" unknown to the board until a formal complaint was filed with the FCC by one of the carriers in October 2014, approximately five months after LaRocca had left the board. (Compl. \u00b6 121) Even after disclosure to the board, the officers' schemes continued until April 2015. (Compl. \u00b6 149) With its financial condition imperiled as a result of the schemes, the Debtor filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 on January 25, 2016. (Compl. \u00b6 2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 27, 2017, the court confirmed the Debtor's plan of liquidation [Dkt. No. 737], which established the GLC Liquidation Trust. (Compl. \u00b6 11) Upon the effective date of the plan [Dkt. No. 742], the Debtor's assets, including the cause of the action against LaRocca, vested in the GLC Liquidation Trust. (Compl. \u00b6 11)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Trustee commenced this adversary proceeding by filing a Complaint against the Debtor's officers and directors, among others, on November 10, 2017 [Adv. Dkt. No. 1]. The Complaint is comprised of fifteen causes of action. With respect to LaRocca, the Complaint alleges only that\n   he breached his fiduciary duties to the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In lieu of answering the Complaint, LaRocca filed the Motion.

The court disagrees for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    1.

Those decisions all arose in the context of a motion to dismiss filed in a derivative suit. Because they are based on Rule 23.1 and similar procedural rules under applicable state law, they examine whether a claim for relief has been stated by employing the heightened pleading standard of particularity.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Melbourne Mun.

This court therefore finds\n   <em>\n    Caremark\n   </em>\n   and other decisions in the context of derivative suits procedurally unpersuasive at this stage of the litigation. It is simply unnecessary for the Trustee to satisfy the heightened pleading standard required in derivative suits under Rule 23.1 and its state law counterparts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Nevertheless, LaRocca argues that this court should look to Delaware law because in the absence of \"clear\" Michigan law on corporate matters, Michigan courts refer to Delaware law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Glancy v.

The court must therefore determine whether, as a matter of law, the facts alleged by the Trustee are sufficient to put a reasonably prudent person in a similar position on notice of a need to further investigate the Debtor's affairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Taking the facts alleged in the Complaint as true, the court concludes that the Trustee has plausibly stated a claim against LaRocca for breach of his duty of care under the MBCA. First, there can be no dispute that LaRocca owed a duty of care to the Debtor pursuant to the MBCA. LaRocca was clearly a member of the Debtor's board of directors until May 1, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Second, the Complaint relies on the following facts to support the allegation that LaRocca should have investigated prior to leaving the board:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   \u2022 The informal complaint filed with the FCC in late February 2014 was disclosed to, and shared with, LaRocca in early March 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \u2022 During the board meeting on March 6, 2014, LaRocca was informed that the billing disputes had caused an increase in accounts receivable and accrued liabilities, and that the reserve balance related to the disputes was $25 million.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   \u2022 The board, including LaRocca, authorized a stock offering valued at approximately $10 million on March 31, 2014 after learning the billing disputes had caused cash flow issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   \u2022 Sometime on or before April 28, 2014, LaRocca learned of the second informal complaint filed with the FCC on April 4, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   \u2022 The officers informed LaRocca on April 28, 2014 that the Debtor would post a significant loss due to the billing disputes with its customers,\n   which had cost the Debtor between $50-60 million in revenues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   \u2022 The officers told LaRocca on April 28, 2014 that additional funds were needed due to tight cash flow.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 75, 80, 79; Mot., Ex. A, pp. 2-3; Ex. B, p. 2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Trustee contends that the informal complaints filed with the FCC before April 2014 were at least some evidence of the officers' misconduct even if not enough, standing alone, to put LaRocca on notice of the need to investigate further. (Compl. \u00b6 75) Beginning in April 2014, the Complaint alleges that LaRocca should have recognized, and acted upon, these extraordinary facts by making further inquiry. (Compl. \u00b6 79) While these facts likely do not rise to the level of red flags relied upon by courts applying Delaware law, they are sufficient to plead a breach under Michigan law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Third and finally, the Complaint plausibly states that LaRocca's breach resulted in damages to the Debtor. The Complaint asserts that the officers' schemes and the resulting order from the FCC imposing significant liability caused foreseeable damage to the Debtor, ultimately resulting in its bankruptcy filing. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 89, 94) The Complaint further alleges that many of the penalties, liabilities and damage claims arising from the FCC order accrued after the time when the board, including LaRocca, was aware of the officers' schemes and failed to take remedial action. (Compl. \u00b6 95) Specifically, the Complaint alleges that the breach of fiduciary duty by the board members allowed the officers' schemes to continue for approximately another year until the schemes were finally ended in April of 2015. (Compl. \u00b6 149) The Complaint plausibly alleges that additional damages to the Debtor accrued during this period due to the board's breaches. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 149-150)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   LaRocca argues that he should be treated differently from the other director-defendants because he left the board on May 1, 2014. While the court agrees that LaRocca's situation is more attenuated than the other director-defendants, LaRocca still had a duty to exercise his oversight responsibilities until his last day of service to the Debtor. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 146-147) The Complaint alleges just enough by stating that LaRocca had knowledge of information that should have caused a reasonably prudent person to investigate prior to his departure from the board on May 1, 2014. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 79-83, 148-149) When LaRocca did not take steps consistent with his oversight duties, the officers' schemes continued until April 2015 and ultimately forced the Debtor to file for bankruptcy. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 148-150) The Trustee has alleged sufficient facts in support of causation. By plausibly stating a claim for breach of the duty of care, the Trustee has rebutted the business judgment rule, to the extent it applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     E. LaRocca's Affirmative Defense Forecloses the Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Although the Trustee has plausibly stated a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, the court must still consider LaRocca's defense to the claim as set forth on the face of the Complaint. In his Motion, LaRocca points to the officers' numerous misrepresentations and other efforts to conceal their schemes from the board. Relying on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20450\">\n    Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .1541a(2)(a), LaRocca argues that the officers' conduct, as alleged in the Complaint and supplemented by the meeting minutes, provides him with a defense to the Trustee's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Trustee disagrees, of course. The Trustee argues that although LaRocca may have relied on the officers' representations, such reliance was unreasonable under\n   the circumstances. Moreover, according to the Trustee, reasonable reliance is a question of fact that should not be addressed in connection with a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The MBCA permits a director of a Michigan corporation to rely on information, reports and statements, among other things, presented by directors, officers and employees of the corporation who such officer or director \"reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20450\">\n    Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .1541a(2)(a). Only where a director has \"knowledge concerning the matter in question that makes [such] reliance...unwarranted\" is the defense inapplicable.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20450\">\n    Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .1541a(3). Although Michigan courts do not appear to have considered the issue, this court concludes that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20450\">\n    Mich. Comp.

PNC Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869679\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/920/#p926\">\n    714 F.3d 920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 926 (6th Cir. 2013) ;\n   <em>\n    Lockhart v.

Comp. Laws \u00a7 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .1541a(2)(a). The court agrees. While a director's reasonable reliance is usually a question of fact, the face of the Complaint establishes LaRocca's defense. LaRocca was wholly attentive to the affairs of the Debtor. He appears to have regularly attended and participated in board meetings. The Complaint does not state otherwise, nor does it suggest that he was derelict in his duties. Rather, the Complaint emphasizes the great lengths undertaken by the officers to deceive LaRocca and the other board members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The first informal complaint was filed with the FCC in late February 2014. (Compl. \u00b6 75) It was disclosed and given to the board either before or during the board meeting on March 6, 2014. (Compl. \u00b6 75; Mot., Ex. A, p. 3) However, the first informal complaint did not contain any allegations regarding the officers' schemes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, much like in\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   , the officers\n   continued to mislead the board by misrepresenting the first informal complaint as a by product of billing disputes with the carriers. (Compl. \u00b6 75) During the board meeting on March 6, 2014, \"there was no discussion of the risks posed by the [informal FCC complaint] other than a strain on company resources that would likely result in answering the complaint.\" (Compl. \u00b6 75) The officers informed the board that they viewed the informal FCC complaint as an \"opportunity,\" not a risk. (Compl. \u00b6 75)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The second informal complaint was filed in early April 2014. (Compl. \u00b6 79) Unlike the first informal complaint, the second informal complaint apparently did allege the schemes perpetrated by the officers. (Compl. \u00b6 79) The Complaint does not state that a copy of the second informal complaint was ever given to LaRocca prior to the conclusion of his term. The court infers that it was not, because the board meeting minutes state that the first informal complaint was given to the board. (Mot., Ex. A, p. 2) The meeting minutes are silent, however, with respect to the second informal complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Throughout April 2014, the officers continued to obscure the details of their schemes from the board, casting the Debtor as the \"victim\" of the carriers' billing disputes. (Compl. \u00b6 76) The Complaint states that the officers' schemes were \"likely\" not known to the board until the\n   <em>\n    formal\n   </em>\n   complaint was filed with the FCC in October 2014, more than five months after LaRocca had left the board. (Compl. \u00b6 121) To some extent, such an allegation renders the Complaint self-defeating, as LaRocca left the board approximately five months earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   According to the Complaint, not only were the officers' schemes hidden from the board until October 2014, but the board was overtly misled by the officers. (Compl. \u00b6 121) The officers told the board that as a result of the billing disputes (not the schemes), the Debtor's \"cash flow was 'extremely tight,' \" thereby necessitating additional funds. (Compl. \u00b6 79) The Complaint makes it clear that LaRocca reasonably relied on the officers' representations that in order to ensure continued \"growth,\" additional funds were needed, whether through loans, capital contributions or stock offerings. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 79, 80; Mot., Ex. B, p. 2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Finally, the strategy of misdirection employed by the officers cannot be overlooked. The meeting minutes reveal that the officers furthered their schemes by pretending to act with transparency. First, the meeting minutes from March 6, 2014 reveal that the Debtor had previously retained legal counsel to assist it with the first informal complaint. (Mot., Ex. A, p. 4) LaRocca could therefore reasonably rely on the fact that legal counsel was involved and working with the Debtor to resolve the billing disputes.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20450\">\n    Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .1541a(2)(b). Second, the officers informed the board that they would, and in fact did, cause the Debtor to file a complaint with the Michigan Public Service Commission against the carriers. (Mot., Ex. A, p. 4) Third, the officers reported to the board that discussions with the majority of carriers remained ongoing and that mediation of the disputes had been scheduled. (Mot., Ex. A, p. 4) Fourth, in an effort to further legitimize their misrepresentations, the officers told the board that they had informed the Debtor's secured lender of the billing disputes and the first informal complaint. (Mot., Ex. A, p. 4) By leading the board to believe that they were proactively and productively pursuing resolution of the billing disputes, the officers, like the manager in\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   , further masked the true cause of the Debtor's financial distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In the aggregate, the Complaint states that the board reasonably relied on the officers' misrepresentations no less than seven times. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 120-122, 129, 136-138) The facts made known to LaRocca during his tenure on the board were cloaked by the officers' continued misrepresentations and concealment, as expressly alleged in the Complaint. This is particularly true because LaRocca was no longer serving on the board when the directors \"likely\" first became aware of the schemes in October 2014. (Compl. \u00b6 121)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The court concludes that the face of the Complaint demonstrates that LaRocca reasonably relied on the Debtor's officers. Because the Complaint fails to allege, beyond conclusory statements, that LaRocca had knowledge of the schemes or specific information that would otherwise provide him with that knowledge,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20450\">\n    Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .1541a(3) does not negate his defense. The Trustee's claim against LaRocca for breach of the duty of care is therefore foreclosed under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20450\">\n    Mich.

Michigan courts have not addressed this issue. Because Michigan courts have previously applied the business judgment rule to claims for breach of the duty of care, this court will assume that the business judgment rule applies to the Trustee's claim against LaRocca for breach of the duty of care. Regardless of whether the business judgment rule applies, the court's decision would not change. This is ultimately a question for the Michigan courts to answer.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    The parties have not directed this court to any authority from the state or federal courts in Michigan adopting the use of \"red flags\" for purposes of pleading breach of fiduciary duty claims under Michigan law.

While including a director's oversight obligations as part of the duty of care is inconsistent with recent decisions applying Delaware law in derivative suits, Michigan law controls for purposes of this dispute.
