R &amp; J argues that the bankruptcy court erred because the jewelry was excluded from Ms. Sorensen's estate by \u00a7 541(b)(8), and she could not extend her right to redeem the property through the bankruptcy process. We AFFIRM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   R &amp; J is a licensed pawnbroker in the state of California. In March 2016, Ms. Sorensen pledged five pieces of jewelry as collateral for five pawn loans with R &amp; J. Four months later, she obtained replacement loans that had a termination date of November 18, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Prior to the termination date of the loans, Ms. Sorensen filed for chapter 13 bankruptcy protection. Her schedules identified R &amp; J as a creditor holding claims secured by the pawned jewelry. Her proposed chapter 13 plan listed R &amp; J as a secured creditor and sought to repay the loans and retain the jewelry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 18, 2016, R &amp; J issued a notice of loan termination, providing a ten-day right to redemption required by state law. Ms. Sorensen did not redeem the jewelry during the ten-day period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ms. Sorensen filed an amended chapter 13 plan,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which again identified R &amp; J as a secured creditor and proposed to make $50 monthly payments on each of the five loans. R &amp; J did not oppose plan confirmation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Meanwhile, counsel for R &amp; J and Ms. Sorensen communicated about the status and characterization of the pawn loans. R &amp; J offered Ms. Sorensen two more extensions of her redemption rights; the final deadline was March 3, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 1, Ms. Sorensen filed an adversary proceeding complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief against R &amp; J. She requested that the court issue an injunction preventing R &amp; J from disposing of the jewelry, which she contended was part of the bankruptcy estate and therefore subject to the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ms. Sorensen also filed an application for a temporary restraining order (\"TRO Motion\") to prevent R &amp; J from disposing of the jewelry. She argued that she satisfied the standard for a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") because she had \"every intention to retain the liens and make payment on those liens to redeem possession of her jewelry, [and] she had clearly stated her intentions to retain the liens and redeem the property in her Chapter 13 Plan ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In opposition to the TRO Motion, R &amp; J argued that Ms. Sorensen was unlikely to succeed on the merits because the jewelry was excluded from the bankruptcy estate pursuant to \u00a7 541(b)(8). It contended that, under \u00a7 541(b)(8)(C) and \u00a7 108(b), the redemption period relevant to a pawn loan expires on the later of (1) the loan termination date under state or local law or (2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   sixty days from the date of the bankruptcy filing. Under California law, Ms. Sorensen had four months (until November 18, 2016) to redeem her jewelry; R &amp; J then issued the statutorily-required grace notice extending the right of redemption until November 28. It contended that, because Ms. Sorensen did not redeem her property within the statutory period, the jewelry was excluded from the bankruptcy estate under \u00a7 541(b)(8), and the automatic stay never applied to the jewelry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 28, 2017, the bankruptcy court confirmed Ms. Sorensen's amended plan. Later that same day, the bankruptcy court heard Ms. Sorensen's TRO Motion. In light of the earlier plan confirmation and additional arguments raised by Ms. Sorensen, the bankruptcy court ordered supplemental briefing and continued the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On March 31, R &amp; J filed a motion to dismiss the adversary complaint (\"Motion to Dismiss\") under Civil Rules 12(b)(1) and (b)(6), made applicable in bankruptcy by Rule 7012(b), arguing that the bankruptcy court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the pawned jewelry because it was excluded from the bankruptcy estate. It repeated that, under \u00a7 541(b)(8), the jewelry was not part of the bankruptcy estate: due to Ms. Sorensen's and \"the Trustee's failure to redeem the property in the statutorily prescribed time limit, the property never entered the bankruptcy estate. If Plaintiff wished to include the pledged items in the estate, Plaintiff was required to redeem them pursuant to Section 541(b)(8)(C) and Section 108(b).\" It also argued that Ms. Sorensen failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted: the \"automatic stay does not in any way affect the statutory redemption period of Section 108 and Section 541(b)(8)(C). Plaintiff has not alleged, and cannot allege, that Debtor-Plaintiff or the Trustee attempted to redeem the property within the time prescribed by Section 108.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following a hearing on the continued TRO Motion and the Motion to Dismiss, the bankruptcy court orally held that (1) R &amp; J's notice of loan termination was likely void for violating the automatic stay; and (2) Ms. Sorensen's confirmed chapter 13 plan-including its treatment of the jewelry-was binding on the parties. It considered the interplay between three factors: state law, bankruptcy law, and the confirmed plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   First, the court noted that California law allows a four-month loan period that expired on November 18, 2016. At that time, if R &amp; J properly provided statutory notice and a ten-day redemption period to Ms. Sorensen, then, \"[p]ursuant to California Finance Code Section 21201, R &amp; J would be vested with all right, title, and interest in the jewelry after the expiration of the ten-day period.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Second, the bankruptcy court considered how Ms. Sorensen's bankruptcy case affected the parties' rights. It stated that, when she filed her petition, her estate included her option to redeem the jewelry. However, under \u00a7 541(b)(8), certain tangible property pledged to pawnbrokers is excluded from property of the estate unless the debtor redeems the property within the time allowed under \u00a7 108(b). That section provides that the redemption period is the later of sixty days after the petition is filed or the period set by state law. But the bankruptcy court noted that the time period under state law had not expired because the ten-day notice that R &amp; J sent violated the automatic stay:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Here, R &amp; J never sent a proper notice of loan termination. Section 362(a)(6) enjoins any act to collect, [assess], or recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the property of the-the commencement of the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Nothing in 541(b)(8), which is the section that talks about ownership[ ] of these assets[,] creates an exception to the automatic stay. So relief from stay is required before any collection action can begin. And the reference here is 5 Collier on Bankruptcy, at 541-paragraph 541.24.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   R &amp; J never moved for relief from stay, which likely would have been granted in view of Section 541(b)(8). And it would have allowed R &amp; J to send the notice required by California law. As everyone knows, actions taken in violation of the stay are void. So it is as if R &amp; J never sent the notice and the ten-day redemption period never began. Accordingly, title to the property was never vested in R &amp; J.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Third, the bankruptcy court considered the effect of Ms. Sorensen's confirmed plan. It stated that the plan controlled the disposition of the jewelry under \u00a7 1327(a) and\n   <em>\n    Espinosa v. United Student Aid Funds, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3718001,3289977\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/553/1193/\">\n    553 F.3d 1193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2008),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581753,12447239\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/260/\">\n    559 U.S. 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799137\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/130/1367/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581753,12447239\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/260/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). The court entered an order granting the TRO Motion and denying the Motion to Dismiss (\"Order\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   R &amp; J filed a timely notice of appeal from the Order and a motion for leave to appeal. The BAP motions panel remanded the case to the bankruptcy court for a determination whether the Order granted a TRO, and is thus interlocutory, or whether the Order granted a preliminary injunction and is immediately reviewable on appeal. The bankruptcy court clarified that, despite language indicative of a TRO, the Order constituted a preliminary injunction. The bankruptcy court also supplemented the reasoning behind the Order, stating that Ms. Sorensen sought to retain ownership of the jewelry through a confirmed plan that \"treated the Property as collateral for a secured claim held by R &amp; J and called for payment of that secured claim over time. R &amp; J did not object to any of Plaintiff's Chapter 13 plans.... The Court continues to believe the confirmed Chapter 13 plan controls the Property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The bankruptcy court had jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 157(b)(1) and (b)(2)(B).

BAP 2017) (\"The nature and extent of the debtor's interests in property must be determined by nonbankruptcy law.\"); Cal. Fin. Code. \u00a7 21201(a), (f). The bankruptcy court correctly held that her estate included her right to redeem her jewelry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Under California law, \u00a7 541(b)(8) does not automatically exclude pawned property from the bankruptcy estate without notice to the pawnor.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   R &amp; J argues that the plain language of \u00a7 541(b)(8) automatically exempts the pawned property from the bankruptcy estate. That subsection provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (b) Property of the estate does not include-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (8) subject to subchapter III of chapter 5, any interest of the debtor in property where the debtor pledged or sold tangible personal property (other than securities or written or printed evidences of indebtedness or title) as collateral for a loan or advance of money given by a person licensed under law to make such loans or advances, where-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (A) the tangible personal property is in the possession of the pledgee or transferee;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (B) the debtor has no obligation to repay the money, redeem the collateral, or buy back the property at a stipulated price; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (C) neither the debtor nor the trustee have exercised any right to redeem provided under the contract or State law, in a timely manner as provided under State law and section 108(b)[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00a7 541(b)(8). The parties do not dispute that subsections (A) and (B) are satisfied; only (C) is at issue in this appeal. We thus look to \u00a7 108(b) and the relevant state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Section 108(b) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (b) Except as provided in subsection (a) of this section, if applicable nonbankruptcy law, an order entered in a nonbankruptcy proceeding, or an agreement fixes a period within which the debtor or\n   an individual protected under section 1201 or 1301 of this title may file any pleading, demand, notice, or proof of claim or loss, cure a default, or perform any other similar act, and such period has not expired before the date of the filing of the petition, the trustee may only file, cure, or perform, as the case may be, before the later of-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (1) the end of such period, including any suspension of such period occurring on or after the commencement of the case; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (2) 60 days after the order for relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00a7 108(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In this case, California law provides the longer period for redemption of pawned property.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    Northington\n   </em>\n   , the Eleventh Circuit held that, under state law automatically vesting title in the pawnbroker at the expiration of the redemption period, the pawned property \"dropped out\" of the estate pursuant to \u00a7 541(b)(8).\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269572,12267198\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/876/1302/\">\n    876 F.3d at 1306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, the debtor failed to redeem prepetition pawned property, and the pawnbroker sought relief from stay and argued that the property was excluded from the estate pursuant to \u00a7 541(b)(8). The Eleventh Circuit started with the proposition that the debtor's interest in the pawned property became property of the estate when he filed his bankruptcy petition.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269572,12267198\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/876/1302/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269572,12267198\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/876/1302/\">\n    at 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court held that, by operation of state law, the pawned property \"dropped out\" of the estate:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Properly understood, the Bankruptcy Code takes an estate's constituent property interests as it finds them. If an asset is by its state-law nature static, then it remains so in the bankruptcy estate.\n   <strong>\n    If, by contrast-as is often the case-state law imbues an estate asset with a sort of internal dynamism, then that characteristic will follow the asset into the estate\n   </strong>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   But increase will not always be the result-sometimes the dynamism will reduce (or even eliminate) an asset's value. Think, for instance, about a debtor whose bankruptcy estate includes an option contract. If the debtor fails to exercise the option in accordance with state law, then the right to buy disappears. This case reflects the same basic phenomenon. Under Georgia's pawn statute, following his loan's maturity date, Wilber had a conditional right to possess the Charger as well as a right to redeem it during the statutory period. But after the expiration of the prescribed period, Wilber had no rights in the car, possessory or otherwise. Rather, his rights had been \"automatically ... extinguished\" and \"automatically forfeited to [TitleMax].\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269572,12267198\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/876/1302/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269572,12267198\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/876/1302/\">\n    at 1314-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   We agree with the\n   <em>\n    Northington\n   </em>\n   court's analysis,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   but the result here is different because Georgia's pawnshop law differs from California's.
