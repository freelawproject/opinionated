Laney, III, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n   This case is before the Court on cross Motions for Summary Judgment filed by AgGeorgia Farm Credit, ACA, the Plaintiff (\"AgGeorgia\"), and James F. Carter, a defendant. Defendants J. Walt Carter (herein \"Walt Carter\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Carter and Sons Farms, LLC did not oppose AgGeorgia's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court heard oral arguments on this matter on May 9, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Having carefully considered the arguments set forth in the parties' briefs and in oral argument, the Court has determined the matter before it is ultimately a question of law and there is no dispute of material fact. Therefore, the Court GRANTS summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 18, 2013, Carter and Sons LLC (\"Carter and Sons\"), an entity solely owned by Walt Carter, purchased 5.02 acres of real estate in Echols County from James Carter. (Compl. (AP No. 1) \u00b6 11; Admitted in James Carter's Answer (AP No. 11) \u00b6 11). That $1.675 million purchase (the \"Packing Shed Purchase\") was financed through two notes. James Carter extended a $900,000 unsecured loan to Walt Carter. AgGeorgia also extended a $605,770 loan (the \"2013 Loan\") to Carter and Sons, which Walt Carter guaranteed. (Plaintiff's Statement of Uncontested Material Facts as Required by M.D. LBR 7056 (AP No. 35) [herein \"7056 Statement\"] \u00b6 1; Admitted by failure to explicitly deny in James Carter's Reply to 7056 Statement (AP No. 40) \u00b6 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The 2013 Loan was secured by various conveyances of collateral. First, Walt Carter and Carter and Sons granted a security interest in the purchased real estate. (Compl. \u00b6 13; Admitted in Walt Carter's Answer \u00b6 13). Additionally, to facilitate the financing of the transaction, James Carter granted a security interest in two tracts of property located in Lowndes County. (7056 Statement \u00b6 4; Admitted by failure to explicitly deny in James Carter's Response to 7056 Statement \u00b6 4). James Carter's grant of a security interest was not eleemosynary. The proceeds of the Packing Shed Purchase offset James Carter's prior obligation to AgGeorgia. (7056 Statement \u00b6 2; James Carters' Response to 7056 Statement \u00b6 2). Further, the property James Carter pledged to finance the Packing Shed Purchase was the same property pledged in his prior obligation to AgGeorgia. (Oral Arg. (AP No. 42) at 59:37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   James Carter memorialized his grant of this security interest in two documents. First, he executed a deed to secure debt (the \"Deed to Secure Debt\"). In addition to securing the funds financing the Packing Shed Purchase, the Deed to Secure Deed contained an \"open-end clause.\" (7056 Statement; Admitted by failure to explicitly deny in James Carter's Response to 7056 Statement \u00b6 4). That clause extended the security interest to \"all additional loans\n   and advances that may subsequently be made to [Walt Carter] (or to any one or more of the parties designated as Undersigned or Borrower, with the written consent of the remainder of said Undersigned or Borrower) by [AgGeorgia.]\" (James Carter's Brief in Response to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (AP No. 39) [herein \"James Carter's Brief\"] Ex. 4 Pg. 2). The Deed to Secure Debt was recorded in the Lowndes County real estate records on March 19, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    To the best of the parties' knowledge, they are not aware of any direct relation between James Carter and Walt Carter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The plan treats AgGeorgia's claims as secured. AgGeorgia opposes the plan's confirmation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    Second, James Carter signed a hypothecation agreement dated March 18, 2013 (the \"Hypothecation Agreement\"). (James Carter's Brief Ex. 5, Pg. 1) In the agreement, James Carter again granted a security interest in the same separately owned tracts in Lowndes County to secure Walt Carter's obligations under the 2013 Loan. Like the Deed to Secure Debt, the Hypothecation Agreement contained an open-end clause. That clause provided: \"[James Carter] agrees with the Lender that, to secure payment of the Liabilities (hereinafter defined), the Lender shall have a lien upon, security title to, and a security interest in [property owned by James Carter.]\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) The agreement defined \"Liabilities\" as \"all obligations of [Walt Carter] to the Lender, however incurred or evidenced...\n    <em>\n     now or hereafter existing, or due or to become due.\n    </em>\n    \" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) (emphasis added). Further, the agreement stated James Carter \"waives notice of the existence or creation of all or any of the Liabilities.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) The Hypothecation Agreement was recorded on March 19, 2013. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    Between 2013 and 2016 Walt Carter obtained additional loans from AgGeorgia. In 2014 Walt Carter obtained an operating loan from AgGeorgia. The record is unclear as to exactly when Walt Carter incurred that debt and the exact amount of the loan; however, the parties each acknowledged the existence of the loan in oral argument. (See Oral Arg. at 54:50-56:13 and 1:01:03-1:02:58). The parties also acknowledged AgGeorgia did not seek James Carter's consent to extend the 2014 security interest to this new loan. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). In 2015, Walt Carter obtained additional financing from AgGeorgia of approximately $802,000. For that loan, AgGeorgia did seek and obtain James Carter's consent. (James Carter's Brief, Ex. 6 and James Carter's Dep. Pgs. 49-52\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    In 2016, Walt Carter obtained a $1 million loan from AgGeorgia (\"the 2016 Note\"). (Compl. \u00b6 17 and Walt Carter's Ans. \u00b6 17). James Carter did not consent to the 2016 Note nor is there any evidence he was even aware of the loan. (James Carter's Resp. to 7056 Statement \u00b6 6). Nevertheless, AgGeorgia contends the security interests extend to the 2016 Note by operation of the open-end clauses in the Deed to Secure Debt and Hypothecation Agreement (together \"the Open-End Clauses\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      II.

Federal Courts in this and other districts have determined that a \"real and immediate threat of future injury\" may arise when the rights of the parties could be conclusively determined in imminent litigation.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Bayer CropScience, LP v.

N.Y. 1994).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    Here, it is clear that the declaratory judgment the plaintiff seeks pertains to the parties' current rights and obligations under the Deed to Secure Debt and Hypothecation Agreement and that an interpretation of those rights would concretely change the parties' contractual obligations. Therefore, AgGeorgia clearly has standing to assert the action. Further, although the bankruptcy proceedings cannot terminate AgGeorgia's liens as they relate to James Carter's property, the proceeding will alter Walt Carter's obligations to AgGeorgia. This will create a default under the terms of the note and will entitle AgGeorgia to seek enforcement of its security interest. Should AgGeorgia initiate a foreclosure proceeding, it would need to determine the lien's extent. James Carter's challenge to Open-End Clause therefore creates a real and immediate threat of future injury because a successful challenge would significantly reduce AgGeorgia's collateral securing the 2016 Note.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    This Court's jurisdiction over the matter, therefore, is the only remaining issue. The bankruptcy court through referral from the district court\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    has jurisdiction\n    over all civil proceedings \"arising in or related to a case under title 11.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b). A case is sufficiently \"related to\" the Bankruptcy Code \"if the proceeding could\n    <em>\n     conceivably\n    </em>\n    have any effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy.\"\n    <em>\n     Estate of Jackson v.

Therefore, the test within this circuit for determining whether a matter is sufficiently related to the Code to give a bankruptcy court jurisdiction is whether \"the outcome... in any way impacts upon the handling and administration of the bankrupt estate.\"\n    <em>\n     Estate of Jackson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269904,12267223\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/1325/\">\n     873 F.3d at 1337\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Pacor\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6560377,607691\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/743/984/\">\n     743 F.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    994 ) (internal quotations omitted). As previously discussed, whether the Open-End Clauses extend James Carter's grant of a security interest to the 2016 Note impacts both the security of AgGeorgia's claim and the disbursement of estate assets.

The Parties do not contest the execution of the documents nor do they dispute their authenticity. In fact, the issue before the Court is largely one of interpreting the rights between the parties as set forth in the Deed to Secure Debt and Hypothecation Agreement.

James Carter's cross-motion for summary judgment argues the Open-End Clauses are ambiguous and that the Court should interpret\n    the clauses to require JamesCarter's consent to apply his 2013 grant of a security interest to the 2016 Note. Further, James Carter argues O.C.G.A. \u00a7 44-14-1(b) limits the Open-End Clauses' application, as less than all of the parties to the contract consented to the agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      a.

The Deed to Secure Debt, he suggests, requires the consent of the \"remaining parties.\" While on the other hand, the Hypothecation Agreement waives James Carter's right to consent. Certainly, a court should find a conflicting document ambiguous.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Brevard, Inc. v.

The Hypothecation Agreement, however, resolves that ambiguity. The agreement unambiguously waives James Carter's right to \"notice of the existence or creation of all or any of [Walt Carter's future obligations to AgGeorgia].\" With such an explicit provision, the Court finds no conflicting language and that no ambiguity exists. The clear language in the Hypothecation Agreement ultimately distinguishes this case from the holding in\n    <em>\n     Clark\n    </em>\n    . Under Georgia law, a court should not interpret a contract to render an explicit provision \"meaningless\" or a \"mere surplusage.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    <em>\n     Duke Galish, LLC v.

This argument fails because under Georgia Law a court must find ambiguity in the contract to consider extrinsic evidence.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Davis v. United Amer.

Accordingly, no ambiguity exists and the Court is prohibited from using the 2015 consent to interpret the parties' rights under the agreement. Even if the Court did consider the document, it would not change its interpretation. Though Walt Carter loaned money from AgGeorgia in the years between 2014 and 2016, AgGeorgia only requested James Carter's consent in 2015. One request for consent between the parties over the course of three years does not create a general course of conduct that any fact finder could reasonably infer reflected the parties' understanding of the agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Further, the 2015 Consent Agreement was not, as James Carter additionally argued, an implicit waiver of the Hypothecation Agreement. First, procedural issues arise in asserting this argument. James Carter did not plead the affirmative defense of Waiver in his Answer, as required by FRBP 7008(c)(1). Additionally, there is no evidence in the record supporting AgGeorgia's actions were a waiver of their rights under the Hypothecation Agreement. Georgia law provides that, although a party may waive a contractual right implicitly, the facts surrounding the purported waiver \"must amount to an intentional relinquishment of a known right.\"\n    <em>\n     Goldsmith v.

When one of the borrowers incurred additional debt with the lender, the lender argued the debt was secured through the extension of an open-end clause, even without the other borrower's consent. To support this argument, the lender pointed to security deed's definition of \"Grantee,\" which included the plural or singular. That is, both or either borrower's future obligations to the lender were secured by the collateral. The court agreed, finding the contract language superseded O.C.G.A. \u00a7 44-14-1(b)'s default construction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Transitioning to the facts in this case, AgGeorgia argues the Open-End Clause within the Hypothecation Agreement waives James Carter's right to notice.

Without ambiguity, there is no question of fact to be determined at trial. Therefore, this Court interprets the agreement according to the plain language set forth in the documents. James Carter waived his right to notice of future obligations incurred by Walt Carter. Accordingly, by operation of the Open-End Clauses, James Carter's grant of a security interest extends to Walt Carter's future obligations to AgGeorgia.
