(\"Queen Elizabeth\" or \"Appellant\") brings this appeal from an interlocutory order granting Creditor-Appellee SMS Financial G, LLC (\"SMS\" or \"Appellee\") ) permission to file a late proof of claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9006(b)(1). Debtor's bankruptcy petition was filed in July 2013, and creditors were required to file notices of claim by October 28, 2013. SMS's predecessors-in-interest had not been given notice of the proceeding or its attendant deadlines; did not learn of it until December 2015; and filed a proof of claim four months later. After extensive discovery and briefing on this issue, United States Bankruptcy Judge Stuart M. Bernstein granted SMS's motion to file a proof of claim untimely on the basis of excusable neglect. Because Judge Bernstein's decision was not an abuse of his discretion, the order below is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Foodmart-All Points Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 25, 2009, Foodmart International II, Corp. (\"Foodmart II\") entered into a chattel mortgage with Sierra Credit Corp. (\"Sierra\"); the agreement was signed by Lewis Wu, President of Foodmart II. (Ex. A). The same day, Lewis Wu executed a guaranty agreement, whereby the entities Foodmart International V, Corp. (\"Foodmart V\"), Queen Elizabeth, and Farmer's Best Market Corp. (\"Farmer's\") agreed to guarantee the payments due to Sierra under the mortgage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Lewis Wu signed on behalf of all guarantor entities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). That same day, Sierra executed a collateral assignment of contract documents wherein it assigned all rights under the Foodmart II contract to All Points Capital Corp. (\"All Points\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Lewis Wu signed, on behalf of Foodmart II, a notice and acknowledgement of the assignment to All Points. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    2. All Points State Court Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 5, 2011, All Points filed suit in New York State Supreme Court, Nassau County, against Foodmart II, Foodmart V, Queen Elizabeth, Farmer's, and Lewis Wu to recover an unpaid sum due and owing of $1,594,682.96. (Ex. A). All Points was represented by Lee Mendelson of Moritt Hock &amp; Hamroff LLP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In a short form order dated June 13, 2012, Justice Stephen A. Bucaria entered summary judgment in favor of All Points, and ordered that an inquest be held. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 13, 2013, the parties filed a stipulation with the Supreme Court in which the parties consented to a judgment against Foodmart V, Farmer's, Queen Elizabeth, and Wu in the amount of $1,500,000 in lieu of an inquest. (Ex. B). Lewis Wu signed the stipulation on behalf of himself, Foodmart V, and Farmer's; no representative of Queen Elizabeth signed the stipulation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Also on February 13, 2013, the Supreme Court entered judgment against Foodmart V, Farmer's, and Wu in the amount of $1,500,000. (Ex. A). The judgment explicitly excluded Queen Elizabeth. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (\"ADJUDGED, that Plaintiff sever and continue the action against Defendant, Queen Elizabeth[.] ) ). The last entry on the docket for this case is dated February 15, 2013, and reads \"settled before trial.\" (Ex. B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Bankruptcy Filing and All Points' Assignment to SMS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Queen Elizabeth filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 on July 17, 2013. (Bankr. Dkt. # 1). By Order dated September 13, 2013, Judge Bernstein set the deadline for filing proofs of claim (the \"Bar Date\") as October 28, 2013. (Bankr. Dkt. # 24). The September 13, 2013 Order required Queen Elizabeth to serve notice of the Bar Date on,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"all creditors and other\n   known holders of claims as of the date of this Order,\" and \"all parties to litigation with the Debtor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On January 14, 2016, Judge Bernstein held a confirmation hearing on Queen Elizabeth's Chapter 11 reorganization plan. (Bankr. Dkt. # 325). He then confirmed the plan on January 26, 2016. (Bankr. Dkt. # 322).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Meanwhile, on December 8, 2015, Capital One Equipment Finance Corp. (\"Capital One,\" formerly known as All Points), had assigned its rights under the June 25, 2009 agreement with Foodmart II to distressed debt buyer SMS. (Ex. A). Schedule A to the general assignment and assumption agreement contains a list of litigation proceedings and judgments-on that list is an entry for Foodmart II as \"borrower\" and Queen Elizabeth as \"judgment debtor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The entry includes the docket number for Queen Elizabeth's Chapter 11 proceeding and says \"no disposition.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Discovery in connection with the instant litigation disclosed that in November 2015, Capital One had invited SMS to bid on the June 25, 2009 contract. (Ex. E). SMS conducted due diligence and asked that Capital One \"run a search to disclose any bankruptcy filings related to the contemplated transaction.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On December 2, 2015, Capital One became aware of Queen Elizabeth's bankruptcy case, and it was added to Schedule A of the assignment agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Further insight into the relevant timeline was obtained in June 2016, when Queen Elizabeth deposed Daniel Shorr, a partner and managing director at SMS, in connection with this litigation. Shorr confirmed that Queen Elizabeth's bankruptcy case had been added to Schedule A following SMS's bankruptcy litigation due diligence. (Shorr Dep. 12:1-14:23). Shorr testified that a few days after the Capital One deal closed (at which point he owned the judgment against Queen Elizabeth), he \"personally pulled the docket report ... to see what the bankruptcy was about.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:16-17). Shorr learned from the docket entries that Queen Elizabeth was \"moving through their Fourth Amended Plan and they had financing in place, hadn't yet funded, but they were looking at some takeout financing on their building in Manhattan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16:23-17:1). Shorr saw that the Bar Date had passed, \"and that All Points and Capital One [had never been] noticed as a [c]reditor in the bankruptcy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17:7-9). He did not learn (and, the Bankruptcy Court later determined, would not have learned) from the docket of the pending confirmation date of Queen Elizabeth's reorganization plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On December 14, 2015, Shorr retained Lee Mendelson-who was the attorney of record on the judgment-\"to file the Assignment of Judgment and file an Appearance and a Motion for the Late Proof of Claim[.]\" (Shorr Dep. 15:12-16:8). But, Shorr explained, Mendelson never filed anything in the bankruptcy case and lied when Shorr asked him about it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17:17-23). Shorr testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [H]e lied. With a string of phone calls and emails, Mr. Mendelson said he had filed the Assignment of Judgment, he said he had filed the late-the Motion for Late Proof of Claim, and he said he had spoken to opposing counsel. I later determined none of it was true and immediately terminated him in March.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Entries in a debt collection software program called Collect show that Shorr contacted Mendelson on December 14, 2015; December 15, 2015; January 4, 2016; January 6, 2016; January 18, 2016; February 1, 2016; and March 8, 2016. (Ex. J). An entry dated March 18, 2016 reads \"Lee is unresponsive[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Shorr testified that he continued to review the docket for Queen Elizabeth's bankruptcy into late January and early February. He sent\n   Mendelson the documents he pulled and implored him to act, but to no avail. (Shorr Dep. 19:11-20:15 (\"We need to get our claim filed before the plan is confirmed, and it looks like it's too late.\") ). At that point, Shorr terminated Mendelson and hired SMS's current counsel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23:16-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    1. SMS's Motion in Bankruptcy Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On April 5, 2016, SMS, through new counsel, filed a motion to file a late proof of claim. (Bankr. Dkt. # 349). SMS argued that it was a known creditor entitled to notice of the Bar Date and, having not received notice, sought leave to file on the basis of \"excusable neglect.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). Queen Elizabeth filed an objection to the motion on April 28, 2016, but changed focus, arguing that Lewis Wu did not have authority to enter into the June 25, 2009 agreement on behalf of Queen Elizabeth and that, in any event, Queen Elizabeth never signed the stipulation in the Supreme Court action and never had any judgment entered against it. (Bankr. Dkt. # 350 at 2-3). In other words, Queen Elizabeth argued that All Points was not a known creditor, was not entitled to notice, and should be barred from filing a late claim under the doctrine of laches. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Following the filing of SMS's reply brief on May 3, 2016 (Bankr. Dkt. # 351), Judge Bernstein held a conference with the parties to discuss the motion; he ordered that the parties conduct discovery, and adjourned the case until June 14, 2016 (Bankr. Dkt. # 352). Shortly thereafter, Queen Elizabeth filed a supplemental objection on May 25, 2016 (Bankr. Dkt. # 353), and an amended supplemental objection on June 3, 2016 (Bankr. Dkt. # 355). In these filings, Queen Elizabeth acknowledged that \"[o]n or about December 2, 2015, All Points became aware of the Debtor's chapter 11 case,\" but still asserted a laches defense, claiming that SMS \"sat idly by while the Debtor confirmed the [reorganization p]lan[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4). On June 10, 2016, SMS filed a supplemental reply brief and argued that the fact-now known to the parties through discovery and acknowledged by Queen Elizabeth-that All Points did not learn about the bankruptcy until December 2015 \"put the ... laches defense to rest, once and for all[.]\" (Bankr. Dkt. # 357 at 2). Despite SMS's entreaties to close discovery, Judge Bernstein ordered further discovery on the motion. (Bankr. Dkt. # 358).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On October 25, 2016, SMS filed a memorandum in further support of its motion to file a late claim under Rule 9006(b)(1). (Bankr. Dkt. # 365). SMS argued that Queen Elizabeth had not met its burden to establish the unreasonable delay or lack of diligence by SMS needed to assert its laches defense and, further, that Queen Elizabeth had failed to show that it would be prejudiced by SMS's late claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-6). Queen Elizabeth filed a response to SMS's brief on October 31, 2016. (Bankr. Dkt. # 366). Here, Queen Elizabeth doubled down on its laches defense and argued that \"mistake or inattention of a creditor's counsel to timely file a proof of claim does not justify allowance of a late-filed claim,\" because \"if a clear deadline is missed due to a law office failure, including inattention or lack of oversight, an extension is not justified.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (citations omitted) ). On November 1, 2016, Judge Bernstein held a conference with the parties and solicited supplemental briefing. (Bankr. Dkt. # 368).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   SMS submitted its supplemental brief on November 9, 2016. (Bankr. Dkt. # 369). SMS argued that its due process rights had been violated by Queen Elizabeth's\n   failure to issue notice of the Bar Date and that SMS's delay was excusable under the multifactor standard annunciated in\n   <em>\n    Pioneer Investment Services Company v. Brunswick Associates Limited Partnership\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6229999\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/380/\">\n    507 U.S. 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6527745\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/113/1489/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6229999\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/380/\">\n    123 L.Ed.2d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993). (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6229999\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/380/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). Queen Elizabeth filed its response on November 16, 2016, and continued to assert its laches defense while arguing that\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   did not apply because All Points was not a known creditor entitled to notice. (Bankr. Dkt. # 370).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Bankruptcy Court's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On March 24, 2017, Judge Bernstein issued a Memorandum Decision and Order granting SMS's motion to file an untimely proof of claim.\n   <em>\n    In re Queen Elizabeth Realty Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-12335 (SMB),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201102865\">\n    2017 WL 1102865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2017). Judge Bernstein rebuffed Queen Elizabeth's attempts to avoid the judgment against it in state court: He found it curious that Queen Elizabeth had not argued Lewis Wu's lack of authority as a defense in the state court action and rejected Queen Elizabeth's argument that the state court action was settled before it filed for bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1-2. The Bankruptcy Court also found persuasive that discovery did not reveal any evidence that All Points or its successors knew about the bankruptcy before December 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court found it \"immaterial\" whether All Points was a known or unknown creditor because, either way, \"the debtor did not provide notice consistent with due process.\"\n   <em>\n    Queen Elizabeth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201102865\">\n    2017 WL 1102865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. Moreover, the Court found that the proper inquiry for a motion seeking to file a late claim and participate in the distribution was excusable neglect under\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   , not laches.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. The Court reasoned that laches would apply had SMS sought \"a declaration that it [was] not bound by the confirmation discharge because it lacked actual knowledge of the case in time to protect its rights[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In weighing the\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   factors-\"danger of prejudice to the debtor, the length of the delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings, the reason for the delay, including whether it was within the reasonable control of the movant, and whether the movant acted in good faith\"-the Court focused on the third factor and found that it \"weigh[ed] heavily in SMS's favor\" inasmuch as SMS immediately took action upon learning of the passed Bar Date and the delay was \"not unreasonable under the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Queen Elizabeth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201102865\">\n    2017 WL 1102865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6. Judge Bernstein reasoned that it was the \"pending confirmation hearing rather than the long-passed Bar Date [that] created the urgency.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201102865\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, Queen Elizabeth had posted a misleading Notice of Hearing on PACER that \"omitted [the confirmation] from the matters scheduled to be heard on January 14[, 2016].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201102865\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, SMS, through no fault of its own, was not aware of the impending confirmation, and did not know the date by which it needed to act. Finally, Judge Bernstein found that \"[t]he evidence of prejudice is entirely hypothetical\" and that \"[t]he alternative of denying SMS a chance to participate in the case and discharging its claim while allowing equity to retain the benefits of ownership is inequitable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. On April 4, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order granting SMS's motion to file a late claim and set a schedule for the filing of objections. (Bankr. Dkt. # 377).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Instant Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Queen Elizabeth filed this appeal on April 11, 2017 (Dkt. # 1), and filed its designated record on appeal under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8009 on April 18, 2017 (Dkt. # 4). Queen Elizabeth\n   filed its memorandum of law in support of its appeal on May 22, 2017 (Dkt. # 6), and SMS filed its opposition on June 20, 2017 (Dkt. # 10). This appeal became fully briefed when Queen Elizabeth filed its reply brief on July 3, 2016. (Dkt. # 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

To be sure, there remained the issue of whether SMS's claim-predicated on a valid state-court judgment that recited\n   a specific damages figure-would be deemed valid, but Queen Elizabeth has not appealed any subsequent ruling as to the validity or amount of SMS's claim. What is at issue here is whether the Bankruptcy Court fully resolved the dispute over whether SMS would be permitted into the litigation in the first instance, and it did. It is arguable that this appeal is at the periphery of the Court's jurisdiction.

The first and second factors weigh in favor of SMS. The Bar Date set by the Bankruptcy Court was October 28, 2013, and SMS filed its motion to submit a claim on April 5, 2016. The total period of delay was about 30 months. The parties agreed in the proceedings below that Queen Elizabeth did not provide SMS's predecessors with actual notice of the Bar Date (putting aside the question of whether they were entitled to such notices), and discovery revealed that All Points (by then, Capital One) did not become aware of the bankruptcy petition until early December 2015 during the due diligence conducted by SMS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Because there is no bright-line rule governing the length of delays, \"courts consider the degree to which the delay might disrupt the judicial administration of that particular case.\"\n   <em>\n    In re AMR Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4175914\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/492/660/#p667\">\n    492 B.R. 660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 667 (Bankr.

SMS found out about the bankruptcy proceeding in early December 2015 and sought leave to file its untimely claim on April 5, 2016. In the intervening four months, the Bankruptcy Court held a hearing on Queen Elizabeth's reorganization plan and confirmed the plan on January 26, 2016.

The contention is not entirely accurate. SMS may not have relied on its attorney's failure as the basis for its neglect, but it recognized, in response to statements by the Bankruptcy Court at a conference, that \"[t]he reason for the additional four months of delay was, as per the Court, the neglect of SMS'[s] prior counsel to submit a motion to file a late claim.\" (Bankr. Dkt. # 369). SMS even relied on its efforts to implore prior counsel to act as evidence that it had not acted in bad faith. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Queen Elizabeth argued in response that the failure of SMS's counsel to file a motion could not be the basis for\n   excusable neglect. (Bankr. Dkt. # 370). The Bankruptcy Court considered the arguments on both sides and found that \"SMS ... immediately instructed Mendelson to file a motion to permit its late claim, and Mendelson negligently failed to do so, [such that] the resulting delay was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Queen Elizabeth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201102865\">\n    2017 WL 1102865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6.

Queen Elizabeth argues now that \"[t]he Bankruptcy Court erred when it ... gave short shrift\" to the argument that \"law office failure\" is not excusable neglect. (Appellant Br. 8).
