FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 1, 2015, the Debtor, Katalin Demitrus, filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. On July 19, 2017, the Trustee initiated this Adversary Proceeding against the University and asserted the following causes of action: (1) Constructive Fraudulent Transfer, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B), 550 and 551 ; and (2) UFTA Constructive Fraudulent Transfer, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Conn.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2052\">\n    Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -552e(a)(2) and 52-552f(a) (\"CUFTA\"). On November 28, 2017, the Trustee filed the instant Amended Complaint which, with the exception of one paragraph, is a mirror image of the original Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 7, 2017, the University filed the Motion to Dismiss and accompanying Memorandum of Law. On January 12, 2018, the Trustee filed the Opposition. On January 19, 2018, the University filed a reply. On February 12, 2018, both parties appeared and presented oral arguments before the Court. Following the hearing, the matter was taken under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In his Complaint, the Trustee alleges that the Debtor is the parent of Alexander N. Demitrus who, at all relevant times, was over the age of 18 years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He alleges that between September of 2013 to October of 2014, when Alexander was a student at the University, the Debtor made a number of transfers to the University by means of a Federal Direct Parent PLUS loan (\"Parent PLUS Loan\") to pay for Alexander's tuition. The Trustee claims that these payments constitute constructive fraudulent transfers, pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code and CUFTA. He seeks that the total of $66,616.00 be avoided and/or set aside and recovered for the benefit of the Debtor's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   IV. LEGAL STANDARD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, made applicable herein by Rule 7012(b) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, permits a party to move to dismiss a case for \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" The Supreme Court has stated, \"[t]o survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

In addition, the Parent PLUS proceeds were not and could not have been property in which [the debtor] had an interest or over which he had control. None of the Parent PLUS proceeds could have been available in any circumstance to pay [the debtor's] creditors.

Gideon (In re Gideon)\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 15-50464, Adv. Pro. No. 16-4939 (TJT) (Bankr. E.D. Mich. Apr. 26, 2017) (Tucker, J.), the court entered summary judgment against the Chapter 7 trustee in an adversary proceeding also seeking recovery of Parent PLUS Loan proceeds from DePaul University, pursuant to a fraudulent transfer theory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court found that the proceeds of Parent PLUS Loans simply could not constitute property of the debtor that was available for the benefit of creditors. In granting summary judgment, Judge Tucker held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [T]he evidence is clear and undisputed that at no time did the loan proceeds-did these loan proceeds go into a bank account of the bankruptcy debtor ... nor did they go in any way through his\n   hands or ... to his possession. He never had possession of the loan funds.... [S]o it certainly appears from all of that that while the bankruptcy debtor ... did incur an obligation as ... the borrower on these PLUS loans and quite arguably incurred an obligation that might be avoidable as a ... fraudulent obligation because the debtor ... may not have received reasonably equivalent value for the obligation he incurred on these loans ... avoidance of the obligation that [the debtor] incurred is not what the trustee seeks in this adversary proceeding. That's clear from the complaint and the argument on ... this motion. It is, rather, avoidance of the transfer and recovery of the funds-the loan funds-that were transferred from the Department of Education to DePaul under the PLUS loans at issue. Those are the transfers alleged in the trustee's complaint and it's clear the trustee is seeking avoidance of those transfers, and not avoidance of any obligation that the debtor ... incurred in connection with those loans ... [U]nder the undisputed facts, material facts here that are relevant to the issue, the record clearly shows, and there can be no genuine dispute here-that the loan funds at issue that were transferred to DePaul were not property of the debtor ...\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The clear consensus forming in the courts on this issue is reflective of the purpose underlying the trustee's avoidance powers, namely, to prevent the depletion of assets that otherwise would have been available to creditors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Requiring that transfers subject to avoidance could have been available to creditors comports with the spirit and purpose of fraudulent transfer provisions in the Bankruptcy Code and CUFTA,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"to protect creditors by preventing a debtor from placing assets otherwise available to pay creditors out of reach of those creditors.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eisenberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269205\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/574/536/\">\n    574 B.R. at 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted) (discussing federal and comparable Pennsylvania law).
