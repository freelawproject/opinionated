Owens appeals his sentence o'f 60 months imprisonment for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud, falsification of financial information filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and wire fraud, all in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 1350, 1343. The district court imposed sentence after Owens pled guilty for his role in a prominent corporate fraud case, which the district court found resulted in significant monetary losses. Owens asserts that his sentence was unreasonable because, contrary to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6), the district court did not consider sentences given to other defendants in related proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-13\">\u201cAfter the district court has accurately calculated the [guideline range, it may impose a more severe or more lenient sentence that we review for reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted). Such review is deferential, requiring us to \u201cevaluate whether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in [18 U.S.C.] section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). We have recognized that \u201cthere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose, and when the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory [guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Necessarily, there are also \u201csentences outside the range of reasonableness that do not achieve the purposes of sentencing stated in \u00a7 3553(a) and that thus the district court may not impose.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>455 F.3d 1227, 1237 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-14\"><em>Post-Booker,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>sentencing requires two steps. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. First, the district court must consult the guidelines and correctly calculate the sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>range under the guidelines. <em>Id. </em>In this step, <em>pre-Booker </em>standards for reviewing the application of the guidelines still apply. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005). Second, the court must consider the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. One of those factors is \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">That said, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-7\">After a careful review of the record and the briefs of the parties, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-8\">Neither side in this appeal has alleged that the district court applied the guidelines improperly, and there is no basis for such an argument. <em>See e.g. United States v. Chotas, </em>968 F.2d 1193, 1197-98 (11th Cir.1992) (disparities between codefen-dants\u2019 sentences is not a proper basis for a departure from the guidelines). Accordingly, we proceed to analyze the total sentence for reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-9\">Here, the district court stated that it thought a 60-month sentence was reasonable and stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Although not required to do so, the district <em>court </em>also extensively discussed the factors it had considered in sentencing Owens. The court expressly analyzed the sentence with regard to: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct and to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (4) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(2), (6). It is also evident that the court considered the guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-11\">The court was especially concerned with deterrence, and specifically found that probation or a short custodial sentence would fail to satisfy this concern. Although the court was obviously affected by Owens\u2019s \u201cextraordinary\u201d cooperation with the government and his obvious remorse and acceptance of responsibility, it was equally, if not more so, impressed by the magnitude of the fraud committed. The court also specifically noted that Owens had been involved in the fraud longer than many of his coconspirators, that his involvement was more significant, and that his skills gave him an important role.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-12\">The court specifically stated that it had considered the sentences in other convictions arising out of the same fraudulent scheme. It also acknowledged that Owens\u2019s sentence was longer than some of those, but specifically found that the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors outweighed this problem. The court noted that \u00a7 3553(a)(6) addressed only \u201cunwarranted\u201d disparities, suggesting that it was satisfied that the disparity in this case was warranted. Finally, the court expressly noted that it had sufficient discretion under <em>Booker </em>to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>duce Owens\u2019s sentence, but declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"AjB\">On this analysis alone, we could conclude that Owens\u2019s sentence was reasonable. Our recent decision in <em>Martin </em>only reinforces the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See Martin, </em>455 F.3d at 1239, 1241-42 (reversing seven-day sentence of defendant convicted of the same fraud as unreasonable, \u201cshockingly short,\u201d and \u201cwildly disproportionate\u201d to his crimes). As in <em>Martin, </em>Owens\u2019s cooperation, though admirable, did not undo the harm he had caused and did not free him from his responsibility. Finally, the district court in this case gave Owens a significant departure, reducing his guidelines sentencing range by almost 300 months, and \u201cproperly rewarding]\u201d him for his cooperation. <em>Id. </em>at 1241. While there is no exact calculus to identify what is a reasonable sentence, because of the district court\u2019s careful consideration of the sentencing factors, we hold that Owens\u2019s 60-month sentence is not unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1296-10\">. <em>United States v.
