Beasley, </em>429 F.3d 1324, 1326 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Shotz v. City of Plantation, Fla., </em>344 F.3d 1161, 1164 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also Cottrell v.

The dance floor of the ballroom where the party took place was surrounded by dinner tables on three sides and had a small stage on the fourth side. The two bands that had been hired to play that night were alternating using the stage. At about 10:30 p.m., Justin began dancing boisterously. He circled the dance floor undulating his arms, danced with four women simultaneously, and eventually shoved apart a couple who were dancing and, without asking, began to dance with the woman. Immediately thereafter, Justin stepped onto the stage uninvited and said \u201cThank you, thank you. Let\u2019s give it up for the band, the next Count Basie.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Happy New Year\u2019s everyone, let\u2019s have a Happy New Year\u2019s.\u201d He then returned to his table.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-10\">At about 11:15 p.m., Justin began dancing again, this time with a male friend. The Ritz\u2019s night shift manager on duty, Frank Barner, saw Justin dancing again and decided to call the sheriffs office to have deputies come to issue a trespass warning and escort Justin off the Ritz\u2019s property. He radioed the front desk and told Azure Sorrell, the employee working there, to call the sheriffs office. Then, to be sure that all of the relevant information was conveyed, he called the Collier County Sheriffs Office himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-11\">Barner told the dispatcher that there were \u201ca couple of subjects being disorderly,\u201d \u201cscreaming[,] and yelling.\u201d Barner claimed that the subjects \u201cjumped up on a stage,\u201d tried \u201cto commandeer the bandstand,\u201d and \u201cwere giving ... the band members a hard time.\u201d Barner also told the dispatcher that when he \u201ctried to explain to [Justin] that he couldn\u2019t do that, he started yelling profanities, screaming, yelling and carrying on.\u201d In reality, Bar-ner had not yet spoken to Justin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-12\">Deputies Scott Russell and Chris Knott separately responded to the call. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>were told only that there was a disturbance of some kind at the Ritz involving two men who were being unruly, refusing to cooperate, and getting onto the stage. After hearing that two deputies had gone to the Ritz, Deputy Amy Stanford decided to go there as well to provide back up.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">When Sorrell spoke to the dispatcher, she requested that deputies come to remove \u201csome disorderly people\u201d who were \u201cjust basically trashing the place ... jumping on furniture, ripping things apart\u201d and whom Ritz security personnel could not control. This was not true, but Sorrell\u2019s report was not relayed to any of the deputies who went to the Ritz to deal with the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">After dancing for a while, Justin and his friend got up on stage while one of the bands was playing. Justin\u2019s friend danced around while Justin went to the microphone. Alex, who had been dancing with his wife, joined them. Alex tapped on a conga drum in time with the music for about ten seconds before leaving the stage. A member of the band who was not playing at that time angrily told Justin to get off the stage, but Justin did not notice him. Justin tapped the microphone to see if it was on. It was not, and he and his friend stepped off the stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-7\">As he walked back to his table, Justin made an exaggerated bow to the other guests. One of them described it as mooning the band with his clothes on. At this point, Barner approached Justin. Barner told Justin that he was not allowed to go up on the stage where the band was playing and that, if he did it again, he would be removed from the property and charged with trespassing. Justin replied by asking him \u201cWhat, no fun?\u201d but returned to his table. While sitting there, Justin felt as though Barner was continuing to watch him. So, he turned to look at Barner and mouthed the words \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just fucking leave us alone?\u201d before returning to his meal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-9\">Around this time, all three deputies arrived in the ballroom. Deputy Knott, who had once worked security at the Ritz under Barner, approached Barner to ask what the disturbance was. Barner pointed out Justin and told Knott that he had been disruptive. Barner went on to recount an exaggerated version of the conversation with Justin in which he made the following claims: When Barner told Justin that he would be removed from the hotel if he went on stage again, Justin said \u201cFuck off, who is going to remove me?\u201d or \u201cFuck off, what are you going to do?\u201d Barner replied, saying that he would call the police. Then Justin said something to the effect of \u201cWhat are they going to do?\u201d After detailing this version of events to Knott, Barner told him that he wanted Justin off the property and asked Knott to issue Justin a trespass warning so that he could not return.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-10\">Michelle had noticed Deputies Knott and Stanford come into the ballroom, and she told Justin that the police had arrived. A few minutes later, at approximately 11:35 p.m., Knott approached Justin from behind and tapped him on the shoulder. Knott asked Justin if he would \u201cstep to the back\u201d so that the deputies could talk to him. Justin went with Stanford and Knott to a service hallway off the ballroom, where they asked Justin to sit. When Justin was seated, Knott told him that he could collect his belongings from the table and that he was going to be escorted from the property and given a trespass warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-11\">Justin returned to his table, retrieved his coat, told Michelle that he was being forced to leave, and went back to the hallway with Deputies Knott and Stanford. Alex and Michelle followed them into the hallway. Justin was again told to sit in the chair in the hallway. He did so, but he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>stood up again shortly thereafter. Stanford had to order him to sit down a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">During this period, Alex told Deputy Stanford: \u201cPlease, officer, we haven\u2019t done anything. It is New Year\u2019s Eve, we haven\u2019t done anything.\u201d Stanford replied that if he didn\u2019t stand back he would be arrested. He then asked her why she was \u201cbeing so hostile? It is New Year\u2019s Eve,\u201d and told her that if she wanted them to leave, they would do so. Stanford again told him to stand back or he would be arrested. Alex replied \u201cArrest me, you\u2019re going to arrest me for what?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">Finally, the deputies took hold of Justin\u2019s arms and began to escort him out. Alex asked Deputy Knott \u201cPlease, why are you doing this? What is going on? It is New Year\u2019s Eve.\u201d Knott replied that Justin was being removed from the Ritz. Alex and Michelle followed as the deputies walked Justin out. While being escorted out, Justin said: \u201cPlease, I just want to go home. Just let me go home.\u201d Michelle replied: \u201cIt is fine, honey, I am right behind you to go home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-6\">The deputies held Justin\u2019s arms as they walked him down the service hallway and into the stairwell. Deputy Knott held Justin\u2019s left arm without hurting him. Deputy Stanford, however, pulled Justin\u2019s right arm up at an angle that did hurt. While walking toward the stairs, Alex continued asking the deputies not to remove Justin. At one point Knott screamed back over his shoulder at Alex. Justin then yelled that Stanford was hurting his arm, but she did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-7\">As Justin and the deputies were entering the stairwell, Justin lurched forward, pulled his arm partially free of Deputy Stanford\u2019s grip, and forced it straight. As Justin and Stanford were approaching the second landing in the stairwell, Deputy Knott pushed Justin, causing both Justin and Stanford to fall down the stairs. Justin landed on his chest. Deputy Stanford fell over him. After falling, both rose to their hands and knees. Justin then rolled over to sit with his back against the wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-9\">Alex and Deputy Knott ran down to the landing. Knott and Deputy Stanford began struggling with Justin, attempting to handcuff him. Knott pulled out his taser gun, aimed it at Alex, and told him to \u201cback off\u2019 immediately. Alex held his hands out, palms open, at chest level and asked Knott not to hurt Justin. Alex shouted for Justin \u201cnot to move, not to struggle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-10\">Deputy Knott then warned Justin that he would use his taser gun if Justin did not cooperate, but Justin did not hear him or did not understand him. Knott fired. The taser gun hit Justin in the torso, causing him to fall over. Alex attempted to get to Justin so that he could cover Justin\u2019s body with his own, but Deputy Stanford held him back. As Alex continued to struggle, Stanford hit him on the right side of his face.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-11\">Alex turned to Deputy Stanford and said, \u201cYou hit me in the face. You hit me in the face, you fucking cunt.\u201d Stanford then lunged at him, grabbed him by the neck, and starting pushing him backwards down the stairs. Alex pushed her off and tried to climb up the stairs to where Justin was lying. Before he could get there, Deputy Russell, who had by then entered the stairwell, punched Alex on the left side of his face, breaking his nose. Someone pulled Alex down, and he fell to the next lower landing. When he regained focus, he was lying prone on his stomach, using his forearms to prop up his upper body. One of the deputies shouted at him to put his arms out. When Alex did not move, a deputy fired his taser gun into Alex\u2019s back. Alex fell forward into a pool of his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>blood, temporarily paralyzed. Again, a deputy told him to straighten out his arms. Alex said that he was unable to move. The deputy shot Alex with his taser gun again.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">Meanwhile, Justin had climbed back up to a sitting position, at which point Deputy Russell fired his taser gun, hitting Justin in the back. Michelle ran down to the landing where Justin was. He asked her \u201cWhy is this happening? Why are they doing this to me?\u201d Michelle told him \u201cBecause he is an asshole.\u201d Russell told Michelle to step back, but she did not want to move for fear that they would hurt Justin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">Deputy Russell told Michelle that she was going to go to jail. She said \u201cfine\u201d and called him \u201can asshole\u201d again. She was told to go back and sit on the stairs, which she did. At no time did Michelle attempt to physically interfere with the deputies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">Finally, Justin, Alex, and Michelle were handcuffed and taken out the back of the hotel to the loading dock. Alex\u2019s handcuffs were so tight that he suffered numbness and tingling in the backs of his hands for about a year after his arrest. While being taken out, Alex turned to Deputy Knott and asked him: \u201cHow do you wake up in the morning and feel proud of who you are?\u201d Because of his broken nose, Alex sprayed blood when he spoke. In reply, Knott said \u2018You\u2019re spitting blood at me,\u201d to which Alex said \u201cYou think I am spitting blood at you. You should have thought of that before you broke my nose.\u201d Alex was either confused about who broke his nose or meant to refer to the deputies generally because it was Deputy Russell who had broken Alex\u2019s nose, not Knott.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-8\">Deputy Knott and another deputy who had arrived at the scene used their taser guns on both of Alex\u2019s shoulders. His legs gave out, but the deputies held him up. They sat Alex on the curb to wait for the ambulance to arrive. When deputies put Justin in a patrol car* he turned to the deputy who was driving and said \u201cHell of a New Year\u2019s, hey?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-10\">In April 2005, Justin was tried for resisting an officer with violence to his or her person, a violation of Florida Statute \u00a7 843.01, but, before the conclusion of the trial, he pleaded no contest to resisting without violence under Florida Statute \u00a7 843.02. At about the same time, Alex also pleaded no contest to resisting without violence. Although Michelle was originally charged with resisting without violence, the court dismissed the charge against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-11\">While the charges were still pending against them, the Zivojinovichs brought suit against Deputies Knott, Russell, and Stanford, as well as the Ritz and Barner. Their amended complaint had thirty-four claims, including one on behalf of Alex\u2019s business associates and various business entities that have financial interests in his career. The two claims that are relevant to this appeal are Justin and Alex\u2019s \u00a7 1983 Fourth Amendment excessive force claims against the deputies and them negligence claims against Barner and the Ritz. The deputies counterclaimed against Alex for negligence and battery, but those counterclaims are not included in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-12\">The district court first granted summary judgment to the defendants on all the claims against them. It then declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaims against Alex and dismissed them without prejudice. Alex and Justin Zivojinovieh now appeal the district court\u2019s grants of summary judgment. The other plaintiffs have decided not to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-13\">The Zivojinovichs contend that the district court erred in five different ways. First, they assert that the summary judgment rule is unconstitutional as applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>because it allows the district court to im-permissibly determine what verdict a rational jury might render. Second, they argue that the district court erred by not taking the facts in the light most favorable to them as non-moving parties. Third, they contend that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Barner and the Ritz on Justin\u2019s negligence claim. Fourth, they claim that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Barner and the Ritz on Alex\u2019s negligence claim. And, finally, they argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the deputies on Alex\u2019s and Justin\u2019s excessive force claims. We will address each of these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">The Zivojinovichs\u2019 contention that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), which governs summary judgment, has been unconstitutionally interpreted is mer-itless. The Federal Rules require a court to grant summary judgment if the record before the court \u201cshow[s] that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The Supreme Court has interpreted the word \u201cgenuine\u201d in Rule 56(c) to mean that the \u201cevidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-6\">The Zivojinovichs\u2019 argument is that this interpretation unconstitutionally deprives them of their Seventh Amendment rights to a jury trial because it substitutes the judge\u2019s judgment about what a hypothetical reasonable jury could do for what a real jury would actually do. Even if we were persuaded by this argument, the Supreme Court is the final arbiter of constitutionality, and its interpretation is binding on us. <em>Baker v. Carr, </em>369 U.S. 186, 211, 82 S.Ct. 691, 706, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962) (The Supreme Court is the \u201cultimate interpreter of the Constitution.\u201d); <em>Marbury v. Madison, 5 </em>U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177-78, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803). We are without power to hold that the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation is unconstitutional, nor would we if we could.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-9\">The Zivojinovichs\u2019 second contention is that the district court did not view the facts in the light most favorable to them, as it was required to do. <em>See Tinker, </em>429 F.3d at 1326; <em>Shotz, </em>344 F.3d at 1164. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Ala.-Tombigbee Rivers Coal. v. Kempthome, </em>477 F.3d 1250, 1254 (11th Cir.2007). As a result, any error in how the district court viewed the facts is mooted by our decision of the issue anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-11\">The Zivojinovichs\u2019 third contention is that the district court improperly granted summary judgment to Barner and the Ritz on Justin\u2019s negligence claim. The Zivojinovichs argue that Barner acted negligently, breaching two asserted duties: (1) the duty to ask Justin to leave before calling law enforcement to eject him from the Ritz and (2) the duty to provide accurate information to law enforcement. The Ritz would be vicariously liable for Earner\u2019s negligence under the doctrine of re-spondeat superior. <em>See Pope v. Winter Park Healthcare Group, Ltd., </em>939 So.2d 185, 187 (Fla. 5th DCA 2006) (\u201cThe tort principle of respondeat superior makes an employer liable to third parties for the negligence of an employee, whom he controls and directs.\u201d (emphasis omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>The first duty the Zivojinovichs assert would be inconsistent with Florida law, which permits the operator of a hotel to \u201cremove or cause to be removed ... any guest ... [who] is intoxicated, profane, lewd, or brawling[ ][or] who indulges in any language or conduct which disturbs the peace and comfort of other guests or which injures the reputation, dignity, or standing of the establishment.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 509.141(1). Section 509.141(2) does require that the operator \u201cnotify such guest that the establishment no longer desires to entertain the guest and ... request that such guest immediately depart from the establishment .... [either] orally or in writing,\u201d but that notification may be done by a law enforcement officer. <em>See State v. Williams, </em>751 So.2d 170, 172 (Fla. 2d DCA 2000) (stating that motel guest was lawfully ejected under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 509.141 when a police officer notified him that the motel wanted him to leave).</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">The Zivojinovichs argue that it is a jury question whether Justin\u2019s actions gave the Ritz the right to eject him under the Florida statute. We disagree. There is no genuine issue of material fact about whether his behavior was \u201cprofane,\u201d \u201clewd,\u201d \u201cdisturbed] the peace and comfort of other guests,\u201d or \u201cinjure[d] the reputation, dignity, or standing\u201d of the Ritz. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 509.141(1). Dragging a woman away from the man with whom she is dancing \u201cdisturbs [her] peace and comfort.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Bending over to display one\u2019s rear to the band at a black tie event \u201cinjures the ... [Ritz\u2019s] dignity.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Justin telling a hotel employee to \u201cfucking leave [him and his family] alone\u201d is profane. <em>See id. </em>The Ritz had the right to eject Justin, so Barner did not breach any duty by having law enforcement notify Justin that he was no longer welcome at the event and escort him off the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">The second duty that the Zivoji-novichs assert Barner and the Ritz breached was a duty to give truthful information to law enforcement. The Zivojinovichs point out three sets of statements that they claim breached this duty: (1) Earner\u2019s statement in his call to the Sheriffs Office; (2) Sorrell\u2019s statements in her call to the Sheriffs Office; and (3) Barner\u2019s statements to Deputy Knott when they spoke in the Ritz ballroom. The elements of a negligence claim under Florida law are: (1) a legal duty on the defendant to protect the plaintiff from particular injuries; (2) the defendant\u2019s breach of that duty; (3) the plaintiffs injury being actually and proximately caused by the breach; and (4) the plaintiff suffering actual harm from the injury. <em>Clay Elec. Coop., Inc. v. Johnson, </em>873 So.2d 1182, 1185 (Fla.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-7\">Barner, Sorrell, and the Ritz had a duty to tell the truth when speaking to law enforcement about Justin. Florida courts have held that, under certain circumstances, a party that gives inaccurate statements to police can be liable for negligence. <em>See Townsend v. Westside Dodge, Inc., </em>642 So.2d 49 (Fla. 1st DCA 1994); <em>Harris v. Lewis State Bank (.Harris III), </em>482 So.2d 1378, 1384-85 (Fla. 1st DCA 1986). The decision with facts most similar to the present one on this point involved a woman, Jessie Mae Harris, who was incorrectly informed by bank employees that she was entitled to the money in a certain account, even though she told them that she did not have an account at the bank. <em>Harris v. Lewis State Bank (Harris I), </em>436 So.2d 338, 339 (Fla. 1st DCA 1983) (recounting the facts underlying the decision in <em>Harris III). </em>After Harris withdrew the money from the account, the real owner reported the theft to the police. <em>Id. </em>When interviewed, the bank employees did not disclose to the police or the prosecutor that they had told Harris that she was entitled to the money. <em>Id. </em>After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>being prosecuted for grand larceny and acquitted, Harris sued the bank and the police for malicious prosecution and negligence. <em>Harris III, </em>482 So.2d at 1379; <em>Harris I, </em>436 So.2d at 340. The Florida appeals court reversed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the negligence claim against the bank, holding that the \u201crelationship voluntarily entered into by the bank ... created a duty on the part of the bank to protect [Harris] from false accusations of forgery and theft.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1385. The voluntary relationship, presumably created by informing Harris that she was entitled to the money, and the bank\u2019s knowledge that failing to disclose that fact would \u201clikely ... result in injury to\u201d Harris created the duty to fully and accurately inform the police. <em>Id. </em>at 1384-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">The situation in the <em>Hams </em>case is similar to the one here. The <em>Harris III </em>decision held that the bank had incurred a duty to Harris when it caused her to believe that she had a legal right to the money in the account. Likewise, the Ritz incurred a duty to Justin when it sold him a ticket to the New Year\u2019s Eve party because a hotel has \u201ca continuing legal duty to its patrons to use ordinary care to ... protect them from harm due to reasonably foreseeable risks of injury.\u201d <em>Hardy v. Pier 99 Motor Inn, </em>664 So.2d 1095, 1097 (Fla. 1st DCA 1995). When the bank employees failed to disclose to the police that they had told Harris that she was entitled to the money, they knowingly put her at risk of being wrongfully prosecuted. Likewise, when Barner and Sorrell allegedly lied to the dispatcher and when Bar-ner allegedly lied to Deputy Knott, they knowingly put Justin at greater risk of physical injury because it became more likely that the deputies would use force in removing Justin from the premises if they believed that Justin had indicated that someone would have to force him to leave. Whether that increased likelihood is enough to satisfy the causation element is a separate question that we address below. We conclude that, under Florida law, Bar-ner and the Ritz had a duty not to lie to law enforcement in a way that increased the risk that a guest would suffer injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-6\">Sorrell breached this duty when she said that \u201cdisorderly people\u201d were \u201cjust basically trashing the place[,] ... jumping on furniture, [and] ripping things apart\u201d because this was untrue and, by exaggerating the severity of Justin\u2019s misbehavior, she increased the risk that the deputies would use force to remove him from the premises. Barner breached this duty by lying to Deputy Knott, falsely telling him that, in response to being informed that he would be removed if he went on stage again, Justin had told him to \u201c[f]uck off\u2019 and had challenged Barner\u2019s or the Sheriffs Office\u2019s ability to do anything about his behavior. Also, Barner lied to the dispatcher when he called the Sheriffs Office, saying that when he tried to warn Justin, Justin \u201cstarted yelling profanities, screaming, yelling and carrying on.\u201d While Justin\u2019s behavior was inappropriate, he and Barner had not yet spoken when Barner called the Sheriffs Office, therefore Justin could not have \u201cstarted yelling profanities, screaming, yelling and carrying on\u201d in response to Barner\u2019s nonexistent admonition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-7\">The third element of Justin\u2019s negligence claim is that Barner and/or Sorrell\u2019s lies were the actual and proximate cause of his injuries. <em>Clay Elec. Coop., Inc., </em>873 So.2d at 1185. The actual causation inquiry requires us to determine whether a reasonable jury could find that, but for Sorrell\u2019s and Barner\u2019s lies, Justin would not have been injured or would not have been injured as severely. Justin has not created a genuine issue of material fact that Sorrell\u2019s call was a cause of Justin\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>injuries, because there is no evidence in the record to show that what she said was ever communicated to any of the deputies who eventually responded. A factfinder could find, however, that at least one falsehood from Banner\u2019s call did make it through to Deputies Russell and Knott. There is evidence that they were told that two men were causing a disturbance by being unruly and uncooperative and getting on stage. Although Justin, Alex, and Justin\u2019s friend did get on stage and were arguably unruly, no one had yet asked any of them to stop being disruptive, so they could not have been uncooperative. Even if the deputies had not heard anything before arriving, Barner\u2019s embellishments to Knott may have created a false mix of information presented to the deputies, which necessarily affected their decision about when force was reasonable and necessary. <em>See generally Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 207, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 2159, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001) (\u201cExcessive force claims ... are evaluated for objective reasonableness based upon the information the officers had when the conduct occurred.\u201d). A jury could find that, but for Barner falsely telling Knott that Justin had responded belligerently to the threat of sheriffs deputies being called, Justin would not have been injured or that his injuries would not have been as severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">The closer issue is whether the false information given to law enforcement by Barner was the proximate cause of Justin\u2019s injuries. If a reasonably prudent person could foresee that a harm like the one that the plaintiff suffered might result from his or her actions, then there is proximate causation. <em>See Goldberg v. Fla. Power &amp; Light Co., </em>899 So.2d 1105, 1116 (Fla.2005). Barner and the Ritz argue that Barner could not be the proximate cause of Justin\u2019s injuries because the deputies\u2019 actions and those of the Zivojinovichs themselves were unforeseeable. In support of their position, they rely on Florida cases that hold that there is generally no liability for the acts of third persons. <em>See, e.g., Trianon Park Condominium Ass\u2019n v. City of Hialeah, </em>468 So.2d 912 (Fla.1985); <em>Allen v. Babrab, Inc., </em>438 ,So.2d 356 (Fla.1983). However, under Florida law, when an \u201cindependent intervening cause is a foreseeable and probable consequence of the wrongful actions of the defendant,\u201d the defendant can be liable. <em>Guice v. Enfinger, </em>389 So.2d 270, 271 (Fla. 1st DCA 1980); <em>see Goldberg, </em>899 So.2d at 1116. This principle includes a defendant\u2019s negligence that later results in injuries from police officers executing their duties. <em>See Townsend, </em>642 So.2d 49; <em>Harris III, </em>482 So.2d at 1384-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-7\">In <em>Townsend </em>a car dealership accidentally affixed a magnetic dealer\u2019s tag to the wrong vehicle and, not knowing where it was, had the loss reported to the police. <em>Townsend, </em>642 So.2d at 50. The police logged the tag as being stolen instead of simply lost. <em>Id. </em>A woman purchased the vehicle with the supposedly stolen tag. <em>Id. </em>That evening, a police officer noticed the vehicle, ran the tag number, discovered it was reported stolen, and arrested the woman. <em>Id. </em>During the arrest, the woman was handcuffed, which aggravated a preexisting shoulder injury. <em>Id. </em>The dealership\u2019s negligence in permitting the woman to leave the lot with the lost tag was held to be a proximate cause of her shoulder injury because it \u201cset in motion a series of events culminating in the stop of [the womanj\u2019s vehiele[,] [and,] ... [u]nder the circumstances, the action of the police in both detaining and arresting the driver ... [was] reasonably within the scope of the danger that could result from [the dealership]^ negligent action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-8\">As in <em>Townsend, </em>in this case the allegedly wrongful conduct of a party \u2014 here Bar-ner, there the dealership \u2014 caused law en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>forcement officials to initiate an encounter in which the plaintiff was injured. In <em>Tmmsend </em>there was no particular reason to believe that the arresting officer would use force or injure the plaintiff, but the Florida appeals court still found that the causation element was met. Here, by contrast, Barner made Justin\u2019s encounter with law enforcement more likely to be violent by falsely telling Deputy Knott that Justin had stated an intention to resist the deputies. For that reason, there is arguably a stronger causal connection in this case than there was in <em>Tmmsend. </em>A reasonable factfinder could conclude that Earner\u2019s alleged lies caused or exacerbated Justin\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">The final element necessary to make out a negligence claim is that the defendant\u2019s breach results in an actual harm. <em>Clay Elec. Coop., Inc., </em>873 So.2d at 1185. The deputies repeatedly shot Justin with a ta-ser gun, and the pain and injuries he suffered are actual harms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-5\">Having found that Barner had a duty not to lie to law enforcement in a way that made it more likely that the Ritz\u2019s guests would be hurt, that he allegedly breached that duty, and that a reasonable jury could find that his breach was the actual and proximate cause of Justin\u2019s injuries, we conclude that the district court erred in granting Barner summary judgment. And, if Barner is not entitled to summary judgment, then the Ritz, which is vicariously liable for torts committed by Barner in the scope of his employment, is not either. <em>See Pope, </em>939 So.2d at 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-7\">The Zivojinovichs\u2019 fourth contention is that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Barner and the Ritz on Alex\u2019s negligence claim. Their argument is that Barner\u2019s negligence led to Alex\u2019s injuries because Alex was hurt while attempting to rescue Justin. While they are correct that Florida law recognizes the rescue doctrine, which holds a tortfeasor liable for injuries to a third party who is hurt in an attempt to rescue the direct victim of the tortfeasor, <em>see Zwinge v. Hettinger, </em>530 So.2d 318, 323 (Fla. 2d DCA 1988), they have not convinced us that doctrine applies to Alex. The rescue doctrine will only permit recovery if \u201cthe attempted rescue is not recklessly or rashly done\u201d and the rescuer does not \u201ccontribute to his [own] peril by placing himself in a position of danger not necessary to effect the rescue.\u201d <em>Rose v. Peters, </em>82 So.2d 585, 586 (Fla.1955); <em>Reeves v. N. Broward Hosp. Dist., </em>821 So.2d 319, 321 (Fla. 4th DCA 2002) (\u201cFor the rescue doctrine to come into play ... the rescuer must have acted reasonably.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-9\">Alex\u2019s effort to rescue his son consisted of trying to push past Deputy Stanford and cover Justin\u2019s body with his own. That happened after Deputy Knott had pointed a taser gun at Alex and told him not to interfere. Attempting to get between a law enforcement officer and an apparently noncompliant suspect is both reckless and rash. Alex\u2019s actions unreasonably escalated an already volatile situation, increasing the risk to everyone and making his rescue attempt counterproductive. We conclude that Alex cannot invoke the rescue doctrine. Without it he cannot make out a claim against Barner and the Ritz for negligence. Therefore, the district court was correct to grant summary judgment to Barner and the Ritz on Alex\u2019s negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-10\">YI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-11\">The Zivojinovichs\u2019 fifth and final contention is that the district court erred by finding that the deputies did not use excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment and that, even if they did, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>they were entitled to qualified immunity. The Zivojinovichs argue that the deputies used excessive force once against Justin and once against Alex. The alleged excessive force against Justin occurred when Deputies Knott and Stanford held Justin\u2019s arms as they escorted him out of the Ritz. The alleged excessive force against Alex occurred when Deputy Knott and an unnamed sheriffs deputy used their taser guns on him when he was handcuffed and being led to the deputies\u2019 cars. The Zivo-jinovichs do not contend on appeal that the deputies used excessive force during the fight in the stairwell.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">Qualified immunity shields public officials from suits against them in their individual capacities for torts committed while performing discretionary duties unless the tortious act violates a clearly established statutory or constitutional right. <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). The parties agree that the deputies were engaged in a discretionary duty while escorting Justin off of the Ritz\u2019s property, so the burden is on the Zivojinovichs to show why the deputies are not entitled to qualified immunity. <em>Dahl v. Holley, </em>312 F.3d 1228, 1233 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">Qualified immunity requires a two-step inquiry. The threshold question is whether \u201c[t]aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, ... the facts ... show the officer\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional [or statutory] right.\u201d <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 201, 121 S.Ct. at 2156. When, as here, qualified immunity \u201carises in the posture of a motion for summary judgment, we are required to view all facts [in the record] and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Brosseau v. Haugen, </em>543 U.S. 194, 195 n. 2, 125 S.Ct. 596, 597 n. 2, 160 L.Ed.2d 583 (2004). Then, \u201cif a violation could be made out on a favorable view of the parties\u2019 submissions, the next, sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly established.\u201d <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 201,121 S.Ct. at 2156.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-8\">Turning to Justin\u2019s excessive force claim, we first consider whether a reasonable jury could find that there was a Fourth Amendment violation. Because even de minimis force will violate the Fourth Amendment if the officer is not entitled to arrest or detain the suspect, <em>see Bashir v. Rockdale County, Ga., </em>445 F.3d 1323, 1332 (11th Cir.2006), we must first determine whether the deputies had probable cause to arrest Justin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-9\">Florida law makes it a first degree misdemeanor to \u201cresist, obstruct, or oppose any officer ... in the execution of legal process or in the lawful execution of any legal duty, without offering or doing violence to the person of the officer.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.02. The two elements of resisting arrest without violence are: (1) \u201cthe officer must be engaged in the lawful execution of a legal duty\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe defendant\u2019s action, be it by words, conduct or a combination thereof, must constitute obstruction or resistance of that lawful duty.\u201d <em>N.H. v. State, </em>890 So.2d 514, 516-17 (Fla. 3rd DCA 2005). \u201cLegal duties\u201d encompass more than just making arrests. <em>Jacobson v. State, </em>476 So.2d 1282, 1287 (Fla.1985) (\u201c[S]ection 843.02 ... does not require that the officer be attempting to arrest the suspect.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-10\">Here, the deputies were lawfully executing their legal duty by informing Justin that he was no longer allowed to be on the Ritz\u2019s property, escorting him out, and giving him a trespass warning. <em>See Williams, </em>751 So.2d at 172. Before escorting Justin out, the deputies told him to sit. He did for a moment, but then he stood up again. Deputy Stanford had to order him to sit again. In <em>N.H., </em>the Florida appeals court affirmed a conviction for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>resisting an officer without violence in the case of a juvenile suspect who was agitated and aggressive, cursed, \u201crefused a police request to sit down,\u201d and \u201cmenacingly-raised his fists at\u201d officers investigating a crime. <em>Id. </em>at 515-16. Like the defendant in <em>N.H., </em>Justin disobeyed a command by members of law enforcement to sit while they executed their lawful duties. Although Justin\u2019s actions were not as egregious as those of the defendant in <em>N.H., </em>the standard for probable cause is significantly lower than the proof-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard applied to convictions. <em>See Lee v. Ferraro, </em>284 F.3d 1188, 1195 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201cAlthough probable cause requires more than suspicion, it does not require convincing proof, and need not reach the [same] standard of conclusiveness and probability as the facts necessary to support a conviction.\u201d). We conclude that the deputies had probable cause to arrest Justin for resisting arrest without violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">That conclusion, however, does not end our inquiry. We must now determine whether the force used was unreasonable. \u201cThe \u2018reasonableness\u2019 inquiry in an excessive force case is an objective one: the question is whether the officer\u2019s actions are \u2018objectively reasonable\u2019 in light of the facts and circumstances confronting him, without regard to his underlying intent or motivation.\u201d <em>Kesinger v. Herrington, </em>381 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cIn order to determine whether the amount of force used by a police officer was proper, a court must ask \u2018whether a reasonable officer would believe that this level of force is necessary in the situation at hand.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lee, </em>284 F.3d at 1197 (11th Cir.2002) (citation omitted). This must be decided \u201con a case-by-case basis from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.\u201d <em>Post v. City of Fort Lauder-dale, </em>7 F.3d 1552, 1559 (11th Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-6\">During his deposition, Justin testified that Deputy Knott\u2019s grip on his arm did not hurt. As such, it was de minimis. De minimis force will only support a Fourth Amendment excessive force claim when \u201can arresting officer does not have the right to make an arrest.\u201d <em>Bashir, </em>445 F.3d at 1332. However, as we have just discussed, there was probable cause to arrest Justin for resisting an officer without violence, so Knott\u2019s grip cannot be the basis for an excessive force claim. <em>See Nolin v. Isbell, </em>207 F.3d 1253, 1257 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201c[T]he application of de minimis force, without more, will not support a claim for excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">With regard to Deputy Stanford, Justin testified that she pulled his arm up at an uncomfortable angle while escorting him out. We conclude that, from the perspective of a reasonable deputy in Stanford\u2019s position, this was not an unreasonable use of force. Stanford knew that Justin had caused a disturbance, was going to be escorted out of the hotel, and had disobeyed her instruction to remain seated. Under these circumstances, using an uncomfortable hold to escort an uncooperative and potentially belligerent suspect is not unreasonable. <em>See Rodriguez v. Farrell, </em>280 F.3d 1341, 1345 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that, when arresting an unresisting suspect believed to have outstanding warrants on drug charges, \u201cgrabbling] [a suspect\u2019s] left arm, twistfing] it behind [his] back, and forced it up to just below the shoulder-blade\u201d was not excessive force even when the suspect screamed with pain).</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-8\">The district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Deputies Knott and Stanford on Justin\u2019s excessive force claims against them. Because we conclude that there was no Fourth Amendment violation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>we need not address the second prong of the qualified immunity analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">The Zivojinovichs also argue that Deputy Knott and the other deputy who held Alex as he was being led out of the Ritz in handcuffs used excessive force when they used their t\u00e1ser guns on him. The deputies clearly had probable cause to arrest Alex for resisting an officer with violence, a violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01, so the only issue here is whether the use of the taser guns was unreasonable. At the time the deputies used their taser guns, Alex\u2019s nose had already been broken, and he sprayed blood when he spoke. Knott testified that he believed it was intentional. Although we view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, <em>Tinker, </em>429 F.3d at 1326, and Alex testified in his deposition that it was not intentional, we must treat it as though it were because the evidence is that is how it would appear to a reasonable officer at the scene. <em>See Post, </em>7 F.3d at 1559. We have previously held that in a \u201cdifficult, tense and uncertain situation\u201d the use of a taser gun to subdue a suspect who has repeatedly ignored police instructions and continues to act belligerently toward police is not excessive force. <em>Draper v. Reynolds, </em>369 F.3d 1270, 1278 (11th Cir.2004). This was such a situation, and we conclude that Knott\u2019s use of his taser gun was reasonably proportionate to the need for force. Because Knott\u2019s use of the taser gun while leading Alex out of the Ritz in handcuffs was not unreasonable, we do not reach the well-established prong of the qualified immunity analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-6\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-7\">We REVERSE the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Ritz-Carlton Hotel and Frank Barner on Justin Zivoji-novich\u2019s negligence claim and AFFIRM the remainder of the district court\u2019s judgment. The case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-9\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1102-7\">.
