His conviction is based upon a complaint which, among other things, charges that on June 19th, 1938, in the township of Washington, he \u201cdid solicit from house to house the gift of money for the use and benefit of an institution or organization in violation of section 3 chapter 111 of Ordinance No. 46 (Washington Township Code) * *</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Section 3 of said code provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">\u201c3. Without having first obtained a permit therefor, no person shall solicit from house to house or in any public street, park or public place, the gift of money, clothing or other thing for the use and benefit of any charitable, or other institution, organization, or cause, public or private or for any use or purpose whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">The proofs, substantially stated, disclose that prosecutor is a member of an organized religious group or sect (Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society) more commonly known as \u201cJehovah\u2019s Witnesses.\u201d In pursuance of the beliefs of his group or sect, prosecutor conscientiously believes, among other things, that to obtain a permit (a man made requirement) to preach the gospel of God\u2019s Kingdom would require him to do that which is in disobedience of the command of Almighty God.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">The proofs further disclose that prosecutor, without the required permit, did on June 19th, 1938, call upon one Margaret Heinz in Washington township so that he might preach the beliefs of his group or sect. He found her to be one who apparently was familiar with, and favorable to, the beliefs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>preached by prosecutor. In fact she had donated to the organization in question for about seven or eight years. Although prosecutor asked her for only a twenty-five cent donation, Mrs. Heinz voluntarily gave him a dollar for which, in turn, she received a paid up subscription to a magazine, \u201cConsolation,\u201d and two small books, \u201cEiches\u201d and \u201cCure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Upon the proofs so adduced the acting recorder found, apart from the questions of the right to \u201creligious liberty\u201d and the right to the \u201cdistribution of literature,\u201d that the regulation here in issue was valid under the police powers o\u00ed the state. The tenuous justification for invoking these police powers was found in the municipality\u2019s right to regulate persons coming into the municipality and \u201cto ascertain who those persons are.\u201d Accordingly, he adjudged prosecutor guilty as charged and imposed a sentence of $10 plus $2 costs. fit is the propriety of the judgment based upon that sentence that is now challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">That challenge is submitted to us for the prosecutor on brief. Five points are argued. Ho brief is submitted for respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Of the five points argued two (1 and 5) require consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">1. Is the complaint defective? Our answer is in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">It is the settled law that in a summary proceeding on a penal ordinance\u2014as here\u2014nothing is presumed or intended in favor of the complaint or the conviction thereunder. <em>Owens </em>v. <em>Camden, </em>6 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>279; 141 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>24; <em>Haviland </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>11 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>799; 168 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>171; <em>McKenna v. Board of Police and Fire Commissioners, Paterson, </em>11 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>945; 169 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>287; <em>Hommel </em>v. <em>Township of East Hanover, </em>13 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>446; 178 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>189; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>116 <em>N. J. L. </em>48, 51; 181 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>706; <em>affirmed, </em>122 <em>N. J. L. </em>466; 5 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>697. The complaint neither alleges that prosecutor solicited \u201cwithout first having obtained a permit\u201d nor does it allege the name of the organization or institution for whose use and benefit the solicitations were made. The complaint and conviction thereunder are, therefore, fatally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>2. Does the conviction trench upon prosecutor\u2019s \u201cinestimable privilege of worshiping Almighty God in a manner agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience,\u201d article 1, section 3 of our State Constitution, and upon section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to our Federal Constitution? Our answer again is in the affirmative. <em>Schneider </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>308 <em>U. S. </em>147; <em>McLean </em>v. <em>Mackay, </em>124 <em>N. J. L. </em>91; 10 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>733.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The conviction is set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
