The court denied his motion because his sentences on those counts were based on a statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See supra </em>note 1. He now appeals the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-13\">The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mack\u2019s motion because Mack was not eligible for any reduction in the Counts 1-4 Sentences since they were based on a statutory mandatory minimum provision, not on the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b44-10\">. Because Mack had at least three prior felony controlled-substance convictions, and was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), he qualified as an armed career offender and a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.4 and 4B1.1, respectively. With a criminal history category of VI and an offense level of 35, his guideline sentence range was 292 to 365 months\u2019 imprisonment. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), the minimum term for the Counts 1-4 offenses was life imprisonment, and the guideline range thus became life imprisonment. The District Court departed downward from the prescribed sentence range pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Ao3\">. And even if Mack were eligible for a reduction of the sentences on Counts 1-4, he would still be left with the Count 5 sentence of 180 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
