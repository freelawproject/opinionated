He appeals his sentence, arguing that the District Court procedurally erred in imposing his sentence and in fading to provide a statement of reasons for the variance. We find no error and accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">We find no procedural error in this case. As required by <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), the District Court properly adopted the Guidelines sentence range set out in the presentence report. Appellant, who was represented by counsel, voiced no objection to that sentence range or the report\u2019s recitation of the facts underpinning it. Nor did appellant object to the sentence he received after the District Court imposed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">As for stating the reasons for the sentence, the District Court made it clear that it was imposing an 18 months\u2019 period of incarceration because appellant had entered the United States illegally 14 times, and a sentence above the Guidelines sentence range was required to promote respect for law and to deter appellant from illegally entering this country again. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b43-9\">. Appellant was given credit for time served between his detention on November 9, 2011, and the imposition of sentence. Appellant is a Mexican citizen. He had entered the United States illegally 14 times. His first removal occurred in 2003, after he was convicted of a misdemeanor. He was arrested for the instant offense on November 9, 2011, after the police stopped the car in which he and 10 others were riding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
