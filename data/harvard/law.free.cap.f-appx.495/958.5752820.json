Pinnock contends the district court erred in denying his motion for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because he should be held accountable for only 300 grams of cocaine base. He asserts that a breach of the plea agreement occurred when he was held accountable at his original sentencing for 60 kilograms of cocaine base when he only stipulated to 1.5 kilograms. He requests a remand to determine the proper drug quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-21\">A district court may not modify a term of imprisonment unless a defendant was sentenced based on a guideline range that \u201chas subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). When evaluating whether a defendant is eligible for a reduced sentence, a district court should determine what new sentence, if any, applies, \u201cby substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). Even if a retroactive amendment would apply to a defendant\u2019s case, he will be ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief if the amendment would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>\u201cnot have the effect of lowering [his] applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) modification \u201cdoes not constitute a <em>de novo </em>re-sentencing,\u201d however. <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. Rather, when engaging in this process, a district court must leave <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations ... unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>Id.; United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1563 &amp; n. 5 (11th Cir.1997) (explaining the district court was bound by its original drug-quantity finding in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">The district court did not err in denying Pinnock\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Despite his attempts both before the district court and now on appeal, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) did not give him license to relitigate the original drug-quantity finding upon which his sentence was based. This quantity \u2014 60 kilograms of cocaine base \u2014 produced a base offense level of 38 under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), both at the time of his original sentencing and as now amended.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because Amendment 750 did not operate to reduce Pinnock\u2019s base offense guideline range, he was ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b981-9\">. We review the denial of a motion for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion, but review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 792 (11th Cir. 2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b981-10\">. Amendment 750, effective November 1, 2011, made permanent an amendment lowering the offense levels for particular crack cocaine quantities in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amends. 748, 750. These amendments altered the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 2D 1.1(c) so that a base offense level of 38 applies to crack cocaine quantities of 8.4 kilograms or more. <em>See id.; </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (2012). Pinnock\u2019s base offense level was also 38 at his original sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
