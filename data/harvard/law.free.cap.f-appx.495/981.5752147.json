Stat. \u00a7 440.205. The district court dismissed Perry\u2019s complaint without prejudice because Perry did not comply with the district court\u2019s orders to file (1) a statement of his claim, and (2) either a joint pre-trial stipulation or a unilateral pre-trial catalog. After review, we vacate the district court\u2019s \u201cFinal Order of Dismissal\u201d and remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A7o\">On September 16, 2011, Perry filed a three-count complaint against his employer, Zinn, for whom he had worked for approximately two years. In Count 1 of the complaint, Plaintiff Perry alleged that Defendant Zinn had willfully failed to pay him overtime pay, in violation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1). Perry also separately alleged that (1) he injured his back while working at Zinn on October 27, 2009; (2) he was unable to work for several months; and (3) when he was cleared to return to work, Zinn notified him that there was no position available for him. Perry\u2019s complaint alleged, in Count 2, that Zinn\u2019s refusal to maintain an open position for him, or to accommodate his back injury, violated Florida\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 440.205. In Count 3, Perry sought declaratory relief, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201 and 2202, regarding Defendant Zinn\u2019s failure to comply with the provisions of the FLSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">After Defendant Zinn answered, the district court issued a December 5, 2011, order instructing Perry to file a \u201cstatement of the claim\u201d within 20 days of the date the order was issued. The statement was to set forth \u201cthe amount of alleged unpaid wages, the means of calculating such wages, and the nature of said wages.\u201d The district court\u2019s order advised Perry that failure to adhere to the order could result in the whole or partial dismissal of Perry\u2019s complaint. Perry did not file a statement of his claim within 20 days or at any point thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-9\">On January 13, 2012, the district court entered an order setting a pre-trial conference for June 15, 2012. In this order, and pursuant to Local Rule 16.1.M, the district court stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that a \u201cPre-Trial Stipulation\u201d or \u201cUnilateral Pre-Trial Cata-logues\u201d must be filed by noon, fourteen days prior to the June 15 pretrial conference (i.e., by June <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> at noon).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This order further advised that failure to comply would result in dismissal without prejudice, as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>Between January 13, 2012, and June 1, 2012 (the deadline), Perry never filed a pre-trial stipulation or a unilateral pre-trial catalogue.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>If a pre-trial stipulation is not filed, then the parties must file unilateral pre-trial catalogues by the time prescribed above. Upon the failure of plaintiff to file a unilateral pre-trial catalogue, the court shall dismiss the case without prejudice. If a defendant fails to file a unilateral pre-trial catalogue within the time prescribed above, defendant will be precluded from entering any physical or documentary evidence and may call no witnesses other than the defendant....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>On June 1, 2012, the district court entered a <em>sua sponte </em>\u201cFinal Order of Dismissal\u201d dismissing Perry\u2019s complaint without prejudice for failure to comply with the court\u2019s two orders and with Southern District of Florida Local Rule 16.1. The district court noted that Perry had failed to file a statement of his claim, as required by the district court\u2019s December 5, 2011, order, and that he also had failed to file a unilateral pre-trial catalog, as required by the district court\u2019s January 13, 2012, order. The district court also noted that Perry had not moved for an extension of time as to either the statement of claim or the unilateral pre-trial catalog.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">On June 4, 2012, Perry moved for reconsideration, but admitted that he failed to comply with the district court\u2019s orders. Perry\u2019s counsel stated that he had drafted the statement of the claim, but inadvertently had forgotten to file it. Counsel argued in mitigation that he and Zinn\u2019s counsel had filed a form consenting to proceed before a magistrate judge, and both mistakenly believed that the case had been referred to a magistrate judge, who counsel presumed would adopt a new schedule for filings. Perry also noted that, although he could re-file his complaint, he would be unable to recover some of his unpaid overtime wages due to the operation of the statute of limitations on his FLSA claim. The district court denied the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">Before filing the notice of appeal, Perry\u2019s counsel filed, on June 8, 2012, the same lawsuit with the same three counts. On June 29, 2012, Perry filed a notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s \u201cFinal Order of Dismissal.\u201d Perry did not appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-12\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint for failure to comply with court rules for an abuse of discretion. <em>Betty K Agencies, Ltd. v. M/V Monada, </em>432 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cDiscretion means the district court has a range of choice, and that its decision will not be disturbed as long as it stays within that range and is not influenced by any mistake of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-13\">The district court may <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss an action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b) if the plaintiff fails to comply with court rules or a court order. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b); <em>Betty K Agencies, </em>432 F.3d at 1337. The district court also has inherent authority to sanction parties for \u201cviolations of procedural rules or court orders,\u201d up to and including dismissals with prejudice. <em>Donaldson v. Clark, </em>819 F.2d 1551, 1557 n. 6 (11th Cir. 1987); <em>Betty K Agencies, </em>432 F.3d at 1337. \u201cWhile dismissal is an extraordinary remedy, dismissal upon disregard of an order, especially where the litigant has been forewarned, generally is not an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Moon v. Newsome, </em>863 F.2d 835, 837 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-14\">Here, Plaintiff Perry failed to follow not one but two court orders, in circumstances in which the district court had forewarned Perry that failure to do so could result in dismissal. The undisputed facts show a record of delay on Perry\u2019s part. Thus, ordinarily we would say that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Perry\u2019s complaint without prejudice. However, on appeal, Perry argues that the district court abused its discretion because (1) the statute of limitations applicable to FLSA claims now bars him from recovering a portion of his alleged unpaid overtime wages; (2) the dismissal here thus amounted to a dismissal <em>with </em>prejudice; and (3) a dismissal with prejudice is an unduly severe sanction in a case where there was no clear record of willful delay or other contumacious behavior by Perry or his counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">This Court has instructed that, where a dismissal without prejudice has the effect of precluding a plaintiff from refiling his claim due to the running of the statute of limitations, the dismissal is \u201ctantamount to a dismissal with prejudice, a drastic remedy to be used only in those situations where a lesser sanction would not better serve the interests of justice.\u201d <em>Burden v. Yates, </em>644 F.2d 503, 505 (5th Cir.1981) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Boazman v. Econ. Lab., Inc., </em>537 F.2d 210, 213 (5th Cir.1976) (holding \u201cthat where the dismissal is without prejudice, but the applicable statute of limitations probably bars further litigation,\u201d we apply the \u201cstricter\u201d standard of review that we ordinarily employ when reviewing a dismissal with prejudice).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These two decisions bear full discussion because they govern the analysis here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">In <em>Boazman, </em>Plaintiff Boazman brought an employment discrimination action against his employer. 537 F.2d at 211. The district court dismissed his case without prejudice due to Boazman\u2019s failure to comply with the court\u2019s orders regarding the filing of a response to the employer\u2019s motion to dismiss, which orders warned Boazman that failure to respond could result in dismissal. 537 F.2d at 211-12. The effect of the dismissal, however, was to bar any further litigation of the merits of Boazman\u2019s action due to the statute of limitations applicable to Boazman\u2019s Title VII claims. <em>Id. </em>at 211. The Fifth Circuit reversed the dismissal, concluding that, in these circumstances, a dismissal without prejudice was effectively a dismissal with prejudice, and that such a sanction was unduly severe because the record disclosed no \u201ccontumacious indifference to the Court\u201d on the part of Boazman and because lesser sanctions were available. <em>Id. </em>at 212-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">Similarly, in <em>Burden, </em>Plaintiff Burden failed to comply with three separate pretrial orders entered by the district court, one of which warned Burden that failure to comply would result in the dismissal of his case. 644 F.2d at 504. Based on Burden\u2019s non-compliance with these orders, the district court dismissed without prejudice Burden\u2019s Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 <em>et seq. </em>(repealed 1994), complaint after the statute of limitations had run on his cause of action. <em>Id. </em>at 504-05. Drawing on the reasoning contained in <em>Boazman, </em>the Fifth Circuit concluded that the dismissal was \u201ctantamount to a dismissal with prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 505. The Fifth Circuit further concluded that a dismissal with prejudice was not warranted because Burden\u2019s \u201cfailure to comply with the court order was more a matter of negligence than purposeful delay,\u201d and because the district court had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>employed lesser sanctions before dismissing the case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">We first conclude, based on <em>Burden </em>and <em>Boazman, </em>which dealt with circumstances analogous to those in the present case, that the district court\u2019s \u201cFinal Order of Dismissal\u201d amounts to a dismissal of a significant portion of Perry\u2019s FLSA claim with prejudice. Perry filed his complaint on September 16, 2011, and, following the district court\u2019s \u201cFinal Order of Dismissal,\u201d he re-filed the complaint on June 8, 2012. Under the three-year statute of limitations applicable to claims alleging willful violations of the FLSA, at the time of Perry\u2019s initial filing in September 2011, he was entitled to claim unpaid overtime wages going back to September 2008. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255(a). Following the district court\u2019s dismissal of Perry\u2019s complaint, and Perry\u2019s subsequent re-filing, the three-year statute of limitations would only allow Perry to claim overtime wages from June 2009 through the end of his employment with Zinn, a difference of approximately eight months. <em>See id. </em>Thus, the district court\u2019s \u201cFinal Order of Dismissal\u201d was \u201ctantamount to a dismissal with prejudice\u201d as to much of Perry\u2019s FLSA claim, and we will review the district court\u2019s order under the standard we ordinarily apply to dismissals with prejudice. <em>Burden, </em>644 F.2d at 505; <em>see Boazman, </em>537 F.2d at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">A dismissal with prejudice is a sanction of last resort, and is only proper if the district court finds \u201cboth a clear record of willful conduct and a finding that lesser sanctions are inadequate.\u201d <em>Zocaras v. Castro, </em>465 F.3d 479, 483 (11th Cir.2006). Moreover, \u201cfindings satisfying both prongs of [the] standard are <em>essential </em>before dismissal with prejudice is appropriate.\u201d <em>Betty K Agencies, </em>432 F.3d at 1339. While we have \u201coccasionally inferred\u201d a finding that lesser sanctions are inadequate, as in cases \u201cwhere lesser sanctions would have \u2018greatly prejudiced\u2019 defendants,\u201d we have never suggested that the district court is relieved of its obligation to make that finding in the first instance. <em>Kilgo v. Ricks, </em>983 F.2d 189, 193 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">In this case, the district court failed to make findings sufficient to enable us to assess whether it abused its discretion. The district court did not make a finding that Perry\u2019s failure to comply with its orders amounted to willful conduct. <em>See Zocaras, </em>465 F.3d at 483; <em>Betty K Agencies, </em>432 F.3d at 1338. And, based on the record before us, we cannot infer such a finding. Rather, as evidenced by Perry\u2019s motion for reconsideration, the failure of Perry\u2019s counsel to comply with the district court\u2019s two orders was attributable to counsel\u2019s negligence and mistaken belief concerning the referral of the complaint to a magistrate judge. Mere negligence or confusion is not sufficient to justify a finding of willful delay or misconduct. <em>Zocaras, </em>465 F.3d at 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">Nor did the district court explicitly consider whether lesser sanctions would have been adequate to obtain Perry\u2019s compliance with court orders, or whether lesser sanctions would have prejudiced Zinn. <em>See Kilgo, </em>983 F.2d at 193. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s \u201cFinal Order of Dismissal\u201d and remand this case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">. The Local Rules for the Southern District of Florida do not expressly define \"Pre-Trial Catalogue.\u201d <em>See </em>S.D. Fla. L.R. 16.1. The Local Rules, however, require parties to file a pre-trial stipulation with the court, or, if counsel for the parties cannot agree to execute a joint stipulation, \"each counsel shall file and serve separate proposed pretrial stipulations.\u201d S.D. Fla. L.R. 16.1(e), (f). From this Local Rule, it is clear that the district court used the term \"Unilateral Pre-Trial Cat-alogues\u201d in its January 13, 2012 order to refer to the mandatory filing of \"separate proposed pretrial stipulations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">. We previously denied Zinn\u2019s motion to dismiss this appeal for a lack of jurisdiction, concluding that we possess jurisdiction because the district court's involuntary dismissal of the complaint is a final, appealable order. <em>Perry v.
