McKinney contends the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion because his appellate counsel never received the transcript of the afternoon session on February 18, 2005, and McKinney had a right to a record on appeal that included a complete transcript of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-23\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying McKinney\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>Even assuming some doubt regarding whether McKinney\u2019s counsel received a full copy of the February 18, 2005, transcript, McKinney\u2019s essential contention\u2014 that he was denied the right to effective assistance of appellate counsel because of an incomplete record \u2014 is one that must be raised in a \u00a7 2255 motion. To the extent that McKinney might seek to raise such a claim on collateral review, he has previously filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, which has been adjudicated on its merits. <em>See McKinney v. United States, </em>S.D. Fla. Case No. 08-cv-60300. As McKinney has not sought or obtained an order from this Court authorizing a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, there was no reason for the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1010-9\">.
