Whether the evidence regarding the money transactions was sufficient to support a conclusion that Polanco knew or was deliberately ignorant to the fact that the money came from drug trafficking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-25\">2. Whether the district court committed clear error in applying an enhancement for knowing or believing the laundered funds were from drug trafficking, and denying Polanco\u2019s request for a minor role adjustment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1019-26\">The evidence at trial of the nature and circumstances of the money transactions (related to the Venezuelan black market Bolivar exchange) was sufficient to support Polanco\u2019s conviction for knowing or being deliberately ignorant to the fact that the money was from drug trafficking. The district court also did not commit clear error in applying a guideline enhancement based on Polanco\u2019s knowledge of the money\u2019s connection to drugs. And the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>court did not commit clear error in denying Polanco\u2019s request for a minor role adjustment: he was only being held responsible for his conduct in the conspiracy. Accordingly, we affirm Polanco\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
