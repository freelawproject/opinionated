Pizzini is an Hispanic woman of Puerto Rican descent, who has been employed since 2003 in the Miami field office of the Federal Air Marshal Service, a component of DHS.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court granted summary judgment in favor of DHS on each of Pizzini\u2019s claims. Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>Pizzini argues here that the district court erred because DHS \u201cfailed to meet its burden on summary judgment and genuine issues of material fact exist for the jury to decide each claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-19\">We review a district court order granting summary judgment <em>de novo. Rioux v. City of Atlanta, Ga., </em>520 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir.2008). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)). In assessing whether a genuine issue of mate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>rial fact exists, we \u201cmust view all the evidence and all factual inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and must resolve all reasonable doubts about the facts in favor of the non-movant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). Stated differently, \u201c[a] genuine issue of material fact exists when a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Chapter 7 Trustee v. Gate Gourmet, Inc., </em>683 F.3d 1249, 1254 (11th Cir.2012)(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">1. HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">To establish a hostile work environment claim under Title VII, a plaintiff must show that: (1) she belongs to a protected group; (2) she was subjected to unwelcome harassment; (8) that harassment was based on her membership in the protected group; (4) the harassment was severe or pervasive enough to alter the terms and conditions of employment and create a hostile or abusive working environment; and (5) the employer is directly or vicariously liable for such environment. <em>Jones v. UPS Ground Freight, </em>683 F.3d 1283, 1292 (11th Cir.2012). The district court granted summary judgment to DHS on Pizzini\u2019s hostile work environment complaint because it determined that she \u201cha[d] not met the \u2018pervasive or severe\u2019 element of her ... claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">Pizzini takes exception to the district court\u2019s determination, arguing that it \u201cignores the totality of the circumstances and fails to examine the conduct in context.\u201d In support, Pizzini alleges \u201cunequal treatment when compared to ... non-Hispanic coworkers,\u201d and \u201crepeated racially derogatory comments [made] by virtually all of [her] coworkers [and] ignored and exacerbated by supervisors.\u201d Finally, she draws our attention to the fact that she was involuntarily hospitalized for two nights in August 2010, allegedly because of the \u201cseverity]\u201d and \u201chostility]\u201d of her work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">Pizzini\u2019s argument in this regard fails. First, neither of the two cognizable instances of \u201cunequal treatment\u201d alleged by Pizzini can reasonably support her hostile work environment claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The first of these alleged instances \u2014 that a supervisor demanded that she clean \u201ctrash\u201d from government vehicles \u2014 is contradicted by Pizzi-ni\u2019s own deposition testimony, taken as part of her initial complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). In that deposition, Pizzini stated that her supervisor requested that she recover receipts and other papers from government vehicles because these documents were necessary for Pizzini to properly perform her duties as DHS fleet custodian. In her deposition, she also made clear that her supervisor never asked her to pick up \u201ctrash.\u201d Pizzini\u2019s testimony is consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>with the supervisor\u2019s affidavit \u2014 submitted by Pizzini as part of her own motion for summary judgment. The supervisor explained that he instructed Pizzini to check the vehicles for this paperwork because it was \u201clogical[ ]\u201d and \u201cefficien[t]\u201d for her to do so, given her \u201cresponsibility] for maintaining vehicle records.\u201d Considering the record as a whole, this allegation does not reasonably support her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">Neither does Pizzini\u2019s second alleged instance of unequal treatment reasonably support her hostile work environment claim. She asserts that a supervisor \u201cre-fus[ed] to approve [her] leave requests until all non-Hispanic program assistants had submitted their leave requests.\u201d In support of this allegation Pizzini has provided three emails, sent by her supervisor to multiple employees in the Miami field office, in which the supervisor requests that all holiday leave requests be submitted by certain dates so that office-wide holiday leave calendars could be coordinated. However, nothing about these emails suggests that Pizzini was singled out for \u201cunequal treatment.\u201d Indeed it appears that each of her holiday leave requests were granted within fifteen days of submission, and no less than six weeks prior to the requested time off. Thus, based on our <em>de novo </em>review of the record before us, this allegation also does not reasonably support Pizzini\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">Neither are we persuaded that the \u201cracially derogatory comments\u201d alleged by Pizzini are sufficient to satisfy the \u201csevere or pervasive\u201d prong of the hostile work environment test. The first of these comments \u2014 that Hispanics \u201cdon\u2019t understand others when spoken to\u201d \u2014 appears to be taken out of context. The record does not reflect that DHS or its employees ever stated that <em>Hispanics </em>\u201cdon\u2019t understand others when spoken to.\u201d Instead it indicates that one of Pizzini\u2019s supervisors told Pizzini that <em>Pizzini </em>\u201cnever understands people when they talk to her.\u201d Pizzini attributes this statement to racial animus but has provided no independent evidence to support that claim. At the same time, Pizzini concedes that this statement occurred in a closed-door meeting between herself and a supervisor, during which Pizzini accused the supervisor of failing to follow through on an alleged agreement to change the content of Pizzini\u2019s performance review. In context, it appears that this statement had nothing to do with Pizzini\u2019s race; rather it related to a miscommunication with the supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>The only remaining \u201ceomment[ ]\u201d before us on appeal\u2014specifically, that \u201cPuerto Ri-cans will never be promoted in the Miami Field Office because they don\u2019t know how to speak or write English\u201d\u2014cannot independently satisfy the \u201csevere or pervasive\u201d prong.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Our law is clear that to be actionable, a hostile work environment must be both objectively and subjectively offensive. <em>Jones, </em>683 F.3d at 1299. In evaluating the objective severity of the harassment, we consider: (1) the frequency of the conduct; (2) its severity; (3) whether it was physically threatening or humiliating, or a \u201cmere offensive utterance\u201d; and (4) whether it unreasonably interfered with the employee\u2019s work performance. <em>Id. </em>Pizzini admits that she was not present for this statement and does not know when it was made. There is no indication that the statement occurred more than once, was accompanied by a physical threat or was humiliating, or that it unreasonably interfered with her work performance. Under our precedent, an alleged one-time statement such as this is insufficient to sustain a hostile work environment claim against a motion for summary judgment. <em>See McCann v. Tillman, </em>526 F.3d 1370, 1378-79 (11th Cir.2008) (affirming summary judgment on appellant\u2019s hostile work environment claim where alleged conduct included two demeaning comments made in appellant\u2019s presence, and two additional racial epithets spoken outside her presence, in a period of less than three years).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\">Finally, we cannot accept Pizzini\u2019s suggestion that her involuntary hospitalization independently establishes that her work environment was \u201chostile.\u201d First, as set out above, she has not demonstrated that the alleged conduct \u201cwas severe or pervasive enough to alter the terms and conditions of [her] employment.\u201d <em>See Jones, </em>683 F.3d at 1292. Second, her hospitalization was not, as Pizzini implies, directly the result of any alleged conduct within her work environment. Rather it was prompted by Pizzini\u2019s distress when the DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) informed her that it would not be visiting the Miami field office and that she should \u201csummarize and forward information\u201d regarding her EEOC complaint to OIG for review. Third, by Pizzini\u2019s own admission, she believed the hospitalization was an overreaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">In sum, a reasonable jury could not return a favorable verdict on Pizzini\u2019s hostile work environment claim because the alleged conduct was not sufficiently \u201csevere or pervasive,\u201d <em>Jones, </em>683 F.3d at 1292, even when viewed in the light most favorable to her. <em>See Chapter 7 Trustee, </em>683 F.3d at 1254. Thus, the district court properly granted DHS\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">II. RETALIATION</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-9\">A prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII requires the plaintiff to show that: \u201c(1) she engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) she suffered a materially adverse action; and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action.\u201d <em>Chapter 7 Trustee, </em>683 F.3d at 1258 (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). The district court determined that DHS was entitled to summary judgment on Pizzini\u2019s retaliation claim \u201cbe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>cause Pizzini [could not] show that she suffered an adverse employment action after the filing of her EEO complaint,\u201d a statutorily protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">Pizzini argues that the district court erred in its determination that she did not suffer a materially adverse action following her complaint to the EEOC. Specifically Pizzini asserts that after she filed her EEOC Complaint, she was denied a salary increase, reassigned positions from fleet custodian to property custodian, and received a negative performance appraisal. Based on our <em>de novo </em>review of the record, however, Pizzini\u2019s argument does not carry the day. First, as noted by the district court, Pizzini filed her EEOC complaint <em>after </em>she learned from her supervisor that she would not receive a pay increase. Thus, Pizzini did not engage in \u201cstatutorily protected activity\u201d until after the alleged \u201cmaterially adverse action.\u201d <em>Chapter 7 Trustee, </em>683 F.3d at 1258. Pizzini\u2019s failure to receive a pay increase therefore does not constitute a materially adverse action for purposes of her retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">Neither does Pizzini\u2019s reassignment from fleet custodian to property custodian constitute a materially adverse action. Again, Pizzini filed her EEOC complaint only after learning of her reassignment. Also, Pizzini has pointed to no evidence that her new position is \u201cmore arduous and dirtier\u201d than her previous position, or even that her former position \u201cwas objectively considered a better job.\u201d <em>See Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 71, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 2417, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006) (quotation marks omitted). Thus, Pizzini\u2019s reassignment cannot reasonably qualify as a materially adverse action for purposes of her retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">Finally, the content of Pizzini\u2019s performance reviews is not sufficient to qualify as a materially adverse action. The performance reviews were not adverse because, as indicated by the district court, they are \u201coverall positive.\u201d Beyond that, there is little qualitative difference, if any, between the substance of the reviews Pizzini received prior to filing her EEOC complaint and those she received after filing her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-8\">Neither individually nor collectively could these alleged instances sustain a favorable verdict on Pizzini\u2019s retaliation claim. <em>See Akins v. Fulton Cnty., Ga., </em>420 F.3d 1293, 1301 (11th Cir.2005). Thus, the district court properly granted summary judgment. <em>See Chapter 7 Trustee, </em>683 F.3d at 1258-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-9\">III. DISCRIMINATION</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-10\">Among other things, Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any individual with respect to her \u201ccompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of [her] race, ... or national origin.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). A plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that: \u201c(1) she belongs to a protected class; (2) she was qualified to do the job; (3) she was subjected to adverse employment action; and (4) her employer treated similarly situated employees outside her class more favorably.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Carroll, </em>529 F.3d 961, 970 (11th Cir. 2008). The district court entered summary judgment in favor of DHS on Pizzini\u2019s discrimination claim because \u201cPizzini [could not] show that she suffered an adverse employment action as a result of her race or national origin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-11\">Pizzini challenges the district court\u2019s determination by alleging \u201cdifferential application of work rules\u201d based on a supervisor\u2019s \u201crefusal to approve [her] leave requests until all non-Hispanic program assistants had submitted their leave requests\u201d; a supervisor\u2019s \u201crefusal to assist [her] with her work duties\u201d; and a supervisor\u2019s demand that she \u201cperform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>duties not required of her non-Hispanic coworkers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Pizzini\u2019s allegation about her leave requests cannot reasonably support her discrimination claim for the same reasons that it cannot reasonably support her hostile work environment claim. Her remaining allegations are waived because once again, and as we discussed above, Pizzini has not provided citations to the record, and she has not provided evidentiary support to show the \u201cduties\u201d of which she speaks. <em>See Nat\u2019l Alliance for the Mentally Ill, 3</em>76 F.3d at 1295-96; <em>qf. Doe, </em>410 F.3d at 1349 n. 10. Thus, because Pizzini has failed to make a prima facie allegation of an adverse employment action based on her race or national origin, her discrimination claim fails. <em>See Crawford, </em>529 F.3d at 970-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">For these reasons, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of DHS is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1014-12\">. The facts underlying Pizzini\u2019s claims are more completely set out in the Report and Recommendation of the Magistrate Judge. <em>Pizzini v. Napolitano, </em>No. 10-61498, 2011 WL 5373801 (S.D.Fla. Nov. 1, 2011) (magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">. On appeal, Pizzini also alleges that a supervisor \"refused to assist [her] with her job duties.\u201d Pizzini has failed, however, to provide citations to the record regarding this allegation, or even to provide any indication as to which \"job duties\u201d she is referring. While we read briefs filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants liberally, <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008), we have also warned that failure to include citations to the parts of the record on which an appellant relies may result in waiver of those allegations for purposes of appeal. <em>See Nat\u2019l Alliance for the Mentally Ill v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>376 F.3d 1292, 1295-96 (11th Cir.2004) (citing Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A)); <em>cf. Doe v. Moore, </em>410 F.3d 1337, 1349 n. 10 (11th Cir.2005) (\"On appeal, we require appellants to not only state their contentions to us, but also to give \u2018the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u2019 \"Xquoting Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(a)). Thus, to the extent that we are not able to determine which incidents or job duties she is referring to here, this allegation is waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">. Relying on <em>Gregory v. Ga. Dep't of Human Res., </em>355 F.3d 1277, 1279-80 (11th Cir.2004), the district court determined that Pizzini's allegation regarding leave requests was beyond the scope of its review because Pizzini failed to raise it in her complaint to the EEOC. This reliance was misplaced. In <em>Gregory, </em>we held that the district court properly <em>allowed </em>a retaliation claim to proceed, even where the complainant failed to allege retaliation in her initial complaint to the EEOC, because \"[t]he facts alleged in her EEOC charge [of race and gender discrimination] could have reasonably been extended to encompass a claim for retaliation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1280. We made clear in <em>Gregory </em>that \"[t]he proper inquiry ... is whether [the complaint to the district court] was like or related to, or grew out of, the allegations contained in [the] EEOC charge.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Wu v. Thomas, </em>863 F.2d 1543 (11th Cir.1989) (\"As long as allegations in the judicial complaint and proof are reasonably related to charges in the administrative filing and no material differences between them exist, the court will entertain them.... Judicial claims which serve to amplify, clarify, or more clearly focus earlier EEO complaints are appropriate.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). Thus, insofar as this allegation was \"reasonably related\u201d to Pizzini's EEOC charge, and \"served to amplify, clarify, [and] more clearly focus [her] earlier EEO complaint[ ],\" it should have been considered by the district court. Nonetheless, as we explained above, this allegation cannot reasonably support Pizzini\u2019s hostile work environment claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">. In her brief, Pizzini also alleges additional \"racially derogatory comments,\" specifically statements that Hispanics \"don\u2019t know any English,\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t know how to write English.\u201d Again, however, Pizzini provided no citations to the record to support these allegations. Our independent endeavors to locate this evidence have failed. For this reason, these allegations are also waived for purposes of Pizzini\u2019s appeal. <em>See Nat'l Alliance for the Mentally Ill, </em>376 F.3d at 1295-96.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
