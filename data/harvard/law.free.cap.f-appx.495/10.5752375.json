Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>408 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), and a claim for libel and slander. Smith\u2019s claims arose out of his termination by the U.S. Census Bureau based on a prior criminal conviction. On appeal, Smith does not contest the district court\u2019s finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his complaint because, first, the Civil Service Reform Act (\u201cCSRA\u201d) precluded Smith\u2019s constitutional claim and, second, the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d) did not waive sovereign immunity for Smith\u2019s libel and slander claim. Instead, Smith argues that he exhausted his administrative remedies and that the Department of Commerce violated his constitutional rights. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-14\">We review a district court\u2019s order granting a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo, </em>viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Parise v. Delta Airlines, Inc., </em>141 F.3d 1463, 1465 (1998). Factual findings concerning subject matter jurisdiction made by the district court will be overturned only if clearly erroneous. <em>Barnett v. Okeechobee Hosp., </em>283 F.3d 1232, 1238 (11th Cir.2002). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(h)(3) says that a court shall dismiss an action whenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter. A facial attack on the complaint requires the court -to look and see if the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a basis of subject matter jurisdiction, and the allegations of his complaint are taken as true for the purposes of the motion. <em>Menchaca v. Chrysler Credit Corp., </em>613 F.2d 507, 511 (5th Cir.1980).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-15\"><em>Bivens </em>permitted plaintiffs to bring civil rights actions against federal officers. <em>Bivens, </em>403 U.S. at 397, 91 S.Ct. 1999. However, the Supreme Court has limited the circumstances under which a <em>Bivens </em>claim may be asserted. When the design of a government program suggests that Congress has provided adequate remedies for constitutional violations that may occur in the course of its administration, <em>Bivens </em>remedies are not available. <em>Schweiker v. Chilicky, </em>487 U.S. 412, 423,108 S.Ct. 2460, 101 L.Ed.2d 370 (1988). The CSRA created an elaborate framework for evaluating adverse personnel actions against federal employees. <em>Lee v. Hughes, </em>145 F.3d 1272, 1274 (11th Cir.1998). The CSRA is designed to preclude a <em>Bivens </em>remedy, even if the CSRA does not provide for administrative or judicial review of an adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>personnel action. <em>Id. </em>at 1275-76. In <em>United States v. Fausto, </em>484 U.S. 489, 108 S.Ct. 668, 98 L.Ed.2d 830 (1988), the Supreme Court \u201cemphatically and conclusively established the preemptive nature of the CSRA.\u201d <em>Stephens v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>901 F.2d 1571, 1575-76 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-3\">The United States may not be sued without its consent. <em>Simons v. Vinson, </em>394 F.2d 732, 735-36 (5th Cir.1968). The FTCA provides a limited waiver of the United State\u2019s sovereign immunity for tort claims that allows the government to be sued by certain parties under certain circumstances. <em>Dalrymple v. United States, </em>460 F.3d 1318, 1324 (11th Cir.2006). A federal court does not have jurisdiction under the FTCA unless the plaintiff first files an administrative claim with the appropriate agency. <em>Id. </em>Section 2680(h) of Title 28 provides a statutory exemption from the FTCA for claims arising out of libel and slander.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">In this case, the district court provided three separate grounds for its dismissal based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction: (1) preclusion by the CSRA; (2)the Department\u2019s sovereign immunity; and (3) Smith\u2019s failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. Even if we were to liberally construe Smith\u2019s <em>pro se </em>appellate brief, he did not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that his claims were precluded by the CSRA and by sovereign immunity. Because he failed to raise these issues in his brief, Smith has abandoned any challenge to them on appeal. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Further, a brief analysis shows that the district court did not err in its dismissal of Smith\u2019s claims. First, Smith\u2019s constitutional claim was properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Smith attempted to bring a <em>Bivens </em>complaint against the Secretary for violation of his due process rights during the hiring process. The CSRA precludes a <em>Bivens </em>remedy, and therefore, any claim against the government for adverse personnel action must be brought according to the CSRA. As a result, the district court properly concluded that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over Smith\u2019s due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">Similarly, Smith\u2019s tort claim for defamation was properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The FTCA specifically states that it does not waive the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity for claims arising out of libel and slander. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h). Consequently, the Department is immune to Smith\u2019s libel and slander claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">As we\u2019ve noted, Smith\u2019s appeal only contests the district court\u2019s finding that he did not exhaust his administrative remedies. But even had Smith exhausted his administrative remedies, both the CSRA and principles of sovereign immunity preclude the district court from exercising subject matter jurisdiction over his claim. Accordingly, we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b33-11\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the Fifth Circuit handed down before the close of business on September 30, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b34-7\">. Further, because the district court correctly dismissed the action based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is DENIED.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
