He appeals the statutory maximum sentence of 240 months of imprisonment imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">White first argues that the district court erred proeedurally by treating the guideline sentence of 240 months of imprisonment as mandatory. He concedes that he failed to preserve this issue by objecting in the district court, but he argues that this court\u2019s review should be for abuse of discretion because the error resulted in a sentence that was in violation of law and because preservation rules should be relaxed in the sentencing context.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">A district court commits procedural error by, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ctreating the Guidelines as mandatory.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 88, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). White\u2019s failure to raise the issue in the district court results in plain error review. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 806 (5th Cir.2008). To establish plain error, White must demonstrate an error that is clear or obvious and that affects substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If such a showing is made, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id. </em>\u201cTo show that an error affects a defendant\u2019s substantial rights, the defendant must show that it affected the outcome in the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 364 (5th Cir.2009). We have not followed other circuits in relaxing the showing required on the substantial rights prong in the sentencing context. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">Here, because the statutory maximum sentence was less than the minimum of the guideline range, the statutorily authorized maximum sentence was the guideline sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a). Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the district court\u2019s statement that White\u2019s sentence was \u201cfixed\u201d under the guidelines at 240 months establishes that the district court erred proeedurally by treating the guideline sentence as mandatory, White fails to establish that the error affected his substantial rights, as he has pointed to nothing of record to show that the district court would have imposed a lower sentence but for the procedural error. <em>See United States v. Kippers, </em>685 F.3d 491, 497 (5th Cir.2012). He is therefore not entitled to relief under the plain error standard. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423; <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-14\">White next contends that the district court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2Dl.ll(b)(l) for possession of a dangerous weapon. He argues that the Government did not meet its burden to establish a sufficient temporal connection between the firearm and drug trafficking. In the alternative, he asserts that he established that it was clearly improbable that the .22 caliber rifle found in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>the van he was driving was connected to drug trafficking.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">\u201cThat the firearms possessed were not the usual firearms or tools of the trade, does not render the court\u2019s findings clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Eastland, </em>989 F.2d 760, 770 (5th Cir.1993). Here, although there was no pseudoephedrine in the van at the time the .22 caliber rifle was found, receipts indicating purchases of pseudoephedrine were found in the van, along with a number of items suggestive of methamphetamine manufacture. Pseu-doephedrine is an immediate precursor to methamphetamine. <em>United States v. Jessup, </em>305 F.3d 300, 304 (5th Cir.2002). In view of the foregoing, the Government adequately established the required temporal and spatial relationships between White, the weapon, and the drug trafficking activity. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764-65 (5th Cir.2008). The district court\u2019s decision to apply the two-level enhancement of \u00a7 2Dl.ll(b)(l) was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Jacquinot, </em>258 F.3d 423, 430 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">White also contends that the district court erred in imposing a three-level enhancement for his role in the offense. The enhancement applies \u201c[i]f the defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d \u00a7 3Bl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Instructing others to obtain precursors for the manufacture of methamphetamine is evidence of a managerial or supervisory role. <em>See United States v. Lewis, </em>476 F.3d 369, 390 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Mesner, </em>377 F.3d 849, 851 (8th Cir.2004). The district court\u2019s determination that White supervised co-conspirator Bertha Mae Russell in obtaining pseudoephedrine pills and that the criminal activity involved five or more participants is adequately supported by the record and is not clearly erroneous. <em>See Lewis, </em>476 F.3d at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b573-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
