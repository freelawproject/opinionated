He contends: the sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); and the illegal reentry Sentencing Guideline, \u00a7 2L1.2, is flawed because: it gives too much weight to a defendant\u2019s prior convictions; it overstates the seriousness of his illegal reentry offense, which he characterizes as nothing more than an international trespass; and it did not account for his personal history and circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-20\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly-preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 48-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Alvarez does not claim procedural error. A discretionary sentence imposed, as here, within a properly-calculated Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>660 F.3d 231, 234 (5th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-21\">After considering Alvarez\u2019 assertions at sentencing, the district court determined a 24-month sentence, the lowest in the applicable advisory Guidelines sentencing range, was appropriate. \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant\u201d. <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Alvarez\u2019 contentions concerning the weight given his prior criminal convictions and his family history and circumstances fail to rebut the above-referenced presumption that his sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>E.g., United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Further, his assertion that his sentence is unreasonable because his offense is nothing more than an \u201cinternational trespass\u201d is foreclosed by our court\u2019s precedent. <em>E.g., United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number><em>v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b501-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
