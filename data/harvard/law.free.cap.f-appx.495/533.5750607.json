Pompa, </em>434 F.3d 800, 805 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see United States v. Beechum, </em>582 F.2d 898, 911 (5th Cir.1978) (en banc); Fed. R.Evid. 403 &amp; 404. We review a district court\u2019s admission of such evidence under a heightened abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. McCall, </em>553 F.3d 821, 827 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-15\">Because Bivins pleaded not guilty, and part of his defense was that the gun found in his house had been left there by his father, evidence of his past gun possession was relevant to his knowledge and intent. See <em>United States v. Olguin, </em>643 F.3d 384, 390 (5th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 439, 181 L.Ed.2d 285 (2011); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>620 F.3d 483, 489-91 (5th Cir. 2010). Past convictions for possession of a firearm are highly probative of these issues. <em>See Williams, </em>620 F.3d at 491. Although the similarity of the past offenses increases the risk of prejudice, in light of the jury instructions regarding the permissible uses of this evidence and the limited portion of the trial occupied by the discussion of these convictions, any prejudice did not substantially outweigh their probative value. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion. <em>McCall, </em>553 F.3d at 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-17\">Also, Bivins challenges two statements by the Government during closing arguments. In analyzing a claim of misconduct during closing argument, we consider de novo whether the challenged remark was improper; if it was, we then consider whether the remark \u201caffected the substantial rights of the defendant\u201d under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>674 F.3d 420, 438-39 (5th Cir.) (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>2012 WL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>286B449 (Oct. 1, 2012) (No. 12-5168). We consider three factors: (1) the magnitude of the remark\u2019s prejudice; (2) any cautionary instructions given; and (3) the strength of the evidence supporting the conviction. <em>Id. </em>A defendant attempting to show that a remark affected his substantial rights must meet a \u201chigh bar.\u201d <em>United States v. Ebron, </em>683 F.3d 105, 140 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">During its rebuttal argument, the Government stated that bullets were close to the gun; however, the evidence showed that the gun was unloaded and that police did not see any ammunition. Although the district court sustained Bivins\u2019 objection and instructed the jury to disregard this statement, he argues that the should have granted a mistrial. We review the denial of a mistrial for an abuse of discretion. <em>Turner, </em>674 F.3d at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Although we agree that the remark was improper, in light of the limited prejudice resulting from this remark, the district court\u2019s immediate instruction that the jury should disregard the remark and that the arguments of counsel were not evidence, we conclude that Bivins failed to meet the \u201chigh bar\u201d to show that his substantial rights were affected. <em>See Ebron, </em>683 F.3d at 140; <em>Turner, </em>674 F.3d at 439. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying his motion for a mistrial. <em>See Turner, </em>674 F.3d at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Bivins next argues that the district court abused its discretion by overruling his objection to another remark by the Government that it \u201cwould not be surprised\u201d if Bivins\u2019 father had not seen the gun the two years. The district court found that the Government was arguing a permissible inference from the evidence. We agree that this was a permissible inference. <em>See United States v. Mendoza, </em>522 F.3d 482, 491 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Finally, Bivins argues that there was no proof that he knew that the gun had moved in interstate commerce and that \u00a7 922(g) is a violation of Congress\u2019s commerce power. As he concedes, these arguments are foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Schmidt, </em>487 F.3d 253, 254 (5th Cir. 2007); <em>United States v. Dancy, </em>861 F.2d 77, 81-82 (5th Cir.1988); <em>United States v. Rawls, </em>85 F.3d 240, 242 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b556-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
