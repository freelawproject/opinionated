On review, Maison argues that (1) the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s adverse-credibility determination cannot be supported by substantial evidence, (2) the BIA and IJ erred in finding that a July 1999 incident, when Maison was attacked in Guyana, did not amount to past persecution, (3) the IJ erred by failing to consider that the \u201con account of\u2019 prong was satisfied based on imputed political opinion, and (4) he established a well-founded fear of future persecution. The government responds that Maison failed to exhaust these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">As an initial matter, although Maison applied for CAT relief and raised this issue in his brief before the BIA, he did not raise this claim before us on review. Accordingly, the issue is abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (when an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">I. Exhaustion</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">We review jurisdictional questions <em>de novo. Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006). We may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to him as a matter of right. INA \u00a7 242(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). The exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional and precludes review of a claim that was not presented to the BIA. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1249-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">In order to properly raise a claim before the BIA, the petitioner must mention the issue and discuss its merits, or at least contest the basis for the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Alim v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 1239, 1254 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that, when a claim was mentioned in a petitioner\u2019s brief to the BIA and was specifically requested as relief, it was properly exhausted); <em>see also Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1224, 1228 n. 3 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that exhaustion requires only that the petitioner argued the core issue before the BIA, the petitioner need not have engaged the IJ\u2019s reasons for denying relief, and \u201chyper-technical[ ]\u201d jurisdictional arguments from the government regarding the exhaustion requirement were unavailing).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">Maison exhausted his claims regarding the adverse-credibility determination, past persecution, and a well-founded fear of future persecution. He asserted his claims regarding the adverse-credibility finding and a well-founded fear of future persecution in his brief to the BIA by raising the core issue. <em>Montano Cisneros, </em>514 F.3d at 1228 n. 3. Moreover, Maison contested the IJ\u2019s resolution of his past-persecution claim in his Notice of Appeal to the BIA, which was sufficient to exhaust this claim. <em>Alim, </em>446 F.3d at 1253-54; <em>Montano Cisneros, </em>514 F.3d at 1228 n. 3 (rejecting the government\u2019s \u201chyper-technical\u201d jurisdictional requirements regarding administrative exhaustion requirements).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">Maison, however, failed to exhaust his claim that the \u201con account of\u2019 prong was satisfied on the basis of imputed political opinion because this claim was not raised before the BIA. Accordingly, we dismiss Maison\u2019s claim based on imputed political opinion, but address the other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>II. Adverse-Credibility Finding</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Maison argues that the record does not contain substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s adverse-credibility determination based on the BIA\u2019s findings that (1) his father\u2019s declaration about the July 1999 incident contradicted Maison\u2019s testimony that he was alone when he was attacked, and (2) it was \u201cimplausible\u201d that his father, a journalist and opposition reporter, did not write an article in the newspaper regarding the July 1999 attack on Maison. Further, the contradiction from the credible-fear interview regarding whether Mai-son had a brother should not, by itself, sustain an adverse-credibility finding because giving false information to immigration authorities to avoid deportation can be consistent with a fear of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">We review credibility determinations under the substantial-evidence test. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2006). The trier of fact determines credibility, and we may not substitute our judgment for that of the BIA with respect to credibility findings. <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir. 2004) <em>(en </em>banc). In fact, we will reverse the IJ\u2019s credibility findings \u201conly if the evidence compels a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the Board adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, [this Court] review[s] the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, to the extent that the BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s reasons for its adverse-credibility determination, we review both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s decisions. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">An applicant for asylum must meet the INA\u2019s definition of a refugee. INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). The definition of \u201crefugee\u201d includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_U\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Thus, in order to meet the definition of a refugee, the applicant must, \u201cwith specific and credible evidence, demonstrate (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a well-founded fear that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2006) (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-12\">Under the REAL ID Act of 2005, credibility determinations are based upon the totality of the circumstances, which may include inaccuracies or falsehoods that do not go to the \u201cheart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(B)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). An applicant must establish eligibility for relief from removal by offering credible, direct, and specific evidence. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). We have held that the BIA may base an adverse-credibility determination upon credible-fear interviews. <em>See, e.g., Shkambi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>584 F.3d 1041, 1049-52 (11th Cir.2009) (upholding BIA\u2019s adverse-credibility finding based upon inconsistencies in applicant\u2019s testimony and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>credible-fear interviews). We have also held that the resulting credibility finding must be supported by the record rather than \u201cpersonal perceptions\u201d or speculation and conjecture. <em>Tang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 578 F.3d </em>1270, 1278 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">As an initial matter, the BIA declined to address any of Maison\u2019s arguments relating to the merits of his persecution claims in light of its credibility determination. (\u201cCounsel has not established that the credibility finding contains clear error.... Consequently, the respondent is not eligible for asylum or withholding of removal.\u201d). Accordingly, his arguments on appeal as to whether he demonstrated past or a well-founded fear of future persecution, are outside the scope of our review and will not be addressed. <em>See Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231 n. 4 (refusing to address the merits of a persecution claim because the IJ\u2019s decision was based on an adverse-credibility determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">In this case, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse-credibility determination. Specifically, the BIA found no clear error in the adverse-credibility determination based on the following findings by the IJ: (1) a discrepancy between Maison\u2019s testimony and his father\u2019s declaration regarding who was present during the July 1999 attack, (2) a discrepancy between Maison\u2019s statement in the credible-fear interview that he had a brother and his testimony before the IJ that he had a sister and not a brother, and (3) the implausibility that his father did not write a newspaper article, when he was a reporter, about the July 1999 attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">As to Maison\u2019s claim regarding his father\u2019s declaration, the record supports the inconsistency because both parties agreed that the declaration stated that Maison\u2019s father was present when Maison was attacked, whereas Maison testified that he was alone. The record also supports the BIA\u2019s finding that there was a discrepancy between Maison\u2019s statement in the credible-fear interview that he had a brother who left Guyana in fear and fled to Trinidad, and his testimony before the IJ that he had a sister, still living in Guyana, and not a brother. To the extent that the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s finding with regard to the newspaper article is speculative, we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Mehmeti v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1196, 1199 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). As a whole, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s adverse-credibility determination because the record supports both the discrepancy between Maison\u2019s testimony and his father\u2019s declaration, and the inconsistency between Maison\u2019s testimony during his credible-fear interview and his testimony before the IJ. Therefore, Maison did not meet his burden of showing that the record compels reversal of the adverse-credibility determination. <em>See Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">After reviewing the entire record, and after consideration of the parties\u2019 appellate briefs, we dismiss in part, and deny in part, the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
