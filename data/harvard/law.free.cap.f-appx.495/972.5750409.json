This offense carried a statutory maximum sentence of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment but no statutory minimum sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). Due to his prior criminal history, Mr. Davis\u2019 advisory range under the Sentencing Guidelines was 37-48 months\u2019 imprisonment. At Mr. Davis\u2019 sentencing hearing, the district court imposed a sentence of 37 months\u2019 imprisonment and explained that the sentence was based, in large measure, upon Mr. Davis\u2019 prior offenses (including a state conviction for possession of a firearm by a felon) and numerous revocations of probation. On appeal, Mr. Davis argues that the sentence was substantively unreasonable, and that the district court should have imposed a lesser sentence of 24 months given that he had undergone various positive changes in his life during the pendency of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-16\">We review a sentence for substantive reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In so doing, \u201cwe do not, as the district court did, determine the exact sentence to be imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). In fact, even if the district court\u2019s sentence is more severe or more lenient than the sentence we would have imposed, reversal is only warranted if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008)). On this record, the district court\u2019s sentence was not substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>First, Mr. Davis received a sentence that was within the advisory range under the Sentencing Guidelines. Although we do not automatically presume a sentence falling within the guideline range to be reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788). Under the Sentencing Guidelines, Mr. Davis was in Criminal History Category IV and, notably, had a prior conviction for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in 2009. D.E. 15 at 5. In this case, the district court reasoned that Mr. Davis\u2019s sentence needed to \u201cconvince him that he just is not allowed to [possess firearms].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. The district court also concluded that a sentence at the low end of the guideline range would be sufficient \u201cbecause the aggravating factors that exist <em>in this case, </em>principally the Defendant\u2019s criminal record, have already been taken into consideration in the calculation of the guideline range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16 (emphasis added). Therefore, the district court\u2019s reliance on the advisory guideline range was ultimately case-specific and not a rote application. We find nothing in the record to suggest that the district court\u2019s judgment was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">Second, the record reflects that the district court sufficiently considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. At the sentencing hearing, the district court permitted Mr. Davis, through counsel, to argue in favor of a variance. D.E. 15 at 6-10. The argument was heard, subsequently addressed, and rejected. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 14 (\u201cAnd the excuse that he has got a firearm because he wants to protect his family is just not going to be accepted. I applaud Mr. Davis for getting involved in his young child\u2019s life, but that\u2019s another reason why he shouldn\u2019t be having firearms ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">Mr. Davis nevertheless contends that the district court \u201cfail[ed] to consider his life history and circumstances in its balancing of the Section 3553(a) factors.\u201d Initial Br. at 7. We disagree. On the contrary, the district court expressly acknowledged that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors including \u201cthe history and characteristics of the Defendant.\u201d D.E. 15 at 16. <em>See also United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that an acknowledgment by the district court that it considered the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) is generally sufficient). Thus, what Mr. Davis is essentially arguing is that the district court did not give sufficient weight to the particular circumstances he raised at his sentencing hearing. But, \u201cwe will not second guess the weight (or lack thereof) that the [district court] accorded to a given factor ..., as long as the sentence ultimately imposed is reasonable in light of <em>all </em>the circumstances presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir.2010) (citations and quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in original). In this case, the district court considered all the relevant factors but chose to place a greater emphasis upon Mr. Davis\u2019 prior criminal history (including the same criminal violation three years earlier) and numerous violations of probation. D.E. 15 at 14. The district court is entitled to make that evaluation. <em>See Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1192 (finding that a sentence is not necessarily unreasonable simply because the district court attached great weight to a single factor). We do not believe that the circumstances in this case cause that evaluation to be substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
