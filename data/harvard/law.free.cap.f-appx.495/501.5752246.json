He was sentenced below the advisory guideline range to 120 months of imprisonment. He appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in applying a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4), based on its finding that the offense involved material that portrayed sadistic images; the district court erred in applying a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(6), based on the use of a computer; the district court erred in applying a five-level enhancement under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B), based on its finding that the offense involved the distribution of pornographic materials for the receipt of a thing of value, but not for pecuniary gain; and the district court erred in denying his request for a downward departure based on what he contends was his role as a minimal participant in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-15\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), sentences are reviewed for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 360 (5th Cir. 2009). Where, as in this case, the defendant raised his arguments in the district court, we review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Guidelines de novo and the district court\u2019s factual findings and application of the Guidelines to the specific facts of the case for clear error. <em>See United States v. Lyckman, </em>235 F.3d 234, 237 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-16\">Desadier argues that the four-level increase under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) was not warranted because the district court made no findings of fact regarding what images portrayed sadistic conduct and because the photographs show no evidence of actual pain. We have held that the sexual penetration of a child by an adult male is conduct that \u201ceause[s] ... pain, physical or emotional or both, and therefore constitutes sadism or violence within the meaning of [\u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239. Further, in considering what acts qualify as sadistic or violent, we have recognized that \u201calthough acts that inflict pain upon the child victim are sadistic and violent per se within the meaning of the guidelines, an absence of physical pain is not per se outside the ambit of the enhancement for sadistic acts\u201d under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4). <em>United States v. Comeaux, </em>445 Fed.Appx. 743, 745 (5th Cir.2011). Sadistic conduct can include sexual gratification that is purposefully degrading and humiliating to the victim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>The Government, in its appellate brief, specifically describes the photographs that were submitted as exhibits at sentencing and reviewed by the district court in camera, and Desadier does not refute that the photographs depict the images described by the Government. The photographs contain the same kind of images that this court has found to be sadistic, <em>see Lyckman, </em>235 F.3d at 239; <em>Comeaux, </em>445 Fed. Appx. at 745, and we are satisfied that those images were viewed by the district court. The district court did not err in applying the four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) based on those images.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">Desadier also argues that the application of the two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(6) constituted unwarranted double-counting because the statute of conviction contemplates the use of a computer to commit the crime as one of the elements of the offense. Although \u00a7 2552A(a)(2)(A) provides that the offense can be committed by \u201cany means or facility of interstate or foreign commerce ... including by computer,\u201d \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(6) does not expressly forbid double-counting. Thus, the district court\u2019s application of the Guideline did not constitute impermissible double-counting. <em>See United States v. Calbat, </em>266 F.3d 358, 364 (5th Cir.2001) (holding that double-counting is prohibited only if the relevant Guideline expressly forbids it).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">We also find that the district court did not err in applying a five-level enhancement under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B). Although Desadier argues that a purely gratuitous dissemination of pornographic images should not trigger the enhancement, this court has upheld \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B) enhancements in other eases presenting facts similar to those here at issue. <em>See United States v. Onken, </em>440 Fed.Appx. 304, 305 (5th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>328 Fed.Appx. 308, 309 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Roman, </em>393 Fed.Appx. 149, 149-50 (5th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 964, 178 L.Ed.2d 794 (2011). In those cases, we held that defendants who, like Desadier, shared child pornography on peer-to-peer networks properly received \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B) enhancements because their actions evidenced an interest in sharing and receiving child pornography. While these cases are not binding, they are persuasive. <em>See Ballard v. Burton, </em>444 F.3d 391, 401 &amp; n. 7 (5th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Finally, to the extent that Desa-dier argues that the district court erred in its resolution of his motion for a downward departure, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s refusal to depart downwardly. <em>See United States v. Sam, </em>467 F.3d 857, 861 (5th Cir.2006). To the extent that Desadier challenges the district court\u2019s failure to apply an adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2, the district court\u2019s determination was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir.2005). Desadier was held accountable for distributing child pornography, and the record reflects that he understood how the file-sharing system worked and knowingly distributed hundreds of images of child pornography to others. Thus, the district court did not err in refusing to apply a minimal-participant adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.2); <em>Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203-04; <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>242 F.3d 593, 598-99 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b524-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
