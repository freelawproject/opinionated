Jones, a former special police officer in the town of Wayland, moved to amend his complaint to seek a declaration that the town must provide him with the retirement and compensation benefits afforded by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 85H.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather than rule immediately on Jones\u2019 motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>amend, the judge on remand allowed Jones to apply to the town\u2019s board of selectmen for compensation pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 85H, and \u201cordered\u201d the selectmen to rule on this application.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Section 85H provides two forms of benefits. In a mandatory provision, compensation (generally equal to the current first year salary of a regular police officer) must be paid to any special police officer who is \u201cdisabled because of . . . incapacity sustained in the performance of his duty without fault of his own,\u201d and who is therefore \u201cunable to perform the usual duties of his regular occupation.\u201d In addition, \u00a7 85H provides that a town \u201cmay retire\u201d a special police officer who becomes \u201cpermanently disabled\u201d due to \u201cinjuries sustained through no fault of his own in the actual performance of duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">In his application to the selectmen, Jones asked to be granted those \u201cbenefits\u201d available under \u00a7 85H; no distinction was made between permanent retirement benefits and temporary compensation for the inability to perform his \u201cregular\u201d occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">After meeting with Jones and his attorney, the selectmen denied Jones\u2019 application, and, with separate reference to both the retirement and compensation benefits available under \u00a7 85H, specified their reasons for doing so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Wayland then moved that judgment be entered that, pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F, the statute under which Jones had initially sought benefits,* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the town was liable to Jones in the amount of $244.35. There is no dispute as to the accuracy of this figure. Rather than entering judgment under \u00a7 111F, however, the judge allowed Jones\u2019 motion to amend his complaint by adding a claim for relief under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 85H. Jones then moved for summary judgment on this amended complaint; subsequently, Wayland also moved for summary judgment. Jones\u2019 motion was allowed, and Way-land\u2019s denied. Based on the first year salary of permanent Wayland police officers<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> over the period, December 1, 1970, to January 31, 1978, Wayland was ordered to pay Jones $84,069.66 plus interest. From this amount the judge ordered deducted $975.66 in employment compensation and $1,000 in insurance indemnity payments found to have been made to Jones. Wayland was ordered to make continuing compensation payments to Jones \u201cin accordance with the terms\u201d and \u201csubject to the limitations\u201d of \u00a7 85H. Finally, since in the judge\u2019s view the Legislature could not have intended that a person in Jones\u2019 position recover under both \u00a7 111F and \u00a7 85H, the town was found to have no liability to Jones under \u00a7 111F. Wayland appealed from the judgment, and we granted the town\u2019s motion for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Wayland attacks the trial judge\u2019s decision on three distinct bases.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> First, Wayland argues that the judge on remand improperly allowed Jones to amend his complaint to include a claim under \u00a7 85H. Similarly, the town maintains that the judge had no authority to \u201corder\u201d the selectmen to vote on Jones\u2019 application for \u00a7 85H benefits. And finally, assuming that the \u00a7 85H claim was properly before him, the judge is said to have erred in awarding compensation benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 85H. We consider each of these arguments in turn, rejecting the first and second, but accepting the third.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">1. <em>Amendment of Jones\u2019complaint. </em>Wayland contends that by allowing Jones\u2019 motion to amend his complaint in order to state a claim under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 85H, the trial judge abused his discretion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Although the issue of leave to amend on remand under Mass. R. Civ. P. 15(a), 365 Mass. 761 (1974), has never been decided by this court, we have held under prior law<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that \u201c[t]he Superior Court has the power in its discretion, even after rescript, to permit amendments in matters of form or substance . . . .\u201d <em>Fram </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>363 Mass. 68, 73 (1973). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>National Contracting Co., </em>201 Mass. 248, 250 (1909); <em>Crossman </em>v. <em>Griggs, </em>188 Mass. 156, 160 (1905) (amendment allowed within discretion of trial judge even where instruction on remand was, \u201cBill dismissed,\u201d because this instruction was not a final decree which precluded further action in this case); <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Brightman, </em>133 Mass. 536, 537 (1882). Rule 15 was not intended to make existing pleading rules more restrictive; under rule 15, \u201cthe expressed tendency is in favor of allowing amendments,\u201d <em>Castellucci </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>372 Mass. 288, 289 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The Federal courts, construing identical language in Rule 15 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, have specifically concluded that \u201c[t]he fact that [a motion to amend] was tendered after remand . . . for further proceedings does not change the rule\u201d that leave to amend shall be freely granted whenever appropriate. <em>Retail Clerks Int'l Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Lion Dry Goods, Inc., </em>341 F.2d 715, 722-723 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 839 (1965). See <em>Guse </em>v. <em>J.C. Penney Co., </em>570 F.2d 679, 680 (7th Cir. 1978); <em>Modrey </em>v. <em>American Gage &amp; Mach. Co., </em>478 F.2d 470, 473 n.4 (2d Cir. 1973). See also 6 C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1488 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">We conclude that a trial judge on remand still possesses, as a general matter, broad discretion to allow any appropriate amendment. The only remaining question is whether, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>on the particular facts of this case, the granting of Jones\u2019 motion to amend constituted an abuse of this discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The trial judge, in his memorandum of opinion allowing Jones\u2019 motion to amend, carefully noted the factors we have said are among those which might justify<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> denial of a motion to amend, \u201cundue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc.\u201d <em>Castelluci </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity </em>&amp; <em>Guar. Co., supra </em>at 290, quoting from <em>Foman </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962). The judge found no indication that Jones had been unduly lax in moving to amend or had acted either in bad faith or with a dilatory motive. These conclusions are amply supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The judge also found that Wayland was not unduly prejudiced by his allowance of Jones\u2019 amendment. Counsel for Wayland maintained to the trial court on remand that no additional evidence need be heard in order to decide Jones\u2019 \u00a7 85H claim. Moreover, given the nearly complete overlap between those facts relevant to \u00a7 85H and those relevant to \u00a7 111F, any possible hardship that Wayland might conceivably have suffered due to the necessity of introducing new evidence is so slight as to fail to constitute sufficient prejudice to require denial of Jones\u2019 motion to amend. See 6 C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1487 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Finally, Wayland contends that the motion to amend was improperly allowed because it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Wayland notes that, at the time the motion was first made, Jones had not specifically applied to the town for \u00a7 85H benefits. Therefore, Way-land urges, since Jones had not, in its view, exhausted his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>administrative remedies, the proposed amendment failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. This argument, however, simply ignores the fact that the amendment in this case was allowed only after Jones had been denied \u00a7 85H benefits by the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">2. <em>Order to selectmen. </em>Wayland also argues that the trial judge had no authority, prior to allowing Jones to amend his complaint, to order the Wayland selectmen to rule on Jones\u2019 application for G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 85H, benefits. Wayland notes that the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction was grounded on the statute authorizing declaratory judgment actions, G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 1, which requires that there be \u201can actual controversy . . . specifically set forth in the pleadings.\u201d See <em>Publico </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Quincy, </em>336 Mass. 152, 155 (1957); <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Independent Ins. Agents and Brokers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>373 Mass. 290, 292 (1977). Prior to Jones\u2019 amendment of his complaint, Wayland urges, no such controversy existed as to \u00a7 85H benefits, and therefore the trial judge in a declaratory judgment action had no authority to order the town to rule on Jones\u2019 application for these benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Whatever may be the merits of this argument, however, any conceivable error on the part of the trial judge in issuing his \u201corder\u201d can only be described as harmless. No written order was issued. The judge said, \u201cI\u2019m going to, in effect, give the town until the meeting of the 20th or the 27th [of March, 1978] to vote [the \u00a7 85H benefits] up or down.\u201d We think that the judge\u2019s actions amounted to no more than a sound exercise of discretion in delaying any further action so as to see whether Wayland might take such actions as would render any \u00a7 85H claim moot. The third and fourth sentences of \u00a7 85H relied on by the judge in granting summary judgment to Jones specify that a town \u201cshall\u201d provide compensation payments to certain special police officers injured in the line of duty. There is no requirement that an individual seeking benefits under this portion of \u00a7 85H must formally request them. In light of this mandatory language, if Jones was indeed one of those officers properly within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>scope of the statute, Wayland had no option but to make the payments called for by this portion of \u00a7 85H. The town cannot now be heard to complain that it was prejudiced by being \u201cordered\u201d to decide whether or not it would comply with the requirements of State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">3. <em>Compensation benefits. </em>The judge below declared Jones to be a \u201cstatutory beneficiary\u201d of the compensation benefits created by the third and fourth sentences of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 85H. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>The judge determined that Jones\u2019 \u201cregular occupation\u201d at the time of his injury consisted of his work as a special police officer. We conclude that the statute does not permit such an interpretation of the term \u201cregular occupation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">In reaching this conclusion we are guided by the principle that individual statutory provisions related to the same general area must be read \u201cas a whole ... to the end that, as far as possible, the [entire legislative program] will constitute a consistent and harmonious whole.\u201d <em>Haines </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Mansfield, </em>320 Mass. 140, 142 (1946). We have previously held that G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F, requires that all qualifying police officers, special as well as regular, incapacitated for police work as the result of an injury sustained in the line of duty through no fault of their own, must be granted leave without loss of pay for so long as they are unable to perform their police duties. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Wayland, </em>374 Mass. 249, 255-257 (1978). We therefore construe \u00a7 85H so that its disability and retirement benefits are consistent with the paid leave benefits of \u00a7 111F.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Under \u00a7 111F, qualifying police and firefighters continue to receive their normal police or firefighting pay. While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>this sum may amount to a full weekly pay check in the case of a regular officer, it may also be the far smaller sum earned by a special officer who worked only a few hours per week prior to his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">We believe that \u00a7 85H reflects legislative concern over the adequacy of benefits afforded by \u00a7 111F to certain public safety officers injured in the line of duty. The \u201creserve, special and intermittent police\u201d and \u201ccall fire fighters\u201d covered by \u00a7 85H represent those public safety officers most likely to be reliant on other jobs as their primary source of income. The compensation benefits of \u00a7 85H, we conclude, are designed to compensate these officers for the inability to perform such other work.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Read in this light, \u201cregular occupation\u201d means employment distinct from that as a police officer or firefighter.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The policy behind such a compensation plan is clear: those individuals willing to submit themselves to the dangers inherent in police and fire work while still looking to another job as a substantial source of support should not be made to suffer economically in the event that they are rendered incapable of performing this other employment due to an injury sustained while serving as a public safety officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Furthermore, by providing such compensation benefits the Legislature has also assured that towns which rely on the services of part-time public safety officers will be able to recruit such persons. Finally, by providing any such officer injured in the line of duty with possible eligibility under both \u00a7 111F and \u00a7 85H, the Legislature has discouraged the indiscriminate use of such special officers in lieu of regular police and firefighters.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Our construction gives full effect to both \u00a7 85H and 111F and their differing legislative goals. We read these provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>sions as complementary. While \u00a7 111F requires a showing that the officer is \u201cincapacitated for [police or firefighting] duty,\u201d eligibility for \u00a7 85H compensation benefits turns instead on the injured officer\u2019s ability to perform the \u201cusual duties of his regular occupation.\u201d Since we conclude that \u201cregular occupation\u201d cannot be police or fire duty, we avoid the incongruous result, encountered by the trial judge, of the statutes overlapping in such a way that a special officer who had lost only one job might claim benefits under both \u00a7 85H and \u00a7 111F.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Construing \u00a7 85H in this manner, we necessarily reject the conclusion of the trial judge that David Jones\u2019 \u201cregular occupation\u201d as defined by \u00a7 85H consisted of his work as a police officer.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Jones therefore cannot be entitled to \u00a7 85H compensation benefits.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">4. <em>Retirement benefits. </em>Since Jones claims generally that he is entitled to benefits under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 85H, we also consider his eligibility for the retirement benefits created by the first two sentences of the statute. We note, furthermore, that in the prior appeal to this court, Wayland\u2019s present counsel stated, \u201cWayland is even prepared to concede that Jones may be eligible for disability retirement under G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>c. 32, \u00a7 85H.\u201d Brief for Town of Wayland at 66. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Wayland, </em>374 Mass. 249 (1978). See also brief at 50 and 63.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">In contrast to the mandatory language creating both the temporary compensation benefits of \u00a7 85H and the paid leave of \u00a7 11 IF, \u00a7 85H provides that a town \u201cmay\u201d retire any police officer or firefighter meeting the statutory qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">In addition to the discretion suggested by this statutory language, deference to local decisions awarding or denying \u00a7 85H retirement benefits is called for by the role which these benefits play in relation to the compensation benefits created by the third and fourth sentences of \u00a7 85H and the paid leave mandated by \u00a7 111F.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Unlike either the \u00a7 85H compensation benefits or the paid leave benefits of \u00a7 11 IF, \u00a7 85H retirement benefits continue for so long as the injured party lives, and are conditioned upon a finding that the recipient is \u201cpermanently disabled.\u201d This finding, furthermore, must be confirmed by the majority of a special three-member medical panel, who must state that \u201csuch incapacity is likely to be permanent.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 85F.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Despite the fact that they are life-long, retirement benefits will normally be awarded by a town as a means of reducing its liability. Retirement pursuant to \u00a7 85H terminates any obligation a town may have under \u00a7 111F to continue to pay the injured person\u2019s usual police and firefighting wages, as well as any additional obligation under the third and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>fourth sentences of \u00a7 85H to pay compensation for the person\u2019s inability to perform his or her \u201cregular\u201d occupation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Furthermore, if a town has been paying compensation benefits under \u00a7 85H, by awarding retirement benefits it can generally reduce its payments during any given pay period by at least<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> one-third, since retirement benefits are fixed at two-thirds of the amount payable as compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">In short, \u00a7 85H, read as a whole, creates significant fiscal incentives encouraging town officials to retire permanently any of those police officers or firefighters within the scope of the statute who are, in the local officials\u2019 opinion, permanently disabled, while at the same time encouraging the denial of such status to those individuals who are likely to return to police or fire work (thus terminating \u00a7 111F liability) or to resume the normal duties of their regular occupation (thus ending \u00a7 85H temporary compensation benefits).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">We conclude that the Legislature intended that towns such as Wayland should possess broad discretion to grant or deny \u00a7 85H retirement benefits.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The town has considered and rejected Jones\u2019 claim for such benefits, and has set forth its reasons for doing so.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Decisions such as this are reviewable here only on the basis that the town has abused its discretion; Jones does not argue that the town has done so, and the record would not support such an argument were it to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>For all the foregoing reasons, we con-elude, as a matter of law, that Jones was not entitled to benefits under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 85H. The judgment in the Superior Court pursuant to Jones\u2019 motion for summary judgment is therefore reversed. Wayland\u2019s motion for summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>merit on Jones\u2019 claim pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 85H, is allowed. Since the parties have agreed that the amount owed by Wayland to Jones under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F, consists of $244.53, the case is remanded to the Superior Court for the entry of final judgment in favor of Jones in that amount.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b125-8\"> Our prior opinion held that G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F, requires that a leave without loss of pay must be granted to any police officer, special as well as regular, \u201cincapacitated for duty because of injury sustained in the performance of his duty without fault of his own.\u201d See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Wayland, </em>374 Mass. 249, 255-257 (1978). Therefore, under \u00a7 111F, Jones was entitled to be paid an amount equal to the amount he would normally have made as a police officer had he not been incapacitated. In Jones\u2019 case this amounted to a substantial sum, since he had been devoting more than forty hours per week to his duties as a special police officer. We also held, however, that Jones\u2019 voluntary resignation, when accepted by the town approximately four months after his injury, terminated his eligibility for further benefits under \u00a7 111F. <em>Id. </em>at 263-264.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b125-9\"> General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 85H, as amended through St. 1970, c. 382, \u00a7 \u00a7 1-2, provides: \u201cThe selectmen of every town may retire from active service any call fire fighter or reserve, special or intermittent police officer who becomes permanently disabled mentally or physically by injuries sustained through no fault of his own in the actual performance of duty as such fire fighter or policeman. A person so retired shall receive an annual pension equal to two thirds of the annual rate of compensation payable to a regular or permanent member of the police or fire force, as the case may be, thereof for the first year of service therein, and if there are no permanent members of such force an annual pension in the sum of three thousand dollars. Whenever a call fire fighter or any member of a volunteer fire company in a town whose service as such has been approved by the board of selectmen of such town or reserve or special or intermittent police officer of a town, or a reserve police officer or reserve or call fire fighter of a city is disabled because of injury or incapacity sustained in the performance of his duty without fault of his own, and is thereby unable to perform the usual duties of his regular occupation at the time such injury or incapacity was incurred, he shall receive from the city or town for the period of such injury or incapacity the amount of compensation payable to a permanent member of the police or fire force thereof, as the case may be, for the first year of service therein, or if there are no regular or permanent members of the police or fire force thereof, at the rate of three thou<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>sand dollars per annum; provided, that no such compensation shall be payable for any period after such police officer or fire fighter has been retired or pensioned in accordance with law or for any period after a physician designated by the board or officer authorized to appoint police officers or fire fighters in such city or town determines that such incapacity no longer exists. All amounts payable under this section shall be paid at the same time and in the same manner as, and for all purposes shall be deemed to be, the regular compensation of such police officer or fire fighter. No town shall pay compensation under this section if insurance providing coverage for such compensation is in effect therefor under clause (1) of section five of chapter forty, unless and until all rights under such insurance in favor of such town shall have been exercised, determined and satisfied.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b126-9\"> With regard to compensation benefits, the selectmen stated that Jones\u2019 voluntary resignation terminated his eligibility. With regard to retirement benefits, the selectmen also contended that Jones\u2019 resignation elimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>nated his right to obtain such benefits. Furthermore, they stated that if they had discretion to award retirement benefits to Jones, they would decline to do so on the basis that (1) no money had been appropriated for this purpose; (2) Jones had waited seven years after his voluntary resignation before applying for such benefits; (3) Jones had not sought medical treatment for his disability on an ongoing basis since the time of his injury; (4) Jones had provided the town with no new information regarding his disability since the time the town accepted his resignation; and (5) \u201cthe Selectmen believe that the Town has paid its debt to Mr. Jones in full\u201d in view of the fact that all medical expenses related to Jones\u2019 injury were paid by the town, six thousand dollars was paid to Jones under the group health and accident insurance policy funded by the town, and an additional amount would be paid to Jones when judgment was entered under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b127-10\"> See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Wayland, </em>374 Mass. 249 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b127-11\"> See note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b128-6\"> The case was decided below on cross motions for summary judgment. Neither party accepted the judge\u2019s invitation to submit additional evidence to supplement the findings of fact set forth in our prior opinion in this case. Since there is no dispute as to any material fact, we, like the trial judge, must decide whether either party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). <em>See Community Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 556 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b128-7\"> Jones argues that Wayland\u2019s failure to answer his amended complaint precludes the town from asserting on this appeal all defenses other than that the court below lacked subject matter jurisdiction. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) and 12 (h), 365 Mass. 755, 757 (1974). While Wayland\u2019s counsel lends credence to this theory by attempting to cloak what amount to arguments on the merits in \u201cjurisdictional\u201d terms, his concern to do so is misplaced. The decision at issue here was not reached on the basis of the pleadings, or at a trial based on these pleadings, but rather on cross motions for summary judgment. Failure to file an answer does not preclude success on a timely motion for summary judgment. While the practice may not commend itself as a model litigation technique, Wayland was free to decline to file an answer, and to instead rely entirely on its motion for summary judgment. The parties here and the judge below have all addressed the issues Wayland raises on their merits, and we shall do so also.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b128-8\"> Wayland also claims that our prior opinion itself precluded any amendment of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint on remand. This argument is without merit. The case was remanded not for the entry of judgment pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F, as Wayland claims, but for \u201cfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b129-7\"> General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 51 (as in effect prior to July 1, 1974), provided in part that an \u201camendment in matter of form or substance in any . . . pleading, which may enable the plaintiff to sustain the action for the cause for which it was intended to be brought\u201d might be allowed \u201cat any time before final judgment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b130-8\"> Since to do so is unnecessary to a decision in this case, we intimate no view as to whether the existence of any or all of these factors might require as well as justify a denial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b132-8\"> The original versions of \u00a7 85H and G.

Furthermore, the present third and fourth sentences of \u00a7 85H, the meaning of which constitutes the central issue on this appeal, result from a 1954 amendment to \u00a7 85H that redrafted the compensation provisions of the statute by incorporating language identical to that appearing in \u00a7 111F. St. 1954, c. 633. \u201c[I]f possible a statute is to be interpreted in harmony with prior enactments to give rise to a consistent body of law.\u201d <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Amherst, </em>372 Mass. 46, 51 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b133-9\"> Rather than calculating the precise amount of income lost due to an officer\u2019s inability to perform such other work on a case by case basis, the Legislature has chosen the rough but equitable solution of determining \u00a7 85H compensation benefit payments by reference to a fixed amount: the first year salary of a permanent police officer or fire fighter. See note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b134-7\"> Our construction also avoids an additional incongruity. Under the judge\u2019s reading of the statute, a qualifying special police officer who had worked only part-time and who had no other regular occupation would be entitled to receive \u00a7 85H compensation benefits equal to the full-time salary of a regular officer. We do not believe the Legislature intended such a result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b134-8\"> While we conclude that \u201cregular occupation\u201d refers to work other than that compensable under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F, we have no occasion on the facts of this case to determine the precise extent to which such work must constitute the injured person\u2019s means of support. It is enough to note here that the high level of compensation fixed by the statute (the full-time salary of a permanent member of the town\u2019s police or fire department) indicates that the \u201cregular\u201d employment whose loss \u00a7 85H is intended to offset must have constituted at least a substantial source of income. No indication appears on the record before us that Jones, at the time of his injury, held any such substantial nonpolice employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b134-9\"> Since we hold that Jones is not entitled to benefits under \u00a7 85H, we intimate no view on Wayland\u2019s argument that Jones\u2019 voluntary resignation terminated his eligibility for \u00a7 85H compensation benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b135-9\"> Thus it is unclear why Wayland\u2019s counsel, when specifically asked by the trial judge on remand if he knew any reason why reference was made in our prior opinion to \u00a7 85H, replied, \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know,\u201d and that \u201cthere was never a concession on our part that there was a right [under \u00a7 85H] or anything like that.\u201d Cf.
