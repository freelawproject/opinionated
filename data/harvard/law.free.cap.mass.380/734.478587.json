(Maritime), must indemnify it against liability in a tort action brought against Edison by an employee of Maritime. The employee was injured while dusting off an electrical switching box owned by Edison and located on Maritime\u2019s premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Edison acknowledges that Maritime is released from all tort claims of the employee (G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 23), and that it may not look to Maritime for indemnity on any statutory or common law tort theory. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Westerlind, </em>374 Mass. 524, 526-527 (1978). Edison asserts an express or implied contractual obligation of Maritime to indemnify it.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">A judge in the Superior Court allowed Maritime\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We transferred Edison\u2019s appeal here on our own motion. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">We have never decided whether we would follow the majority rule<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and permit a third-party tortfeasor to obtain indemnity from an employer who had expressly or impliedly contracted to indemnify the third party against liability for injury to the employer\u2019s employee. In those cases in which the issue was raised, we did not reach the question because the evidence did not warrant a finding that there was such an agreement. See <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Westerlind, supra </em>at 526-527; <em>H.P. Hood &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>370 Mass. 69, 77 (1976); <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Roy Bros., </em>358 Mass. 446, 458 (1970). The same is true in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">The utility relies on certain terms and conditions, filed with the Department of Public Utilities, which, in various applications for service, Maritime acknowledged would govern the supply of service to it by Edison. There is no indication in the affidavits filed in support of and in opposition to the motion for summary judgment that the subject of an obligation on the part of Maritime to hold the utility harmless was ever adverted to in dealings between the parties. Because the document was prepared and filed by Edison and made applicable to all its contracts for service, any uncertainty in the meaning of the document\u2019s terms and conditions is to be construed against Edison. See <em>Merrimack Valley Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>372 Mass. 721, 724 (1977); <em>Massachusetts Turnpike Auth. </em>v. <em>Perini Corp., </em>349 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Mass. 448, 454 (1965); <em>Bowser </em>v. <em>Chalifour, </em>334 Mass. 348, 352 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">We have reviewed the provisions of the terms and conditions on which Edison relies and find none under which Maritime agreed to indemnify Edison for its tort liability to a Maritime employee injured as a result of Edison\u2019s negligence. An agreement by Maritime to safeguard Edison\u2019s property, to take precautions against unlawful interference with that property, and to pay for any damage caused by Maritime to that property has nothing to do with indemnification for personal injuries caused by Edison. A disclaimer by Edison of any liability \u201cfor damages caused by defects in piping, wiring, appliances, apparatus, appurtenances and premises\u201d installed or supplied by Maritime does not make Maritime an indemnitor. Similarly, Edison\u2019s disclaimer of liability \u201cfor damages resulting in any way from the supplying or use of . . . electricity or from the presence or operation of [Edison\u2019s] service\u201d and equipment on Maritime\u2019s premises may well properly limit Edison\u2019s liability to Maritime, but it says nothing about Maritime\u2019s liability to Edison. Likewise, no obligation of indemnity arises from Edison\u2019s disclaimer of liability and Maritime\u2019s assumption of \u201call risk of loss or damage to person or property resulting from or arising out of [any] . . . interruption, fault or failure\u201d of the supply of electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">We decline to read disclaimers of liability to Maritime as creating an obligation on Maritime to indemnify Edison. Acceptance of Edison\u2019s construction would \u201cproduce a result unreasonable in the business context in which the parties acted.\u201d <em>Ucello </em>v. <em>Cosentino, </em>354 Mass. 48, 52 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">We find nothing in the relationship of the parties to warrant an implication of an obligation on Maritime to indemnify Edison against Edison\u2019s loss. See <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Westerlind, supra </em>at 528; 2A A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7\u00a7 76.42, 76.44 (1976 &amp; Supp. 1979). Such a radical departure from the reasonable expectation of the parties, considering their relationship, is unwarranted in the absence of a clear expression in the contract. See <em>Clev</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number><em>enger </em>v. <em>Haling, </em>379 Mass. 154, 157-159 (1979). Cf. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Central Vt. Pub. Serv. Corp., </em>391 F. Supp. 420, 427 (D. Vt. 1975), where the indemnification was expressly acknowledged in relation to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">There was no material fact in dispute to bar the allowance of Maritime\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The judge did not abuse his discretion in declining to rehear the motion. The evidence on which Edison relied in seeking a rehearing, even if admissible, added nothing to what was already expressed in the terms and conditions on which Edison based its claim of indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-8\"> 2A A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7\u00a7 76.00, 76.41 (1976 &amp; Supp. 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b751-6\"> In other cases, where employers have been held liable on undertakings to indemnify third parties, despite the exclusive remedy provisions of applicable workmen\u2019s compensation laws, the language of indemnity has been similarly explicit, even if its effect in relation to workmen\u2019s compensation laws was not expressly mentioned. See, e.g., <em>Olsen </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co., </em>595 F.2d 1099, 1105 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 979 (1979); <em>DeShaw </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>155 Mont. 355, 360-361 (1970); <em>Gordon H. Ball, Inc. </em>v. <em>Oregon Erecting Co., </em>273 Or. 179, 183-186 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
