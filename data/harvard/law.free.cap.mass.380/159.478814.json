(MacDuffie), for a certificate of hardship under the Historic Districts Act, G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>c. 40C, \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 10 <em>(c), </em>with a view to demolition of a historic building known as Bowles House. The plaintiffs sought review of that decision in the Superior Court. Their complaint was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, and they appealed. We transferred the case from the Appeals Court to this court on our own motion, and we now affirm the judgment of dismissal. We hold that neither G. L. c. 40C, \u00a7\u00a7 12A, 13, nor G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1, conferred jurisdiction on the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">We summarize the allegations of the complaint, as amended. The plaintiffs are a nonprofit corporation and six residents of the city of Springfield; one is a resident of the Maple Hill Historic District, in which the building in question is located. In August, 1978, MacDuffie, the owner of the building, filed the application for a certificate of hardship for the purpose of obtaining a demolition permit. In September, 1978, the commission voted six to zero, with one absence, to deny the application, adopting a staff report as its reasons. MacDuffie appealed to the Superior Court as an \u201capplicant aggrieved\u201d by the determination under G. L. c. 40C, \u00a7 12A. In June, 1979, on MacDuffie\u2019s motion assented to by the commission, the matter was remanded to the commission for reconsideration. On July 5, 1979, by a vote of four to two, the commission granted the application. The vote, it is alleged, was arbitrary and capricious and otherwise contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">We agree with the judge that G. L. c. 40C does not confer jurisdiction of the case on the Superior Court. By its plain language, \u00a7 12A provides a remedy only for an \u201capplicant,\u201d and the only applicant here was MacDuffie. Cf. <em>Tranfaglia </em>v. <em>Building Comm\u2019r of Winchester, </em>306 Mass. 495, 497 (1940). Under \u00a7 13 the Superior Court has \u201cjurisdiction to enforce\u201d c. 40C and any ordinance or by-law enacted under c. 40C and the determinations, rulings and regulations issued pursuant thereto \u201cand may, <em>upon the petition of the mayor or of the board of selectmen or of the commission, </em>restrain by injunction violations thereof; . . .\u201d The words in italics were inserted by St. 1971, c. 359, \u00a7 1; like the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>judge, we read them as limiting the eligible plaintiffs to those listed.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The plaintiffs also contend that the case is within G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1, conferring \u201cjurisdiction of all cases and matters of equity cognizable under the general principles of equity jurisprudence.\u201d Our decisions are to the contrary. <em>Boyle </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Malden, </em>327 Mass. 564, 566-567 (1951). See <em>Administrator of OPA </em>v. <em>Chook, </em>320 Mass. 187, 191-192 (1946); <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Wilbraham, </em>140 Mass. 459, 460 (1886).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The plaintiffs contend further that jurisdiction is conferred by art. 97 of the Amendments to the Constitution of Massachusetts, and that denial of jurisdiction deprives them of property without due process of law. There is no reference to these contentions in the complaint, the record does not disclose that they were presented to the judge, and there is no indication that he ruled on them. We do not consider them. See <em>Christoffels </em>v. <em>Alton Properties, Inc., </em>362 Mass. 862 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
