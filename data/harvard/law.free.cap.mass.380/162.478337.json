LaFreniere (landlord). The complaint stated two counts of negligence, one against the tenant and the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>against the landlord, in which Young sought damages for personal injuries sustained in a fall from the second-story front porch of the tenant\u2019s apartment. Young alleged that she was lawfully on the premises and that the railing had been negligently maintained. The case was tried to a jury which found for the plaintiff on both counts and returned answers to special questions on September 21, 1978. Mass. R. Civ. P. 49 (a), 365 Mass. 812 (1974). The landlord then filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Mass. R. Civ. P. 50 (b), 365 Mass. 814 (1974). On September 28, the trial judge filed a memorandum and order. He entered judgment for Young against the tenant for $20,000; no appeal has been taken by the tenant. On October 3, he allowed the landlord\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The plaintiff filed notice of appeal. On January 26, 1979, the judge reported the case against the landlord to the Appeals Court. Mass. R. Civ. P. 64, 365 Mass. 831 (1974). We brought the case here on our own motion. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The facts as stated in the judge\u2019s report show the following. The accident occurred on the landlord\u2019s property at 7 Park Street in Westfield. Garwacki rented the house\u2019s second-floor apartment as a tenant at will. One Larry Mastello shared the apartment with him. Mastello invited Young, a friend of both men, to a dinner party on April 21, 1977. She arrived before the other guests and began preparing the dinner. On his way to pick up a friend, Mastello went down to his car which was parked in a driveway near the front of the house. Young went to the front porch to ask him to pick up some groceries on his way back. When she placed her hands on the railing and leaned forward to call down to Mastello, the railing gave way. She fell to the ground and was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">In December, 1976, the landlord\u2019s insurance company had informed him that the railing was dangerous and had cancelled his liability insurance. At that time, the landlord warned the tenant of the danger and bought materials to repair the railing, but he made no repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>According to the judge\u2019s report, the landlord had made no express agreement to keep the premises in repair, although he testified he considered it his obligation to repair the porch railing. Furthermore, the porch, which was accessible only from the tenant\u2019s living room, was part of the demised premises, not under the landlord\u2019s control. In answer to the judge\u2019s special questions, the jury found that the landlord did not exercise reasonable care in his maintenance of the premises, that his negligence was the proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, and that she was not at all negligent herself.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-14\">Thus, this case presents a question we have reserved before. <em>DiMarzo </em>v. <em>S. &amp; P. Realty Corp., </em>364 Mass. 510, 514 (1974). See <em>Markarian </em>v. <em>Simonian, </em>373 Mass. 669 (1977) . In the absence of the landlord\u2019s express agreement to keep the rented premises in repair, is he liable to his tenant\u2019s guest for injuries resulting from his negligent failure to maintain the safety of the premises?</p>\n<p id=\"b178-21\">Common law rules defining a landowner\u2019s liability in negligence to people coming onto the land reflected the needs of an agrarian society. The landowner was a petty sovereign within his boundaries. The character of his duty to an injured party varied with the party\u2019s relationship with the sovereign. <em>Mounsey </em>v. <em>Ellard, </em>363 Mass. 693, 695 . (1973). Thus, the common law distinguished several classes of tort plaintiffs; among them, trespassers, licensees, invitees, and tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>The traditional approach to tenants turned on the concept of a lease as a conveyance of property. The tenant \u201cbought\u201d the leasehold at his peril, so he could not expect the landlord to have repaired preexisting defects, and at the time of the letting, the landlord ceded to the tenant his dominion over the rented premises. Under this ancient view, the axiom was \u201cthere is no law against letting a tumbledown house.\u201d <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>15 C.B. (N.S.) 221, 240, 143 Eng. Rep. 768, 776 (1863). The landlord might have been liable for negligent maintenance of common areas, but was not generally liable for the negligent maintenance of the premises themselves. See generally Restatement (Second) of Property, Landlord and Tenant c. 17, Introductory Note &amp; \u00a7 17.3 (1977); 2 R. Powell, Real Property par. 233 (at 330.69-330.70), par. 234[2][b] (P. Rohan 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The landlord \u201cwas under a separate and limited duty toward each tenant and that tenant\u2019s visitors to exercise reasonable care to maintain the common areas in a condition not less safe than they were, or appeared to be in, at the time of the letting to the particular tenant.\u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>G &amp; M Realty Corp., </em>373 Mass. 658, 660 (1977). <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>Massios, </em>372 Mass. 79, 81-82 (1977). As to the demised premises, caveat emptor reigned. The tenant took the premises as he found them. See <em>Gade </em>v. <em>National Creamery Co., </em>324 Mass. 515, 518 (1949). \u201cThe general rule is that the landlord is not liable to the tenant for defects in the premises existing at the time of the letting unless they are hidden defects of which he is aware and does not warn the tenant.\u201d <em>Ackarey v. Carbonaro, </em>320 Mass. 537, 539 (1946). The defect had to be one that was not discoverable by the tenant. <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>342 Mass. 38, 40 (1961) .<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We set out the remaining rules in <em>DiMarzo </em>v. <em>S. &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number><em>P. Realty Corp., supra </em>at 513. As we stated in <em>DiMarzo, </em>during the term of the rental, \u201cthere could be no tort liability for nonfeasance in the absence of an agreement, for consideration, that the landlord would keep the premises in a condition of safety, and make all repairs without notice. <em>Fiorntino </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>233 Mass. 451 (1919). <em>Jacovides </em>v. <em>Chaletzky, </em>332 Mass. 225 (1955). <em>Bushfan </em>v. <em>Gluck, </em>339 Mass. 772 (1959). <em>Schopen </em>v. <em>Rando, </em>343 Mass. 529 (1962). <em>Long </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>344 Mass. 758 (1962). Gratuitous repair creates tort liability only if it is done in a grossly negligent fashion. <em>Bergeron </em>v. <em>Forest, </em>233 Mass. 392 (1919). <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Wood Realty Inc. </em>334 Mass. 370 (1956). <em>Popowych </em>v. <em>Poorvu, </em>361 Mass. 848 (1972). The ordinary agreement for consideration by which a landlord is to make repairs is construed as an agreement to repair on notice. <em>Conahan </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>233 Mass. 234 (1919). <em>Fiorntino </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>233 Mass. 451 (1919). Failure to repair under such an agreement gives rise only to a contract action for the cost of the repair. Tort liability will exist, however, for negligently made repairs. In the absence of such a specific agreement to repair, no agreement will be implied from the mere letting of the premises, and any repairs made will be treated as gratuitous. <em>Bergeron </em>v. <em>Forest, </em>233 Mass. 392 (1919).\u201d <em>DiMarzo </em>v. <em>S. &amp; P. Realty Corp., </em>364 Mass. at 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">After seven years of reconsideration and reform, little remains of this obsolete machinery of the common law. Much of the reform has been accomplished judicially.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cRecent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>decisions of this court clearly reflect ... a shift in philosophy with regard to status distinctions in tort standards of care . . . .\u201d <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>374 Mass. 206, 221 (1978) .* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Mounsey </em>v. <em>Ellard, </em>363 Mass. 693 (1973), we did away with the legal significance in tort of categories of licensee and invitee and held that a landowner owes a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors. We said: \u201cThe problem of allocating the costs and risks of human injury is far too complex to be decided solely by the status of the entrant, especially where the status question often prevents the jury from ever determining the fundamental question whether the defendant has acted reasonably in light of all the circumstances in the particular case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707. Since <em>Mounsey, </em>we have eliminated other limits based on status. E.g., <em>Soule </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co., </em>378 Mass. 177 (1979) (foreseeable child trespasser); <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, supra </em>(employee of independent contractor); <em>Pridgen </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>364 Mass. 696 (1974) (helplessly trapped trespasser).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">In the landlord-tenant field, we have held that a landlord is liable to a tenant\u2019s guest for failing to exercise due care in maintaining common passageways under the landlord\u2019s control without regard to their condition at the time of the letting. <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>Massios, supra. </em>We said that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>status of the person visited, landowner or lessee, should not affect the visitor\u2019s right to personal safety or the landowner\u2019s obligation reasonably to maintain premises in his control.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82. In <em>King </em>v. <em>G &amp; M Realty Corp., supra, </em>we extended the landlord\u2019s general and continuing duty to exercise reasonable care as to the safety of common passageways to include tenants as well as their visitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">We have also attacked the theory on which the tenant\u2019s status classification depends. In the line of cases creating and applying the implied warranty of habitability, we have overthrown the doctrine of caveat emptor and the notion that a lease is a conveyance of property. <em>Berman &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>379 Mass. 196 (1979). <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>McCaffrey, </em>377 Mass. 443 (1979). <em>Boston Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Hemingway, </em>363 Mass. 184 (1973). Moreover, we have invoked the doctrine of warranty to afford a tenant compensation not only for economic loss, as in <em>Berman </em>and <em>Hemingway, </em>but for personal injury. <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>McCaffrey, supra </em>at 450-453. Thus, at least to the extent required by the relevant housing and building codes, a landlord may be liable to his tenant for failing to maintain areas not under the landlord\u2019s control.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Today, we do away with the ancient law that bars a tenant\u2019s guest from recovering compensation from a landlord for injuries caused by negligent maintenance of areas rented to the tenant. Like the other rules based on status, this rule has prevented a whole class of people from raising the overriding issue: whether the landlord acted reasonably under the circumstances. The practical result of this archaic rule has been to discourage repairs of rented premises. In cases like the one before us, a landlord with knowledge of a defect has less incentive to repair it. And the tenant, who often has a short-term lease, limited funds, and limited experience dealing with such defects, will not be inclined to pay for expensive work on a place he will soon be leaving.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Thus, the defect may go unrepaired until an unsuspecting plaintiff finds herself with a lawsuit that care could have prevented.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Seven years ago, in <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>113 N.H. 388, 397-398 (1973), Chief Justice Kenison wrote: \u201cHenceforth, landlords as other persons must exercise reasonable care not to subject others to an unreasonable risk of harm. A landlord must act as a reasonable person under all of the circumstances including the likelihood of injury to others, the probable seriousness of such injuries, and the burden of reducing or avoiding the risk. We think this basic principle of responsibility for landlords as for others \u2018best expresses the principles of justice and reasonableness upon which our law of torts is founded\u2019\u201d (citations omitted). Henceforth, this basic principle of responsibility applies to Massachusetts landlords as well. Accord, <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Cockrell Invs., Inc., </em>35 Cal. App. 3d 796 (1973); <em>Willcox v. Hines, </em>100 Tenn. 538 (1898); <em>Pagelsdorf v. Safeco Ins. Co. of America, </em>91 Wis. 2d 734 (1979). See <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>435 F.2d 104 (D.C. Cir. 1970); <em>Presson </em>v. <em>Mountain States Properties, Inc., </em>18 Ariz. App. 176 (1972). See generally Love, Landlord\u2019s Liability for Defective Premises: Caveat Lessee, Negligence, or Strict Liability? 1975 Wis. L. Rev. 19. See also Restatement (Second) of Property, Landlord and Tenant c. 17, Introductory Note at 155-156 (1977) (adopting common law rule set out in Restatement [Second] of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 355, 365 [1965], but acknowledging trend away from common law rule).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>The former rule was not without its reasons. When a landlord rents an apartment to a tenant, he gives up his right to enter. Ordinarily, absent a contractual agreement or the tenant\u2019s permission, the landlord can neither inspect for defects nor make repairs on the rented premises. See G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B (1) <em>(a). </em>This obstacle, however, does not justify the landlord\u2019s wholesale absolution from liability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Matters of control, like matters of status, can be components of familiar negligence analysis; they can affect such questions as reasonableness and foreseeability. So, too, may matters of intervening negligence by the tenant or others be treated. Cf. G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 19. In particular, a landlord should not be liable in negligence unless he knew or reasonably should have known of the defect<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and had a reasonable opportunity to repair it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-18\">Our statutes do not support limiting a landlord\u2019s negligence liability to areas under his control. General Laws c. 186, \u00a7 19,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> requires most landlords to exercise reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>care to correct an unsafe condition of which the tenant or a code enforcement agency has given him notice. If a landlord fails to correct the condition within a reasonable time, the tenant or any person rightfully on the premises has a tort action against the landlord for injuries sustained. General Laws c. 186, \u00a7 15,* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> renders invalid any lease clause which has the effect of idemnifying the landlord or exculpating him from \u201cany . . . negligence ... on or about the leased . . . premises.\u201d In St. 1974, c. 575, \u00a7 1, the Legislature deleted the phrase \u201cand not within the exclusive control of the lessee or tenant.\u201d Thus, the landlord is liable in negligence for defects of which he has notice, even though the defect occurs on the rented premises. Furthermore, the landlord cannot exculpate himself from liability for negligent maintenance of the rented premises. Both of these statutes are consistent with the result we reach today.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>We reverse the judgment and remand the case to the Superior Court with orders that the jury\u2019s verdict be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-30\"> The judge instructed the jury to assume that there was an implied duty imposed on the landlord to exercise reasonable care to maintain the rental premises in a reasonably safe condition. By doing this, he utilized the device of special questions so that the jury could determine whether the landlord had violated such duty. He states in his report that he did so \u201cin the hope of obviating the necessity of a new trial if an appellate court did decide in this case that landlords are under such a duty.\u201d We commend the judge for this approach as being consistent with the intent of Mass. R. Civ. P. 50 (b), 365 Mass. 814 (1974), and the conservation of limited judicial resources. See, e.g., <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Ariens Co., </em>375 Mass. 620, 627 628 (1978) ; <em>Soares </em>v. <em>Lakeville Baseball Camp, Inc., </em>369 Mass. 974, 975 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b179-6\"> In addition to the hidden defects exception, many jurisdictions require landlords who lease property for a purpose involving admission of the public to exercise reasonable care to discover and remedy defects existing at the time of the letting, if the landlord can reasonably expect that the tenant will admit the public before the property is made safe.

We have repeatedly demonstrated our readiness to reconsider common law immunity doctrines. See, e.g., <em>Colby </em>v. <em>Carney Hosp., </em>356 Mass. 527 (1969) (charitable immunity); <em>Sorensen </em>v. <em>Sorensen, </em>369 Mass. 350 (1975) (parental immunity); <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>370 Mass. 619 (1976) (interspousal immunity); <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>373 Mass. 208 (1977) (sovereign immunity).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b182-7\"> Of course, nothing we say here as to the landlord\u2019s duty of care is to be construed as relieving a tenant of his legal responsibility to exercise reasonable care as to the demised premises.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b183-6\"> In reaction against the traditional rule, courts have \u201cexpended considerable energy and exercised great ingenuity in attempting to fit various factual settings into the recognized exceptions.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Property, Landlord and Tenant c. 17, Reporter\u2019s Note to Introductory Note 2, at 157 (1977). Ry eliminating the rule entirely, we obviate the need for its exceptions. Thus, the hidden defect doctrine, which we criticized in a related context in <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>374 Mass. 206 (1978), has lost its raison d\u2019etre. The question now must be whether the landlord, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have discovered the defect and repaired it within a reasonable time. See Greaney, Developing Duties of a Landlord with Regard to Tenant Safety, 63 Mass. L. Rev. 61, 66 (1978). The comparative negligence statute, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85, sets the plaintiff\u2019s responsibilities if, in the exercise of reasonable care, he should have discovered the defect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b184-21\"> In fact, under our cases, the landlord was not liable even after the right to obtain control of the premises reverted to him.

In <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>McCaffrey, </em>377 Mass. 443, 452 (1979), we left open the question whether the landlord\u2019s liability begins only after he has had notice of the defect and a reasonable time to repair it. Cf. <em>Berman &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>379 Mass. 196 (1979), (right to rent abatement commences at time of notice, not after reasonable time to repair).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b184-34\"> The statute, inserted by St. 1972, c. 665, provides: <em>\u201cA </em>landlord or lessor of any real estate except an owner-occupied two- or three-family dwelling shall, within a reasonable time following receipt of a written notice from a tenant forwarded by registered or certified mail of an unsafe condition, not caused by the tenant, his invitee, or any one occupying through or'under the tenant, exercise reasonable care to correct the unsafe condition described in said notice except that such notice need not be given for unsafe conditions in that portion of the premises not under control of the tenant.

Auth. </em>v. <em>Hemingway, </em>363 Mass. 184, 199 (1973) (warranty of habitability limited to \u201crental of any premises for dwelling purposes\u201d). Section 19 excludes from its coverage unsafe conditions in owner-occupied two- or three-family dwellings. We need not consider whether negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>gence liability should be similarly limited. Cf. <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>McCaffrey, supra </em>at 452 (refusing to make exception in warranty context). Finally, \u00a7 19 applies to both tenants and other persons rightfully on the premises. In its narrowest application, our rule today governs only plaintiffs who are the tenant\u2019s guests. Compare <em>King </em>v. <em>G &amp; M Realty Corp., 373 </em>Mass. 658 (1977), and <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>Massios, </em>372 Mass. 79 (1977) (persons lawfully on premises may sue for landlord\u2019s negligent maintenance of areas he controls), with <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>McCaffrey, supra </em>(tenant may recover in warranty).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
