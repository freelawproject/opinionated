Sellon appeals. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G. Sellon also appeals from the denial of a motion for new trial based on a claim that at trial he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. The appeals were consolidated, and we transferred the case here on our own motion. We affirm the judgment and the denial of the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">Sellon\u2019s principal argument<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at trial. Sellon points to (1) trial counsel\u2019s decision not to offer certain statements made by the victim to hospital nurses, and counsel\u2019s failure to interview these nurses; (2) counsel\u2019s supposed failure to adequately \u201cprepare\u201d certain defense witnesses; (3) the activities of a disbarred attorney at the counsel table during part of the trial; and (4) counsel\u2019s failure to request additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>jury instructions or to object to the instructions actually given.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Regarding his conviction, Sellon argues assignments of error asserting (1) that his conviction was based on inadmissible hearsay; (2) that certain real evidence was admitted without an adequate foundation; (3) that questions put to a witness by both the prosecutor and the trial judge improperly assumed an ultimate question of fact; and (4) that jury instructions regarding the crime of manslaughter were inaccurate and confusing and that further instructions, on the drawing of inferences, given to the jury after their deliberations had begun, were impermissibly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">We briefly summarize the evidence presented at trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Shortly before 6 a.m. on Saturday, February 18, 1978, Sellon arrived at the Quincy residence of his father-in-law, Carl Dahl. Sellon knocked on the front door, and Dahl, who was up and dressed at the time, let him in. In his jacket pocket, Sellon had a bottle of highly concentrated plumber\u2019s acid. The men proceeded down a hallway to the kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">At the time of the alleged crime, Ellie Rukkinen, a friend of Dahl\u2019s from their childhood days in Finland, had been staying at Dahl\u2019s home for approximately six months. Rukkinen did not speak English. Rukkinen heard Sellon\u2019s knock and saw him in the house with Dahl. When Rukkinen, in a bedroom off the hallway, heard a noise from the kitchen, she went to the kitchen to see what had happened. Dahl was seated on the floor, and a brown substance was spattered on the floor, walls, ceiling, refrigerator, and curtains. Rukkinen, with Sellon\u2019s assistance lifted Dahl from the floor, and Rukkinen took Dahl to the bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Rukkinen testified that in the bathroom, Dahl said to her in Finnish that \u201cBilly [Sellon] hit him [Dahl] the first time from behind.\u201d After Rukkinen attempted to wash Dahl off in the bathroom, Dahl was taken to the bedroom. Rukkin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>en testified that, in the bedroom, within a few minutes of the time she first saw Dahl seated motionless on the floor, he said, in Finnish, \u201cOh, Billy, why did you do this to me?\u201d (Sellon does not speak Finnish.)</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Dahl was taken to Quincy City Hospital and later the same day to University Hospital in Boston, where he was treated for third degree burns covering forty per cent of his body. These burns had been caused by exposure to a highly concentrated acid. Dahl\u2019s death on April 15, 1978, was caused by his acid burns and subsequent infection.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">1. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>In assessing whether a defendant has been denied the effective assistance of counsel, we have engaged in a \u201ctwo-step inquiry.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rondeau, </em>378 Mass. 408, 412 (1979). Sellon must show both (1) that the conduct of his trial counsel fell \u201cmeasurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 89, 96 (1974), and (2) that \u201cprejudice resulted] therefrom.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rondeau, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">a. <em>Failure to call nurses as witnesses. </em>The Commonwealth maintained that Sellon had deliberately poured acid on Dahl. In support of its theory, it offered the two statements Rukkinen said Dahl made just after he was burned. While they were hearsay, these statements were properly admitted as spontaneous exclamations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">Sellon, on the other hand, claimed that the acid spilled accidentally. Testifying in his own defense, Sellon indicated that he had brought the acid with him from his home in Canton, where he kept a supply of plumber\u2019s acid for use in clearing clogged drains in two apartment buildings which he owned. He testified that upon entering Dahl\u2019s house, he went directly to the kitchen, opened the bottle which contained the acid, and then asked his father-in-law to watch how the acid would clear the drain.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Not<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>ing that the walkway into Dahl\u2019s house had been partially covered with snow, Sellon continued that he slipped on the floor of the kitchen, and the contents of the bottle flew all over the room, landing in part on his father-in-law.</p>\n<p id=\"A2E\">A police officer who had responded to the scene on the morning that Dahl was burned testified at trial that Sellon told him, \u201cWe were cleaning the sink drain and I slipped and spilled the acid.\u201d Sellon\u2019s wife, furthermore, testified that at University Hospital on the day he was burned her father told her, \u201cIt was an accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AKy\">Sellon\u2019s counsel knew that four nurses at Quincy City Hospital had given separate statements to the police to the effect that Dahl had stated at the hospital that he (Dahl) had spilled the acid on himself accidentally.* *<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Sellon alleges that trial counsel\u2019s failure to call these nurses as witnesses constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"AlZ\">The choice facing trial counsel in deciding whether or not to call the nurses was more difficult than Sellon suggests. The statements by Dahl to the nurses could have been used to impeach Dahl\u2019s statements to Rukkinen which had been admitted as spontaneous exclamations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judge, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>ever, indicated that if the nurses were called to testify to what Dahl had said to them, he might permit the introduction of another damaging statement made by Dahl to Rukkinen.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah-\">The Commonwealth had attempted to introduce this additional statement through testimony by Rukkinen to the effeet that at the hospital Dahl told her, \u201cLook out for Billy [Sellon]. He will kill you, just as he tried to kill me.\u201d The trial judge ruled this testimony inadmissible since the statement occurred more than an hour after Dahl was burned, and thus could not constitute a spontaneous exclamation.* ***<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hampton, </em>351 Mass. 447, 449 (1966). The judge specifically indicated, however, that he would reverse his decision to exclude this testimony if \u201cany contrary statements\u201d by Dahl (such as his statements to the nurses) were to be introduced by the defense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The choice facing Sellon\u2019s trial counsel was further complicated by the fact that Dahl\u2019s statements to the nurses directly contradicted Sellon\u2019s own testimony in that Dahl said that he, not Sellon, had spilled the acid accidentally.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AKS\">For these reasons the question whether or not to use the nurses as witnesses posed a significant tactical dilemma. When \u201carguably reasoned tactical or strategic judgments of a lawyer are called into question,\u201d in order to find ineffective assistance of counsel, \u201cwe require that such judgments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>be [shown to be] \u2018manifestly unreasonable.\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rondeau, </em>378 Mass. 408, 413 (1979), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>374 Mass. 722, 728 (1978). Since the choice of tactics by Sellon\u2019s trial counsel is fairly debatable on the record before us, ineffective assistance of counsel has not been demonstrated.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Sellon contends, however, that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to interview the nurses, in and of itself, constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Such an omission by defense counsel in a first degree murder case may well amount to \u201cserious incompetency ... or inattention of counsel \u2014 behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). However, even if his trial counsel\u2019s failure to investigate constitutes sufficient incompetence to satisfy the first of <em>Saferian s </em>two tests, Sellon has failed to show how he was prejudiced by this failure to interview the nurses. In response to Sellon\u2019s motion for a new trial, the judge found that the affidavits obtained from the nurses by Sellon\u2019s appellate counsel indicate that \u201c[w]hat they [the nurses] would say ... is really not different from what they had told the District Attorney\u201d (i.e., the statements provided to defense counsel). The record affords no basis for us to conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">b. <em>Failure to prepare witnesses. </em>Sellon argues that his trial counsel failed to \u201cprepare\u201d him (Sellon), his wife, and other family members prior to their testifying as defense witnesses. \u201cPreparation\u201d in this context refers not to a general interview with a witness in order to determine what he or she knows concerning an event,* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but rather to a discus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>sion designed to review the specific matters likely to be testified to at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Sellon grounds his argument on affidavits by himself and by family members, and on lengthy testimony by his trial counsel at a hearing on his motion for a new trial. During the course of this hearing, trial counsel conceded that he did not prepare one minor witness, Sellon\u2019s son Raymond. Trial counsel insisted, however, that he had prepared all other family members. The judge chose to believe this testimony and found that affidavits by these family members to the effect that they had not been prepared were not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Sellon argues that these findings were based only on the affidavits, and thus are subject to an independent reassessment by this court. The findings, however, were not based simply on affidavits. The judge had before him the testimony of trial counsel, and, in addition, he relied on his observation during the trial of the family members\u2019 testimony, in which he found no indication of confusion. Findings based on the testimony of witnesses as well as affidavits are \u201cnot ordinarily to be overturned on appeal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rondeau, </em>378 Mass. 408, 413 (1979). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>378 Mass. 165, 171-172 (1979), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Moreover, even if trial counsel wholly failed to prepare his witnesses, Sellon has failed to demonstrate any \u201cissue of fact or law that [as a result] could have been but was not exploited by counsel for the defendant\u2019s benefit in the original proceedings.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 98 (1974). Even if a defendant demonstrates a deficiency in pretrial preparation, \u201cthe defendant [can] make no headway in the absence of a showing that the fault probably resulted in forfeiture of a substantial defence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">c. <em>Presence of disbarred attorney at the counsel table. </em>Sellon\u2019s trial counsel introduced one Joseph Passaretti to the judge and jury as an \u201cinvestigator.\u201d Passaretti was allowed by the judge to sit at the counsel table. At a bench conference during the course of the trial, the judge chastised Sellon\u2019s trial counsel for allowing this \u201cinvestigator\u201d to offer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>advice both on trial tactics and on more specific matters, such as when to make objections. After this admonition, Passaretti ceased his participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The judge subsequently learned that Passaretti was a disbarred attorney. In his ruling on Sellon\u2019s motion for a new trial, the judge noted, \u201cHowever reprehensible it may have been to introduce him [Passaretti] as an investigator and have him sit at counsel table, . . . the jury never learned anything about this.\u201d The judge specifically found that \u201cPassaretti\u2019s presence at the counsel table had no measurable detrimental effect on the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Whatever may be the consequences to Sellon\u2019s trial counsel,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> this conduct on his part can only amount to ineffective assistance of counsel if it is shown that Sellon was thereby likely to have been deprived of a substantial defense. The judge found that Passaretti\u2019s presence did not affect Sellon\u2019s defense. We have no basis to conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">d. <em>Failure to object to jury instructions. </em>The failure of Sellon\u2019s trial counsel to object to the jury instructions on manslaughter as given, or to seek further instructions, may plausibly be viewed as the product of a tactical decision. Trial counsel could reasonably have believed that additional elaboration by the judge on the manslaughter instructions would have lessened Sellon\u2019s chances of a not guilty verdict. If the jury believed the testimony of Sellon, his wife, and other family members, a not guilty verdict was required. Viewed in this light, we cannot say that trial counsel\u2019s decision, \u201carguably reasoned,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rondeau, 378 </em>Mass. 408, 413 (1979), not to seek modification, of the manslaughter instructions lay \u201cbeyond the range of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>374 Mass. 722, 730 (1978). In any event, we find the instructions to be adequate and not erroneous. See <em>infra </em>at 231-233.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">We conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Sellon\u2019s motion for a new trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number><em>Satterfield, </em>373 Mass. 109, 116 (1977). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Devereaux, </em>257 Mass. 391, 394 (1926).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">2. <em>Evidentiary issues. </em>Sellon grounds the appeal of his conviction in part on claims that there were errors in the judge\u2019s rulings on evidence. We consider each of these claims in turn, and conclude that there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">a. <em>Statements by Dahl to Rukkinen. </em>Central to the Commonwealth\u2019s case was testimony by Rukkinen that, as she was attempting to clean the acid off Dahl in the bathroom, he said to her in Finnish, \u201cBilly hit [me] the first time from behind.\u201d Rukkinen also testified that, after Dahl had been taken to the bedroom, he said again in Finnish, \u201cOh, Billy [Sellon], why did you do this to me?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Sellon argues that both statements constitute hearsay, and that neither falls within a recognized exception to the hearsay rule. We think, however, that the judge was correct in admitting the statements since they constitute spontaneous exclamations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Each statement was made within minutes of the time the incident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">The judge could well have concluded within his \u201cbroad discretion\u201d that Dahl\u2019s statements were made \u201cbefore there [had] been time to contrive and misrepresent.... It is to be observed that the statements need not be strictly contem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>poraneous with the exciting cause; they may be subsequent to it, provided there has not been time for the exciting influence to lose its sway and to be dissipated. . . . [TJhere can be no definite and fixed limit of time. Each case must depend upon its own circumstances.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>364 Mass. 211, 223 (1973), quoting from 6 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1750 (3d ed. 1940). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hampton, </em>351 Mass. 447, 449-450 (1966) (no error to admit hearsay evidence of a statement made by the victim five to six minutes after the stabbing occurred).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">b. <em>Police log. </em>Sellon also describes as inadmissible hearsay a Quincy police journal entry showing the time at which a call was received from the Dahl residence on the morning of February 18. The record, however, indicates that the judge had ample basis for concluding that the police log as to telephone calls received at the station met all the requirements of the business records exception to the hearsay rule created by G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">c. <em>Admission of bottle labelled \u201cLiquid Drano.\u201d </em>Sellon contends that real evidence, specifically, a bottle labelled Liquid Drano, was improperly admitted, in that it was both irrelevant and unduly prejudicial. The bottle was found by police in the cellar of the Dahl residence, pursuant to a search warrant, on the day of Sellon\u2019s arrest, eleven days after Dahl was burned. The presence in Dahl\u2019s cellar of a bottle, la-belled Liquid Drano, containing some type of liquid, tended to support the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that it was unnecessary for the defendant to have brought plumber\u2019s acid to Dahl\u2019s house. \u201cWhether such evidence was so inflammatory in nature as to outweigh its probative value and preclude its admission is a question to be determined by the trial judge in the exercise of his sound discretion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D'Agostino, </em>344 Mass. 276, 279 (1962).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>d. <em>Use of the phrase \u201cthe great amount of acid. </em>\u201d Sellon, testifying in his own defense, was asked by both the prosecutor (over defense counsel\u2019s objection) and the judge, whether a \u201cgreat amount\u201d of acid had struck Dahl.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> At the time the questions were asked the evidence indicated that Dahl suffered third degree acid burns over forty per cent of his body surface. The judge was fully justified in concluding that Sellon would not be prejudiced by being asked to answer a question including the phrase \u201cthe great amount of acid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">3. <em>Jury instructions. </em>Sellon argues two errors in the instructions to the jury: (1) that the instructions on manslaughter were inadequate, and (2) that the instructions on inferences were prejudicial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">a. <em>Involuntary manslaughter. </em>Sellon argues that the charge (1) failed to impart to the jury a clear understanding of the crime of involuntary manslaughter; (2) failed to relate legal principles to the evidence in the case so as to aid the jury in understanding the issues presented for their decision; and (3) failed to place upon the Commonwealth the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt both the elements of manslaughter and the absence of the defense of accident. In support of his conclusions Sellon parses the charge and attacks it piecemeal. We, however, view the charge in its entirety since the adequacy of instructions must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>be determined in light of their over-all impact on the jury.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Godin, </em>374 Mass. 120, 130 (1977). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rhoades, </em>379 Mass. 810, 824 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The judge defined involuntary manslaughter as \u201can unlawful homicide \u2014 that means a killing \u2014 unintentionally caused by an act which <em>constitutes </em>such a disregard of the probable, harmful consequences to another as to constitute wanton and reckless conduct.\u201d When the jury, during its deliberations, requested the judge to define for them again the crimes of murder and manslaughter, the judge stated that \u201c involuntary manslaughter . . . means that the person involved has such total disregard of the rights and safety of somebody else that you can say his conduct was what we call willful and wanton and resulted in bringing about the death.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vanderpool, </em>367 Mass. 743, 747 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The judge carefully distinguished the possibility of accident from the possibility that Sellon used the acid \u201cin such an outrageous manner that his conduct amounted to wanton and reckless misconduct.\u201d The defendant\u2019s conduct, as the judge indicated, must evidence a \u201ctotal\u201d disregard for the rights and safety of another. The judge gave the jury two examples of wilful and wanton conduct. Read as a whole, the instructions adequately conveyed to the jury the appropriate standard on which to impose liability.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rhoades, </em>379 Mass. 810, 825 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Finally, we find no merit in Sellon\u2019s contention that the charge failed to place on the Commonwealth the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of manslaughter. The judge instructed generally that the Commonwealth has the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and that this burden never shifts to the defendant, but remains continuously upon the Commonwealth. The judge specifically instructed that the Commonwealth must show that the acid spill was not an accident, and then, in his next sentence, he referred to \u201cthe government satisfying] [the jury] beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d that the incident was more than an accident. At the end of the portion of his charge related to manslaughter, moreover, the judge referred to the testimony of the defendant and other witnesses and instructed the jury to consider \u201cwhether the government has satisfied you beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime has been committed.\u201d We think that the judge more than adequately conveyed to the jury the burden of proof carried by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">b. <em>Inference instruction. </em>Sellon\u2019s final argument alleges that the judge\u2019s additional instructions on inferences suggested that he could be convicted upon a standard of proof lower than proof beyond a reasonable doubt (1) because these instructions were given after the jury began deliberating, thereby giving undue emphasis to inferences, and (2) because the judge did not repeat in his additional instructions his earlier discussion of the basic constitutional guaranties which must be included in the charge to the jury in a criminal case.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The judge\u2019s additional instructions, however, although delivered after a period of jury deliberation, must be read in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>light of the entire charge. The judge in giving further instructions is not required to repeat all aspects of his prior charge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>372 Mass. 319, 324-325 (1977). Viewed as a whole, the charge to the jury indicated that it was the jury\u2019s duty to find that the Commonwealth had met its burden of proving every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt before they could convict.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\"><em>Order denying defendant </em>s <em>motion for a new trial affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b235-13\"> Assignments of error not briefed are deemed waived. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amazeen, </em>375 Mass. 73, 74 n.1 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b236-9\"> Additional evidence will be set forth in our review of the errors alleged, and in our discussion of the motion for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b237-12\"> See 229-230, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b237-13\"> The credibility of Sellon\u2019s motive for bringing the acid with him was called into question by Rukkinen\u2019s testimony that she had used the kitchen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>sink daily before Dahl was burned, and had encountered no problem with the drain.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b238-24\"> The prosecutor told Sellon\u2019s counsel about the statements at the probable cause hearing.

The Commonwealth suggests to this court that the statements were hearsay and hence inadmissible. However, the trial judge might properly have admitted Dahl\u2019s statements to the nurses for impeachment purposes. Where an exception to the hearsay rule allows the admission of a statement by an out-of-court declarant, this statement is subject \u201cto impeachment in the appropriate ways\u201d (italics omitted). 3A J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 884 (Chadbourn rev. 1970). See Fed. R. Evid. 806 (\u201cWhen a hearsay statement. . . has been admitted in evidence, the credibility of the declarant may be attacked, and if attacked may be supported, by any evidence which would be admissible for those purposes if declarant had testified as a witness\u201d). The spontaneous exclamation exception to the hearsay rule effectively allowed the Commonwealth, through the testimony of Rukkinen, to place Dahl on the stand to testify that Sellon hit him (i.e., Dahl) from behind. The nurses\u2019 testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>as to what Dahl said at the hospital thus was admissible for impeachment purposes as evidence of inconsistent statements made by Dahl prior to the time of trial. See generally W.B. Leach &amp; P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 114-119 (4th ed. 1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b239-32\"> The judge couched his ruling in terms of \u201cres gestae.\u201d See note 14, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"Avg\"> Since this contingency did not arise, the judge had no occasion to consider limiting instructions. The parties do not suggest that it would have been correct to admit Dahl\u2019s statements to the nurses or his additional statement to Rukkinen for purposes other than impeachment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"A8A\"> Dahl\u2019s statements to the nurses might well have been attacked by the Commonwealth as reflecting Dahl\u2019s embarrassment at being the victim of a violent crime committed by a family member, or Dahl\u2019s desire to protect his son-in-law by falsely blaming himself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b240-7\"> In his findings on Sellon\u2019s motion for a new trial the judge noted that \u201c[a]n issue much discussed before and during trial was whether the nurses should be called as witnesses.\u201d The choice not to call the nurses, the judge concluded, \u201cdoes not appear to me to be unwise, even in hindsight.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b240-8\"> Sellon does not contend that his trial counsel was unfamiliar with the substance of the matters testified to by family members, or that such members had not discussed what they knew about the case with counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b242-9\"> The judge indicated that he would take appropriate action after the trial concluded. The record does not indicate what further action was undertaken by the judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b243-9\"> Sellon suggests on this appeal that we should define the standard for effective assistance of counsel by reference to the ABA Standards Relating to the Defense Function (Approved Draft 1971). However, we adhere to our previous rejection of this suggestion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 99 n.15 (1974). As we said then, the standards themselves indicate that they are \u201cintended as guides for conduct of lawyers and as the basis for disciplinary action, not as criteria for judicial evaluation of the effectiveness of counsel to determine the validity of a conviction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b243-10\"> The judge admitted the statements because they were part of the \u201cres gestae.\u201d We have previously noted that \u201cthe phrase \u2018res gestae\u2019 has been applied frequently \u2018to the Hearsay Exception for <em>Spontaneous Exclamations . . . </em>i.e. statements made during or after an affray, a collision, or the like, used to prove the facts asserted in the statement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>364 Mass. 211, 221 n.3 (1973), quoting from 6 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1768 (3d ed. 1940). We prefer the inore specific term \u201cspontaneous exclamation.\u201d See 6 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 1767, 1768 (Chadbourn rev. 1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b244-7\"> \u201cThe operations of the instrumentalities of government constitute \u2018business\u2019 within the meaning of the statute . . . .\u201d <em>Sawyer &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co., </em>354 Mass. 481, 484 (1968), quoting from <em>LaPorte </em>v. <em>United States, </em>300 F.2d 878, 880 (9th Cir. 1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b244-8\"> The absence of any chemical analysis, and the fact that the bottle was found eleven days after the crime, went to the weight, not to the admissi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>bility of the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>361 Mass. 665, 679 (1972), vacated on other grounds, 410 U.S. 901, aff\u2019d on remand, 363 Mass. 665, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1080 (1973) (fact that there was no testimony as to the type of blood on blood-stained paper money went to the weight, not to the admissibility of the evidence).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\"> The prosecutor asked Sellon whether he was aware of the \u201cgreat amount\u201d of acid that had struck Dahl; when defense counsel objected, the following exchange occurred in the presence of the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">The judge: \u201cWell, there is no question about that, is there?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">The witness: \u201cI was aware of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">The judge: \u201cA great amount did strike him, is that correct?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">The witness: \u201cYes, your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">The prosecutor subsequently asked whether Sellon had observed \u201cthe great amount of liquid\u201d on Dahl, and Sellon replied, \u201cI did.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b246-7\"> Since there is no exception to this aspect of the charge, we review the challenged instructions to determine whether the charge as given created \u201ca substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 564 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b246-8\"> We also find adequate the manner in which the judge introduced the issue of involuntary manslaughter. The judge said, \u201cNow, suppose you make up your minds that the facts indicate to you that the defendant didn\u2019t trip and fall and thus spill the product but that he used the product in such an outrageous manner that his conduct amounted to wanton and reckless misconduct.\u201d The judge then defined involuntary manslaughter and gave the jury other examples of wilful and reckless conduct. Viewed as a whole, we conclude there was no error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b247-7\"> The instructions were given in the course of answering a question from the jury as to the definitions of two medical terms from the Quincy City Hospital: \u201cENT\u201d and \u201cCNS.\u201d By agreement the jury was told that ENT meant ear, nose, and throat, and that CNS meant central nervous system. The defendant\u2019s exception, taken before the instructions were given, was a general objection that an instruction on inferences was being given at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
