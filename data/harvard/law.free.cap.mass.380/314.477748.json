L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, for relief from the action of a judge of the Superior Court in allowing the defendant\u2019s motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>new trial under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A single justice of this court denied the Commonwealth relief and ordered the petition dismissed. The case is before us on the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal from the judgment of dismissal. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The defendant, Vernard Cook, was convicted of murder in the first degree and related offenses,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by a jury on June 12, 1973, and appealed therefrom to this court. We affirmed his conviction by our opinion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>364 Mass. 767 (1974). For a summary of the evidence presented at Cook\u2019s trial, see <em>id. </em>at 768-769. In addition to reviewing Cook\u2019s assignments of error on direct appeal, we reviewed the record and transcript pursuant to our powers under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, and held that \u201c[jjustice does not require a new trial or the entry of a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt on any of the indictments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 772-773. The point now raised was not argued in the prior appeal and was not discussed by this court in its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">On December 16, 1976, Cook filed a pro se motion for a new trial, and a judge of the Superior Court appointed new counsel to represent him thereon. On February 28, 1977, the new counsel filed a substitute motion for a new trial, on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel, and judicial and prosecutorial overreaching. The judge who had presided over the original trial had retired, so the motion was heard by another judge of the Superior Court (motion judge). Hearings on the motion were held on December 21, 1977, and again on March 2, 1979; the delay between the two hearings being due to the unavailability of a witness. The original trial counsel for Cook and the prosecutor for the Commonwealth testified. On May 14,1979, the motion judge filed Findings, Rulings and Order granting Cook\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>The Commonwealth sought relief from that decision and order by the present petition under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. The single justice who heard the petition filed a memorandum in which he \u201cassume[d], without deciding, that the Commonwealth may seek relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, from the granting of a motion for a new trial,\u201d and ruled that \u201c [ajlthough the circumstances do not seem to have required the allowance of the motion ... I cannot rule that the allowance . . . was an abuse of discretion.\u201d The Commonwealth is appealing from that decision of the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">After the parties argued before this court, Cook\u2019s counsel filed a \u201csuggestion of mootness,\u201d because Cook had earlier escaped from prison and his whereabouts were still unknown. A fugitive from justice cannot pursue an appeal, because \u201c [b]y his voluntary act, which renders him unavailable to await the decision of the court, he has waived appellate rights.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rezendes, </em>353 Mass. 228, 228 (1967). We see no reason to deprive the Commonwealth of appeal because of the act of the defendant, however. The Commonwealth is entitled to a determination of what its rights will be should Cook be apprehended or otherwise return to Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The facts forming the basis for the motion for a new trial were, in broad outline, as follows. During Cook\u2019s trial, the prosecutor called to the stand Joseph Andrews, Cook\u2019s co-participant in the crime, whose trial had been severed under the Bruton rule.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Andrews testified, but, as to all but innocuous questions, he refused to answer on the ground that his answers might tend to incriminate him. Cook\u2019s trial counsel did not at any point object, except, request a voir dire, or request a jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">A somewhat more lengthy recapitulation of the Andrews episode is necessary to provide the proper factual context for the ruling of the motion judge. The evidence against Cook at his trial was, as we noted on direct appeal, largely cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>cumstantial. <em>Cook, supra </em>at 772.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The prosecutor told the jury in his opening statement that Cook and Andrews were alleged to have committed the robbery and murder. Before Andrews was called to the stand, other eyewitnesses had testified that a tall man and a short man participated in the robbery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As soon as Andrews was sworn as a witness but before he took the stand, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything.\u201d His own attorney immediately advised him that he had a right to refuse to answer any question the prosecutor might ask. At that point in the trial neither the judge, nor the prosecutor, nor Cook\u2019s trial counsel did anything to explore whether Andrews intended to invoke his privilege against self-incrimination. The judge simply stated: \u201cHe may take the stand.\u201d Andrews answered several preliminary questions, including his name, the fact that he was then in custody at Charles Street jail,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that he had known Cook for eight or nine years, and that he, Andrews, lived one block from Humboldt Avenue. An eyewitness to the escape had earlier testified that at some time after the robbery he identified the escape car which was then parked on Humboldt Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">When the prosecutor asked Andrews, \u201cDid you see the defendant back on December 20th, 1972\u201d (the date of the robbery), Andrews pleaded the Fifth Amendment and refused to answer on the ground that he might incriminate himself. He gave the same answer when asked whether or not Vernard Cook was the owner of an automobile during the month of December, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>When asked if he knew Sergeant Whalen (to whom he had made a confession), Andrews replied that he had seen him before. The prosecutor then asked if Andrews had ever spoken to Whalen, and Andrews invoked the privilege against self-incrimination. After seyeral further questions, in response to many of which Andrews invoked the same privilege, the prosecutor showed Andrews \u201cthis piece of paper\u201d and asked him to read it to himself. He next asked Andrews if he had read enough of the document to recognize it, and Andrews answered in the affirmative. The prosecutor asked if the paper was \u201ca stenographic copy of the statement that you gave to Sergeant Whalen,\u201d whereupon Andrews again invoked the same privilege. Direct examination then ceased. Cook\u2019s trial counsel asked one question (which the motion judge in his findings characterized as \u201cmeaningless\u201d): \u201cSir, have you ever seen or talked to me?\u201d The witness answered that he had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The evidence presented at the hearing on the motion for new trial revealed that there had been preliminary negotiations before Cook\u2019s trial for a plea arrangement for Andrews. Both the Cook and the Andrews prosecutions were being handled by the same assistant district attorney. The prosecutor testified that he had a strong case of murder in the first degree against Andrews including a confession made after full Miranda warnings, and that he had offered to accept a plea to murder in the second degree from him in exchange for his testimony against Cook. No agreement was ever reached, however, and when the prosecutor called Andrews to testify at the Cook trial, he did not know whether Andrews would testify fully or invoke his privilege. Andrews\u2019 attorney testified that he suggested to the prosecutor that he call Andrews. Cook\u2019s trial counsel testified that he had failed to take any action regarding the Andrews episode because he was unaware at the time of any legal basis for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The contents of Andrews\u2019 confession never reached the jury, so there was no per se violation of <em>Bruton, supra, </em>or of <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415 (1965). The motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>judge ruled, however, that the incident taken as a whole, with inferences the jury might have drawn from Andrews\u2019 refusal to answer certain questions, \u201cadded critical weight to the prosecution\u2019s case in a form not subject to cross-examination, and thus unfairly prejudiced the defendant,\u201d quoting from <em>Namet </em>v. <em>United States, </em>373 U.S. 179, 187 (1962). He found that the prosecutor \u201cconsciously [came] close to the edge of committing a <em>Bruton </em>and <em>Douglas </em>error . . . [and] in effect, denied confrontation to the defendant.\u201d Accordingly, he granted Cook a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">1. <em>Propriety of review under G. L. c. 211, </em>\u00a7 <em>3. </em>General Laws c. 211, \u00a7 3, as amended through St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 44, provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe supreme judicial court shall have general superintendence of all courts of inferior jurisdiction to correct and prevent errors and abuses therein if no other remedy is expressly provided . . . .\u201d The order of the Superior Court judge is not appealable under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E, governing interlocutory appeals. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>375 Mass. 409, 413 (1978).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Cook argues that the Commonwealth has a remedy under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. He cites no case, however, construing \u00a7 33E as providing a remedy to the Commonwealth in the case of the grant of a motion under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29. See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The fact that the Commonwealth has no other remedy does not make c. 211, \u00a7 3, review automatic, however. We have rarely allowed Commonwealth appeals of interlocutory matters under our supervisory powers. See <em>McCarthy, supra </em>at 414; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frado, </em>372 Mass. 866, 866 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>(1977) ,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We will review interlocutory matters in criminal cases only when \u201csubstantial claims\u201d of \u201cirremediable\u201d error are presented, <em>Beckman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>377 Mass. 810, 812 (1979), and only in \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d <em>Gilday </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>360 Mass. 170, 171 (1971), where \u201cit becomes necessary to protect substantive rights,\u201d <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>353 Mass. 236, 239 (1967). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Longval, </em>378 Mass. 246, 252-253 (1979); <em>Blaisdell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>372 Mass. 753, 755 (1977); <em>Meyers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 843, 844 (1973). The \u201cright\u201d the Commonwealth seeks to protect here presumably is the efficient administration of justice; it seeks to avoid utilizing its resources to conduct what it contends is an unnecessary retrial. As we did in <em>McCarthy, supra, </em>and as the single justice did in this case, we shall assume that the Commonwealth may seek such relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">2. <em>Standard of review. </em>The motion judge granted the motion for new trial pursuant to his power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29, as amended through St. 1966, c. 301.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A motion for new trial is generally a matter for the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>Earl </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>356 Mass. 181, 184 (1969). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dascalakis, </em>246 Mass. 12, 25, 32 (1923). If the original trial was \u201cinfected with prejudicial constitutional error,\u201d the trial judge has no dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>cretion to deny the motion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Lannon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>379 Mass. 786, 788 (1980). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Penrose, </em>363 Mass. 677, 681 (1973). <em>Earl, supra. </em>Even in the absence of constitutional error, the motion judge has discretion to \u201cset aside a verdict in order to prevent a miscarriage of justice when a decisive or pertinent point affecting substantial rights has not been raised by exception at the trial.\u201d <em>Dascalakis, supra </em>at 25. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harrington, 379 </em>Mass. 446, 449 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>364 Mass. 211, 229 (1973); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967). This is especially true where, as here, the defendant alleges that he was represented at trial and on direct appeal by ineffective counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">The standard of review under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, of the exercise of judicial discretion in granting a new trial under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29, is whether the judge acted arbitrarily, frivolously, or contrary to law. <em>McCarthy, supra </em>at 415 &amp; n.6. Furthermore, absent an abuse of discretion by the single justice in denying relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, the Commonwealth can have no relief from the full court. See <em>Cefalu </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., 377 </em>Mass. 907 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">3. <em>Grant of a new trial. </em>Before discussing the merits of the motion judge\u2019s ruling, we wish to make clear that the validity of Andrews\u2019 exercise of his privilege against self-incrimination is not before us, and we intimate no opinion thereon. Additionally, in this court, Cook explicitly waived his claim of prosecutorial misconduct at the trial, and we therefore make no attempt to analyze the actions or motives of the prosecutor. Cook relies on ineffective assistance of counsel and the denial of confrontation in support of his claim that the motion judge did not act arbitrarily in granting his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The question whether Cook was deprived of effective assistance of counsel at trial with regard to the Andrews epi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>sode turns on whether his trial counsel\u2019s inattention, negligence, or ignorance affected Cook\u2019s trial in such a way and to such an extent as to prejudice his defense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rondeau, </em>378 Mass. 408, 412 (1979) (two-step test for ineffective assistance of counsel). Therefore, we must first determine whether the evidence supports the conclusion of the motion judge that the Andrews incident deprived Cook of a fair trial. See generally <em>Halner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 378 </em>Mass. 388 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">In <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123 (1968), the Supreme Court held that it was error of constitutional magnitude to try two codefendants together when the statement of Evans, implicating Bruton, was admitted in evidence only as to Evans. A jury instruction was held not to cure the error. \u201c[Bjecause of the substantial risk that the jury, despite instructions to the contrary, looked to the incriminating extrajudicial statements in determining petitioner\u2019s guilt, admission of Evans\u2019 confession in this joint trial violated petitioner\u2019s right of cross-examination secured by the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">In <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415 (1965), the prosecutor called as a witness, a codefendant (Loyd), who had already been tried and convicted. The prosecutor read from a document purporting to be Loyd\u2019s confession, implicating Douglas. When asked to confirm or deny that he had made each statement, Loyd invoked his privilege each time because his appeal was pending. <em>Id. </em>at 416. The procedure was held to violate Douglas\u2019 right to confront and cross-examine a witness against him, because Loyd had not affirmed the statements as his. <em>Id. </em>at 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The leading case concerning the situation before us is <em>Namet </em>v. <em>United States, 373 </em>U.S. 179 (1963). Two alleged coparticipants who had pleaded guilty to gambling charges were called to testify against Namet, an alleged participant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>with the first two. The presiding judge held a conference out of the jury\u2019s hearing and ruled that the witnesses had a limited privilege as to dealings with third persons but not as to their own gambling activities, because they had already pleaded guilty (but could be subject to further charges of bribery or conspiracy). The Supreme Court upheld this procedure, but noted certain facts which distinguish <em>Namet </em>from the present case. In <em>Namet, </em>the government\u2019s closing argument included no reference to the refusal to testify, the jury were not told that the coparticipants were arrested or charged together with Namet, and the judge fully instructed the jury not to draw any adverse inferences about Namet\u2019s guilt from the refusal of the witnesses to testify. See <em>Namet, supra </em>at 181-184. Furthermore, Namet\u2019s attorney objected, and obtained a bench conference resulting in a ruling on the validity of the witnesses\u2019 privilege, a procedure not followed by Cook\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Although the Court found no error in <em>Namet, </em>it established the test for such cases as the present one: \u201cerror may be based upon a concept of prosecutorial misconduct, when the Government makes a conscious and flagrant attempt to build its case out of inferences arising from use of the testimonial privilege . . . [or] in the circumstances of a given case, inferences from a witness\u2019 refusal to answer [may have] added critical weight to the prosecution\u2019s case in a form not subject to cross-examination, and thus [may] unfairly [have] prejudiced the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186-187.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">We have applied the <em>Namet </em>test in this Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>372 Mass. 412, 414 (1977). \u201cWhen a witness in a criminal case refuses to answer questions on the ground of self-incrimination, lay triers may readily, although improperly, make invidious inferences as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>sociating the witness with the defendant in an illegal enterprise; and the prejudice to the defendant may be especially hard to remove because he cannot cross-examine the witness as to \u2018testimony\u2019 which is in the form of a kind of riddling silence\u201d (footnotes omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 413-414. These inferences, and the ability to attack them, are especially poignant when the witness is a coparticipant in the crime. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Funches, </em>379 Mass. 283, 292 (1979). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ritz, </em>548 F.2d 510, 518 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>San Fratello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>340 F.2d 560, 565 (5th Cir. 1965).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Such \u201criddling silences\u201d can create an \u201catmosphere of guilt\u201d that is impossible to refute. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Coppola, </em>479 F.2d 1153, 1160 (10th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">We have affirmed convictions where coparticipants and other witnesses had invoked their Fifth Amendment privilege, but those cases are distinguishable on their facts from the present case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fazio, </em>375 Mass. 451, 458-462 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>375 Mass. 211, 213-217, cert. denied, 439 U.S. 872 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martino, </em>361 Mass. 720, 722 (1972); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Granito, </em>326 Mass. 494, 498-499 (1950). The crux of these decisions is that, considering the entire situation that occurred at the trial, there is no indication that either of the two tests of <em>Namet, supra </em>(as applied in <em>Martin, supra), </em>has been violated. In the present case, the factual situation differs. The prosecutor told the jury in his opening statement that Joseph Andrews was the tall man alleged to have committed the robbery with Cook. Eyewitnesses testified that a tall man and a short man committed the robbery, but none could identify the latter. Andrews, visibly taller than Cook, was led into the courtroom and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>refused to testify as to anything concerning the incident. Andrews admitted to having spoken to Sergeant Whalen, and admitted that he recognized the piece of paper handed to him by the prosecutor. Andrews refused to answer when asked if the paper was a copy of the statement he gave to Whalen. The jury could well have inferred that Andrews had implicated Cook in the statement. We cannot say that the evidence in this case, which includes total inaction on the part of Cook\u2019s trial counsel, does not support the motion judge\u2019s finding of prejudice to the defendant as the result of ineffective assistance of counsel. Nor can we say that the motion judge abused his discretion or acted in a manner \u201carbitrary, frivolous, or contrary to law,\u201d <em>McCarthy, supra </em>at 415, in ruling that the Andrews incident \u201cadded critical weight to the prosecution\u2019s case in a form not subject to cross-examination, and thus unfairly prejudiced the defendant.\u201d <em>Namet, supra </em>at 187. <em>Martin, supra </em>at 414. The test is not what we would have done if we were in the position of the motion judge after hearing the same evidence which he heard. Rather it is whether that evidence, as it appears in the record before us, warrants the action of the motion judge in ordering a new trial. We believe that it does and in this situation we do not allow ourselves the idle luxury of speculating on whether we would have acted differently if we had presided over the hearing on the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-7\"> General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 29, was replaced by Mass.

L. c. 278, \u00a7 29: \u201cif it appears that justice may not have been done.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b335-7\"> The motion judge ruled in the alternative: \u201cI rule that \u2018the original trial was infected with prejudicial constitutional error\u2019.... I have no discretion to deny a new trial .... [I]f I had discretion I would grant the motion . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b336-8\"> The confrontation clause was held applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment in <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b337-7\"> The Court stressed in <em>Namet </em>that it was not dealing with constitutional error, but only \u201ca claim of evidentiary trial error.\u201d In <em>Douglas, supra </em>at 420, the Supreme Court held that the denial of confrontation at Douglas\u2019 trial was a violation of the second <em>Namet </em>test, however. Therefore, the motion judge did not err in ruling that a violation of the second <em>Namet </em>test could, in certain circumstances, rise to the level of constitutional error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b338-5\"> When the coparticipant witness invokes his privilege on the stand and is subsequently granted immunity out of the hearing of the jury, the prejudice is not so great because he is then subject to full cross-examination. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em>549 F.2d 654, 658-659 (9th Cir. 1977); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>543 F.2d 640, 650 (8th Cir. 1976); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dingle, </em>546 F.2d 1378, 1380-1382 (10th Cir. 1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
