United appealed, we allowed its application for direct appellate review, and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-16\">We summarize the stipulated facts. United is a credit union organized under G. L. c. 171 and a member of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>MCUSIC, a corporation created by St. 1961, c. 294, to insure shares and deposits of member credit unions. On becoming a member in 1964, United paid MCUSIC $56,506.37 pursuant to \u00a7 7 of the MCUSIC statute. Additional semiannual \u00a7 7 assessments were paid to maintain United\u2019s contribution at one per cent of its total share and deposit balances, bringing the total \u00a7 7 assessment to $60,901.80. MCUSIC paid dividends on \u00a7 7 assessments in each year since 1971. United also paid assessments in a total amount of $53,132.35 pursuant to \u00a7 8 of the MCUSIC statute, providing for semi-annual assessments of one twenty-fourth of one per cent of the member\u2019s share and deposit liabilities. No dividends were paid on \u00a7 8 assessments, and United does not seek the return of the \u00a7 8 assessments. In June, 1976, United became a member of Federal Share Insurance, a Federal corporation providing insurance similar to that provided MCUSIC, voluntarily withdrew from MCUSIC, and demanded return of its \u00a7 7 assessments. MCUSIC refused the demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The parties agree that the MCUSIC statute does not explicitly authorize return of \u00a7 7 assessments to a member who voluntarily withdraws. The assessments paid pursuant to \u00a7 7 and \u00a7 8 make up the \u201cshare insurance fund.\u201d \u00a7 8. MCUSIC is authorized to use the fund to provide financial assistance to troubled members, including their operation or liquidation. Section 7 assessments may be \u201ccharged by the member to its guaranty fund, reserve account, undivided earnings, or established as an asset\u201d; \u00a7 8 assessments may only be \u201ccharged to the guaranty fund, reserve account, undivided earnings or operating expense.\u201d \u201c Uniform refunds\u201d of \u00a7 7 assessments over one per cent are authorized, and in the event of dissolution of MCUSIC \u00a7 7 assessments are to be distributed to the \u201cthen members\u201d pro rata. \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The MCUSIC statute bears some resemblance to the earlier statutes creating the mutual savings bank Deposit Insurance Fund, St. 1934, c. 43, and the cooperative bank Share <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Insurance Fund, St. 1934, c. 73,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a comparison of the three statutes suggests that the MCUSIC statute is incomplete. The savings bank statute provides that a member bank that voluntarily withdraws from the State program to join the Federal counterpart receives a cash refund of its original assessment of one-quarter of one per cent of deposits. \u00a7 15 (a), inserted by St. 1956, c. 324, \u00a7 10. If the withdrawn member rejoins that State program, it is credited with the retained portion of its original assessment. \u00a7 16, inserted by St. 1956, c. 324, \u00a7 10. Upon dissolution and liquidation of the Fund, a withdrawn member is entitled to its pro rata share of assessments not theretofore repaid. \u00a7 10, as amended by St. 1956, c. 324, \u00a7 9. Excess funds may be used to pay withdrawn members on account of the assessments not theretofore repaid. \u00a7 15 (c), inserted by St. 1956, c. 324, \u00a7 10. In case of the liquidation of a member, the directors of the Fund may return \u201cthe unexpended portion, as determined by said directors, of all assessments\u201d after deducting a charge for insurance. In cases of merger or consolidation, the continuing bank succeeds to the rights of the discontinuing bank in the assessments theretofore paid. \u00a7 3, as amended by St. 1956, c. 324, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The cooperative bank statute makes provisions similar to those in the savings bank statute. St. 1934, c. 73, as amended by St. 1956, c. 323. But the cash refund to a bank which withdraws to join the Federal counterpart is one-half of its original one per cent assessment instead of its original assessment of one-fourth of one per cent. \u00a7 14 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The bill which became the MCUSIC statute provided for return of assessments on voluntary liquidation of a member credit union or on its withdrawal. 1961 House Doc. No. 2652, \u00a7 8. On liquidation, the bill provided, MCUSIC \u201cmay\u201d return to the member its proportionate share of all assessments under \u00a7 7 \u2014 the assessments of one per cent of its share balances. On withdrawal MCUSIC \u201cmay repay\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>one-half of the member\u2019s proportionate share of \u00a7 7 assessments; \u201call other funds and assessments shall be retained by the cooperation as payment for the insurance coverage.\u201d The latter provision would have given United only half of what it now claims. Both provisions were deleted in the course of enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">In the absence of any statutory provision for the situation that has arisen, the judge treated the assessments in question like insurance premiums, not subject to refund. Cf. <em>North N.Y. Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Ins. Corp., </em>515 F.2d 1355, 1358-1360 (D.C. Cir. 1975); <em>Euclid Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Federal Home Loan Bank Bd., </em>286 F. Supp. 125 (N.D. Ohio, 1966), aff\u2019d, 396 F.2d 950 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 846 (1968). United argues with some force that \u00a7 7 assessments are designed to produce a reserve to be used only if \u00a7 8 assessments are insufficient, and hence are unlike premiums. United urges upon us instead the analogy of deposits made with mutual insurance companies in addition to premiums. We held that such deposits became \u201cabsolute funds of the company\u201d when the by-laws explicitly so provided, but not otherwise. Compare <em>Long Pond Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Houghton, </em>6 Gray 77, 83 (1857), with <em>Fayette Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>8 Allen 27, 33 (1864). United asserts further that it is explicitly authorized by G. L. c. 171, \u00a7 35, to become insured by Federal instead of State insurance, and that the imposition of a forfeiture by MCUSIC for doing so is inconsistent with the legislative policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">These arguments are persuasive against forfeiture, and we do not understand MCUSIC to contend that there is a forfeiture. But even if United retains some interest in the unexpended balance of \u00a7 7 assessments paid by it, it is not shown how much of a refund should be made, nor when it should be made. The legislative precedents suggest that several rational solutions to these questions are possible, and that it may be proper to give considerable discretion to the directors of MCUSIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>The case was heard and decided on the footing that United claimed a right to an immediate refund of the total of its \u00a7 7 assessments. It now argues that it is entitled to the \u201cunexpended portion,\u201d but the record before us provides no basis for determining that portion. We have considered remand of the case to make an equitable apportionment, but we prefer to take the broader ground that the problem is legislative rather than judicial. The governing legislation simply fails to provide a basis for fashioning the governing rule. Nothing we say here is to be taken as limiting the power of the Legislature to provide such a rule, or as indicating the appropriate solution, in the absence of further legislation, of the various hypothetical problems that have been put in argument: the withdrawn member who rejoins, merger or consolidation of two credit unions, dissolution of a member, dissolution of MCUSIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b412-17\"> Statute 1961, c. 294, \u00a7 1, enacted a statute consisting of twelve sections, which have not been incorporated in the General Laws but may be found as c. 171 App. in both Mass.
