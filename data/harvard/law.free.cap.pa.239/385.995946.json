T., 1913, by Eliza Y. Wootten, from decree of O. C. Allegheny Co., No. 106, June T., 1912, modifying and confirming adjudication In Re Estate of Anna Sophia Eells, deceased.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"AEx3\">Before Brown, Mestrezat, Potter, Elkin and Stewart, JJ.</judges>\n<disposition data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"A0U\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-8\">Adjudication of the estate of a decedent. Hawkins, P. J., filed a statement and opinion as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-9\">The question which underlies this controversy is whether or not Miss Eells died intestate as to part of her estate?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-10\">The facts are these:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-11\">Having given certain pecuniary legacies testatrix provided \u201cshould there be enough of my estate left after paying the above amounts,\u201d certain other legacies should be paid; and then provided further, \u201cShould there not be enough left of my estate to pay these last named sums, then I direct that whatever may be left shall be given to said legatees......pro rata.\u201d Then follows separate items giving further legacies, and winding up with this paragraph:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-14\">\u201cShould there be any of my estate left after payment of the above named sums of money I hereby give .and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>bequeath the same as follows, viz: to said David Bobinson one thousand dollars in trust to pay the interest to Mrs. Lucy A. Jewett for life, and at her death, said amount to be divided equally between her said daughters as above. And to the said David Bobinson, one thousand dollars in trust to pay the interest to Beverend David Edward Eells for life and said amount to be divided equally between his said two sons after his death. Or if there should not be that amount left then payable as above pro rata.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-5\">There was more than enough to pay the amounts specified in the will, and this surplusage is the subject of controversy. Testatrix\u2019s uncertainty as to the value of her estate probably grew out of its gradual enhancement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-6\">Her estate was derived from her adoptive father and mother, and the relatives of these are the principal objects of her bounty. The final legatees represent both the father and mother.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-7\">The death of Lucy O. Jewett, residuary legatee, before testatrix suggests the question of lapse pro tanto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-8\">The adoption in this case seems to have been by parol, as no record has been found of any legal steps.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-9\">The decedent left no next of kin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-10\">If this will be construed with reference to the strict letter, intestacy must follow. The fixed sums given in the last clause fall short of complete disposition of the estate. But an anxiety is shown by the whole tenor of the will to make a complete disposition. There are three successive expressions used in the making of the will which clearly manifest this purpose. \u201cShould there be enough of my estate left after paying the above amounts,\u201d then further legacies should be paid; but \u201cshould there .not be enough,\u201d then they should take pro rata; and a similar provision is made in the final clause, True the legacies given are fixed in amount; but that was testatrix\u2019s form of accomplishing a paramount purpose, and that purpose ought not be defeated by a mistaken estimate of the value of the estate: Clarke\u2019s Est., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>82 Pa. 528. If conditions had remained as at the time of making the will this purpose would have been effectuated ; but the death of one of the residuary legatees suggests the question of revocation pro tanto by operation of law. It is insisted that the gift to her was as a member of a class and a right'of survivorship to her sister followed. The residuary gift was not in general terms to the children of Mrs. Jewett, but was to her two daughters by name. Had Lucy survived she would undoubtedly have taken a vested right in one-fourth of the residuary. Having died before testatrix the share intended for her lapsed and escheated to the Commonwealth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-5\">After exceptions filed the court made a decree modifying and confirming the adjudication and awarding one-fourth of decedent\u2019s residuary estate to the Commonwealth. Eliza Y. Wootten appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-6\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were, inter alia, in refusing to award the deceased sister\u2019s share in the residue to appellant, and in awarding it to the Commonwealth.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b417-7\"><em>S.

Jewett and her two daughters as the representatives of her foster mother\u2019s family and David E. Eells and his two sons as the representatives of her foster father\u2019s family, and that as such they were to be treated as a class, so that upon the death of Lucy A. Jewett and her daughter Lucy O. Jewett, the benefits given to this class would survive as a whole to the surviving daughter, Eliza Y.

Jewett was not to her as a member of a class \u2014 children of Mrs. Lucy A. Jewett. It was to her by name, to pass to her if she survived the testatrix, and to lapse if she did not. The learned court below, in construing the will of the testatrix, held that, if she had survived, she would have taken one-fourth of the residuary estate. This is not questioned by counsel for appellant or appellee, but, as she died in the lifetime of the testatrix, the latter\u2019s provision for her lapsed and escheated to the Commonwealth, for there were no known heirs or next of kin of Anna Sophia Eells to take it.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Decree affirmed at appellant\u2019s costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
