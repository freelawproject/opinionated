Allegheny Co., May T., 1912, No. 174, dismissing exceptions to adjudication in estate of John Haberman, deceased.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"A8Q\">Before Fell, C.

The only provision made in his will for his widow is the devise of a life estate in two and a quarter acres of land, upon which he resided, and a legacy of $300.00. She elects to take against the will, and claims that the amount in the hands of the accountant, $2,806.00, be distributed to her under the Act of April 1, 1909.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-10\">The legatees under the will offered an ante-nuptial agreement entered into between Mrs. Haberman and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>the decedent, August 27, 1889, a few weeks prior to their marriage, by the terms of which she was to have upon his death the life estate given in the will, and if he survived her, he was to have $3,800.00, the whole amount of her estate, less legacies of $130.00, given to her kin. If, then, Mrs. Haberman is bound by this agreement her claim must be rejected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-4\">When the agreement was made she was a widow, aged about fifty years, without children, and the decedent a bachelor, aged sixty-five years. He then owned real estate worth about $10,000 and $7,000 of personalty, consisting of money at interest. The agreement was prepared by a justice, now deceased, who did not understand German, and as Mrs. Haberman understood and spoke English very imperfectly, J. H. Haberman, decedent\u2019s nephew, acted as interpreter. He says, \u201cShe told me first in German, then I told \u2019Squire Rodgers in English, after it was down he read it in English, then I read it in German again.\u201d Mrs. Haberman says, \u201cI didn\u2019t understand half, when he explained anything he always spoke too fast, I could not understand half, it was half English and half German.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-5\">That this contract is an unconscionable and unreasonable ante-nuptial agreement there can be no question. Whilst Mrs. Haberman is provided with a house to live in, there is no adequate provision for her maintenance, as it is entirely improbable that she could support herself by renting the two and a quarter acres of land, or by cultivating it herself. As against this inadequate provision for Mrs. Haberman, she covenants to give her husband all her estate, except $130.00 given her kin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-6\">The provisions for her being so grossly disproportionate to the value of her husband\u2019s estate, fraudulent concealment will be presumed, and the burden of proof is upon the legatees to show that full disclosure had been made to Mrs. Haberman of the value of his estate: Warner\u2019s Est., 210 Pa. 431. This presumption has not been rebutted, as the evidence fails to show that full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>disclosure had been made to her of the value of his estate. It does show, however, that the agreement was made at the suggestion of J. H. Haberman, the decedent\u2019s nephew; that it was not fully explained to Mrs. Haberman, nor understood by her, and that she did not have the advice of any disinterested person in regard to it, and thus supports the presumption.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-4\">Distribution will, therefore, be made to her under the Act of April 1, 1909.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was decree dismissing exceptions to adjudication.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b42-6\"><em>J.
