In an action by an employee against his employer to recover damages for the loss of certain of his fingers caught between the cog-wheels of a shearing machine, the case is for the jury where it appears that the defendant had not guarded the cog-wheels as required by the Act of May 2, 1905, P. L. 352; that plaintiff when injured was engaged in the performance of his work in the usual manner pursued at the defendant\u2019s plant and in accordance with instructions received from defendant\u2019s foreman; that he knew of no better way to do it and in fact no better way was pointed out in the evidence, and that the hand rag which plaintiff had on at the time of the accident and which was the first thing caught in the cog-wheels was the usual protection worn by men engaged in the character of work being performed.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b150-6\">2. Where the issue of contributory negligence has been submitted to the jury, a finding in favor of the plaintiff will not be set aside unless, upon a review of the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, it is inconceivable that a mind desiring only a just and proper determination of the question could reasonably reach any other conclusion than that the plaintiff had brought about or contributed to the injury by his own carelessness. That is, after determining all doubts and drawing all inferences in favor of the plaintiff, it must be clear that he was guilty of contributory negligence before it can be so ruled as a matter of law.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b150-7\"><em>Evidence </em>\u2014 Witness\u2014Cross <em>examination </em>\u2014 Harmless <em>error.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b150-8\">3. The refusal of the trial judge to permit a plaintiff\u2019s witness to be asked certain questions upon cross examination for the purpose of showing the-witness\u2019s bias is not ground for reversal, even though the ruling inay not have been technically correct, if it appears from an examination of the whole body of the evidence that no material harm to the defendant\u2019s case could have resulted from such refusal.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b150-9\"><em>Negligence </em>\u2014 Evidence\u2014Manner <em>of doing work </em>\u2014 Reversible <em>error.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b150-10\">4.

In the performance of his duties he was obliged to collect metal scrap waste from boxes located in different parts of the plant, and he was so engaged at the time of the accident. The cogs which caused the injury consisted of one large and one small wheel, \u2014 the point of contact between the two being about fifty-eight inches above the floor, and the box from which the plaintiff was removing the scrap stood with one end close to these wheels; there was about four feet of space between this box and the truck to which he was transferring the scrap, and the plaintiff was obliged to turn-from one to the other. While he was so engaged, a canvas-rag which he wore to protect his hand, in some way became caught in the cogs and his right hand was drawn in between them; these cogs were in plain view but were not guarded. The verdict was for the plaintiff; the defendant has appealed and contends that it should have been held as a matter of law that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, and that the trial judge committed error in certain rulings upon the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The evidence shows that the hand-rag which the plaintiff had on at the time of the accident was a usual protection worn by men engaged in the character of work performed by him; it further shows that the plaintiff was doing his work in the usual manner pursued at the defendant\u2019s plant and in accordance with instructions received from the defendant\u2019s foreman, and that he knew of no better way to do it; in fact no better way is pointed out in the evidence. While the exact terms of the instructions were not brought out in the testimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>yet the plaintiff states that he did the work in the way that he was shown, \u201cI done it the way he told me and the way he was doing it.\u201d At the time of the accid\u00e9nt certain ends of the scrap were protruding out of the box, and the plaintiff was bending these ends back when his hand was caught. In answer to the question, \u201cHow did he show you to do the work , when the ends protruded over the boxes?\u201d he replied, \u201cHe said bend them over and put it back in.\u201d And in reply to the next question, \u201cIs that the manner in which you were doing the work at the time you were hurt?\u201d he said, \u201cYes, sir; it was for a fact.\u201d Although it appears that some of the scrap was rattling in the cogs at the time of the accident and that the plaintiff heard the noise, it is not clear that he tried to bend these pieces; so far as the testimony shows, it may be that he intended to put his hands upon pieces that were \u201csticking out from the box\u201d but not upon those which were actually \u201crattling in the cogs.\u201d In other words, after reading the testimony, we cannot say that it is clear that this plaintiff put his hand upon pieces of metal rattling in the cogs and thus did his work in an obviously dangerous manner when he might have done it in another way. Nor is it clear that he could readily have moved the box containing the scrap away from the cogs, for the testimony indicates that obstructions were present which might have interfered with this course.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\">Where the issue of contributory negligence has been submitted to the jury, a finding in favor of the plaintiff will not be set aside unless, upon a review of the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, it is inconceivable that. a mind desiring only a just, and proper determination of the question could reasonably reach any other conclusion than that the plaintiff had brought about or contributed to the injury by his own carelessness. That is, .after determining all doubts and drawing all inferences in favor of the plaintiff, it must be clear that he was guilty of contributory negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>gence before it can be so ruled as a matter of law. Here the- fact that the defendant was negligent in not guarding the cogwhe\u00e9ls as required by the Act of May <em>2, </em>1905, P. L. 352, was conceded; the plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence was properly submitted to the jury and the issue was found against the defendant. Under the evidence presented it may well be that the injury to this plaintiff was brought about by some slip or accidental movement on his part not amounting to contributory negligence. \u201cAn injury from machinery open and uncovered, is not liable to occur, without the concurrence of some accidental or unexpected event, such as a slip or miscalculated' move. And it is for that very reason ......that-prudence requires proper safeguards to be supplied to prevent accidental contact with moving machinery\u201d : Fegley v. Lycoming Rubber Co., 231 Pa. 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">One of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses was asked certain questions upon cross-examination for the purpose of eliciting testimony to show that he had been discharged from the defendant\u2019s employ, and thus to prove bias. The refusal to allow these questions is assigned for error. It is not necessary to determine whether or not these rulings were technically correct, for an examination of the whole body of the evidence satisfies us that no material harm to the defendant\u2019s case can have resulted therefrom. The witness had testified that one of the defendant\u2019s witnesses named Cochran, who stated upon the stand that he had seen the plaintiff\u2019s movements just before the accident, had admitted in his presence that the first he saw of the accident was when the plaintiff\u2019s hand was in the cogs. We say that the defendant\u2019s cause can have suffered no material harm from the rulings under consideration, for, in the first place, several other witnesses preceding the one in question had testified to the,same effect, i. e., that they had heard Cochran make the admissions, and, in the second place, the testimony given by the latter concerning the movements of the injured man just prior to the accident, if believed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>the jury, would not of necessity have convicted or even reasonably have tended to convict the plaintiff of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\">When the manner of doing a particular act is obviously negligent, testimony which goes to show that others have done it in the same way may be properly refused as irrelevant; but admitting this general rule, we cannot say that reversible error was committed in allowing certain of plaintiff\u2019s fellow-workmen to testify that \u201cWhen the ends of the scrap protruded over the ends of the boxes\u201d and \u201cthe box was not full,......they would double the scrap together and then take it out of the box and put it into the box on the truck,\u201d for the purpose of showing the usual manner in which such work was done in the defendant\u2019s mill; for, as already stated, this manner of doing the work cannot be said to have been obviously negligent. As to the last assignment of error we need only say that the refusal to allow the question put to one of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses on cross-examination concerning the location of the scrap box at which the plaintiff was working, could have done the defendant no material harm. The witness had not located the box in his direct examination; furthermore, its location does not appear to have been a point in dispute, and if in dispute it was sufficiently fixed by other testimony in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The assignments of error are all overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
