Fry Glass Company is engaged in the manufacture and sale of glassware, including among other articles what are known as \u201cpressed glass blanks for cutting,\u201d and the said company is the owner of certain letters patent for processes, tools and apparatus which are used in the polishing of the interior surfaces of. the articles mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-7\">2. That the McKee Glass Company is also engaged in the manufacture and sale of glassware; that the aforesaid companies, parties hereto, on the 9th June, 1910, entered into a written agreement, under which, subject to certain terms and conditions specified therein, a license was granted to the defendant company to use in the manufacture of pressed glass blanks for cutting the methods and apparatus described in the letters patents aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-8\">3. That a copy of said instrument of writing is attached to the bill filed in this case. It recites: \u201cAnd whereas in certain suits in equity heretofore brought in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>District of Pennsylvania against the licensee (and its predecessors) for infringement of certain letters patents .:____it has been adjudged and decreed by the said court that each and all of said last-named letters patents are in all respects good and valid in law, and that the said defendants have infringed the same, and the said licensee has been enjoined from any further infringement thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-6\">4. That the said instrument of writing, in paragraph three, provides further as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-7\">\u201cAll pressed glass blanks for cutting which shall be sold or otherwise disposed of by the licensee during the term of this license, or which shall be used by it in the manufacture of cut glassware, shall be subjected, prior to such sale or use, to a finishing operation involving the practice of some one or more of the inventions described and claimed in some one or more of the said letters patent, or other letters patent which may hereafter be obtained and made subject to the provisions hereof. ......The rights herein granted are expressly limited\u00bb to the practice of the invention hereby covered in the manufacture of pressed glass blanks for cutting, to be sold only to cutting houses for use in the manufacture of cut glassware; and it is understood that the practice of any of said inventions by the licensee in finishing glassware to be put upon the market without Cutting, otherwise known as pressed glassw\u00e1re, or sold to other than cutting houses, will be an infringement of the letters patent therefor and a violation of the injunctions heretofore issued as above recited; it being the intention and purpose of this license that the said patented inventions shall not be used by the licensee in the manufacture of \u201cimitation cut glassware\u201d or other pressed glassware. By \u201cblanks for cutting\u201d is meant blanks which are not put upon the market until the entire pattern pressed on the exterior of said blanks has been cut over and finished by the implements used in the manufacture of what is Commonly called \u201ccut glass.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>5.

That the plaintiff alleges that the defendants have violated that portion of the contract set forth in the third paragraph in that since the acceptance of the said license they have advertised and sold pressed blanks for cutting which were not subjected prior to such sale to a finishing operation involving the practice of some one or more of the inventions described and claimed in the letters patent aforesaid; that such sales have been at lower prices than those specified in said instrument; that no accounting has been made of such sales, and that by reason of such violation of the terms of the license the plaintiff company has been greatly damaged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-4\">7. That the defendants deny that they have violated as set forth above or in any way the provisions of the license; that blanks for cutting as provided in the agreement, were not advertised or sold until they had been subjected to a finishing operation involving the use of some of the said inventions; that \u201cpressed glass blanks for cutting\u201d is a trade term which only includes those made from \u201clead glass\u201d; that before and since the agreement of 9th June, 1910, it has been the custom of the McKee Glass Company to make and sell commercial articles of different designs, sizes, shapes and patterns manufactured from \u201clime glass,\u201d without making use of any of the inventions described in the said letters patents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-5\">8. That the words \u201cpressed glass blanks for cutting\u201d found in the agreement are used in the trade sense and include such only as are made from lead glass.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-6\">CONCLUSIONS OF LAW.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-7\">1. As it has been found that \u201cblanks for cutting\u201d mean only such as are made from lead glass, the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>ants did not violate the contract by selling blanks made from lime glass without first subjecting them to the finishing operation of plaintiff\u2019s inventions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-4\">2. That the license bearing date 9th June 1910, by its terms and conditions covers only \u201cblanks for cutting\u201d made from lead glass.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-5\">3. That the bill be dismissed at plaintiff\u2019s cost.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-6\">DISCUSSION.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-7\">The investigation has taken a wide range and much testimony has been introduced. The issue, however, is readily understood as there is only one material fact in dispute and the case turns briefly on a question of law. The contract, which is called a license, provides that all pressed glass blanks for cutting which shall be used or sold by the licensee shall be subjected to a finishing operation by some of the methods covered by the letters patent issued to the licensor. All blanks made out of lead glass were subjected to the operation required by the contract; they were sold at the scheduled prices and an accounting was made therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-8\">The defendants, however, sold other blanks for cutting at lower prices than those specificed in the instrument and without subjecting them to the finishing process required by the contract. Such blanks were made out of lime glass. The defendants contend that the sale of blanks made out of lime glass was not in violation of the contract. Such contention is resisted by the plaintiff company and hence the whole case turns on the construction of the contract and the meaning of the words \u201cpressed glass blanks for cutting.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-9\">If would seem that there should be no trouble about the interpretation of this contract. It sets forth with reasonable clearness, although with some waste of words, the understanding of the parties. It provides that \u201call pressed glass blanks for cutting\u201d shall be subjected to the finishing process; To one unfamiliar with the terms used in the glass trade, it would appear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>this provision should give rise to no misunderstanding. The language is plain and comprehensive. If we should read no farther than the first clause of the third paragraph it would seem plain that the licensee could not sell any kind of a pressed glass blank for cutting unless subjected to the finishing operation provided in the contract. As we read on, however, it is also plain that such was not the meaning intended because it is expressly provided \u201cthat the said patented inventions shall not be used by the licensee in the manufacture of \u2018imitation cut glassware\u2019 or other pressed glassware.\u201d The whole idea was to confine the use of the inventions to the finishing of glass articles from which \u201ccut glass\u201d was made. The contract distinctly recognizes the possibility of applying the inventions to other uses and, therefore, prohibits their use in the manufacture of \u201cimitation cut glassware.\u201d This is further evident from the condition prescribed in regard to the sale of blanks as follows: \u201cAll blanks purchased under this agreement are sold subject to the express condition that they shall not be re-sold until they have been converted into the product known as cut glass.\u201d The contract did not prohibit the licensee from manufacturing and selling ordinary pressed glassware or imitation cut glassware. The only restriction was that' the patented inventions should not be used \u201cin the manufacture of imitation cut glassware or other pressed glassware.\u201d The evidence shows that the inventions were not used in the manufacture of imitation cut glassware. The licensee continued to make and sell pressed glassware from which was made the imitation cut glass. And in plain language the right to do so is recognized in the contract itself. Prior to the time of the contract the imitation of cut glass was not much of a. success. Since that time by a new process an article is produced which only an expert can distinguish from genuine cut glass. The plaintiff complains that the glassware thus sent out is not subjected to the operation provided in the contract but such complaint is not justi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>fled as the contract expressly prohibits such use of the inventions. The contract must be enforced to carry out the intention of the parties at the time it was made and not changed to meet new conditions which have arisen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-4\">The contract further sets forth that \u201cby \u2018blanks for cutting\u2019 is meant blanks which are not put upon the market until the entire pattern pressed on the exterior of said blanks has been cut over and finished by the implements used in the manufacture of what is commonly called \u2018cut glass.\u2019 \u201d Thus showing that the whole purpose of the agreement was to require the use of the inventions only on blanks which were used in the manufacture of \u201ccut glass\u201d and to prohibit their use on blanks used in the manufacture of \u201cimitation cut glass.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-5\">On the theory that the meaning of the contract was doubtful because of the use of technical words and trade terms much parol testimony was introduced. It must be conceded that it will require one acquainted with the glass business to define a \u201cblank\u201d or to tell what is meant by a \u201cpressed glass blank for cutting.\u201d The law does no.t define these terms and one not an expert is ignorant of their meaning. As is usual with experts we have a variety of definitions. Thus John E. Marsden, a witness for plaintiff, testifies that: \u201call glass that cutters use are termed as blanks.\u201d And Carl J. G-iometti, a witness for defendant says that: \u201cA pressed blank for cutting is a lead glass with a design pressed on it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-6\">But however the testimony may differ as to the meaning of trade terms, it is shown without contradiction that at the date of the agreement the only blanks in use for the making of cut glass were those made from lead glass. The testimony on plaintiff\u2019s side establishes such fact. Thus John E. Marsden, says: \u201cWhat is known as a lead glass blank is what has been used among cutters continuously.\u201d And there is no testimony on either side inconsistent with such statement. As blanks for cutting made from lime glass were unknown to the trade at the time the contract was signed it is not easy to imagine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>that such blanks could have been in contemplation of the parties or that it was the intention to subject such unknown articles to the finishing operation provided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-3\">From the language of the contract as already pointed out and from the conditions existing at the time of its execution, it seems plain enough that the defendants did not violate the contract when they sold blanks for cutting made from lime glass. From such blanks the commercial article known as \u201ccut glass\u201d could not be manufactured and nothing could be produced but \u201cimitation cut glassware\u201d in the manufacture of which the parties agreed the patented inventions could not be used. The evidence, therefore, failing to show any violation of the contract on the part of the defendants or any intention of violating the same, it follows that the plaintiffs have not made out a case which justifies an injunction as prayed for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-4\"><em>Error assigned </em>was decree dismissing the bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-5\"><em>Edwin W.
