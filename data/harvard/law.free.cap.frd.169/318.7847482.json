(\u201cCode-Alarm\u201d), a Michigan Corporation, and its President, Rand Mueller. Intercept alleges that Code-Alarm sold to Intercept defective \u201ckey fob\u201d controlled wireless residential and commercial alarm systems. Since the inception of this case, the parties\u2019 attorneys have been excessively and brutally at odds with one another. Discovery in this case has evolved into a foolish barrage, evidenced by the score of motions that counsel for both Intercept and Code-Alarm have filed to date, accusing one another of \u201cstone-walling.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-17\">Adding to the litany of discovery motions is Intercept\u2019s present motion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to: (1) compel further production of documents; (2) award Intercept all costs and fees associated with seeking this motion; (3) order that Code-Alarm be precluded from using or referring to any non-privileged document which is not produced forthwith and which falls within the scope of Intercept\u2019s document requests; (4) dismiss Code-Alarm\u2019s counter-claims with prejudice, and; (5) hold Code-Alarm in contempt of this court\u2019s May 7, 1996 order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the following reasons, this court will grant in part, and deny in part, Intercept\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-18\">\n<em>I. SUMMARY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b387-19\">On August 22, 1994, Intercept served Code-Alarm with twenty-four requests for production of documents, including eight requests for documents relating to defects, problems, and complaints regarding Code-Alarm\u2019s home security systems for all Code-Alarm\u2019s customers and two requests for doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>uments referring to modifications of Code-Alarm\u2019s home security system. After first objecting, defense counsel indicated a willingness to comply with the request. On October 23, 1995, Code-Alarm partially complied, but failed to produce a number of relevant documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">For instance, Code-Alarm did not tender even one document evidencing complaints with other customers. Rather, Code-rAlarm limited its production to records evidencing complaints Intercept made to Code-Alarm. In particular, Code-Alarm failed to furnish any \u201cReturn Authorization/Repair Order\u201d forms (\u201cRA forms\u201d) that documented returns by <em>other </em>customers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, Code-Alarm exclusively tendered RA forms documenting <em>Intercept </em>returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Code-Alarm\u2019s production was deficient in other respects. For example, Code-Alarm produced a mere three pages of a log entitled \u201cUpdates and Changes.\u201d This log records the form numbers for two forms: \u201cUpdates and Changes\u201d forms<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and \u201cEngineering Change Order\u201d reports<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (\u201cEO reports\u201d). As for the Updates and Changes forms and EO reports which are tracked in the Updates and Changes log, Code-Alarm has not produced any of these forms either.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">On April 1, 1996, Intercept, in pursuit of additional documents, filed a motion to compel further production. The motion was duly granted, and this court ordered Code-Alarm to produce all non-privileged requested documents within 30 days. The court further ordered Code-Alarm to pay Intercept up to $1,000.00 for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. To date, Code-Alarm has meagerly responded to this court\u2019s order compelling production of documents. Moreover, Code-Alarm has blatantly disregarded this court\u2019s order to pay the monetary sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">\n<em>II. ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b388-14\">Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, Intercept requests that this court order Code-Alarm to further produce documents, hold Code-Alarm in contempt, and sanction Code-Alarm. Intercept requests that this court sanction Code-Alarm by precluding Code-Alarm from introducing any new documents at trial, dismissing Code-Alarm\u2019s counterclaims, and awarding Intercept all costs and fees associated with seeking such documents.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-15\">First, Intercept contends that Code-Alarm is intentionally withholding documents. Intercept claims that third parties have provided Intercept with documents that clearly fall within the confines of Intercept\u2019s original document request to Code-Alarm, which Code-Alarm has not produced. Intercept also asserts that Code-Alarm is destroying documents. Intercept points to deposition testimony of a former Code-Alarm senior RF Engineer, David Scruggs, who stated that records of another, project engineer mysteriously disappeared one day from a Code-Alarm office. Additionally, Intercept maintains that Code-Alarm, in general, and Janet Slagle,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in particular, conducted an improper search. According to Intercept, Slagle contacted a mere five individuals in her endeavor to gather documents, and failed to approach key Code-Alarm employees for this purpose. Also, Slagle is seemingly unaware of any document control department institut<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>ed at Code-Alarm, and therefore, has not searched such a department.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Lastly, Intercept argues that Slagle has confined her search to \u201cdead storage\u201d areas, overlooking locations such as Vice-President of Engineering, Peter Stouffer\u2019s two homes<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and his personal storage facility in Dearborn, Michigan.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">In its defense, Code-Alarm maintains that \u201cthousands of documents\u201d have been produced, boldly professes that \u201c[a]bsolutely no documents have been damaged, hidden, destroyed or withheld on account of the instant lawsuit,\u201d and avers that <em>all </em>feasible locations have been probed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Code-Alarm explains that documents which have not yet been provided were either damaged or destroyed during the physical relocation of the home security department in early 1993, or that integral ex-employees of Code-Alarm \u201cwere in possession of many documents.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Furthermore, Code-Alarm insists that Intercept\u2019s request for production is ambiguous. Code-Alarm argues that Intercept\u2019s request for relevant documents is unreasonably broad and Intercept has not specifically identified any document(s) being withheld. In any event, Code-Alarm asserts, even assuming arguendo that Code-Alarm has not produced relevant documents, nevertheless Intercept\u2019s request for dismissal of Code-Alarm\u2019s counter-claims is inappropriate because Intercept has not introduced a scintilla of evidence suggesting \u201cfoul play\u201d on the part of Code-Alarm. In turn, Code-Alarm argues that Intercept\u2019s motion for sanctions is, in itself, sanctionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\n<em>a. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b) discusses the ramifications of failing to comply with a court discovery order, such as this court\u2019s May 7, 1996 order compelling Code-Alarm to produce documents. Rule 37(b)(2) delineates \u00e1 wide array of sanctions which a court may impose for such failure, including an order prohibiting the disobedient party from introducing designated matters into evidence, an order striking out pleadings, and an order holding the recalcitrant party in contempt. The court has broad discretion to order one or more \u201cjust\u201d sanctions as provided for in Rule 37, and thus, can tailor the imposition of sanctions to the facts of a particular case. Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b)(2); <em>Regional Refuse Systems v. Inland Reclamation Co., </em>842 F.2d 150, 153 (6th Cir.1988); <em>Shelton v. American Motors Corp., </em>805 F.2d 1323, 1329-30 (8th Cir.1986) (cited in <em>Baker v. General Motors Corp., </em>159 F.R.D. 519 (W.D.Mo.1994)); 8A C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; R. Marcus, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 2289 (2d ed. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">In fact, Rule 37(b) provides for the draconian sanction of dismissal when a party\u2019s failure to comply with an order of a court is attributable to \u201cwillfulness, bad faith, or any fault\u201d of the party. <em>Societe Internationale Pour Participations Industrielles et Commerciales, S.A. v. Rogers, </em>357 U.S. 197, 212, 78 S.Ct. 1087, 1096, 2 L.Ed.2d 1255 (1958); <em>Regional Refuse Systems, </em>842 F.2d at 153; <em>Bass v. Jostens, Inc., </em>71 F.3d 237, 241 (6th Cir.1995) (defining \u201cwillful violation\u201d as \u201cconscious and intentional failure to comply with the court order\u201d). \u201cThe use of dismissal as a sanction for failing to comply with discovery has been upheld because it accomplishes the dual purpose of punishing the offending party and deterring similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>litigants from such misconduct.\u201d <em>Bass, </em>71 F.3d at 241 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The burden is on the noncomplying party to show that the failure was due to inability and not to willfulness, bad faith, or fault. <em>Regional Refuse Systems, </em>842 F.2d at 154. The rationale behind this presumption is that, \u201cif a party has the ability to comply with a discovery order and does not, dismissal is not an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, </em>427 U.S. 639, 642-43, 96 S.Ct. 2778, 2780-81, 49 L.Ed.2d 747 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">In addition to whether non-cooperation with a discovery order is willful, the Sixth Circuit has identified three other factors a court should consider when deciding whether dismissal is warranted. The three factors are: (1) whether the adversary was prejudiced by the party\u2019s failure to cooperate in discovery; (2) whether the non-compliant party was warned of the possibility of dismissal, and; (3) whether less drastic sanctions should be imposed. <em>Bass, </em>71 F.3d at 241; <em>Regional Refuse Systems, </em>842 F.2d at 155; <em>Bank One of Cleveland, N.A. v. Abbe, </em>916 F.2d 1067, 1073 (6th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\n<em>b. Whether Code-Alarm Should be Compelled to Further Produce Documents</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">This court finds that for over one year, Code-Alarm has flagrantly avoided Intercept\u2019s document requests. Intercept originally served Code-Alarm with straight-forward and reasonable document requests in August, 1995. Discussions between Code-Alarm and Intercept regarding perceived deficiencies in Code-Alarm\u2019s document production have been entirely fruitless. Indeed, even this court\u2019s order has not resolved the long-standing document discovery dispute because Intercept is presently before this court requesting the exact same documents (e.g. RA forms, EO reports) it requested six months ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">The justifications Code-Alarm has provided this court for its non-compliance are untenable. First, Code-Alarm argues that documents were lost during the relocation of the home security department. While this may be true for documents dated prior to 1993, this does not explain Code-Alarm\u2019s failure to produce any RA forms from other customers dated late-1993 or 1995 and only four such forms dated 1994.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Also, this excuse seems dubious in light of the fact that the majority of RA forms for other customers that Code-Alarm produced (33 out of a total of 41 such forms) are dated 1992, <em>prior </em>to the move. Moreover, the move does not justify Code-Alarm\u2019s total failure to produce EO reports and other pages from the \u201cUpdates and Changes\u201d log.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">Code-Alarm\u2019s argument that employees who left the company are responsible for Code-Alarm\u2019s failure to produce documents is equally unavailing. Code-Alarm does not expound on this justification. Why are Code-Alarm\u2019s ex-employees responsible for such a tremendous loss of documents? This court finds it incredible that Code-Alarm would allow key employees to depart with important documents, or that every employee hid, lost or destroyed documents before he or she left. Moreover; Code-Alarm does not provide the name of even one so-called \u201cintegral\u201d former employee who was in possession of the documents at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">For all the foregoing reasons, this court has arrived at the inescapable conclusion that Code-Alarm is withholding documents from Intercept. This court\u2019s conclusion is bolstered by the fact that Code-Alarm, in the past, has denied the existence of documents and then later was able to produce a smattering of them. Indeed, the overwhelming evidence is contrary to Code-Alarm\u2019s averment that all locations were searched and all documents have been produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-14\">This court also finds Intercept\u2019s document requests to be clear. At the very least, Intercept seeks the following documents: (1) RA forms for other customers dated 1993\u2014 1995; (2) EO reports dated 1992-1995; and (3) pages from the Updates and Changes log. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Accordingly, Code-Alarm shall search<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> files and records of all employees who could be in possession of the requested documents, and produce such documents within 20 days. Code-Alarm shall be precluded from introducing <em>any </em>new document which has not been produced to Intercept prior to or pursuant to this order, which falls within Intercept\u2019s document requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Under the circumstances, sanctions are warranted. Code-Alarm is ordered to pay costs of this motion, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, in the amount of $2000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">c. <em>Whether Code-Alarm\u2019s CounterClaims Should be Dismissed</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Intercept argues that Code-Alarm\u2019s counter-claims should be dismissed as a sanction for Code-Alarm\u2019s failure to produce documents. As aforementioned, in determining whether a recalcitrant party\u2019s claims should be dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b), the court must consider four factors: (1) the willfulness of the disobedient party; (2) the prejudice to the adversary; (3) whether the non-compliant party was warned; and (4) whether less drastic sanctions should be imposed. <em>Bass, </em>71 F.3d at 241. Each factor will be discussed in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">This court finds Code-Alarm\u2019s failure to produce various documents willful. Code-Alarm has had more than ample time to respond to the requests, but has scantily complied. Code-Alarm\u2019s excuses for noncompliance are untenable and Code-Alarm\u2019s assertion that the documents are missing, damaged or 'destroyed is highly dubious. The justifications Code-Alarm has provided do not rebut the presumption that their noncompliance is willful.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">It is undeniable that Intercept is being prejudiced by this failure to cooperate in discovery. While it is true that the information is necessary for Intercept to prepare its case against Code-Alarm, it is equally true that much of the requested material is relevant to the merits of Code-Alarm\u2019s compulsory counter-claims (e.g. interference with business relations, slander <em>per se, </em>and misrepresentation). Particularly, Intercept needs this information to properly understand the nature and extent of Code-Alarm\u2019s counter-claims and to be able to prepare a defense or enter settlement negotiations. In short, Intercept is entitled to much of the information requested and needs that information to prepare an informed defense in a timely manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">With regard to the third factor, Code-Alarm has not been warned by this court that failure to comply with its discovery order could result in dismissal of the case. Code-Alarm partially responded to this court\u2019s order, but the order itself does not mention any sanctions for failure to comply. Certainly, the federal rules permit this court' to dismiss for failure to comply. This court, however, has not given any explicit notice to Code-Alarm. This factor counsels against dismissal at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">As for the fourth factor, this court finds that it is inappropriate, at this time, to dismiss Code-Alarm\u2019s thirteen counter-claims to force Code-Alarm to comply with Intercept\u2019s document requests. Less severe sanctions are warranted (e.g. Code-Alarm, at the very least, must pay the costs Intercept incurred in bringing this motion). This court is generously affording Code-Alarm one final opportunity to produce the requested documents. To be sure, if Code-Alarm refuses to comply with this order, this court will unhesitantly dismiss all of Code-Alarm\u2019s counterclaims against Intercept with prejudice. Thus, this order serves as an admonition to Code-Alarm that failure to comply with this court\u2019s order will result in dismissal of its action against Intercept.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">\n<em>d. Whether Code-Alarm Should be Held in Contempt for Failing to Pay Intercept $1000</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b391-15\">Intercept argues that Code-Alarm is in contempt of this court\u2019s May 7,1996 order. Intercept contends that Code-Alarm refused to pay Intercept\u2019s costs, as the order directed. The order reads in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Plaintiff has made a good faith effort to obtain this discovery prior to filing the [April 1, 1996] motion. Plaintiff shall notify defendants and the court of the appropriate costs within ten days of this order. Defendant Code-Aarm shall pay the amount owed, <em>not to exceed $1,000, </em>to plaintiff within ten days of being notified of the precise amount owed. <em>If such payment is not timely made, plaintiff shall notify this court and defendant Code-Alarm will be held in contempt of court, with appropriate sanctions.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">On May 17, 1996, Intercept notified this court and Code-Aarm that its costs amounted to $1,398.00. Therefore, Code-Aarm was to pay Intercept $1,000.00 within ten days of such notification. Code-Aarm refused to pay $1000.00 to Intercept, choosing instead to construe imaginatively this court\u2019s order. In particular, Code-Aarm read into the order the ability to assess the reasonableness of the costs on its own, and pay an amount it, alone, determined to be reasonable. Certainly, the language of the order clearly provides for <em>no </em>such independent assessment by Code-Aarm. Quite the contrary, the court had already determined that sanctions in any amount up to, and including $1000.00 on the nose, to be reasonable and warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Accordingly, this court finds CodeAarm in contempt of the May 7, 1996 order to pay Intercept\u2019s costs of bringing the April 1,1996 motion. Code-Aarm shall pay Intercept $1000.00, plus interest from the date of June 1, 1996 at the federal pre-judgment interest rate. Aso, as Code-Aarm\u2019s conduct has caused substantial and unnecessary burdens to be visited upon this court, this court will order that Code-Aarm pay into the Clerk of this court, within ten days of this Order, the sum of two-hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00) as a sanction for its contempt. The factors that have guided this court in determining the appropriate amount for Code-Aarm\u2019s contumacious conduct in this case are the following: (1) the conduct was deliberately performed; (2) the conduct has caused a completely unnecessary burden upon the time and resources of this court; (3) there is a need to deter Code-Aarm, and other litigants and counsel from similarly obstructive conduct, and (4) the sanction avoids undue punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">\n<em>e. Code-Alarm\u2019s Failure to Pay Michael Macdonald\u2019s Plane Fare</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">This court deems it necessary to address one other matter that has been the source of significant dissension among the parties in this case. On June 5, 1996, this court ordered Code-Aarm to pay the airfare for Intercept\u2019s President, Michael Macdonald, to enable him to attend the deposition of Code-Aarm\u2019s President, Rand Mueller. Apparently, Macdonald used a flight coupon, and thus, Code-Aarm argued it did not have to pay Macdonald. Athough CodeAarm\u2019s construction of the June 5, 1996 order is not wholly irrational, this court construes the order as requiring Code-Aarm to pay Macdonald the reasonable value of his flight in the event he used a flight coupon. Thus, the court orders Intercept to submit and Code-Aarm to pay the reasonable value of airfare, assuming two weeks advance notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">\n<em>III. CIVILITY OF COUNSEL</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">Athough this order reprimands and sanctions Code-Aarm for its inexcusable delay in producing the requested documents and refusal to pay court-ordered sanctions, it is clear to this court that Intercept, at times, has been equally defiant of Code-Aarm\u2019s requests. Counsel have persisted in a course of interminable bickering and have shown one another a complete lack of courtesy. Undeniably, the reputation of the legal professional suffers when counsel behave in this impeding fashion. Moreover, counsels\u2019 continual and repetitious resort to this court to resolve petty disputes is thwarting this court\u2019s effort at achieving an efficient administration of justice. Counsels\u2019 attention was directed to the Eastern District of Michigan Civility Principles at the October 9, 1996 hearing on this matter. For the benefit of all, this court has attached a copy of the Civility Principles which should be thoroughly examined. Hereinafter, this court expects counsel to act in accordance therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Code-Alarm search files and records of all employees who could be in possession of the requested documents, and produce such documents within 20 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Code-Alarm shall be precluded from introducing any new document which has not been produced to Intercept prior to or pursuant to this order, which falls within Intercept\u2019s document requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Code-Alarm shall pay the costs of this motion, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, in the amount of $2000.00.

Code-Alarm's Production Manager, Alberta Miller, testified that a document control department was organized in November, 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b389-8\">. Stouffer has a home in Clarkston, Michigan and Paris, France.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b389-9\">. At his deposition on June 6, 1996, Stouffer testified that documents could be stored at Code-Alarm's corporate headquarters and annex in Detroit, or Stouffer's homes in Clarkston, Michigan and Paris, France, or a storage facility in Dearborn, Michigan or Code-Alarm's facilities in Austin, Texas and Paris, France.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b389-12\">. Code-Alarm submitted the affidavits of Stouffer and Engineering Manager, John Gillespie, stating that they have searched for documents at all locations and facilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b389-13\">. Code-Alarm does not elaborate on why integral employees who are no longer employed by Code-Alarm are responsible for any loss, damage or destruction of documents. Presumably, Code-Alarm is arguing that ex-employees took the documents with them upon their departure, or hid or destroyed them prior to parting with Code-Alarm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b390-9\">. Code-Alarm has produced 33 RA forms dated 1992 from other customers, four RA forms dated 1994 from other customers and no RA forms dated late-1993 or 1995 for other customers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b391-10\">.
