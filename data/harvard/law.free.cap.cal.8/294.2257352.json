On the trial, the plaintiff introduced in evidence a certified copy of a grant from T. M. Leavenworth, former alcalde of San Francisco, to W. C. Parker, (the loss of the original having been established) and sundry mesne conveyances from Parker to himself; he also established a continuous possession and occupation of said Parker and his grantees, down to the time of his eviction by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-12\">The defendant relied upon a deed from the Board of Land Commissioners, made in pursuance of the act of May, 18, 1853.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-13\">The jury before whom the case was. tried, brought in a ver- \u2022 diet for five hundred dollars damages, in addition to finding generally for the plaintiff.

Sess. Laws, 1851, p. 809, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-7\">The grant from Leavenworth to Parker, was filed with the clerk of the county of San Francisco, and recorded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-8\">The word \u201crecorder,\u201d in the act, must have been intended for \u201c clerk,\u201d and a thing within the intention of the. act, is within its meaning, as much as if within its letter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-9\">The original grant was proved to have been lost, and a certified copy was properly admitted in evidence. See see. 3, of same act, p. 309, Laws of 1851.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-10\">But if the Court should be of the opinion that the grant was not properly recorded, yet the title being originally in the State, was by the act of March 26, 1851, transferred to the city of San Francisco. If so, the defendant, by virtue of his deed from the \u201cState Land Commissioners,\u201d only required the right to the possession of the lot, after the expiration of ninety-nine years, from March 1851. See act authorizing sale water lots\u2014Laws of 1858, p. 210, et. seq.; in taking possession of the lot therefore, he was a mere trespasser.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-11\">This Court has frequently decided, that a party can recover on the ground of prior possession, as against a trespasser, and without showing title in himself. McCarren et al. <em>v. </em>O\u2019Connell et al., Jan. T., 1857; Winans et al. <em>v. </em>Christy, 4 Cal., 70.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-12\">Title in a third person will not prevail, as against a mere trespasser, without connecting himself with that title. See Winans et al. <em>v. </em>Christy et al., above cited.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b309-13\">Terry, C. J., after stating the facts, delivered the opinion of the Court\u2014Burnett, J., concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"b309-14\">The defendant relies upon a deed executed by the Board of. Land Commissioners, by virtue of an act passed May 18th, 1853. At the time when Leavenworth made the grant to Parker, the pueblo of San Francisco had no title whatever to the water property: it belonged to the United States, who held it in trust for any new State that might be erected out of said territory, and passed to the State of California on her admission, by virtue of her sovereignty. The grant was therefore a nullity. On the twenty-sixth of March, 1851, the Legislature passed an act grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>ing to the city of San Francisco, for the term of ninety-nine years, certain property known as the beach and water-lot property, of which this is a part. The acvt contained a reservation, in favor of-those claimJog tinder alcalde grants and city sales. Such titles were confirmed to the then holders, provided such conveyances were registered or recorded in some book of record on or before the third of April, 1850, which book was in the possession and under the control of the recorder of- San Francisco, at the date of the passage of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">There is no evidence that the grant to Parker was ever so recorded. A copy of the petition and grant was admitted in evidence, certified by John E. Addison, county clerk, on the seventh of June, 1850, to be a correct copy of the original record at that time in his office. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The law requires, that the grant should be recorded in a book in the recorder\u2019s office, or a book kept by and under the control of the recorder, and not of the county clerk. But even if there were some mistake about this, the certificate does not state that such grant was of record on the third of April, 1850.'</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">It may very well be, that the original grant Was on the record in the county clerk\u2019s office, at the date of the certificate, and still not recorded at the time and in the mode pointed out by the statute. The plaintiff having failed to make out a title under the Water-Lot Act, is driven to his prior possession, which is sufficiently established to enable him to recover, unless the deed executed to defendant, by the San Francisco Land Commissioners should be held valid. \u25a0 \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">The Water-Lot Act, gives to the city all the lands within certain boundaries, except such as have been granted or sold in a certain Manner. The grant of the lot in question, not having been recorded as required, it necessarily follows that it passed to the city, and that the Commissioners had no power to sell any other than the reversionary interest of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">It is urged, that the testimony shows that the defendant's tenant is in possession of a part of the property, and that he should have been joined. The record discloses the fact, that the defendant was in possession of the entire property at the commencement of the suit; even if he was not, the objection comes too late, after having come in and defended, he cannot-complain of the judgment. Whether his tenant can be dispossessed without having been made a party, is a question with which he has no concern. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">The Court below had a perfect right to require the plaintiff to remit a portion of the damages. It has been repeatedly held, that.this power was within the discretion of the Court; and its exercise has been encouraged.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
