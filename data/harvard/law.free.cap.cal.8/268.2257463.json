Belt <em>v. </em>Davis, 1 Cal., 134; Burnett <em>v. </em>Kilburne, 3 Cal., 327; Bucklew <em>v. </em>Chipman, Oct. T., 1855; Gray <em>v. </em>Eaton, Oct. T., 1855.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-7\">It is not necessary that the bill should be filed in the Court where the judgment at law was rendered. It may as well be filed in the District Court of another district.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-8\">Considerations of comity have no just application to the question\u2014for the Court rendering the judment at law, has no relations whatever to the proceeding. The decree does not act upon its records, nor does it contain any mandate directed to the Judge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-9\">The ground of the jurisdiction is, that a Court of Equity has power to act upon the person <em>JEIquitas agit in personam. </em>Though it cannot affect the judgment by direct action, still, it can bind the conscience of the party in regard to the judgment. The established form of decree is, that the party enter into a rule for a new trial in the Court in which the judgment remains, or that he be perpetually enjoined from taking out execution on the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-10\">On the maxim before quoted, <em>(\u00c6quitas agit in </em>personam,) Courts of Equity may compel the specific performance of contracts respecting land abroad. Sto. Eq., vol. 2, \u00a7 743; Toller <em>v. </em>Cartaret, 2 Vern., 495; Sutton <em>v. </em>Fowler, 9 Paige, 280.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-11\">On the same principle, they have power to stay proceeedings in the Courts of foreign countries, though nothing is clearer than that the Courts of one country cannot exercise any control or superintending authority over those of another country. 2 Sto. Eq., \u00a7 899, and the cases cited in the note; 2 Paige, 606, Mitchell <em>v. </em>Bame.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-12\">Again, <em>\u201c </em>comity \u201d has no application, except as between sovereignties ; it is inapplicable as between the tribunals of a particular country, when the jurisdiction of each is defined by law. 1 Bouvier L. D., Tit. Comity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-13\">Assuming that Courts of Equity have the jurisdiction claimed over the particular subject-matter presented, the only question that can by possibility be started, of a jurisdictional character, is a question of <em>venue, </em>and that is settled by the Practice Act, in favor of \u201c the county in which the parties, or some of them, reside at the commencement of the action.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-14\">Or if there was a mistake in the venue, then the party should have moved for a change; not having done so, the mistake must be considered as waived. 2 Code R., 118, Millingham <em>v. </em>Brophy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>This loss of right was by an \u201c accident,\" viz.: the accident of adjournment. Sto. Eq., \u00a7\u00a7 78, 79.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-5\">But admitting that there was negligence, still a Court of Equity has power to grant a new trial on the iniquity of judgment. Maine Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Hodgson, 7 Cranch, 332; 3 Cal., 464.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b284-6\"><em>E. W. F. Sloan </em>for Respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-7\">I do not contend that a bill for relief after trial at law, might not be filed in another Court,'but there are many reasons why such practice should not be encouraged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-8\">But it is said that if there was negligence, yet because of the inequitable character of the judgment, chancery will relieve.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-9\">The case of Maine Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Hodgson, 7 Cranch, 332, is scarcely applicable. In that case, a defence, was sought to be made available in equity, which it was competent for a Court of Equity to enforce, and the question was, whether the defence was one equally available at law, and there had been a trial at law, a Court of Equity would then interpose, and the relief was denied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-10\">\u201c The rule is, says Chancellor Kent, that chancery will not relieve against a judgment at law, on the ground of its being contrary to equity, unless the defendant in the judgment was ignorant of the fact in question, pending the suit, or it could not have been received as a defence, or unless he was prevented from availing himself of the defence by fraud or accident, or the act of the opposite party, unmixed with negligence or fault on his part.\u201d Foster <em>v. </em>Wood, 6 J. Ch. R., 89.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-11\">\u201cIt would be establishing a grievous precedent, and one of great public inconvenience, to interfere in any other case than one of indispensable necessity, and wholly free from any kind of negligence.\u201d Per Ch. Kent, on bill for new trial in Floyd <em>v. </em>Jayne, 6 J. Ch. R. 479.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-12\">\u201c The defendant cannot come here for a new trial, where no special ground of fraud or surprise is suggested, and wjien he neglects or omits due diligence, and without due excuse, to defend himself in his proper place; this is a fundamental doctrine of this Court.\u201d Barker <em>v. </em>Elkins, 1 J. Ch. R., 464.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-13\">\u201c Relief cannot be had here for the purpose of a new trial when the party has lost his opportunity at law by his own negligence.\u201d Dodge <em>v. Strong, </em>2 J. Ch. R., 229.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b284-14\">Burnett, J., delivered the opinion of the Court\u2014Terry, C. J., concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"b284-15\">This is a bill in equity for a new trial, in an action of ejectment, on the ground of excessive damages, the remedy by motion for a new trial having been lost, without the fault, as is alleged, of the plaintiff. The ejectment suit was <em>tried in </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Third District Court, and this bill is filed in the Fourth District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">We decided in the late case of Ricketts and Wife <em>v. </em>Johnson and others, that a Court of co-ordinate jurisdiction could not entertain proceedings to restrain the judgments of another. The plaintiffs should have proceeded before the District Court of the Third District.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
