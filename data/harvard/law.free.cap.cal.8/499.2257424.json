Judgment for defendants, and plaintiff appeals to the County Court, where a trial <em>de novo </em>is had, and judgment rendered for plaintiff, and against defendant, Samuel Keiser, for the posssession of the premises, and treble damages. Defendant moves for a new trial, which being denied, he took this appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-14\">The evidence on the trial in the County Court shows, that Samuel Keiser had used a portion of the premises in dispute, about two months before plaintiff's purchase, and claimed the whole under an execution-sale of the premises, as the property of one Morrison, through whom plaintiff derived his title. And at the time of the sale to plaintiff, defendant had then plowed and sowed a small portion of the premises.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b513-15\"><em>Thomas &amp; Meyres </em>for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-16\">House was not peaceably in actual possession at the time of the alleged entry. He alleges that he took possession on the twenty-third of April, 1856, but the evidence shows that defendant was then in possession,' and had been from the eighteenth of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>February preceding, and that plaintiff\u2019s temporary possession, which he usurped on the day before the alleged entry, was opposed, disturbed, and obstructed, by defendant, who claimed fhe ground and held the claim adversely. Defendant was in actual possession, and plaintiff attempted to oust him, and hence the threats, force, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-5\">Defendant did not forcibly enter, which should have been shown. Frazier <em>v. </em>Hanlon, decided in this Court, July T., 1855.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-6\">Defendant entered on the eighteenth of February, 1856, and held peaceably (notwithstanding plaintiff\u2019s alleged possession on twenty-third April) till the, day before the difficulty. He then objected to plaintiff\u2019s cutting and taking the grain away, and plaintiff left with half a load. Hext day, defendant was on the inside of the fence, or enclosure, and .held, his possession, which he had a right to do; for h'e purchased the premises on the eighteenth of February, 1856, at sheriff\u2019s sale, and took possession, and the time for redemption had expired before the trial. 9 Cowen, 687.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-7\">There was no evidence to show the plaintiff was peaceably in the actual possession at the time of the alleged entry; nor that defendant forcibly entered; nor that waste and injury were done to the premises; nor that the rents and profits were of any value, and a nonsuit should have been granted. 1 Cal. R., 108.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-8\">Title to the land was necessarily involved, and ejectment was the proper action.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b514-9\"><em>Crocker &amp; Robinson </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-10\">This was an action for forcible entry and detainer. There is no objection to the pleadings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-11\">The questions of force and possession have been passed on by the jury, and there is evidence sufficient to sustain the verdict.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-12\">Section twelve of Forcible Entry Act, Cod. S., 170, gives damages for waste and injury, as well as rents and profits.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-13\">In this case, the growing crops were taken. The word \u201c injury \u201d would fully include that as damage. Webster\u2019s Dictionary, word <em>\u201c </em>injury.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-14\">Rents and -profits would also cover the crops, and it is not necessary that waste alone should accrue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-15\">The statute requiring the verdict to find the monthly value, is only directory, and does not injure the defendant, if not found. Ho one but the plaintiff could find fault.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-16\">The proceedings commenced in a Justice\u2019s Court, and will not be so strictly construed, as in a high Court. Barnes <em>v. </em>Stark, 4 Cal. R., 414-15; Statutes 1856, p. 134, subdivision 9 ; Cronise <em>v. </em>Carghill, 4 Cal., 120; Hernandez <em>v. </em>Simon, 4 Cal., 182; Ward &amp; Co. <em>v. </em>Cooney, July T., 1854.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-17\">There was no effort to raise the question of title in this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>except by defendant, who sets up and tried to prove a title by virtue of a sheriff\u2019s sale; which was wholly inadmissible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-5\">If he has any rights, he must bring a proper suit and test his right. He cannot take possession by force, or peaceably. People <em>v. </em>Godefroy, 1 Hall\u2019s Rep., Supreme Court, New York, 245, and authorities cited; People <em>v. </em>Nelson, 13 J. R., 40; 8 Cowen, 226; Jackson <em>v. </em>Fuller, 4 J. R., 215; Lane <em>v. </em>Gaskins, Jan. T., 1854.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b515-6\">Terry, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court\u2014Field, J., concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The statute <em>\u201c </em>concerning forcible entry and unlawful detain-er,\u201d is in derogation of the common law, and must be strictly construed. A party, therefore, who desires to avail himself of the summary remedy provided by this act, must bring himself clearly within its provisions. He must show a possession, <em>actual, peaceable, </em>and exclusive; a mere scrambling or interrupted possession, or the exercise of casual acts of ownership over the premises, is not sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">The record in this case does not show such possession.in the plaintiff\u2014on the contrary, the evidence raises a strong presumption that defendant\u2019s entry was made before plaintiff\u2019s right of possession accrued; and it is well settled that this action, being for injury to possession, can only be maintained by the person who was in actual possession at the time of the entry, and not by his grantee, or reversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
