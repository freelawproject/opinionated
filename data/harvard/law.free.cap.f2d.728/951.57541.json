We agree with the bankruptcy judge that, under Indiana law, it is not and affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-10\">The factual circumstances of the two cases before us do not differ significantly. In each case, an Indiana court issued a garnishment order against the debtor\u2019s wages more than ninety days prior to the debtor\u2019s filing of a chapter 7 petition in bankruptcy and the debtor\u2019s wages were garnished within the ninety-day period. Following the debtors\u2019 discharges, the trustee commenced the instant actions to recover the wages garnished as preferential transfers. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547 (1982). The bankruptcy judge held that the garnished wages did not constitute preferences. The trustee appealed, both parties agreeing to appeal directly to this court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293(b) (Supp. IV 1980); Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, Pub.L. No. 95-598, \u00a7 405(c)(2), 92 Stat. 2685; <em>In re UNR Industries, Inc., </em>725 F.2d 1111, 1114-1115 (7th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-21\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-22\">Many courts have confronted the factual situation before us here, but there is no consensus as to whether the garnishment in this situation constitutes a preferential transfer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The different results are often, though not always, attributable to varying state law because state law governs in determining when a transfer of the debtor\u2019s property has occurred. <em>See </em>cases cited <em>supra </em>note 1; 4 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 547.46 (15th ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-23\">In Indiana, the garnishee is accountable, from the day the garnishment summons is served, to the plaintiff for any money he owes to the judgment debtor. Ind.Code \u00a7 34-1-11-21 (1976). Following a hearing, a court may order, as apparently happened here, that the judgment be a continuing lien on the future income of the debtor, i.e. continuous garnishment. Ind.Code \u00a7 34-1-44-7 (1976). At the time of the garnishments at issue here, this continuing lien could not exceed 10% of the debtors\u2019 income. <em>Id. </em>In this respect, the Indiana statutes were similar to the New York statutes involved in <em>In re Riddervold, </em>647 F.2d 342 (2d Cir.1981), in that the statutes, in effect, worked a novation of 10% of the debtor\u2019s salary. Following court orders that the liens on these debtors\u2019 future income be continuous, the debtors no longer had a property interest in 10% of their future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>salaries. <em>See In re Woodman, </em>8 Bankr. 686, 688 (Bkrtcy.W.D.Wis.1981). Rather, the employers owed that portion of their salaries directly to the garnishment plaintiffs and were liable to the plaintiffs for those amounts if the wages were not withheld pursuant to the court orders. True, the employers were not liable until the wages were actually earned, but once the court orders were entered the debtors were no longer legally entitled to 10% of their future salaries. Because the court orders legally transferred 10% of the debtors\u2019 wages to the garnishment plaintiffs, there were no transfers at the time of the actual garnishments in question. The Bankruptcy Judge ruled correctly that because no transfer of the debtors\u2019 property occurred within ninety days of the filing of the petition, there was no avoidable preference in either of the cases before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-4\">The debtors argue that \u00a7 547(e)(3)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requires a different result. We disagree. This section was enacted to overrule this court\u2019s decision in <em>Grain Merchants of Indiana, Inc. v. Union Bank and Savings Co., </em>408 F.2d 209 (7th Cir.1969). Sen.Rep. No. 95-989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 89 (1978), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5787, 5875; H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 374 (1978), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5963, 6330. In <em>Grain Merchants, </em>this court held that rights acquired in accounts receivable within the preference period were not a preference when the bank\u2019s security interest in after-acquired accounts receivable was perfected more than four months prior to filing of the bankruptcy petition. Although there are factual similarities between <em>Grain Merchants </em>and the cases before us, the analogy is not perfect. The most important distinction is that under Indiana law, the debtors retained no interest in 10% of their future wages following the entry of the garnishment orders. In contrast, the filing of financing statements in <em>Grain Merchants </em>did not transfer ownership of the debtor\u2019s future accounts receivable; that debtor would acquire some rights in the future accounts receivable when the accounts receivable came into existence. Section 547(e)(3) does not come into play in this case simply because after a garnishment order providing for a continuing lien is entered in Indiana, a debtor will never acquire rights in the portion of his or her wages to be garnished in the future. Once a garnishment order has been entered by a court, the debtor\u2019s rights in 10% of his or her future wages are irrevocably transferred to the garnishment plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the order of the bankruptcy judge.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1048-11\">. <em>See, e.g., In re Riddervold, </em>647 F.2d 342 (2d Cir.1981) (applying New York law); <em>In re Certain, </em>30 B.R. 379 (Bkrtcy.D.Conn.1983); <em>In re Yamamoto, </em>21 B.R. 58 (Bkrtcy.D.Haw.1982); <em>In re TMIC Industrial Cleaning Co., </em>19 B.R. 397 (Bkrtcy.W.D.Mo.1982); <em>In re Brinker, </em>12 B.R. 936 (Bkrtcy.D.Minn.1981); <em>In re Woodman, </em>8 B.R. 686 (Bkrtcy.W.D.Wis.1981) (no preference). <em>Contra In re Stoddard, </em>23 B.R. 226 (Bkrtcy.S.D.N.Y.1982) (applying Virginia law); <em>In re Larson, </em>21 B.R. 264 (Bkrtcy.D.Utah 1982); <em>In re Walden, </em>19 B.R. 901 (Bkrtcy.E.D.Tenn.1982); <em>In re Mayo, </em>19 B.R. 630 (E.D.Va.1981); <em>In re Eggleston, </em>19 B.R. 280 (Bkrtcy.M.D.Tenn. 1982); <em>In re Evans, </em>16 B.R. 731 (Bkrtcy.N.D.
