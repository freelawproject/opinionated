Hulshizer $200 in damages and $1,795.50 in attorney\u2019s fees and expenses for Global\u2019s violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(ll) (1982). In the spring of 1982, Hulshizer received a letter from Global, dated April 14, 1982, seeking collection of a debt she owed to the University of Nebraska Hospital in the amount of $2,582.01. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act requires debt collectors to \u201cdisclose clearly in all communications made to collect a debt or to obtain information about a consumer, that the debt collector is attempting to collect a debt and that any information obtained will be used for that purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The parties agree that the required disclosures did not appear in the letter to Hulshizer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-5\">Hulshizer brought a civil action against Global for this violation under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k (1982), which allows suits to recover actual damages, additional damages up to $1,000, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1692k(a)(l), (2)(A), (3). The district court found a violation of the statute and awarded her \u201cadditional\u201d damages, attorney\u2019s fees, and expenses. Global appeals, arguing that the court\u2019s literal reading of the statute failed to consider Global\u2019s reliance on a staff letter from an attorney in the Division of Credit Practices for the Federal Trade Commission (Commission), and that the violation was unintentional and thus protected under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(c) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-6\">Although the statute does allow debt collectors to rely in good faith on \u201cany advisory opinion of the Commission\u201d in communicating with debtors, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1692k(e), the letter which it cited to the district court indicating that the statute was not designed to require disclosures in straightforward communications with the debtor is not an opinion of the Commission. The letter clearly states that it \u201crepresents the staff\u2019s present enforcement position. It is informal in nature and as such is not binding on the Commission.\u201d <em>See </em>16 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1.1-1.3 (1983). Furthermore, Global\u2019s action was intentional in that it consciously chose to follow the informal advice of a Commission staff attorney and representatives of the American Collectors Association rather than the clear language of the statute. In addition, we agree with the Ninth Circuit that reliance on the advice of counsel or a mistake about the law is not protected by the \u201c[unintentional and * * * bona fide error\u201d defense of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(c) (1982). <em>Baker v. G.C. Services Corp., </em>677 F.2d 775, 779 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-8\">The language of the statute being unambiguous and Global\u2019s disregard of that language undisputed, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
