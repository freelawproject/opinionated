The ALJ found that she has the residual functional capacity for non-supervisory light, work where bathroom facilities are readily available and applied the grids to reach a conclusion of no disability. The district court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1679-25\">The government concedes that the ALJ erred in his finding on the severity of claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1584\">*1584</page-number>ant\u2019s diarrhea and erred in applying the grids to a non-exertional impairment. <em>See Haynes v. Heckler, </em>716 F.2d 483 (8th Cir. 1983) (colon discomfort and recurrent episodes of diarrhea is a non-exertional impairment). Because the grids do not apply when claimant suffers from a non-exertional impairment that affects her ability to perform a wide range of work at a designated level of RFC, the case must be remanded for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1680-5\">VACATED and REMANDED with instructions to remand to the Secretary.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
