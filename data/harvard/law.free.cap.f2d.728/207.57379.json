Stanley S. Brotman, United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b304-10\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b304-11\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">The issue in this case is whether the filing of a lien under the Pennsylvania mechanic\u2019s lien statute, after a contractor has filed for bankruptcy, violates the automatic stay provision of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-14\">In March 1982, Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation (W-P) and Yobe Electric (Yobe) entered into a contract whereby Yobe agreed to install electrical work in W-P\u2019s plant in Monessen, Pennsylvania. To fulfill the contract, Yobe purchased a substantial quantity of electrical equipment from Graybar Electric Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-17\">On March 4, 1983, Yobe filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Later that month, Graybar served on W-P a notice of intention to file a mechanic\u2019s lien in the amount of $171,970.75, covering material Graybar furnished Yobe for installation at the W-P plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-18\">Yobe filed a complaint urging that the Bankruptcy Court strike Graybar\u2019s notice of intent to file a mechanic\u2019s lien on the ground that such a lien violated the automatic stay provision of the Bankruptcy Act by triggering W-P\u2019s right to withhold funds due to Yobe.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-19\">The bankruptcy judge asserted that the case turns primarily on the Pennsylvania statute dealing with mechanic\u2019s liens. Pa. Stat.Ann. tit. 49 \u00a7 1508 (Purdon 1965). He pointed out that under that statute the perfection of a mechanic\u2019s lien \u201crelates back\u201d to the installation of the first material, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 1508(a), and, therefore, concluded that the filing of a mechanic\u2019s lien does not violate the automatic stay provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The judge distinguished certain New Jersey cases, which held to the contrary, by noting that under New Jersey law the filing of a mechanic\u2019s lien does not necessarily relate back to a time prior to filing. <em>See e.g. Harry Brai-num, Jr., Inc. v. Shore Air Conditioning &amp; Refrigeration, Inc., </em>18 B.R. 643 (Bkrtcy.D. N.J.1982); <em>ATC Systems, Inc. v. Valairco, Inc., </em>9 B.R. 289 (Bkrtcy.D.N.J.1981). By agreement of the parties, a direct appeal was taken to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-20\">We will affirm the judgment of the Bankruptcy Court on the basis of the well-reasoned opinion of the bankruptcy judge. <em>See Yobe Electric v. Graybar Electric Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number><em>(In re Yobe Electric), </em>30 B.R. 114 (Bkrtcy. W.D.Pa.1983).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
