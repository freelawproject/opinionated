Only the temporary suspension is now in issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1610-7\">Otherson contends (1) that the fact of indictment for job-related criminality, standing alone, cannot constitute statutory \u201ccause\u201d to temporarily suspend an employee; <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (2) that such a suspension without pay, when so based, violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (3) that in Otherson\u2019s instance, temporary suspension was an unreasonable penalty, and thus did not promote the \u201cefficiency of the service.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We find these claims wanting and accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1610-19\">Our recent decision in <em>Brown v. Department of </em>Justice<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> disposes of Otherson\u2019s first two arguments. There we held that neither the Due Process Clause<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> nor any relevant statute<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> prohibits a temporary suspension without pay of a Border Patrol agent though predicated solely on a criminal indictment for job-related activity.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> With regard to Otherson\u2019s third thesis\u2014 that, under the circumstances, temporary suspension was an unreasonable penalty\u2014 our task is to determine whether MSPB has \u201c \u2018.review[ed] the agency\u2019s penalty selection to be satisfied (1) that on the charges substantiated by [MSPB] the agency\u2019s penalty is within the range allowed by law, regulation, and any applicable table of penalties, and (2) that the penalty \u201cwas based on a consideration of the relevant factors and ... there has [not] been a clear error of judgment.\u201d \u2019\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1515\">*1515</page-number>Otherson challenges the reasonableness of his suspension under the criteria established by MSPB in <em>Douglas v. Veterans </em>Administration.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> He asserts that a less severe penalty \u2014 limited duty \u2014 should have been imposed in lieu of temporary suspension. Otherson also claims that the suspension violated the principle of like penalties for like offenses because other Border Patrol agents indicted for serious crimes had simply been placed in limited-duty positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-5\"><em>Douglas </em>does refer to the importance of resorting to milder alternative sanctions when available, and to the need for consistency in penalties imposed for wrongful employee conduct.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Douglas </em>specifies, however, that the alternative should be adequate and effective to deter similar future conduct by the involved employee and others.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Douglas also declares that the principle of like penalties for like offenses does not require \u201cmathematical rigidity or perfect consistency regardless of variations in circumstances,\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and that mere \u201c <em>\u2018surface </em>consistency should be avoided.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1611-6\">In addition to these considerations, <em>Douglas </em>lists a number of equally important factors bearing on the appropriateness of a penalty.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Included are the employee\u2019s job level and type of employment, the visibility of his position, and the degree of contact with the public; the nature and seriousness of the offense, its relationship to the employee\u2019s position and responsibilities, and whether it was intentional, maliciously committed or frequently repeated; the notoriety of the crime; and any impact which the criminal episode may have upon the agency\u2019s reputation.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Douglas </em>admonishes agencies to \u201cexercise responsible judgment in each case, based on rather specific, individual considerations, rather than acting automatically on the basis of generalizations unrelated to the individual situation.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1611-17\">We think MSPB\u2019s holding that Otherson\u2019s temporary suspension was reasonable survives the test of <em>Douglas.</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>MSPB justified the disparate treatment INS accorded Otherson in comparison with other Border Patrol employees charged with violent crime<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> by noting the conspiratorial nature of the accusation against Otherson and the fact that his behavior was alleged to be \u201cplanned,\u201d \u201cbrutal,\u201d \u201csustained, repeated, and cooperative.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Although the presiding official at Otherson\u2019s hearing did find it \u201cadministratively practical\u201d for INS to place Otherson in a limited-duty position,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> that bare conclusion reflects nothing on whether a mere position transfer would suffice to deter him and others from future illegal conduct, and would satisfactorily protect INS\u2019s interests in its reputation and in avoidance of future liability<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> were any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1516\">*1516</page-number>Border Patrol agent to engage in further wrongdoing.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1612-4\">In light of the narrowness of our review authority,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> these considerations lead us to defer to MSPB\u2019s determination that an assignment of Otherson to limited duty would not substitute adequately and effectively for temporary suspension. We similarly defer to MSPB\u2019s conclusion that, because of the nature and seriousness of the crimes charged, and the absence of any alternative penalty that would have protected the employing agency\u2019s interests sufficiently, it was not unreasonable to suspend Otherson without pay pending the outcome of his criminal prosecution. Put another way, we find no \u201cclear error of judgment\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> in MSPB\u2019s decision, and its order is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1610-8\">.

GORDON, Senior District Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"akz-dedup-0\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-7\">Respectfully, I must dissent for two reasons. First, I think the majority\u2019s opinion adopts a looser standard for our review of MSPB decisions than Congress intended. Second, simply viewing the factual record in this case, I believe that petitioner\u2019s suspension was \u201can abuse of the agency\u2019s discretion,\u201d <em>Gipson v. Veterans Administration, </em>682 F.2d 1004, 1011 (D.C.Cir.1982), and was \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c)(3) (Supp. V 1981). This case admittedly involves disturbing conduct by a public employee. But this record demonstrates all too dramatically that suspensions like petitioner\u2019s may be imposed arbitrarily, and may be based on indictments that can be politically motivated or unreliable. Given how drastically an indefinite suspension without pay affects an employee\u2019s life, \u2014 and given that indicted employees are still innocent in the eyes of the law, I think such suspensions should only be sustained in the rarest of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-11\">I. Our Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"AgA\">The majority suggests that the appropriate standard of review for MSPB personnel actions is only whether there has been \u201ca clear error of judgment.\u201d. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-12\">Our authority to reverse petitioner\u2019s suspension is grounded in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c), which directs us to review agency disciplinary measures and \u201chold unlawful and set aside any agency action, findings, or conclusion found to be \u2014 (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-13\">By focusing on the statutory language authorizing reversal where there has been \u201can abuse of discretion,\u201d courts have repeatedly observed that \u201c[a] reviewing court\u2019s function in considering the appropriate sanction for employee misconduct ... is limited.\u201d <em>Gipson v. Veterans Administration, supra, </em>682 F.2d at 1011. Nevertheless, as the MSPB stated in its landmark decision in <em>Douglas v. Veterans Administration, </em>5 MSPB 313, 324-25 (1981), we are also obligated by the statute to ensure that particular sanctions can be supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d \u201c[A]n agency\u2019s adverse action \u2018decision\u2019 necessarily includes selection of the particular penalty as well as the determination that some sanction was warranted. The statute clearly requires that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1517\">*1517</page-number>all facts on which such agency decision rests must be supported by the standard of proof set out therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-4\">Thus, while it was unclear at the time of <em>Doe v. Hampton, </em>566 F.2d 265, 271 n. 15 (D.C.Cir.1977), that courts should apply the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test in reviewing adverse personnel actions, that standard was specifically adopted in 1978 in the Civil Service Reform Act. The standard now applies to all three distinct factual inquiries agencies must make in taking adverse actions. <em>Young v. Hampton, </em>568 F.2d 1253, 1264 (7th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-5\">First, agencies must establish that the employee did engage in the alleged misconduct or was indicted for a serious job-related offense. <em>Brown v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>715 F.2d 662, 663 (D.C.Cir.1983). Second, agencies must establish a nexus between the efficiency of the service and the misconduct or alleged indictable offenses. This means that agencies must establish that the conduct or alleged offenses (or indictments themselves) may reasonably be expected to interfere with job performance or with the agency\u2019s responsibilities. Third, agencies must establish that the particular adverse action proposed will promote the efficiency of the service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-11\">These determinations all may involve factual assessments, which will be subject to the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test, as well as applications of administrative judgment, which will be subject to the \u201carbitrary,\u201d \u201ccapricious,\u201d or \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standards. The determinations must be clearly articulated by the agencies and by reviewing authorities, or courts will be unable to perform their own review function. Determinations reviewable under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test must be supported by specific proof and reasoning, and so too \u201cin order to decide whether an agency\u2019s action is arbitrary or capricious, \u2018the court must consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\u2019 <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 823, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971).\u201d <em>American Optometric Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>F.T.C., </em>626 F.2d 896, 905 (D.C.Cir.1980).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1613-12\">As to what factors agencies should consider in administering particular sanctions, I would refer agencies to the lengthy list enumerated by the MSPB in <em>Douglas </em>and reproduced in the footnotes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Of course, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1518\">*1518</page-number>not all of these will be pertinent in every case. But to satisfy Congress\u2019 desire to give statutory protection against arbitrary adverse actions, agencies must include a conscientious evaluation of these factors. A sufficiently thorough evaluation should preclude unnecessary court appeals as well as allow courts like us to preserve agencies\u2019 discretion in managing their workforces.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-4\">II. Petitioner\u2019s Suspension</p>\n<p id=\"ATG\">Ironically, although the MSPB released its <em>Douglas </em>decision calling for careful evaluations while petitioner\u2019s appeal was pending before it, in actually deciding this appeal the MSPB fell far short of its <em>Douglas </em>directives. The MSPB presiding official who initially heard petitioner\u2019s appeal took a full day\u2019s testimony, wrote a careful decision, and concluded that petitioner\u2019s suspension was \u201cnot reasonably necessary\u201d and was \u201ctherefore \u2018not for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.\u2019 \u201d A.R. (Administrative Record compiled on appeal to the MSPB) at 94, quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-5\">The MSPB\u2019s entire discussion reversing the official, however, follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1614-6\">Appellants were charged with conspiracy and with the commission of several incidents of planned, brutal behavior towards aliens. The cases of other employees do not contain charges of such sustained, repeated, and cooperative behavior as was allegedly engaged in by these appellants. In view of the nature and seriousness of the charges and the direct relationship between the charges, and appellants\u2019 positions and the agency\u2019s mission, the Board finds that the indefinite suspensions were reasonably necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An6\">A.R. 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-7\">Aside from its brevity, this analysis is troublesome for several reasons. First, there is the MSPB\u2019s conclusion that indefinite suspensions were more deserved here because earlier cases involving other border guards did \u201cnot contain charges of such sustained, repeated, and cooperative behavior.\u201d In fact, however, petitioner\u2019s presiding official viewed these circumstances in precisely the opposite light. Referring to petitioner\u2019s three witnesses (other guards who had not been suspended), the presiding official reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1614-11\">All three of these agents were charged with crimes involving firearms; the appellants here are charged with using only their hands and feet, and in one instance, a nightstick, as weapons. Clearly the three Agents who were allowed to perform limited duty were potentially more dangerous to aliens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1614-12\">I. also note that the appellants here are charged with using calculated brutality, probably in an attempt to maintain authority over aliens through unauthorized means.... The record does not persuade me that there is any reasonable likelihood that they would commit violence against aliens while working as dispatchers, in the garage, on construction work, etc. These jobs are all performed in areas with supervisors or fellow Agents present. In previous cases, just cited, the agency determined that these jobs were sufficiently well supervised so that Agents accused of far more serious crimes could be trusted to perform them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADq_\">A.R. 93-94. Thus, the presiding official concluded that petitioner\u2019s suspension was less justified than suspensions would have been in other cases. The MSPB never addressed this conclusion, and certainly never advanced the deterrence rationale now put forth by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-13\">Second, nowhere in the record is there evidence that the MSPB and the agency carefully considered alternative sanctions. But the presiding official had, and he had concluded that \u201cit was administratively practical to allow Border Patrol Agents, charged with crimes of violence to perform limited duty without danger to aliens.\u201d A.R. 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1519\">*1519</page-number>This was no \u201cbare conclusion,\u201d as the majority suggests. It came after the official had heard extensive testimony about a full list of alternative jobs that would have kept the petitioner away from aliens and would have protected the agency from public criticism. These jobs included the petitioner\u2019s being a dispatcher, a desk officer, an administrative worker in the agency\u2019s local headquarters, a radio and key issuer, or a maintenance and construction worker. The MSPB never bothered to discuss the alternative job testimony or the official\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-5\">Moreover, I continue to believe that even if no alternative positions had been available, the agency should have been obligated to place petitioner on paid leave rather than suspension. The majority in <em>Brown v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>715 F.2d 662, 663 (D.C.Cir. 1983), correctly noted that Office of Personnel Management regulations prohibit the use of administrative leave for longer than ten days, 715 F.2d at 668 n. 3, but it is debatable whether those regulations are congressionally mandated. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 6326 (1976) (recognizing \u201cthe authority of an Executive agency ... to grant administrative leave excusing an employee from work when it is in the public interest.\u201d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1615-6\">In conclusion, I am persuaded by the majority in <em>Brown </em>that agencies must occasionally have authority to discipline employees on the basis of indictments alone. But given the facts of this case, and my belief that indefinite suspensions without pay should seldom be administered, I would reverse the MSPB\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1613-6\">. I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s suggestion, <em>see </em>footnote 23 <em>supra, </em>that agencies can satisfactorily record their evaluation of the many relevant factors involved in disciplinary actions by a mere reference to the MSPB\u2019s decision in <em>Douglas </em>v.. <em>Veterans Administration, </em>5 MSPB 313 (1981). <em>Douglas </em>was certainly an important decision. But surely a talismanic reference to it will not relieve agencies like the MSPB of all obligation to give these issues explicit consideration, simply because the agencies are shrewd enough to know which case to cite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1613-7\"><em>. </em>\u201cCourt decisions and OPM and Civil Service Commission issuances have recognized a number of factors that are relevant for consideration in determining the appropriateness of a penalty. Without purporting to be exhaustive, those generally recognized as relevant include the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-8\">(1) The nature and seriousness of the offense, and its relation to the e[m]ployee\u2019s duties, position, and responsibilities, including whether the offense was intentional or technical or inadvertent, or was committed maliciously or for gain, or was frequently repeated;</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-9\">(2) the employee\u2019s job level and type of employment, including supervisory or fiduciary role, contacts with the public, and prominence of the position;</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-14\">(3) the employee\u2019s past disciplinary record;</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-15\">(4) the employee\u2019s past work record, including length of service, performance on the job, ability to get along with fellow workers, and dependability;</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-16\">(5) the effect of the offense upon the employee\u2019s ability to perform at a satisfactory level and its effect upon - supervisors\u2019 confidence in the employee\u2019s ability to perform assigned duties;</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-17\">(6) consistency of the penalty with those imposed upon other employees for the same or similar offenses;</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-18\">(7) consistency, of the penalty with any applicable agency table of penalties;</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-19\">(8) the notoriety of the offense or its impact upon the reputation of the agency;</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-20\">(9) the clarity with which the employee was on notice of any rules that were violated in committing the offense, or had been warned about the conduct in question;</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-21\">(10) potential for the employee\u2019s rehabilitation;</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-22\">(11) mitigating circumstances surrounding the offense such as unusual job tensions, personality problems, mental impairment, harassment, or bad faith, malice or provoca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1518\">*1518</page-number>tion on the part of others involved in the matter; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-9\">(12) the adequacy and effectiveness of alternative sanctions to deter such conduct in the future by the employee or others.\u201d <em>Douglas v.

Even in the cases where paid leave might be most unattractive, \u2014 where, for example, agencies might shrink from paying additional salary to a suspended employee indicted for truly heinous crimes, Congress can always make those benefits recoverable when actual proof of the suspect\u2019s guilt is obtained. <em>Cf. </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 404(a)(1) (1976) (authorizing the recovery of overpayments made to Social Security beneficiaries in cases including those where claimants continue to receive benefits while appealing termination notices).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
