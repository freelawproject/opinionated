Burney, a black male, appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in defendants\u2019 favor on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1376\">*1376</page-number>Title VII, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>claim on the ground of collateral estoppel and the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 claim alleging a deprivation of his First Amendment rights of free speech and free association as time barred by the Florida two year statute of limitations governing actions for the recovery of back wages, Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 95.11(4)(e). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-4\">The facts in this case are as follows. Plaintiff was employed as a tenured guidance counselor by the defendant Polk Community College (PCC). On April 11, 1978, the President of PCC petitioned PCC\u2019s Board of Trustees (the Board) to conduct proceedings on the President\u2019s recommendation that plaintiff be dismissed. Plaintiff requested that a full evidentiary hearing on the charges set forth in the President\u2019s petition be held. The Board appointed one of its members to serve as a Hearing Officer. A six day hearing was held at which plaintiff was represented by counsel and numerous witnesses were called on plaintiff\u2019s behalf. Plaintiff\u2019s defense at the hearing against the President\u2019s dismissal recommendation included allegations of racial discrimination based on claimed disparate treatment of similarly situated white faculty members. The Hearing Officer\u2019s recommended order rejected plaintiff\u2019s claim of disparate treatment and upheld the President\u2019s recommendation to dismiss the plaintiff. The Board adopted the Hearing Officer\u2019s order and plaintiff was dismissed on December 29, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-5\">Plaintiff appealed the Board\u2019s order of his dismissal to the Florida Second District Court of Appeals. The court affirmed the Board\u2019s order without published opinion. <em>Burney v. Polk Community College, </em>380 So.2d 586 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-10\">Plaintiff then filed a charge of race discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), received a right to sue letter, and on June 21, 1981, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida alleging causes of action under Title VII, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1981<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 1983 against PCC, the Board and others.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1472-11\">I. THE TITLE VII CLAIM: KREMER V. CHEMICAL CONSTRUCTION CORP.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-12\">The President\u2019s petition to the Board in this case listed thirteen separate reasons in support of his recommendation that plaintiff be dismissed. Plaintiff responded to these charges by asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that the dismissal recommendation \u201c[rjeflects the application of discriminatory criteria to him as compared with other College employees.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the six day hearing, where plaintiff was represented by counsel, called seventeen witnesses to testify on his behalf, and submitted sixteen documentary exhibits in support of his defense, plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"amt-dedup-1\">[Djuring both direct and cross-examination of witnesses for Petitioner, attempted to show that the reasons set forth were not the real reasons behind the petition for relief as sought by the Petitioner. [Plaintiff] injected comparisons of [his] evaluations and Counselor E. Horton Briggs, and claimed that the ratings on the evaluations were similar. [Plaintiff] claimed that the continued employment of Briggs and intent to dismiss [him] constituted the application of disparate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>measures in the evaluations of the services of the two individuals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1473-5\">The Hearing Officer concluded that the charges contained the required \u201cgood and sufficient reasons\u201d for the dismissal of the plaintiff, noting that the President and the Board have \u201c[w]ide discretion in deciding what constitutes \u2018good and sufficient reasons\u2019 as long as the reasons are of such nature that they do not infringe upon [plaintiff\u2019s] exercise of his First Amendment freedoms, nor involve nuances of racial discrimination.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Hearing Officer held that \u201c[n]o such allusions are made in the charges as set forth by Petitioner.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Board adopted the Hearing Officer\u2019s recommended order as its proposed order, and the plaintiff filed exceptions and a brief opposing the recommended order. In its final order, the Board accepted the findings of the Hearing Officer and his recommendation that plaintiff be dismissed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On appeal of the Board\u2019s order, the Florida Second District Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1473-6\">The similarity between the facts of this case and <em>Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corp., </em>456 U.S. 461, 102 S.Ct. 1883, 72 L.Ed.2d 262 (1982), is apparent. In <em>Kremer, </em>the plaintiff filed a discrimination charge with the EEOC claiming that his discharge and failure to be rehired by the defendant was due to his national origin and Jewish faith. Pursuant to the dictates of Title VII, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e-5(c), the EEOC referred plaintiff\u2019s charge to the New York State Division of Human Rights (NYHRD), the state agency charged with enforcing the New York law prohibiting employment discrimination. The NYHRD found there was no discrimination in plaintiff\u2019s discharge and failure to be rehired. The NYHRD Appeals Board upheld this determination. The plaintiff appealed the Board decision to the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court. The court affirmed the Board\u2019s order without written opinion. Plaintiff could have sought, but did not seek, review by the New York Court of Appeals. Plaintiff also pursued his charge with . the EEOC, received a right to sue letter, and brought a Title VII action in federal district court, claiming discrimination on the basis of national origin and religion. The district court dismissed plaintiff\u2019s complaint, holding that the state court decision affirming the Board was res judi-cata <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> on plaintiff\u2019s Title VII claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1473-15\">The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari, and addressed the issue of whether the national policy embodied in Title VII of vesting enforcement of anti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>discrimination laws in the federal courts superseded the longstanding principle of comity expressed in 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1738<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"amk-dedup-0\">Specifically, we decide whether a federal court in a Title VII case should give preclusive effect to a decision of a state court upholding a state administrative agency\u2019s rejection of an employment discrimination claim when the state court\u2019s decision would be res judicata in the state\u2019s own courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1474-4\">456 U.S. at 463, 102 S.Ct. at 1887-88. The Court held that Section 1738 requires that full faith and credit be given by the federal courts to a state court decision upholding a state administrative agency\u2019s rejection of an employment discrimination claim if two criteria are met: (1) the court of the state from which the judgment emerged would grant preclusive effect to the judgment, and (2) the state proceedings, including the administrative action and judicial review of this action, do not violate the procedural requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. As these criteria were satisfied in <em>Kremer, </em>the Court held that plaintiff\u2019s Title VII action was properly dismissed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-9\">The district court held that <em>Kremer </em>is controlling on plaintiff\u2019s Title VII claim and thus granted summary judgment in the PCC defendants\u2019 favor as a matter of law. In this appeal, plaintiff claims that <em>Kremer </em>does not apply to the present case because the state agency which rendered the administrative decision, the PCC Board, is not the state agency statutorily authorized to enforce Florida\u2019s anti-discrimination in employment laws.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Alternately, plaintiff contends that if <em>Kremer </em>does apply, the first criterion of the <em>Kremer </em>test<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is not met in the present case, <em>i.e., </em>that a Florida court would not grant preclusive effect to the Second District Court of Appeals\u2019 affirmance of the Board\u2019s order. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>Plaintiff claims that the scope of the <em>Kremer </em>holding is limited to state court judgments affirming a state equal employment agency\u2019s orders. In support of this claim, plaintiff notes that the precise factual context of <em>Kremer </em>was a state court\u2019s affirmance of a state equal employment agency\u2019s order. We hold, however, that the <em>Kremer </em>analysis extends to the present state court judgment affirming the PCC Board\u2019s order, and that in this case it is the state court judgment, and not the agency affirmed, that is determinative of a federal court\u2019s full faith and credit obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-4\">Clearly, the necessary focus of the <em>Kremer </em>analysis is on the state court judgment, and not the agency affirmed, for purposes of full faith and credit. Thus, in holding that neither the express statutory language nor legislative history of Title VII contains an implied partial repeal of Section 1738, the Court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1475-5\">No provision of Title VII requires claimants to pursue in state court an unfavorable state administrative action, nor does the Act specify the weight a federal court should afford a final judgment by a state court if such a remedy is sought. While we have interpreted the \u201ccivil action\u201d authorized to follow consideration by federal and state administrative <em>agencies </em>to be a \u201ctrial de novo,\u201d <em>Chandler v. Roude-bush, </em>425 U.S. 840, 844-45 [96 S.Ct. 1949, 1951-52, 48 L.Ed.2d 416] (1976); <em>Alexander v. Garner-Denver Co., </em>[415 U.S. 36, 38, 94 S.Ct. 1011, 1015, 39 L.Ed.2d 147 (1974)]; <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>[411 U.S. 792, 798-99, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1822-23, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973)], neither the statute nor our decisions indicate that the final judgment of a state <em>court </em>is subject to redetermination at such a trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1475-6\">Nothing in the legislative history of the 1964 Act suggests that Congress considered it necessary or desirable to provide an absolute right to relitigate in federal court an issue resolved by a state court. 456 U.S. 469-70, 73, 102 S.Ct. 1891-92, 1893 (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1475-9\">This language is clearly evidence of the <em>Kremer </em>Court\u2019s focus on the state court judgment, and not the agency affirmed, for purposes of full faith and credit, and further disposes of plaintiff\u2019s claim that he is entitled to a trial de novo in federal court on his Title VII claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-10\">Additional internal evidence of the focus of the <em>Kremer </em>Court\u2019s analysis is found in the Court\u2019s holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1475-11\">[T]he comity and federalism interests embodied in \u00a7 1738 are not compromised by the application of res judicata and collateral estoppel in Title VII cases. Petitioner maintains that the decision of the Court of Appeals will deter claimants from seeking state court review of their claims ultimately leading to a deterioration in the quality of the state administrative process. On the contrary, stripping state court judgments of finality would be far more destructive to the quality of adjudication by lessening the incentive for full participation by the parties and for searching review by state officials. Depriving state judgments of finality not only would violate basic tenets of comity and federalism, <em>Board of Regents v. Tomanio, </em>446 U.S. 478, 488, 491-92, [100 S.Ct. 1790, 1797, 1798-99, 64 L.Ed.2d 440] (1980), but also would reduce the incentive for States to work toward effective and meaningful antidiscrim-ination systems. <em>Id. </em>at 478 [100 S.Ct. at 1790] (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1475-12\">The destructive effect of stripping state court judgments of finality is equally applicable to state court judgments affirming that a claim of employment discrimination is unproven made by a state administrative agency other than that expressly authorized to determine employment discrimination claims. Likewise, plaintiff\u2019s claim that affirming the federal district court\u2019s holding that <em>Kremer </em>applies to the PCC Board\u2019s order will deter claimants from seeking state court review of such orders is unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>Finally, that the state court judgment is the determinative factor in the <em>Kremer </em>analysis is illustrated by the <em>Kremer </em>Court\u2019s holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1476-4\">[T]he congressional directive that the EEOC should give \u201csubstantial weight\u201d to findings made in state proceedings, \u00a7 706b, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(b), indicates only the minimum level of deference the EEOC must afford all state determinations; it does not bar affording the greater preclusive effect which may be required by \u00a7 1738 if judicial action is in-vovled[,]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1476-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 470, [102 S.Ct. at 1891]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ahg-dedup-0\">and accompanying footnote seven:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1476-6\">Since it is well settled that decisions by the EEOC do not preclude a trial <em>de novo </em>in federal court, it is clear that unre-viewed administrative decisions by state agencies also should not preclude such review even if such a decision were to be afforded preclusive effect in a State\u2019s own courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1476-7\">In sum, it is the state court judgment, and not the agency decision, that triggers the full faith and credit requirement of Section 1738.</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-8\">Our holding that <em>Kremer </em>applies to the present state court judgment affirming the PCC Board is supported not only by the clear import of the <em>Kremer </em>analysis but also by the <em>pre-Kremer </em>precedent of the former Fifth Circuit.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In <em>Frazier v. East Baton Rouge Parish School Board, </em>363 F.2d 861 (5th Cir.1966) (per curiam), a public school teacher brought a Section 1983 action in federal court based on claims previously rejected by the School Board after a public hearing and affirmed by the Louisiana state court. The court held that plaintiff\u2019s Section 1983 action was barred by res judi-cata and that: \u201c[i]f state administrative action is first challenged in the state court, and the state court acts judicially, the state court decision is <em>res judicata </em>and bars a decision by a federal court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-10\">In <em>Jennings v. Caddo Parish School Board, </em>531 F.2d 1331 (5th Cir.1976) (per curiam), the School Board ordered plaintiff, a public school teacher, dismissed after a full hearing at which plaintiff was represented by counsel. Plaintiff appealed the Board\u2019s order to the Louisiana state court, which affirmed. Plaintiff\u2019s Section 1983 suit, alleging that her dismissal was racially motivated, was held to be barred by the res judicata effect of the state court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-11\">In <em>Cornwell v. Ferguson, </em>545 F.2d 1022 (5th Cir.1977), plaintiff, an associate professor at the University of Florida, was not granted tenure or renewed employment by the University\u2019s Academic Freedom and Tenure Committee. At a hearing before the Committee, plaintiff alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that this action constituted a denial of equal protection. The Committee found that no constitutional deprivations had occurred, and plaintiff was dismissed. Plaintiff then petitioned the Florida district court of appeal for review, and shortly thereafter filed an action in federal court, alleging similar causes of action under the Civil Rights Act. On defendants\u2019 motion the federal district court stayed the proceedings pending the outcome of the state appeal. The state court affirmed the Committee\u2019s order. The parties then returned to federal court and defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment was granted on the ground of res judicata. On appeal, the former Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding the district court\u2019s abstention was proper and that the decision of the state court was res judicata in the federal proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1476-12\">Due process does not require federal courts to get involved in every action alleging a federal constitutional or civil rights claim. Here the complaining party freely and voluntarily chose to first seek relief from the state court. This court has previously held that a state court judgment is conclusive as to all matters which were litigated or might have been litigated in the first action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1476-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 1024.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>We find this precedential trio concerning the actions of administrative agencies similar to the PCC Board to be highly persuasive, if not controlling, in the present Title VII context because although each case involved federal claims under the Civil Rights Act the <em>Kremer </em>Court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"acm-dedup-1\">Our finding that Title VII does not create an exception to \u00a7 1738 is strongly suggested if not compelled by our recent decision in <em>Allen v. McCurry </em>[449 U.S. 90, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980) ] that preclusion rules apply in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 actions and may bar federal courts from freshly deciding constitutional claims previously litigated in state courts. Indeed, there is more in \u00a7 1983 to suggest an implied repeal of \u00a7 1738 than we have found in Title VII. 456 U.S. at 476, 102 S.Ct. at 1894.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1477-4\"><em>See also Lee v. City of Peoria, </em>685 F.2d 196 (7th Cir.1982) (relying on <em>Jennings </em>and <em>Kremer </em>in holding that a state court judgment affirming an administrative decision of a police personnel board is res judicata and barred plaintiff\u2019s Civil Rights Act claims). Since a federal court is required to give full faith and credit to a state court judgment affirming an administrative agency determination under both the Civil Rights Act and Title VII, we find no principled basis for distinguishing between the preclusive effect of a state court judgment affirming a school or university Board decision under the Civil Rights Act and under Title VII. In sum, we hold that the Florida court\u2019s affirmance of the PCC Board\u2019s order is entitled to full faith and credit in a federal court if the <em>Kremer </em>criteria are met.</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-5\">We turn now to plaintiff\u2019s claim that the first criterion of the <em>Kremer </em>test is not met in this case and that a Florida court would not accord preclusive effect to the Second District Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment affirming the PCC Board\u2019s order. Plaintiff contends that the PCC Board did not have jurisdiction to determine his claim of employment discrimination and from this premise seeks to draw the conclusion that the state court\u2019s affirmance of the Board\u2019s order likewise was without jurisdiction and would not be given preclusive effect in a Florida state court. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-7\">First, we note that the court\u2019s affirmance of the PCC Board\u2019s order can be read as necessarily involving a determination that the Board had jurisdiction over plaintiff\u2019s claim. <em>See Sauls v. DeLoach, </em>182 So.2d 304, 305 (Fla. 1st D.C.A.1966) (on the district court of appeals\u2019 review of administrative agency actions under Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 120.-31(1) (1977), the predecessor statute to current Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 120.68, \u201c[t]he question which we must decide is whether the administrative agency acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction\"). <em>Cf. Kremer, </em>456 U.S. at 480, 102 S.Ct. at 1896-97 (\u201c[t]he Appellate Division\u2019s affirmance of the NYHRD\u2019s dismissal necessarily decided that petitioner\u2019s claim under New York law was meritless\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-8\">Second, we address plaintiff\u2019s claim that the state court\u2019s summary affirmance of the PCC Board\u2019s order \u201cobviously\u201d did not address plaintiff\u2019s claim of employment discrimination or the Board\u2019s jurisdiction over such a claim. Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 120.68 governs judicial review of final agency action and provides that the district court of appeals \u201c[sjhall remand the case to the agency if it finds the agency\u2019s exercise of discretion to be outside the range of discretion delegated to the agency by law,\u201d <em>id. </em>(12)(a), or \u201c[i]f the court finds that the agency has erroneously interpreted a provision of law ... it shall: (a) set aside or modify the agency action, or (b) remand the case to the agency for further action under a correct interpretation of the provision of law,\u201d <em>id. </em>(9). Whether the Board\u2019s actions in determining plaintiff\u2019s employment discrimination claim were within its jurisdiction as a matter of law or delegated statutory discretion is an issue that would be properly presented to the district court of appeals on direct review. The record in this case does not reflect on what grounds plaintiff sought review of the PCC Board\u2019s order in the Florida court. Assuming that plaintiff did not raise such a challenge to the PCC Board\u2019s jurisdiction before the district court of appeals, this fact is irrelevant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number>application of the doctrine of res judicata to the district court of appeals\u2019 affirmance of the Board\u2019s order in a subsequent proceeding in a Florida court. In <em>Coulter v. Davin, 373 </em>So.2d 423, 427 (Fla.2d D.C.A.1979), the court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1478-4\">[Wjhen administrative agency action in a proceeding has become final as to a party, whether or not review by a district court of appeal is sought, that party is foreclosed from asserting in circuit court that the agency action is unconstitutional (or is improper for any other reason). This is for the simple reason that the unconstitutionality of the action is an issue which could have been asserted by the party on direct review by the district court of appeal pursuant to Section 120.68.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1478-5\"><em>See also, Key Haven v. Board of Trustees of Internal Improvement Trust Fund, </em>427 So.2d 153, 157-58 (Fla.1982); <em>Albrecht v. State, </em>407 So.2d 210, 211 (Fla. 2d D.C.A. 1981); <em>Hays v. State Department of Business Regulation, </em>418 So.2d 331, 332 (Fla. 3d D.C.A.1982). Since a Florida court would grant res judicata preclusive effect to all issues, including that of the PCC Board\u2019s jurisdiction, which could have been raised before the district court of appeals on direct review of the Board\u2019s order, a federal court is required to do the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-6\">Third and finally, we note that the issue of employment discrimination decided by the PCC Board\u2019s order is entitled under Florida law to collateral estoppel effect in subsequent proceedings before another administrative agency or state court, apart from direct review by the district court of appeals. <em>See Coulter v. Davin, supra; City of Bartow v. Public Employees Relations Commission, </em>382 So.2d 311, 313 (Fla. 2d D.C.A.1979); <em>Marion County School Board v. Clark, </em>378 So.2d 831, 835 (Fla. 1st D.C.A. 1979). (Ervin, J. concurring). Again, a federal court is required to do the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-10\">We therefore hold that Kremer requires that full faith and credit be given by a federal court to the judgment of the Florida Second District Court of Appeals affirming the Board\u2019s order disposing of plaintiff\u2019s claim of employment discrimination and that accordingly the federal district court did not err in granting summary judgment in the PCC defendants\u2019 favor as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-11\">II. THE SECTION 1983 CLAIM: MCGHEE V. OGBURN</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-12\">The district court held that the applicable limitations period under Florida law<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to plaintiff\u2019s Section 1983 claim, alleging a deprivation of his First Amendment rights of free speech and association, was that of Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 95.11(4)(c), governing an \u201caction to recover wages or overtime or damages or penalties concerning the payment of wages and overtime.\u201d Since plaintiff was discharged on December 29, 1979, and suit was not filed until June 21, 1981, the district court granted the PCC defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s Section 1983 claim as time barred. In determining the applicable statute of limitations for plaintiff\u2019s Section 1983 claim under Florida law the district court relied on McWilliams v. <em>Escambia County School Board, </em>658 F.2d 326 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> in which the court held that Section 95.-ll(4)(c) applies to a Section 1983 claim alleging race discrimination in employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1383\">*1383</page-number>and seeking both legal and equitable relief. After the district court\u2019s decision in this case, <em>McGhee v. Ogburn, </em>707 F.2d 1312 (11th Cir.1983), was decided. In <em>McGhee, </em>this Court extended <em>McWilliams </em>to a Section 1983 claim alleging a deprivation of procedural due process in employment termination. The PCC defendants claim that the rationale of <em>McGhee </em>is controlling on the appropriate limitations period for plaintiff\u2019s Section 1983 claim in the present case, alleging a deprivation of his First Amendment rights. We agree only because we are bound by <em>McGhee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1479-4\">Plaintiff seeks to distinguish <em>McGhee </em>on the grounds that his First Amendment claims are not employment related and are distinct from any claim of race discrimination in employment. We agree that plaintiff\u2019s First Amendment rights exist outside of any employment relationship with the PCC defendants; we find, however, that the clear gravamen of plaintiff\u2019s Section 1983 claim is a claim that he was discharged by the PCC defendants in retaliation for exercising his First Amendment rights.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is clear that plaintiff\u2019s First Amendment claim for retaliatory discharge is distinct from any claim of race discrimination in employment. If we were writing on a clean slate, we would hold that due to the distinct nature of plaintiff\u2019s First Amendment claim from any claim of racial discrimination in employment this case falls without the ambit of <em>McWilliams </em>and Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 95.11(4)(c). This panel is, however, bound by <em>McGhee v. Ogburn, </em>which can only be reconsidered and overruled by the court en banc. As in <em>McGhee, </em>plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1479-9\">[A]rgues that the appropriate limitations period is four years under either Fla.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 95.11(3)(f) (West 1982), which applies to an \u201caction founded on a statutory liability,\u201d or <em>id. </em>\u00a7 95.11(3)(o), which applies to an \u201caction for ... any ... intentional tort.\u201d Employment discrimination and due process claims share the pertinent characteristics of these statutes. Both are grounded in statutory liability, imposed by the Civil Rights Acts. If plaintiff\u2019s due process claim, based on the denial of sufficient notice and hearing, can be termed an action for an intentional constitutional tort, so can a claim for racial discrimination in demotion and eventual termination of employment. If, as McWilliams concluded, an \u201caction to recover wages ...\u201d is the most closely analogous Florida action to a \u00a7 1983 action seeking injunctive relief as well as damages, then the same is true for a \u00a7 1983 due process employment ease seeking the same relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1479-10\">707 F.2d at 1314.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1479-11\">Although we find considerable merit to plaintiff\u2019s claim that a First Amendment retaliatory discharge action arises separate and distinct from any claim of racial discrimination as in <em>McWilliams, </em>we find no principled basis for distinguishing between the present First Amendment retaliatory discharge claim and the <em>McGhee </em>procedural due process claim. If plaintiff\u2019s First Amendment claim of retaliatory discharge can be characterized as an intentional constitutional tort grounded in the statutory liability of the Civil Rights Act, then the same is true of a procedural due process employment termination claim. For this reason, unless and until this Court en banc overrules <em>McGhee\u2019s </em>extension of <em>McWil-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1384\">*1384</page-number><em>liams </em>to claims under the Civil Rights Act distinct from those involving allegations of racial discrimination, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s Section 1983 claim alleging that he was discharged in retaliation for exercising his First Amendment rights as time barred under Fla.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 95.11(4)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-5\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in the Polk Community College defendants\u2019 favor on plaintiff\u2019s Title VII claim, and AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s Section 1983 claim as time barred by Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 94.11(4)(c).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1472-6\">. Plaintiff does not appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of his Section 1981 claim as time barred by Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 95.11(4)(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1472-7\">. In addition to PCC and the Board, the plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint names PCC\u2019s Dean of Students, Director of Counselling, Director of Admissions and Records, and a secretary to the Dean of Students as defendants in their individual capacities. We refer to all of the defendants in this case collectively as the PCC defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1472-13\">. Although plaintiff\u2019s actual response is not of record, the President\u2019s petition, Record at 61, states that plaintiff so responded to the charges in a letter of March 23, 1978. Plaintiff does not here contend that he did not raise this defense before the Hearing Officer, nor does he claim that the federal district court clearly erred in finding that \u201c[t]he hearing officer did consider plaintiff\u2019s claims of racial discrimination and disparate treatment and found them lacking in merit.\u201d Record at 109.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1473-7\">. Hearing Officer\u2019s recommended order, Record at 79-80, <em>quoted </em>in the federal district court\u2019s memorandum opinion and order, Record at 108.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1473-8\">. <em>Id. </em>at 82, <em>quoted </em>in the federal district court\u2019s memorandum opinion and order, Record at 108-109.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1473-11\">. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1473-12\">. Plaintiff contends that the Board never adopted the Hearing Officer\u2019s finding that he was not dismissed for racial reasons in its final order. This claim is contradicted by the record: \u201cThe Board ... has decided to affirm the findings and conclusions of the Hearing Officer as modified herein.\u201d Record at 84. No modification of the Hearing Officer\u2019s finding that the charges were not based on racially discriminatory reasons follows, and the Board\u2019s final order adopts the Hearing Officer\u2019s conclusions as to the \u201cgood and sufficient reasons\u201d standard. <em>Id. </em>at 85. The federal district court did not err in finding that the Board accepted the Hearing Officer\u2019s rejection of plaintiff\u2019s claims of racial discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1473-16\">. We note at this juncture that the term \u201cres judicata\u201d is used generically to refer to both collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, and res judicata, or claim preclusion. <em>See Migra v. Warren City School Board of Education, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 892, 894-95, 79 L.Ed. 2d 56 n. 1 (1984); <em>Kremer, </em>456 U.S. at 466-67 n. 6,102 S.Ct. at 1889-90 n. 6. Res judicata in this second narrower sense of claim preclusion refers to the effect of a judgment in foreclosing the parties from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in the prior action. Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, refers to the effect of a judgment in foreclosing litigation of a matter that has been litigated and decided. In <em>Kremer, </em>collateral estoppel was applied to prevent relitigation of the issue of employment discrimination previously decided by the state courts. Likewise, in the present case the district court held that the state court\u2019s affirmance of the Board\u2019s order collaterally estopped the plaintiff from relitigating the issue of employment discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1474-5\">. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1738 provides in pertinent part: The ... judicial proceedings of any court of any such State . .. shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States and its Territories and Possessions as they have by law or usage in the courts of such State ....</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1474-6\">. Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 23.161 <em>et seq. </em>is Florida\u2019s employment discrimination Act. Section 23.-167 prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of race, religion, sex, national origin, age, handicap, or marital status. Sections 23.-163-66 provide for a Commission of Human Relations to investigate and hold hearings on claims of employment discrimination and to serve as a deferral agency for the federal government. We agree with the plaintiff that the Florida Human Relations Commission is analogous to the New York State Division of Human Rights in <em>Kremer.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1474-7\">. Plaintiff also claims that the second criterion in <em>Kremer, i.e., </em>that the administrative proceedings and judicial review comport with due process, is not met in this case. Plaintiff\u2019s sole argument in support of this claim is that the administrative proceedings did not meet minimal due process standards because the Hearing Officer was a member of the Board and thus, plaintiff claims, deprived him of his due process right to a fair and impartial decision maker. However, because plaintiff has pointed to no record evidence of actual bias in support of his claim that the Board was in an adversarial posture to him, and because our review of the record has revealed no such evidence, we hold that this claim is without merit and precluded by precedent binding upon this court, <em>Megill v. Board of Education of the State of Florida, </em>541 F.2d 1073, 1079 (5th Cir.1976):</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-11\">An impartial decisionmaker is a basic constituent of minimum due process. <em>Ferguson v. Thomas, </em>430 F.2d 852, 856 (5th Cir.1970); <em>Simard v. Board of Educ., </em>473 F.2d 988, 993 (2d Cir.1973). In <em>Duke v. North Texas State Univ., </em>469 F.2d 829 (5th Cir.1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>412 U.S. 932, 93 S.Ct. 2760, 37 L.Ed.2d 160 (1973), this Court refused to adopt any per se rule disqualifying administrative hearing bodies. The record must support actual partiality of the body or its individual members. \u201cIn the absence of evidence to the contrary, we must assume therefore that the [administrative hearing body] acted independently and properly in these circumstances.\u201d 469 F.2d at 834. <em>Accord Jenkins v. Louisiana State Bd. of Educ., </em>506 F.2d 992, 1003 (5th Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-12\">Further we note that under the Florida Administrative Procedure Act, Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 120.50 <em>et seq., </em>plaintiff had the right to request that the Hearing Officer be disqualified for bias, prejudice, interest, or other causes for which a judge may be recused. Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 120.71; <em>State ex rel. Allen v. Board of Public Instruction, </em>214 So.2d 7 (Fla.1968). As in <em>Kremer, </em>\u201c[t]he fact that [the plaintiff] failed to avail himself of the full procedures provided by state law does not constitute a sign of their inadequacy.\u201d 456 U.S. at 485, 102 S.Ct. at 1899.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1476-9\">. The Eleventh Circuit has adopted the case law of the former Fifth Circuit handed down as of September 30, 1981, which is binding unless and until overruled or modified by this Court en banc. See <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1478-7\">. It is well settled that federal courts must look to the applicable state limitations period if Congress, as in the Civil Rights Act, has not provided a federal statutory limitation period, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1988; <em>Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>421 U.S. 454, 462, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 1721, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-8\">We recognize the proper approach is to first determine the essential nature of the claim under federal law and then focus on the period applicable to such a claim under state law....
