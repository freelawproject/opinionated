Hickey appeals from a final judgment of the District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the District of South Dakota denying his petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. For reversal appellant argues that the district court erred in finding (1) that his right to due process was not denied as the result of alleged contacts between the jurors and relatives of the man appellant was on trial for killing; and (2) that the prosecutor\u2019s failure to furnish a copy of a witness\u2019s statement was not improper because nothing in that statement was material to appellant\u2019s guilt or punishment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-16\">Hickey is a prisoner of the State of South Dakota serving a sentence of forty years for manslaughter. The facts underlying his conviction following a jury trial in state court are set forth in <em>State v. Hickey, </em>287 N.W.2d 502 (S.D.1980). On the night of September 3, 1977 appellant and Walter Lux were drinking at a bar in Oacoma, South Dakota, when Lux invited appellant to his home for a few beers. Defendant and a friend drove to Lux\u2019s home and waited in defendant\u2019s pickup until Lux arrived. Upon arrival Lux approached the pickup yelling that he was going to \u201cwhip\" appellant. He hit appellant in the face through an open window and tried to drag him out of the pickup. Appellant managed to escape with the help of his friend, who stayed behind, but later returned with a gun he had picked up at his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-17\">Upon appellant\u2019s return, Lux again approached appellant\u2019s pickup saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to finish you off this time.\u201d Appellant claims that a struggle ensued, and the gun accidentally discharged, firing a shot that was fatal to Lux. Appellant\u2019s friend, who had remained at the Lux home after the first confrontation, testified that Lux threatened appellant, but stated that Lux was at arm\u2019s length from the door of the pickup when the shot was fired. Violet Lux, decedent\u2019s wife, testified that she never overheard her husband threaten appellant after he returned. She further stated that as she and decedent walked toward the pickup, she heard a muffled \u201cblip\u201d and decedent stumbled and fell. She did not realize her husband had been shot until she saw appellant\u2019s gun pointed out the pickup win<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>dow. According to Mrs. Lux, decedent was about five or six feet away from the pickup when he was shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">Appellant alleges that during the trial decedent\u2019s mother and sister became emotional and were ordered to the back of the courtroom by the trial judge. In addition, the mother purportedly accosted members of the jury at recesses, created a scene in the hallways, and at one point ran up to the jury room during deliberations shouting and attempting to break in. Appellant further claims that one of the jurors was a friend of, or at least acquainted with, the decedent and decedent\u2019s mother, sister, and wife. Both the state court and federal district court conducted extensive evidentiary hearings into these allegations and found no support for them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Any conflicts in the testimony of witnesses appearing at the hearings were resolved in favor of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-6\">Appellant contends on appeal that the evidence presented at the federal and state hearings clearly demonstrated the existence of improper contacts between members of the victim\u2019s family and the jurors. Appellant argues that no presumption of correctness should attach to the factual determinations of the state court regarding his claims of jury contamination and bias because the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved in the state court hearing, material facts were not adequately developed, and appellant did not receive a full, fair and adequate hearing in the state court proceeding. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), (3) and (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-7\">Following a full evidentiary hearing and review of the transcript of the state post-conviction proceeding, the magistrate found that none of the statutory conditions alleged by appellant applied, that appellant had the burden of establishing by convincing evidence that the factual determination by the state court was erroneous, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), and that he had failed to discharge that burden. Upon review of the record before us, we agree with the district court and with the magistrate that the findings and conclusions resulting from the South Dakota post-conviction proceeding presumptively are correct. The record as a whole demonstrates fair support for the determination of the state court; indeed we find no convincing evidence of prejudicial contact between decedent\u2019s relatives and jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-10\">Appellant\u2019s second claim on appeal involves the prosecutor\u2019s failure to disclose a written statement by Violet Lux given to a deputy sheriff a few days after her husband was shot. (Although the record is not clear, we will assume for purposes of this appeal that defense counsel was not present at the time Mrs. Lux gave the written statement and was not aware of the statement\u2019s existence until sometime after trial.) Appellant made a pretrial discovery motion seeking any written statements by potential witnesses for the State. The State failed to disclose Mrs. Lux\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-11\">Appellant maintains that the State\u2019s failure to disclose Mrs. Lux\u2019s statement contravened his right to due process. \u201cIn <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>[373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963) ] the Supreme Court announced the rule that \u2018suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Scurr v. Niccum, </em>620 F.2d 186, 189 (8th Cir.1980). The Court later clarified the <em>Brady </em>rule in <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976), to provide that when the defense made a general pretrial request for the disclosure of evidence, undisclosed evidence would be considered \u201cmaterial\u201d only if it created a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist when evaluated in the context of the entire record. <em>Id. </em>at 109-12, 96 S.Ct. at 2400-01. Appellant\u2019s pretrial discovery motion in the case at bar was clearly general. <em>See Thompson v. Missouri, </em>724 F.2d 1314, 1318 (8th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-12\">We cannot say that evaluated in the context of the entire record, Mrs. Lux\u2019s statement creates a reasonable doubt that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>not otherwise exist. Appellant contends that the undisclosed statement was essential to impeach Mrs. Lux on cross-examination. First, appellant points out that Mrs. Lux\u2019s trial testimony differed from her statement regarding the distance between appellant\u2019s pickup and decedent\u2019s car. This inconsistency is inconsequential because the only distance of any import was that between appellant and decedent at the time of the shooting. The testimony at trial was undisputed that decedent was not in his car when he was shot, but was walking toward appellant\u2019s pickup. Second, appellant states that Mrs. Lux\u2019s trial testimony was that she did not hear the shot that killed her husband, contrary to her earlier statement that she had heard a muffled \u201cblip.\u201d Mrs. Lux did admit on cross-examination that she heard a sound. Because the jury heard this contradictory testimony, Mrs. Lux\u2019s undisclosed statement would not have created a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist. We are persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the undisclosed statement was not material to guilt or punishment and that its nondisclosure did not violate appellant\u2019s right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1246-14\">.
