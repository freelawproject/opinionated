KENNEDY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b444-22\">Melvin Beene Produce Company (Beene) appeals a revocation of its license under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA), 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 499a <em>et seq. </em>The Secretary of Agriculture\u2019s revocation of Beene\u2019s license resulted from a complaint, filed on August 31, 1981, alleging that Beene had violated 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 499b(4) by failing to make full and prompt payment to fourteen sellers for some 227 lots of perishable agricultural commodities. The violations had occurred between May 1979 and August 1980. The complaint further alleged that Beene\u2019s violations were willful, flagrant, and repeated. The agency sought revocation of Beene\u2019s license pursuant to 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 499h(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-23\">The case was heard by an Administrative Law Judge who found that Beene had willfully, flagrantly, and repeatedly violated 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 499b(4). Accordingly, she ordered a ninety-day suspension of Beene\u2019s PACA license. The agency appealed this decision to a Judicial Officer, who also found that Beene had committed willful, flagrant, and repeated violations of PACA and ordered that its license be revoked. We affirm the Judicial Officer\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-24\">Beene makes three arguments on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9C\">(1) The Secretary of Agriculture lacked subject matter jurisdiction to revoke Beene\u2019s license because the complaint was untimely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>(2) Revocation of Beene\u2019s license in lieu of a ninety-day suspension was inappropriate under the circumstances and constituted an impermissible failure on the Judicial Officer\u2019s part to use discretion in dispensing sanctions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-4\">(8) The revocation of its license by an Administrative Law Judge and a Judicial Officer who are not Article III judges is unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">All these claims are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">It is uncontested that Beene violated 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 499b(4). PACA provides for two different types of suits which may be filed for such a violation. Section 499e provides for a reparations action for damages incurred by any person injured by virtue of a \u00a7 499b violation,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> while \u00a7 499h provides for disciplinary actions brought by the Secretary of Agriculture for such violations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This action was brought under the latter section.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Section 499f sets out a procedure for complaints of \u00a7 499b violations. Section 499f(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">Any person complaining of any violation of any provision of section 499b of this title by any commission merchant, dealer, or broker may, <em>at any time within nine months after the cause of action accrues, </em>apply to the Secretary by petition, which shall briefly state the facts, whereupon, if, in the opinion of the Secretary, the facts therein contained warrant such action, a copy of the complaint thus made shall be forwarded by the Secretary to the .commission merchant, dealer, or broker, who shall be called upon to satisfy the complaint, or to answer it in writing, within a reasonable time to be . prescribed by the Secretary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-16\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-17\">The complaint in this case was filed more than nine months after the time period during which the violations occurred. The question here is whether this time limit applies to disciplinary actions by the Secretary under \u00a7 499h, or only to reparations proceedings under \u00a7 499e.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-18\">We find that the nine-month limit applies only to reparations actions under \u00a7 499e, and that the Secretary did not lack subject matter jurisdiction here. First, the language of \u00a7 499f(a) states that any person complaining of a \u00a7 499b violation may <em>apply to the Secretary within nine months </em>after the cause of action accrues. Semantically, the nine-month limit does not apply to actions by the Secretary, only to complaints directed to him. This is borne out by the fact that all of the cases cited by Beene \u2022 holding the time limit to be a jurisdictional prerequisite to action by the Secretary of Agriculture under the' statute involve \u00a7 499e reparations actions, not disciplinary actions by the Secretary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>We believe that subsection 499f(b), which does not contain a nine-month time limit, supplies the procedure for disciplinary actions under \u00a7 499h. Subsection 499f(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-4\">Any officer or agency of any State or Territory having jurisdiction over commission merchants, dealers, or brokers in such State or Territory and any employee of the United States Department of Agriculture or any interested person may file, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Secretary, a complaint of any violation of any provision of this chapter by any commission merchant, dealer, or broker, and may request an investigation of such complaint by the Secretary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">This conclusion is consistent with other language in the statute. Section 499m(b), provides that the Secretary, in order to insure compliance with the prompt payment provision of \u00a7 499b(4), \u201cshall from time to time inspect the accounts, records, and memoranda of any commission merchant, dealer, or broker <em>determined in a formal disciplinary proceeding under \u00a7 499f(b) </em>of this title to have violated such provision.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The statute thus indicates that the procedure for disciplinary actions is set out in \u00a7 499f(b), and not \u00a7 499f(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">A recent decision of the District of Columbia Circuit, <em>Finer Foods Sales Co. v. Block, </em>708 F.2d 774 (D.C.Cir.1988), supports our view. While <em>Finer Foods </em>does not address the precise question of whether the time limit applies to \u00a7 499h disciplinary actions, it does hold that another clause of \u00a7 499f(a) applies only to reparations proceedings and not to disciplinary actions. The Court examined subsections (a), (b) and (c) of \u00a7 499f and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">These subsections do not expressly state which of them applies to reparations proceedings, which to disciplinary proceedings, and which to both. Analysis of their language and structure, however, indicates that the requirement in [\u00a7 499f(a)] for the filing and serving upon the licensee of an informal complaint of a third person ... applies only in reparations proceedings and not in disciplinary proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-14\">Beene argues that if the nine-month time limit were read not to apply to disciplinary actions by the Secretary, then there would be no statute of limitations on the Secretary\u2019s disciplinary power. We see no serious problems with this situation. The doctrine of laches does apply to the Secretary. Moreover, this is not the only instance in which Congress has chosen not to put a statutory time limit on the Secretary of Agriculture\u2019s disciplinary power. <em>See, e.g., </em>Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 181 <em>et </em>seg.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The statute itself and the case law point to our conclusion that the nine-month time limit does not apply to actions by the Secretary under \u00a7 499h.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-16\">Beene next argues that revocation of its license was inappropriate under the circumstances. It argues that the Judicial Officer impermissibly refused to exercise discretion in dispensing Beene\u2019s sanction, that the Judicial Officer was in error in this and should have used his discretion not to revoke Beene\u2019s license. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-17\">The choice of sanctions imposed by the Secretary of Agriculture through his Judicial Officer may not be overturned unless it is unwarranted in law or without justification in fact. <em>Butz v. Glover Livestock Commission Co., Inc., </em>411 U.S. 182, 185-86, 93 S.Ct. 1455, 1457-58, 36 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>142 (1973); <em>American Fruit Purveyors, Inc. v. United States, </em>630 F.2d 370, 373 (5th Cir.1980) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 997, 101 S.Ct. 1701, 68 L.Ed.2d 197 (1981). This is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Beene misreads the Judicial Officer\u2019s opinion. Beene in its brief quotes portions of the Judicial Officer\u2019s opinion as support for its contention that the Judicial Officer refused to exercise any discretion in imposing a sanction. However, the Judicial Officer says only that he has no discretion to consider mitigating circumstances in deciding whether Beene violated PACA, and whether it did so willfully. He does not address the question of discretion in dispensing sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The Secretary is authorized, under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 499h(a), to revoke a PACA license for flagrant or repeated violations of \u00a7 499b. Both the Administrative Law Judge and the Judicial Officer found that Beene had committed such violations, and Beene does not challenge this on appeal. Beene went into bankruptcy after failing to pay for the 227 lots of perishable produce. This does not, however, have any effect on the Secretary\u2019s power to revoke Beene\u2019s license. As the Judicial Officer explains at length, Congress specifically amended \u00a7 525<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the 1978 Bankruptcy Law in order to authorize continuation of the Secretary\u2019s license revocation authority under PACA when the violations involve debts dischargeable in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Par from denying that he had discretion regarding the license revocation, the Judicial Officer carefully examined the evidence that Beene put forward as justification for a more lenient penalty. Beene presented unsworn petitions by five of its fourteen unpaid sellers, asking for leniency for Beene. The Judicial Officer noted that the petitions had no probative value, first, because they were unsworn, and second, because Beene\u2019s creditors had an interest in Beene\u2019s staying in business, hoping that it would eventually be able to make full payment. Beene presented no testimony or other evidence of mitigating circumstances. The Judicial Officer justified the revocation of Beene\u2019s license saying: \u201cIf lenient sanctions were imposed in the case of serious and flagrant violations of the Act for the benefit of a few of respondent\u2019s creditors, the sanctions would not have a strong deterrent effect and, therefore, such a policy would be contrary to the public interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">Appellant also urges that the administrative mechanism for dispute resolution between a licensee and its creditors in which a money judgment may be entered against the licensee for unpaid sums is an unconstitutional exercise of judicial power. Relying upon <em>Northern Pipeline Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Marathon Pipeline Co., </em>458 U.S. 50, 67, 102 S.Ct. 2858, 2869, 73 L.Ed.2d 598 (1982), Beene argues that the right to recover contract damages is a state-created private right which can only be enforced in an Article III court. However, we are concerned here only with a public right controversy, whether Beene\u2019s license should be revoked. The Supreme Court in <em>Marathon </em>specifically recognized licenses as examples of public rights which are within the province of administrative agencies without violating Article III.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">The Judicial Officer\u2019s revocation was not unwarranted in law or without justification in fact, and therefore cannot be overturned. Accordingly, the judgment of the Judicial Officer revoking Beene\u2019s license is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b445-10\">. Section 499e provides, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">(a) If any commission merchant, dealer, or broker violates any provision of section 499b of this title he shall be liable to the person or persons injured thereby for the full amount of damages sustained in consequence of such violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">(b) Such liability may be enforced either (1) by complaint to the Secretary as hereinafter provided, or (2) by suit in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b445-13\">.
