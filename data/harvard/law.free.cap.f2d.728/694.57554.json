A tort claim against the United States is barred unless it is first presented in writing to the appropriate federal agency within two years after the claim accrues. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b). Pursuant to the statutory authorization, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2672, the Attorney General prescribed regulations for the requisite initial presentation of tort claims to the appropriate federal agency, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 14.1-14.11. One of these regulations requires that the written notification to the agency include a claim for \u201cmoney damages in a sum certain.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 14.2(a). Here, Martinez\u2019s administrative claim stated that his damages were <em>\u201cin excess of </em>$100,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-17\">The district court granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss this claim for lack of jurisdiction, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), holding that because of the italicized words the initial administrative claim did not comply with the requirement that it be in a \u201csum certain.\u201d The court therefore held that no prerequisite timely initial claim had been presented to the agency and that, consequently, the courts lacked jurisdiction to entertain the Federal Tort Claims suit. We reverse, upholding the plaintiff-appellant\u2019s contention that the administrative claim reasonably complied with the sum-certain requirement, if only because the italicized words may be regarded as surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-19\">The motion to dismiss was decided on the basis of the pleadings and certain documentary exhibits. Accepting for present purposes the showing so made, the facts of the claim are as follows: Martinez was a federal prisoner in 1978-79 during which time he sustained an injury or infection to his left eye. He was denied medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>assistance. In January, 1979, when he could no longer see out of that eye, he was taken to a medical specialist and learned for the first time of an infection in the eye and that permanent damage to his eye had been sustained.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">On September 4, 1980 the attorney for the plaintiff wrote to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, stating the above facts, noting that the letter was submitted for purposes of filing a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The attorney\u2019s letter added that: \u201cAt this time the claimant, Rafael Martinez, would show that the damages involved in this claim are in excess of $100,000.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The government does not dispute, for present purposes, that the administrative claim was timely presented to the correct agency. Although the government urges technical deficiencies (such as its emphasis that the attorney\u2019s letter did not include all the details required of a Form 95 provided for presentation of such claims), the written presentation of Martinez\u2019s claim through his attorney\u2019s letter, <em>Crow v. United States, </em>631 F.2d 28, 30 (5th Cir.1980), which gave notice of the skeletal facts of the claim sufficient to enable the agency to investigate, <em>Adams v. United States, </em>615 F.2d 284, 289, <em>reh. denied, </em>622 F.2d 197 (5th Cir.1980), <em>Avery v. United States, </em>680 F.2d 608, 610-11 (9th Cir.1982), was undoubtedly adequate (except perhaps for the sum certain requirement) for the purpose of preliminarily presenting the claim to the agency as a prerequisite to a Federal Tort Claims action. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.2.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As we stated in <em>Williams v. United States, </em>693 F.2d 555, 557 (5th Cir.1982):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-11\">[A]n individual with a claim against the government satisfies the notice requirement of \u00a7 2675 if he or she: \u201c(1) gives the agency written notice of his or her claim sufficient to enable the agency to investigate and (2) places a value on his or her claim.\u201d .. . Moreover, we have held that no particular form or manner of giving such notice is required as long as the agency is somehow informed of the fact of and amount of the claim within the two year period prescribed by \u00a7 2401(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-12\">The district court nevertheless granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal. It held that the written claim was not properly presented within two years after the claim accrued on January 19, 1979, as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>the presentation of the claim to the agency on . September 4, 1980, although within the two-year period, did not \u2014 by claiming damages <em>\u201cin excess </em>of $100,000\u201d \u2014 comply with the administrative requirement that the claim for damages be in \u201ca sum certain.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.2(a) (quoted at note 3 <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">We and other circuits have held that timely presentation of a claim including \u201ca sum certain\u201d is a jurisdictional requirement, absent compliance with which the courts have no jurisdiction to entertain the suit under the Federal Tort Claims Act. <em>Wardsworth v. United States, </em>721 F.2d 503, 505-06 (5th Cir.1981). The asserted justification for this holding is that it furthers statutory goals of settlement determinations and efficient processing of claims by agencies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the other hand, in this circuit substantial compliance with the requirement has been liberally construed, so that the absence of a formal statement of a sum certain in the claim has not defeated court jurisdiction of the claim, for example, where the government had actually been apprised of the amount sought by a prior state court suit, <em>Williams, supra, </em>693 F.2d at 558, where the attorney\u2019s letter included an invoice and inventory of items for which recovery was sought, <em>Crow, supra, </em>631 F.2d at 30, or where the attorney\u2019s initial letter to the agency included medical bills and repair estimates (including some for expenses unrelated to and in excess of the claim), <em>Molinar v. United States, </em>515 F.2d 246, 247, 249 (5th Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">In accord with the approach taken by this court in these decisions, and with a similar holding by the Seventh Circuit in <em>Erxleben v. United States, </em>668 F.2d 268 (7th Cir. 1981), we hold that the presentation of an administrative claim <em>\u201cin excess of </em>$100,000\u201d is a reasonable compliance with the \u201csum certain\u201d requirement of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">In <em>Erxleben, supra, </em>the Seventh Circuit so held, where the claim was for a monetary amount with the word <em>\u201cpresently\u201d </em>added, because at most the qualification of the monetary amount could be regarded as sur-plusage (citing district court decisions to similar effect),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and because no statutory or administrative purpose of investigation or pre-suit settlement was disserved by the inclusion of such surplus verbiage. The decision reiterated that the Federal Tort Claims Act is \u201c \u2018intended to provide a framework conducive to the administrative settlement of claims, not to provide a basis for a regulatory checklist which, when not fully observed, permits the termination of claims regardless of their merits.\u2019 \u201d 668 F.2d at 273. We find this observation and the rationale of this decision to be persuasive and dispositive of the issue as to whether a \u201csum certain\u201d was adequately stated by the present administrative claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-14\">The government\u2019s motion to dismiss was also based on Martinez\u2019s alleged failure to file this action \u201cwithin six months after the date of mailing, by certified or registered mail, of notice of final denial of the claim by the agency to which it was presented.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b), quoted in full in note 4 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>This portion of the motion to dismiss was overruled by the district court on the basis of the documentary showing before it. This included a letter of December 11,1981, rejecting the September 1980 claim because of lack of a sum certain. Because the suit was filed on May 12, 1982, within the six-month delay, the district court had little difficulty in rejecting the government\u2019s claim of time-bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">On appeal, however, in urging that the dismissal be affirmed on another basis, the government re-urges this contention, but it now bases its time-bar claim upon an earlier letter of October 3, 1981. This allegedly constituted the notice of the final administrative denial of the claim more than seven months before the (thus untimely) suit of May 12, 1982. The substance of the letter was that the agency was unable to locate a claim by Martinez earlier than that of July 1981 (more than two years after the damage claim accrued), and therefore the agency could not \u201cconsider\u201d the claim for relief.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The letter of October 3, 1981, now relied upon by the government does not meet the administrative requirements for a \u201cnotice of final denial\u201d by an agency of a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">To avoid the uncertainty as to the date of a \u201cnotice of final denial\u201d of a claim by an agency, the Attorney General\u2019s administrative regulations provide, inter alia, that \u201cthe notification of final denial ... <em>shall </em>include a statement that, if the claimant is dissatisfied with the agency action, he may file suit in an appropriate U.S. District Court not later than six months after the date of mailing of the notification.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.9(a) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">The agency letter of October 3, 1981 did not, by its terms, constitute a final denial of Martinez\u2019s federal tort claim timely presented to the agency on September 4, 1980. Nor, because of its failure to comply with the quoted mandatory requirement of \u00a7 14.9(a), did this letter put him on notice that \u2014 rather than (as the attorney did in response to the letter) call to the agency\u2019s attention its clerical failure to locate his September 1980 claim, see note 7 <em>supra </em>\u2014 he was required to file a suit in district court within six months in order to continue the assertion of his tort claim against the government. In this respect, the agency letter of October 3 did not comply with the administrative regulation, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.9, designed to place the claimant on <em>notice </em>that the communication was intended to be a \u201cnotice of final denial\u201d of the claim for purposes of commencing the six-month delay within which to file suit, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b). <em>Boyd v. United States, </em>482 F.Supp. 1126, 1129 (W.D.Pa.1980);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Zill-man, Presenting a Claim Under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 43 La.L.Rev. 961, 986-88 (1983). <em>Cf., Woirhaye v. United States, </em>609 F.2d 1303, 1306 (9th Cir.1979); <em>Childers v.

The government concedes that, under these allegations, Martinez\u2019s claim first accrued on January 19, 1979, when he had actual knowledge of or should have discovered his infection.

The exaltation into a jurisdictional basis of the non-statutory administrative requirement of a sum certain in the administrative claim has been criticized as beyond the statutory intent and unnecessarily harsh and unnecessary in instances, especially where no administrative purpose is served by requiring an obviously inflated \u201csum certain\u201d, where there is honest uncertainty as to the amount of the claim.

The court pointed out that, subject to the limitation of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(b), quoted at note 2 <em>supra, </em>the effect of striking the surplus wording was to place a limit to the sum certain stated on the amount a claimant could recover for pre-administrative claim damages in any judicial action consequently brought. <em>Erxle-ben, </em>668 F.2d at 271, 273.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b794-6\">.
