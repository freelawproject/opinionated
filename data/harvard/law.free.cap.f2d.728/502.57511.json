On September 4, 1980, Cokinos\u2019 car was ticketed for illegal parking and subsequently towed to a central lot. Cokinos retrieved his car, on the same day, after paying the $10 parking fine and the $50 towing charge. He now contends that the procedures by which the District of Columbia tows and impounds automobiles violate the due process clause of the fifth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-22\">Cokinos argues, principally, three points: (1) in a non-emergency situation like the one his case presented, the District of Columbia must provide notice and an opportunity for hearing <em>before </em>towing a car; (2) the District of Columbia provides inadequate opportunities for a hearing <em>after </em>the car has been towed; and (3) regardless of the adequacy of the post-towing hearing, Cokinos, in fact, was never informed of his right to a hearing to challenge the validity of the tow.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-23\">As for the right to notice and hearing <em>before </em>towing in a non-emergency situation, we follow the Seventh Circuit\u2019s thorough analysis of this identical issue and conclude there is no right to pre-towing notice and hearing. <em>See Sutton v. City of Milwaukee, </em>672 F.2d 644 (7th Cir.1982). On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>the adequacy of the post-towmg hearing, we note the uncontradicted affidavit of the Chief Hearing Examiner of the Department of Transportation which states that a hearing on the underlying traffic violation is available on demand during normal working hours. Thus Cokinos could have had a hearing within sixteen hours from the time his car was towed. Such a time lapse is well within the 48-hour delay found reasonable by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Goichman </em>v. <em>Rheuban Motors, Inc., </em>682 F.2d 1320 (9th Cir.1982). We adhere to the view, stated and explained by the Ninth Circuit, that due process does not require a more immediate hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Finally, Cokinos concedes, as he must because it is printed on the back of the parking ticket, that a hearing is available to challenge the underlying traffic violation. The regulation allows towing of illegally parked vehicles; the validity of the tow, therefore, is dependent on the validity of the determination that the car in question was found parked in violation of a traffic regulation. Cokinos\u2019 assertion that he was not informed of the right to challenge the tow rings hollow; he knew he could challenge the parking violation and thus had all the information he needed to challenge the legality of the tow as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s September 30, 1982, order granting and entering summary judgment in favor of all defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
