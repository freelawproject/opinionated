David Breitbart, a New York lawyer, appeared <em>pro hac vice </em>to defend him, along with \u201cassociate\u201d (or \u201clocal\u201d) counsel John <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>O\u2019Neill. O\u2019Neill also represented Sundel s codefendant. During the course of pretrial proceedings, the trial judge began to fear that Breitbart\u2019s representation of his client was inadequate, perhaps because of Breit-bart\u2019s ignorance of local rules and procedures. On the first day of trial, after observing Breitbart\u2019s efforts to cross-examine the policeman who had seized the drugs, the judge had a series of conversations with both counsel \u2014 some on the record and some off the record in chambers \u2014 about what he saw as Breitbart\u2019s inadequacies. The upshot was that the judge, referring as authority to <em>United States v. Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. 600, 96 S.Ct. 1075, 47 L.Ed.2d 267 (1976), revoked Breitbart\u2019s permission to appear. He then asked Sundel whether he wished to proceed with O\u2019Neill as counsel, represent himself, or obtain other counsel. O\u2019Neill said that he believed there was a \u201cconflict of interest.\u201d Sundel said that he would like to engage other counsel. The judge then took the case from the jury \u201cat Mr. Sundel\u2019s request\u201d and set a new trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Subsequently Sundel argued that a new trial would violate the protection against \u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d provided by the fifth amendment. The Rhode Island Supreme Court ultimately rejected this argument on the ground that Sundel himself requested, or acquiesced in, the court\u2019s decision to remove Breitbart. <em>Compare Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. 667, 679, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 2091, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982). Sundel sought habeas in the federal district court. It was denied on the ground that, whether or not Sundel agreed to replace Breitbart, once the trial judge revoked Breitbart\u2019s permission to appear, Sundel himself sought a new trial. Sundel appeals the decision denying his habeas petition, 570 F.Supp. 1131.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">We affirm the denial, for, in our view, the state trial judge correctly invoked the authority of <em>United States v. Dinitz, supra. </em>We find that case factually similar and legally indistinguishable. <em>Dinitz </em>involved a Florida trial of a defendant who was represented by a New York lawyer, Wagner, appearing <em>pro hac vice, </em>and a local counsel, Meldon. Wagner\u2019s behavior at the trial, as the Supreme Court described it, consisted of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">Wagner then began his opening statement for the defense. After introducing himself and his co-counsel, Wagner turned to the case against the respondent:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">\u201cMr. Wagner: After working on this case over a period of time it appeared to me that if we would have given nomenclature, if we would have named this case so there could be no question about identifying it in the future, I would have called it The Case\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">\u201cMr. Reed [Asst. U.S. Attorney]: Your Honor, we object to personal opinions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-10\">\u201cThe Court: Objection sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">The purpose of the opening statement is to summarize the facts the evidence will show, state the issues, not to give personal opinions. Proceed, Mr. Wagner.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-12\">\u201cMr. Wagner: Thank you, Your Honor. I call this the Case of the Incredible Witness.\u201d App. 20.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-14\">The prosecutor again objected and the judge excused the jury. The judge then warned Wagner that he did not approve of his behavior and cautioned Wagner that he did not want to have to remind him again about the purpose of the opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-15\">Following this initial incident, the trial judge found it necessary twice again to remind Wagner of the purpose of the opening statement and to instruct him to relate \u201cthe facts that you expect the evidence to show, the admissible evidence.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 82. Later on in his statement, Wagner started to discuss an attempt to extort money from the respondent that had occurred shortly after his arrest. The prosecutor objected and the jury was again excused. Wagner informed the trial judge of some of the details of the extortion attempt and assured the court that he would connect it with the prospective Government witness Cox. But it soon became apparent that Wagner had no information linking Cox to the extor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>tion attempt, and the trial judge then excluded Wagner from the trial and ordered him to leave the courthouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">The trial judge asked Meldon if he would proceed. Meldon said he was not sufficiently prepared. The judge then asked the defendant if he wanted 1) a stay pending an application to appeal; 2) to proceed with Meldon (and a law professor Baldwin); or 3) a mistrial in order to obtain other counsel. The defendant asked for a mistrial, which was granted. 424 U.S. at 602-04, 96 S.Ct. at 1077-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Before his second trial, Dinitz argued that, on these facts, to retry him would put him in \u201cdouble jeopardy.\u201d He said he had wanted to keep Wagner as his lawyer. Once Wagner was removed, given Meldon\u2019s lack of familiarity with the witnesses, he was \u201cforced\u201d to ask for a mistrial. Thus, the trial was terminated over his objection. Unless there was \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for doing so, a second trial was barred. <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 509, 98 S.Ct. 824, 832, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978); <em>Illinois v. Somerville, </em>410 U.S. 458, 463, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 1070, 35 L.Ed.2d 425 (1973); <em>see Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. at 672-73, 102 S.Ct. at 2087-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The Supreme Court accepted Dinitz\u2019s premises, but rejected his conclusion. The Court agreed that Dinitz had not waived his right to proceed with Wagner. It said, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">traditional waiver concepts have little relevance. ... The important consideration, for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, is that the defendant retain primary control over the course to be followed .. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">after a serious trial court error (such as depriving Dinitz of his counsel assuming, for the sake of argument, that doing so was error). <em>United States v. Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. at 609-10, 96 S.Ct. at 1080-81. Unless the judge\u2019s action in, say, removing Wagner \u201cwas motivated by bad faith or undertaken to harass or prejudice\u201d the defendant, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not prevent a retrial as long as the defendant is offered the choice of continuing. <em>Id. </em>at 611, 96 S.Ct. at 1081. Otherwise trial judges would be tempted simply not to allow the defendant that choice; they would require the trial to proceed to its conclusion leaving the defendant with appeal and <em>retrial </em>as his only remedy. That is to say, the judge might have required Dinitz to proceed through a trial with Meldon as his lawyer. Dinitz, if convicted, would have had to appeal. And, according to the Court, \u201cthe Double Jeopardy Clause\u201d would then \u201cpresent no obstacle to a retrial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 610, 96 S.Ct. at 1081. Rather than encourage the trial judge to follow this complicated route to obtain a new trial, the Court held that a defendant\u2019s request for a mistrial, in these circumstances, will simply be taken at face value; the case will <em>not </em>be treated as one in which a new trial was ordered \u201cover his objection;\u201d thus a new trial will be permitted. <em>Id. </em>at 608-611, 96 S.Ct. at 1080-81; <em>see Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. at 672, 102 S.Ct. at 2087.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">Sundel seeks to distinguish <em>Dinitz </em>in three ways. First, he argues that Wagner\u2019s conduct was far more egregious than was Breitbart\u2019s. We do not agree. The trial judge lists, among other instances of doubtful conduct, the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">1) Breitbart brought a motion to suppress evidence without showing his client\u2019s standing, a fact that, in the judge\u2019s view, was likely sufficient under Rhode Island law to doom the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">2) During the voir dire Breitbart questioned the jury in a way apparently aimed at suggesting that the key prosecution witness had a motive not to tell the truth. The prosecution objected, because the line of questioning seemed well beyond that permitted by R.I.R.Crim.P. 24, which allows questioning for the purpose of determining whether a prospective juror is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-13\">related to a party, or has any interest in the case, or has expressed or formed an opinion or is sensible of any bias or prejudice therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-16\">Breitbart then stated, in the juror\u2019s hearing, \u201cMy question is with the individual motivation to lie.\u201d The judge rebuked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Breitbart for this and other departures from the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">3) Breitbart\u2019s opening statement to the jury referred several times to the key witness as having \u201clied,\u201d and as having \u201cschemed.\u201d Canon 7 of the Rhode Island Canons of Ethics states that a lawyer shall not \u201cassert his personal opinion ... as to the credibility of a witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">4) Breitbart\u2019s effort to cross-examine Corporal Malley, who seized the drugs, went well beyond the scope of direct examination, contrary to Rhode Island practice. Breitbart apparently was trying to use his cross-examination of this early witness to show that Hall, the key witness who would testify later, had made inconsistent statements. The prosecution objected, Breitbart was admonished by the judge, but Breitbart kept returning to this line of questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Sundel seeks to defend Breitbart\u2019s conduct as proper under Rhode Island law. His arguments, as to some of these matters, are plausible; but as to others, they are weak. He points, for example, to Rhode Island cases that allow cross-examination beyond the scope of direct \u201cto establish possible bias, prejudice or ulterior motives.\u201d <em>State v. O\u2019Brien, </em>412 A.2d 231, 233 (R.I. 1980); <em>State v. Bennett, </em>405 A.2d 1181, 1183 (R.I.1979); <em>State v. Ragonesi, </em>112 R.I. 340, 309 A.2d 851, 854 (1973). But these cases concern impeachment of the <em>witness being examined, </em>not impeachment of another witness who has not, as yet, even testified. Nor do we believe the trial judge took a few isolated matters out of context. Rather, we agree with the federal district judge, in this case, who was formerly an experienced Rhode Island trial attorney, when he notes that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">the trial judge seems, at the very least, to have had reasonable grounds to question Breitbart\u2019s familiarity with local practice and procedure, based on his filing and handling of motions, his conduct of jury voir dire, his opening statement, and his cross examination of Detective Malley.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdY\">Further, Wagner\u2019s conduct seems no more egregious than Breitbart\u2019s in any relevant sense. Wagner may have acted deliberately rather than through ignorance, but we do not see how that fact affects what was at issue in <em>Dinitz </em>(and here), namely defendant\u2019s right to counsel of his choice. Whether Wagner\u2019s or Breitbart\u2019s conduct was bad enough or incompetent enough to warrant removal is also beside the point, for in <em>Dinitz </em>the Supreme Court was willing to accept \u201cthe appellate court\u2019s conclusion that the trial judge overreacted in expelling Wagner from the courtroom.\u201d <em>United States v. Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. at 611, 96 S.Ct. at 1081.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">Finally, here, as in <em>Dinitz</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZG\">the respondent has not contended, and the record does not show that the judge\u2019s action was motivated by bad faith or undertaken to harass or prejudice the respondent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">Second, Sundel argues that the trial judge had greater reason than the judge in <em>Dinitz </em>to know that disqualification of Breitbart would likely lead to a new trial. He correctly points out that the judge knew O\u2019Neill was representing a codefendant; prior to trial, a motion to sever had been made; thus, the judge was aware of a possibility of conflict of interest. There was no such apparent conflict in <em>Dinitz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">This difference is not dispositive, however, for the trial judge did not know, nor could he even be reasonably sure, that Sun-del would reject O\u2019Neill as counsel. For one thing O\u2019Neill had previously filed an appearance for Sundel as well as for the codefendant. For another, Breitbart\u2019s motion to appear stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeB\">in my absence from any hearing or trial . .. my associate counsel [O\u2019Neill] may act for and on my behalf in the conduct of such hearing or trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-13\">At most one might find a somewhat greater likelihood here, than in <em>Dinitz, </em>that disqualification would lead to a \u201cnew trial\u201d choice. But, the language of <em>Dinitz </em>suggests that these shades of difference do not matter short of the point where the trial judge <em>knows </em>that the present trial must be aborted.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Third, Sundel argues at length that he did not \u201cwaive\u201d his right to have Breitbart represent him. And, he adds that any such waiver must be \u201cconvincingly established on the record\u201d as a waiver of a fundamental constitutional right. These \u201cwaiver\u201d arguments, however, are precisely those rejected in <em>Dinitz. See United States v. Din-itz, </em>424 U.S. at 609 n. 11, 96 S.Ct. at 1080 n. 11. The Court says that \u201cwaiver\u201d is scarcely relevant; it <em>agrees </em>that defendant may face a \u201cHobson\u2019s choice\u201d after a judge erroneously deprives him of counsel of his choosing. But, the Court\u2019s point is that defendants, faced with such errors, even horrendous ones, normally must wait until after they are convicted, then appeal, and, when vindicated, undergo a new trial. A defendant should not be <em>better off (i.e. </em>immune from trial) because the judge gives him the choice of the new trial in advance. This reasoning applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Sundel\u2019s argument in essence is that of the <em>Dinitz </em>court of appeals. It is the argument that the Supreme Court rejected. We see no meaningful distinction. Thus, the decision of the district court must be</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
