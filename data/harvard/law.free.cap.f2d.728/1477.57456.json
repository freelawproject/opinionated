(\u201cNaph-Sol\u201d) appeal from orders entered by, respectively, the District Court for the Northern District of New York and the District Court for the Western District of Michigan that, <em>inter alia, </em>invalidated the \u201cdeemed recovery rule\u201d as procedurally defective. <em>Mobil Oil Corp. v. DOE, </em>547 F.Supp. 1246 (N.D.N.Y.1982),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is a declaratory judgment action brought to challenge the validity of a \u201cthree cent\u201d retail price equalization rule and, alternatively, of the \u201cdeemed recovery rule.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1480\">*1480</page-number><em>Naph-Sol Refining Co. </em>v. <em>Murphy Oil Corp., </em>550 F.Supp. 297 (W.D.Mich.1982), is an action for recovery of overcharges with respect to Naph-Sol\u2019s purchase of gasoline from Murphy Oil Corporation (\u201cMurphy\u201d) at prices allegedly in excess of those permitted by the petroleum price regulations, 10 C.F.R. pt. 212, including the \u201cdeemed recovery rule,\u201d and by the supply contracts existing between the parties. Although, as will become apparent, other issues are also before this court, the invalidation of the \u201cdeemed recovery rule\u201d was pivotal to both district court rulings and resulted in the consolidation of these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-4\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"AqfS\">\n<em>A. Regulatory Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"aiv-dedup-1\">We first survey the various regulations involved, deferring until a subsequent section any detailed presentation of the procedural aspects of the rulemakings here in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-5\">1. <em>Petroleum Price Regulations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1576-6\">Prior to the rulemakings involved here, the Mandatory Petroleum Price Regulations,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 10 C.F.R. pt. 212, established limitations on the maximum prices refiners could charge in the sale of \u201ccovered products\u201d or of \u201cspecial products,\u201d such as motor gasoline.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under the \u201cprice rule,\u201d a refiner could \u201cnot charge to any class of purchaser a price in excess of the base price\u201d of the covered product except under certain specified conditions. 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.82 (1975). A \u201cclass of purchaser\u201d was defined as \u201cpurchasers ... to whom a person has charged a comparable price for comparable property or services pursuant to customary price differentials between those purchasers ... and other purchasers... . <em>\u201d </em>10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.31 (1975). One purpose of these price rules was to maintain the supplier-purchaser relationships as they existed in 1972-73, prior to the statutory regulation of the petroleum industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-12\">The \u201cbase price\u201d was \u201cthe weighted average price at which the item was lawfully priced in transactions with the class of purchaser concerned on May 15, 1973, plus increased product costs incurred between the month of measurement and the month of May 1973 . .. . \u201d 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.82(f)(l)(i) (1975). To calculate its base price for a given month, therefore, a refiner had to; 1) establish its classes of purchaser; 2) compute its increased product costs and apportion these among the various products it sold; and 3) allocate the increased costs for each product among its classes of purchasers of that product.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-13\">The \u201crefiner cost allocation formula\u201d governed apportionment of increased product costs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As it operated in January 1974, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1481\">*1481</page-number>formula yielded a cents per gallon figure, referred to as \u201cd\u00a1,\u201d that represented the maximum amount of increased product cost that a refiner might apportion to a given special product:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1577-4\">d\u00a1 = the dollar increase that may be applied in the period \u201cu\u201d (the current month) to the May 15, 1973, selling price of the special product ... to each class of purchaser to compute the base price to each class of purchaser ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1577-5\">10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.83(c)(2) (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-6\">The d\u00a1 calculation established the maximum increment of increased product costs a refiner could pass through to each class of purchaser of a particular special product. Since d\u00a1 was a single number, the result of the formula was the equal application of increased product costs among classes of purchasers when the maximum was passed through. This rule was designed to distribute the burden of increased costs as uniformly as feasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-7\">The Regulations, however, did not require refiners actually to charge the base price. In certain market conditions, refiners might choose to set prices below base price by not immediately passing on some of the increased product costs. Whether, as of January 15, 1974, refiners were obligated to pass through increased product costs equally to each class of purchaser when selling prices were below base price is a matter in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-8\">As noted, the Regulations did not require a refiner to recover all of its increased product costs for a given month in that month. The \u201ccost bank rule,\u201d 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.83(e)(1) (1975), allowed the refiner to carry over, or \u201cbank,\u201d its unrecovered increased product costs for inclusion in the calculation of base prices in a later month:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWX\">(e) Carryover of costs. (1) If in any month ... a firm charges prices for a special product which result in the re-coupment of less total revenues than the entire amount of increased product costs calculated for that product pursuant to the general formula ... the amount of increased products costs not recouped may be added to the May 15, 1973 selling prices to compute the base prices for that special product for a subsequent month.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AD-a\">Whenever a refiner added previously unre-couped costs to its current price, of course, it had to reduce its \u201cbank\u201d of these costs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1577-10\">In addition, the refiner could add to the base price certain increases in non-product costs incurred since May 1973 but only if the refiner satisfied certain profit margin limitations and complied with a prenotification procedure that required advance notice of the proposed price increase to the agency for its approval. 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.87 (1975). The sum of the base price and allowable nonproduct cost increases was the refiner\u2019s maximum lawful price.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-11\">2. <em>April 1974 Three-Gent </em>Rule<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ADze\">The \u201cretail price equalization,\u201d or \u201cthree-cent,\u201d rule, promulgated in April 1974, was a response to an unintended price disparity that had developed between independent and refiner-operated gasoline stations. <em>See </em>39 Fed.Reg. 12013, 13013-14 (April 2, 1974). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1482\">*1482</page-number>In January and February 1974, the FEO authorized independent and refiner-operated retailers of motor gasoline to increase their retail selling prices by up to three cents a gallon to reflect increases in nonpro-duct costs incurred in the marketing of gasoline. <em>See </em>39 Fed.Reg. 809 (Jan. 3, 1974); 39 Fed.Reg. 7795 (Feb. 28, 1974). Since refiner-operated stations were subject to profit margin and pre-notification restrictions, however, they generally did not attempt to recover the three cent marketing cost allowance. As a result, independents were faced with either foregoing the three cent allowance or being undersold by the refiner-operated stations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-4\">FEO responded by promulgating an amendment to the refiner cost allocation formula for calculating d\u00a1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK8\">d\u00a1 = The dollar increase that may be applied in the period \u201cu\u201d (the current month) to the May 15, 1973 selling price of [a special product] to each class of purchaser to compute the base price to each class of purchaser, except that the dollar increase that may be applied in the period \u201cu\u201d to the May 15, 1973 selling price of gasoline to compute the base prices to the classes of purchaser which purchase gasoline at retail from a refiner at service stations operated by employees of the refiner may be \u201cd\u00a1\u201d plus a maximum of $.03 per gallon of gasoline provided that, in computing \u201cdj,\u201d the numerator of the [general formula] is reduced by an amount equal to the product of the actual amount of cents per gallon increase added to \u201cd\u00a1\u201d above multiplied by the estimated number of gallons of gasoline to be sold during the period \u201cu\u201d at retail through service stations operated by employees of the refiner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1578-5\">10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.83(c)(2) (1975), 39 Fed.Reg. 12013 (April 2, 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-6\">The three cent rule thus allowed refiners to pass through an additional three cents per gallon of increased product costs in sales of motor gasoline at refiner-operated stations. The rule, however, did not increase the total amount of increased product costs a refiner could recover. The refiner had to subtract the dollar amount recovered under the three cent rule from the amount of increased product costs otherwise available for recovery under d\u00a1.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ap3-dedup-0\">3. <em>Deemed Recovery Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"AiWz\">In September 1974, without prior notice or opportunity for comment, and in reliance on the \u201cgood cause\u201d exception to this procedural requirement, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(B), the FEA promulgated an amendment to the cost bank rule. 39 Fed.Reg. 32306 (Sept. 5, 1974). The amendment, addressing a supposed \u201cambiguity\u201d in the Regulations and directed to preserving \u201ccustomary price differentials,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 32307, made explicit that the requirement that refiners pass through increased product costs equally among classes of purchaser applied to actual, and not just maximum, selling prices. It also provided for a \u201cdeemed recovery\u201d penalty should actual prices not reflect equal application of costs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1578-9\">\u00a7 212.83. Allocation of refiner\u2019s increased costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1578-10\">(e) <em>Carryover of costs.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1578-11\">(1) ... With respect to each special product . .. when a firm calculates the amount of increased product costs not recouped, which may be added to the May 15, 1973 selling prices to compute the base prices for that special product in a subsequent month, it shall calculate its revenues as though the greatest amount of increased product costs actually added to any May 15, 1973 selling price of that special product and included in the price charged to any class of purchaser, had been added, in the same amount, to the May 15, 1973 selling price of that special product and included in the price charged to each class of purchaser; except that, where an equal amount of increased product cost is not included in the price charged to a purchaser because of a price term of a written contract covering the sale of such product which was entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1483\">*1483</page-number>into on or before September 1, 1974, that portion of the increased product costs not included in the price charged to such a purchaser need not be included in the calculation of revenues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1579-5\">10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.83(e)(1) (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-6\">Under the deemed recovery rule, then, the refiner had to pass through increased product costs uniformly among all classes of purchaser or suffer a cost recovery penalty. Specifically, each month the refiner was required to compute its bank of unrecov-ered costs as though it had charged <em>all </em>classes of purchaser the largest increment of increased costs it charged to any one class of purchaser, even though, in fact, it did not. If a refiner applied increased costs unequally, thus, it had to reduce its bank of previously unrecouped costs by an amount that was larger than the amount of increased costs actually recouped. The refiner, that is, was \u201cdeemed\u201d to have recovered costs it, in fact, did not. By penalizing selective price increases, therefore, the deemed recovery rule provided an economic incentive for equal pass through of increased product costs in actual selling prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-7\">In the September 5,1974 rulemaking, the FEA stated that it intended to hold public hearings regarding proposed revisions to the Regulations and that, at that time, it would receive comments on the deemed recovery amendment. 39 Fed.Reg. at 32307. On September 10, 1974, the FEA published a notice of a proposed \u201ccomprehensive revision\u201d of the Regulations. 39 Fed.Reg. 32718 (Sept. 10, 1974). The proposed revisions included certain modifications of the rules governing equal application of increased product costs and the recoupment of unrecovered increased product costs. <em>Id </em>at 32718-24. The FEA received oral and written comments on the proposed revisions. On December 5, 1974, the FEA re-promulgated the deemed recovery rule in its September 5, 1974 form. 39 Fed.Reg. 42368, 42372 (Dec. 5, 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-8\">4. <em>May 1977 Three Cent Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"ark-dedup-1\">On January 27, 1977, the FEA published various amendments affecting the pricing of gasoline. One change modified the definition of d\u00a1, altering it from a cents per gallon figure to a total dollar figure of increased product costs that a refiner could allocate to a given product. 42 Fed.Reg. 5030, 5031 (Jan. 27, 1977). This new definition did not contain the three cent retail price equalization rule that had been introduced into the definition of d\u00a1 in April 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-10\">On May 5, 1977, without prior notice or opportunity for comment, and in reliance on the interpretive rule exemption to this procedural requirement, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(A), the FEA published a \u201ccorrective amendment\u201d to the price rule to replace the \u201cinadvertently omitted\u201d three cent rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1579-11\">\u00a7 212.83 Price Rule .. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1579-12\">(h) <em>Equal Application among classes of purchaser . . .</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1579-13\">(2) <em>Special Rules ...</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1579-14\">(iv) Retail sales of gasoline by refiners. When a refiner calculates the amount of increased costs not recouped that may be added to May 15, 1973, selling prices of gasoline to compute maximum allowable prices in a subsequent month, it may, notwithstanding the general rule in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, compute revenues as though (A) the greatest amount of increased costs actually added to any May 15, 1973, selling price of gasoline and included in the price charged to any class of purchaser that purchases gasoline at retail from a refiner at any service station operated by employees of the refiner had been added to the May 15, 1973, selling price of gasoline and included in tjie price charged to any class of purchaser that purchases gasoline at retail from a refiner at any service station operated by employees of the refiner had been added, in the same amount (less any actual differential or three cents per gallon, whichever is less) to the May 15, 1973 selling prices of gasoline and included in the price charged to all other classes of purchaser.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1579-15\">10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.83(h)(2)(iv) (1978), 42 Fed. Reg. 22881 (May 5, 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1484\">*1484</page-number>The FEA indicated that this new three cent rule was merely making explicit the equal application requirement, and deemed recovery penalty, that was implicit in the original three cent rule. Id.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1580-4\">In March 1978, Mobil filed a request for a formal interpretation of the three cent rule. The FEA ruled that, since its inception in April 1974, the three cent rule was but a \u201climited\u201d exception to the equal application requirement. Although it permitted unequal recovery of increased product costs as between retail classes of purchaser of motor gasoline as a group and all other classes of purchaser of gasoline, it did \u201cnot authorize any price variations between individual refiner owned stations without penalty.\u201d <em>Mobil Oil Corp., </em>Interp. no. 78-53, 43 Fed.Reg. 40207 (Feb. 11, 1978), 6 En.Mgmt. [CCH] \u00b6 56,444 (1978). <em>See Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>Interp. 78-36, 43 Fed.Reg. 29541 (June 9, 1978), 6 En.Mgmt. [CCH] \u00b6 56,427 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-5\">In the FEA\u2019s view, therefore, whenever, under the three cent rule, a refiner passed through $.03 of increased product costs to any one refiner-operated gasoline station, it would be deemed to have passed through the full $.03 to all refiner-operated stations even though, in fact, it did not.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AYd\">B. <em>Proceedings in the District Courts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1580-6\">In January 1979, Mobil brought an action challenging the validity of the new three cent rule and, alternatively, of the September 1974 deemed recovery rule. Mobil\u2019s position was that by reading an equal application requirement and deemed recovery penalty into the three cent rule, at least among individual refiner operated stations, the new three cent rule did not merely interpret the Regulations but substantively changed them. Accordingly, since the FEA did not follow notice and comment procedures in promulgating it, the new three cent rule was procedurally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-9\">Mobil maintained that, under the rule as promulgated in April 1974, there was no requirement that recovery of the three cent allowance be uniform among classes of purchaser or among refiner operated gasoline stations. Mobil further argued that the September 5, 1974 deemed recovery rule applied only to the d\u00a1 increment and not to recovery of the three cent allowance. Should the district court have been inclined to a different view of the effect of the September deemed recovery rule on the three cent rule, Mobil, in the alternative, argued that the deemed recovery rule itself was procedurally invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-10\">In the district court, the DOE pressed the position that the September deemed recovery rule by its terms applied to <em>all </em>increased product costs passed through in actual selling prices, including the three cent allowance. Thus, whether the three cent rule contained an equal application requirement and imposed a deemed recovery penalty in April 1974 <em>vel non, </em>it did so in September 1974. The 1977 rule, therefore, was merely an interpretive elaboration of the existing regulatory scheme. The DOE additionally maintained that the deemed recovery rule was validly promulgated in September 1974 under the \u201cgood cause\u201d exception, and, further, validly repromulgated in December 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-11\">The district court agreed with Mobil that, as promulgated in April 1974, the three cent rule \u201ccontained no equal application requirement pertaining to the pass-through of increased product costs .. .. \u201d <em>Mobil v. DOE, supra, </em>547 F.Supp. 1246,1270. See <em>id. </em>at 1266. The district court, however, never ruled on the impact of the September 1974 deemed recovery rule on the April 1974 three cent rule. Rather, the court invalida<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1485\">*1485</page-number>ted the deemed recovery rule as procedurally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-5\">The court found there was no emergency in September 1974 justifying the FEA\u2019s bypass of the notice and comment procedures. <em>Id. </em>at 1268-69.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court also rejected the argument that the deemed recovery rule was validly repromulgated in December 1974, finding that the September 10, 1974 notice of proposed rulemaking was inadequate to inform interested parties that the agency was evaluating the deemed recovery rule <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 1269.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-6\">Since there was no equal application requirement inherent in the April 1974 three cent rule and the September 1974 deemed recovery rule was procedurally invalid and, thus, a nullity, the May 1977 three cent rule effected a substantive change in the Regulations. Since the FEA promulgated this rule without following notice and comment procedures, it, too, was procedurally invalid. For these reasons, the district court entered summary judgment in favor of Mobil.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-7\">In January 1979, Naph-Sol brought an action to recover price overcharges allegedly incurred in its purchase of refined petroleum product from Murphy Oil Corp. Naph-Sol\u2019s claim that Murphy\u2019s prices were in excess of the maximum allowed under the Petroleum Price Regulations was, principally, two fold.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1581-8\">First, Naph-Sol alleged that the price that Murphy charged on May 15, 1973 was in excess of that permitted by the parties\u2019 supply contract and, therefore, that Murphy used an unlawful May 15 price in calculating its maximum allowable price under the Regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-9\">Second, Naph-Sol contended that Murphy computed its selling prices in violation of the equal application and deemed recovery requirements. Thus, Naph-Sol claimed that Murphy passed through increased product costs unequally and then computed its cost bank without regard to the deemed recovery principle. Murphy thereby calculated its prices to purchasers as though banked, unreeouped cost increases were available to be passed through when, under the deemed recovery rule, they were not. This resulted in overcharges to purchasers, of whom Naph-Sol was one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-11\">On September 17, 1982, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Murphy on the unlawful May 15 selling price claim and, on October 1, 1982, it granted summary judgment to Murphy on the deemed recovery rule violation claim. The district court ruled, as a matter of law, that the price Murphy charged Naph-Sol on May 15, 1973 was permissible under the supply contracts between the parties. There was, therefore, no contractual violation and, consequently, no regulatory violation. <em>Naph-Sol v. Murphy Oil Corp., supra, </em>550 F.Supp. at 305-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-12\">The court also invalidated the deemed recovery rule on procedural grounds. The court found that no emergency existed in September 1974. <em>Id. </em>at 322-23. Additionally, the court held that the deemed recovery rule was not validly repromulgated since the December 5, 1974 publication did not include an adequate statement of the basis and purpose for retaining the rule. <em>Id. </em>at 323-24. This ruling effectively disposed of Naph-Sol\u2019s claim that it was entitled to recover for overcharges due to Murphy\u2019s violation of the deemed recovery rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-13\">II. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1581-14\">The judicial review provisions of \u00a7 211(d)(1) of the Economic Stabilization Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1904 note, which were incorporated into the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 754(a)(1), limit the scope of our review to a determination of whether regulations were issued in excess of agency authority, are arbitrary or capricious, or otherwise not in accordance with law under the criteria set forth in 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1486\">*1486</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The relevant provisions of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2) are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1582-4\">The reviewing court shall\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1582-5\">(2) hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1582-6\">(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1582-7\">(D) without observance of procedure required by law ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1582-8\">The Supreme Court, drawing on its earlier decisions in <em>Bowman Transportation Inc. v.

Nevertheless, the agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a \u201crational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1582-10\"><em>Motor Vehicle Manufacturer\u2019s Ass\u2019n v.

A reviewing court, thus, may not set aside an agency rule that is the product of reasoned decisionmaking, based on consideration of relevant factors, and within the scope of the authority delegated to the agency by statute. <em>See id. </em>at 2866, 2871. This court has followed the \u201crational basis\u201d test. <em>See McCulloch Gas Processing Corp. </em>v. <em>DOE, </em>650 F.2d 1216, 1221 (TECA 1981) (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-14\">An agency\u2019s procedural compliance with statutory norms, however, is subject to closer scrutiny. The reviewing court, having competence in this area, must satisfy itself that there was procedural integrity in the promulgation of the regulations in question. See <em>ITT World Communications v. FCC, </em>699 F.2d 1219, 1246 (D.C.Cir.1983); <em>National Resources Defense Council </em>v. <em>SEC, </em>606 F.2d 1031, 1048 (D.C.Cir.1979); <em>Weyer-haeuser Co. </em>v. <em>Costle, </em>590 F.2d 1011, 1027 (D.C.Cir.1978). Nevertheless, although a court may exercise greater independent judgment when reviewing agency action on procedural, rather than substantive grounds, <em>see id., </em>to the extent that the requisite procedures involve factual determinations, deference is still afforded to agency judgments. <em>See Philadelphia Citizens in Action v. Schweiker, </em>669 F.2d 877, 886 (3d Cir.1982) (\u201cgood cause\u201d determination); <em>Coalition of Michigan Nursing Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dempsey, </em>537 F.Supp. 451, 458 (E.D.Mich.1982) (same). The ultimate question remains whether or not the agency\u2019s action was arbitrary and capricious, that is, unreasonable. <em>See ITT v. FCC, supra, </em>699 F.2d at 1246; <em>Philadelphia Citizens v. Schweiker, supra, </em>669 F.2d at 886; <em>NRDC v.

Dole, </em>707 F.2d 116, 118 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Committee for An Independent P-I v. The Hearst Corp., </em>704 F.2d 467, 472 (9th Cir.1983); <em>Brown v.

The district court in <em>Mobil v. DOE </em>considered and rejected the argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHn\">Inasmuch as the focus of this action is upon the May 5,1977 three cent rule, and in view of the relatively brief period of time between the issuance of the rule and the commencement of this action .. . this Court is not inclined to dismiss this action on the ground of laches.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1583-7\">547 F.Supp. at 1265. Although we recognize that laches is an equitable defense addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, <em>see, e.g., Moore v. Smith, </em>694 F.2d 115, 119 (6th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 1442, 75 L.Ed.2d 798 (1983); <em>University of Pittsburgh v. Champion Products, </em>686 F.2d 1040, 1045 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1087, 103 S.Ct. 571, 74 L.Ed.2d 933 (1982); <em>Dickey v. Alcoa Steamship Co., </em>641 F.2d 81, 82 (2d Cir.1981), we cannot uphold the <em>Mobil </em>court\u2019s laches ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-11\">By asking the district court to declare the 1974 deemed recovery rule invalid on procedural grounds, Mobil shifted the \u201cfocus\u201d of this action. This is no less true because Mobil\u2019s challenge to the validity of the 1974 rule remains embedded within its challenge to the validity of the 1977 rule. The \u201cfocus\u201d might reasonably be said to be the 1977 rule if this action involved merely the proper interpretation of the 1974 rule. Mobil, however, moved the case considerably beyond this.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Moreover, there is no logical stopping place to the district court\u2019s \u201cfocus\u201d analysis. New rules typically build on existing ones and an action to declare a current rule invalid could always be cast, in the alternative, as a challenge to the longstanding rule on which the new rule is premised. Under the district court\u2019s reasoning, since the \u201cfocus\u201d would be on the new rule, lach-es could never bar the challenge to the old rule, no matter how untimely, or how prejudicial to the defendant. This argument ignores the basic equitable precepts that lach-es reflects and, as well, would seriously undermine administrative stability. It cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-14\">Mobil, however, also urges that laches is not available in a \u201cdefensive\u201d declaratory judgment action like that here. Mobil argues as follows. Statutes of limitations, and laches, do not run against defenses. Mobil therefore would be able to assert the procedural invalidity of the deemed recovery rule in an enforcement action brought by the DOE. Although nominally the \u201cplaintiff\u201d in the pre-enforcement declaratory judgment action now before the court, Mobil must be viewed in the context of its being the defendant in an enforcement action. Since DOE cannot raise laches in an enforcement action, it should not be permitted to raise laches in a declaratory judgment action seeking only to establish the validity of a defense to the anticipated enforcement action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-15\">It is true that laches, and statutes of limitations, do not run against a defense. <em>See, e.g., 118 East 60th Owners v. Bonner Properties, </em>677 F.2d 200, 203 (2d Cir.1982); <em>Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, </em>277 F.2d 615, 623-24 (10th Cir.1960); these doctrines are available \u201c \u2018only as a shield, not as a sword.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623-24 (citations omitted). There is little authority, however, on the question whether a declaratory judgment plaintiff like Mobil can, for these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1488\">*1488</page-number>purposes, be assimilated to the status of a defendant; what there is suggests that it may not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-4\">Thus, in <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967), which held that a pre-enforcement action for declaratory relief could be entertained by the courts if ripeness and exhaustion requirements were met, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1584-5\">Further, the declaratory judgment and injunctive remedies are equitable in nature, and other equitable defenses may be interposed.... The defense of laches could be asserted if the Government is prejudiced by a delay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1584-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 155, 87 S.Ct. at 1519 (citations omitted). One district court, in part relying on <em>Abbott, </em>has held that a pre-enforcement declaratory judgment action challenging the validity of the deemed recovery rule was properly characterized as \u201caffirmative\u201d in nature:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1584-7\">[Pjlaintiff has had a claim for relief ripe from the institution of the regulations. That claim when it became ripe was not defensive in nature, but affirmative.... Without regard to the institution of administrative enforcement proceedings, plaintiff has had an equitable claim for relief since 1974. The interposition of the administrative proceedings does not alter the affirmative nature of this claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeqO\"><em>United Refining Co. v. DOE, </em>Civ. No. 79-144, slip op. at 4-5 (W.D.Pa.1983). Laches therefore was available to the DOE.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1584-8\">We find it particularly difficult to view Mobil\u2019s challenge to the deemed recovery rule as \u201cdefensive.\u201d Mobil, presumably, anticipates being a defendant in an action to enforce the 1977 three cent rule and, thus, aims preemptively to establish the nonen-forceability of that rule. Mobil\u2019s declaratory judgment action, however, goes considerably further: it challenges the validity of a rule other than the one whose enforcement is, ostensibly, impending. Although the 1974 deemed recovery rule might somehow be related to the 1977 rule, in these circumstances it would be stretching concepts far too thin to characterize Mobil\u2019s challenge to the deemed recovery rule as defensive, or to consider Mobil only \u201cnominally\u201d a plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-11\">Accordingly, since it is clear that laches can be invoked against a declaratory judgment plaintiff who affirmatively challenges an agency rule, <em>see, e.g., Citizens and Landowners Against the Miles City/New Underwood Powerline v. Secretary of DOE, </em>683 F.2d 1171, 1175 (8th Cir.1982); <em>Independent Bankers Assoc. </em>v. <em>Heimann, </em>627 F.2d 486, 487 (D.C.Cir.1980); <em>Michigan v. City of Allen Park, </em>501 F.Supp. 1007, 1016-18 (E.D. Mich.1980) (counterclaim); cf. <em>Energy Cooperative Inc. v. DOE, </em>659 F.2d 146 (TECA 1981) (exhaustion of remedies), we find that laches is available to the DOE.</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-12\">Laches reflects the principle that \u201cequity aids the vigilant, not those who slumber on their rights.\u201d <em>Gull Airborne Instruments </em>v. <em>Weinberger, </em>694 F.2d 838, 843 (D.C.Cir.1982), quoting 2 J. Pomeroy, <em>Equity Jurisprudence </em>\u00a7 418 (5th ed. 1941). Two elements are essential to a laches defense: 1) inexcusable delay in instituting suit; and 2) prejudice to the defendant from such delay. <em>See, e.g., Gulf Airborne, supra, </em>694 F.2d at 843; <em>University of Pittsburgh v. Champion Products, supra, </em>696 F.2d at 1044.</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-13\">Many of DOE\u2019s arguments with respect to delay and prejudice, on their face, are impressive. First, and most significantly, is the obvious fact that Mobil\u2019s procedural challenge is brought some five years after the fact of promulgation. Mobil and other oil companies promptly challenged other regulations issued at essentially the same time as the deemed recovery rule and there has been no satisfactory explanation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1489\">*1489</page-number>of why, in this case, there was a delay. This is particularly significant here since the judicial review provision in \u00a7 211 of the Economic Stabilization Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1904 note, was expressly designed to ensure prompt review of agency action. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 92-507, 92nd Cong., 1st Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1971 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 2283, 2292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-4\">The apparent effects of the delay are considerable. DOE would now be unable to cure any procedural infirmity by repromul-gating the deemed recovery rule. It is arguable that invalidation at this juncture would run afoul of congressional intent with respect to petroleum pricing in the period of controls. There is some evidence that Congress never explicitly enacted equal application legislation because, in part, the deemed recovery rule existed. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 94-26, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 37-38 (1975). Moreover, invalidation'could be seen as prejudicing those refiners who had set their prices in accordance with the rule. Finally, the lost time and expense of DOE\u2019s ongoing enforcement actions is to be considered.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1585-5\">Nevertheless, we cannot decide the merits of the laches defense on the present record. All else being equal, we would be inclined to remand the case for factual findings on the question of delay and prejudice. In view of the <em>Naph-Sol v. Murphy </em>appeal, however, we would not thereby be relieved of the responsibility of deciding the merits of the procedural validity of the deemed recovery rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-6\">Murphy raised its challenge to the validity of the deemed recovery rule as a defense to Naph-Sol\u2019s claim that it was overcharged due to Murphy\u2019s violation of the rule.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although we recognize that this suit, unlike an ordinary contract action, implicates a regulatory scheme and not simply the rights of the parties, we believe that Murphy\u2019s challenge falls within the rule that laches does not run against a defense. Naph-Sol cannot both seek to recover payments and bar Murphy from defending by challenging the statutory basis upon which the claim for recovery is based. Murphy\u2019s procedural challenge, thus, cannot be barred by laches; the <em>Naph-Sol </em>appeal, therefore, cannot be decided on laches grounds. In view of this, and given our view of the deemed recovery rule issue, we proceed to decide both cases on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-11\">IV. <em>Validity of the Deemed Recovery Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1585-12\">Before considering the validity of the deemed recovery rule, the subject matter of this section, one further issue, relevant to the <em>Mobil v. DOE </em>appeal, must .be addressed. DOE\u2019s 1978 Interpretations of the three cent rule seemingly found that an equal application requirement, with a deemed recovery component, was inherent in the original April 1974 rule. If this were true, the May 1977 three cent rule could be upheld as an interpretive rule whether or not the September 1974 deemed recovery rule was valid. The district court, interpreting the language of the original three cent rule, and relying on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Standard Oil Co. v. DOE, </em>596 F.2d 1029, 1040-45 (TECA 1978), held that the April 1974 three cent rule did not, of its own force, require that the three cent cost allowance be equally applied. In reaching this result, the court gave little weight to the agency interpretations to the contrary. 547 F.Supp. at 1266-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-13\">The DOE apparently has abandoned the position that an equal application requirement was implicit in the original three cent rule. Its brief on appeal makes no mention of the argument and, indeed, its summary judgment brief in the district court renounces it. <em>See </em>Stip. Record p. 000777. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1490\">*1490</page-number>view of this, and based on our reading of the regulations as of April 1974, we find it unnecessary to expand on the district court\u2019s analysis of this issue, which we adopt. Accordingly, the May 1977 three cent rule cannot be upheld as an interpretive rule without a consideration of the impact of the deemed recovery rule on it. We therefore finally turn to the question of the procedural validity of the deemed recovery rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-4\">A. <em>September 5, 1974 Rulemaking: Good Cause Exception</em></p>\n<p id=\"apd-dedup-0\">The notice and comment procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551 <em>et seq., </em>and the Federal Energy Administration Act (FEAA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 761 <em>et seq., </em>applied to FEA\u2019s September 5, 1974 promulgation of the deemed recovery rule. The FEA did not observe these requirements, relying on the \u201cgood cause\u201d exceptions in each act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-5\">Under the APA, an agency may promulgate a rule without prior notice and comment</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1586-6\">when the agency for good cause finds (and incorporates the finding in a brief statement of reasons therefor in the rules issued) that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable,.unnecessary or contrary to the public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1586-7\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(B).

DOE, supra, </em>650 F.2d at 1221; <em>Mobil Oil Corp. v.

DOE, supra, </em>610 F.2d at 804, but may uphold a finding of good cause justified by obvious and compelling facts that can be judicially noticed. <em>See National Helium Corp. v. FEA, </em>569 F.2d 1137, 1141-46 (TECA 1977); <em>Nader v. Sawhill, </em>514 F.2d 1064, 1068 (TECA 1975). The waiver provision of the FEAA is similarly to be used sparingly. <em>See </em>Sen.Conf.Rep. No. 93-788, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1974] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2939, 2977. Despite the narrowness of the exceptions, we are persuaded that FEA had \u201cgood cause\u201d for promulgating the deemed recovery rule without prior notice and opportunity for comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-13\">The preamble to the deemed recovery rule explained that the amendment was intended to clarify an \u201cambiguity\u201d in the Regulations by putting</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOg\">all sellers .. . expressly on notice that \u25a0prices actually charged, and not merely prices calculated as a lawful maximum, must reflect the equal application of increased product costs, except where a pre-existing contract prevents the implementation of such a price.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1586-14\">39 Fed.Reg. 32306, 32307 (Sept. 5, 1974). Although \u201cmost sellers\u201d had been equally applying costs in prices below base prices,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"abo-dedup-0\">(a)s an improved supply situation has begun to have a restraining influence on prices, the FEA has become aware that certain sellers have taken the position that they may selectively \u2018bank\u2019 increased product costs as to certain classes of purchaser, for recoupment in a subsequent month, as long as the prices charged to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1491\">*1491</page-number>other classes of purchaser do not exceed the maximum lawful price.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1587-5\"><em>Id. </em>Such practices \u201ccould obviously serve to avoid the intent of the overall framework of the price regulations,\u201d particularly the goal of preserving the \u201ccustomary price differentials\u201d among classes of purchaser. <em>See id. </em>The deemed recovery rule was designed to prevent this.</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-6\">The FEA promulgated the rule without prior notice and comment, finding that an emergency existed and explaining that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKiv\">[A]s the supply situation becomes more favorable, the incentive to depart from the equal application requirement becomes stronger. Moreover, announcement of these amendments as proposals would highlight current ambiguities in the regulations and could result in sellers seeking to take advantage of that ambiguity or of the contract exception to the regulation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1587-7\">The FEA has determined that the continuation or initiation of such practices would be injurious to the public welfare, in view of the number of circumventions of FEA regulations and the substantial compliance difficulties which would result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1587-8\">According to appellants, then, the FEA feared that highlighting the gap in the Regulations through advance notice would promote discriminatory pricing against independent distributors and, as well, against certain regions of the country, particularly the Northeast. By passing through proportionately greater costs to independent outlets, for instance, refiners could threaten the competitive viability of the independents. Moreover, there was a risk that refiners would seek to take advantage of the \u201ccontract exception\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> to the deemed recovery rule and \u201cgrandfather in\u201d unequal cost pass-throughs to refiner operated stations by entering into long-term contracts. Thus, advance notice would result in severe market dislocations and erosion of the class of purchaser scheme so central to the Price Regulations, thereby justifying waiver of notice and comment procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1587-13\">Both district courts rejected this argument, finding that the circumstances did not warrant dispensing with notice and comment procedures:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1587-14\">Here, there was no compelling circumstances surrounding the discriminatory pricing practices cited by the agency. No users had been totally deprived of a supply of motor gasoline, no violence had surfaced or appeared imminent, and, more importantly, no sudden, disruptive change appears to have occurred with respect to either the distribution or pricing of motor gasoline on or about the time the September 5, 1974 rule had issued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1587-15\"><em>Mobil v. DOE, supra, </em>547 F.Supp. at 1269; <em>accord Naph-Sol v.

Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 6.29 (Supp. 1982).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Although it is not free from doubt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1492\">*1492</page-number>both district courts here appeared to find that, as a matter of law, this is the only sort of exigency that would justify by-passing the notice and comment procedure. On a number of occasions, however, this court has held that, in special circumstances, good cause can exist when the very announcement of a proposed rule itself can be expected to precipitate activity by affected parties that would harm the public welfare. <em>See Nader v. Sawhill, supra, </em>514 F.2d at 1068; <em>DeRieux v. Five Smiths, Inc., </em>499 F.2d 1321, 1332 (TECA), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 896, 95 S.Ct. 176, 42 L.Ed.2d 141 (1974); see <em>also Reeves v. Simon, supra, </em>507 F.2d at 458-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b1588-4\">We recognize that agencies might frequently assert that someone will take advantage of the situation if advance notice is given. If the exception is not to become an all purpose escape-clause, therefore, the anticipated response must involve a significant threat of serious damage to important public interests. The circumstances in the present case perhaps were less \u201ccalamitous,\u201d <em>see Nader v. Sawhill, supra, </em>514 F.2d at 1068, than where announcement of a future price increase would exacerbate existing oil supply shortages, <em>see id., </em>or announcement of a future price freeze would generate a \u201cmassive rush to raise prices.\u201d <em>DeRieux v. Five Smiths, supra, </em>499 F.2d at 1332. Nevertheless, in view of the emergency conditions prompting the petroleum price legislation, <em>see Pasco v. FEA, </em>525 F.2d 1391, 1394 (TECA 1975), and assuming that announcement of the deemed recovery rule would cause price discrimination and other market dislocations and dampen competition, we find that the threat to the public would be sufficiently dire for good cause to be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b1588-5\">The question thus becomes whether, as a matter of fact, FEA\u2019s finding of good cause is supported by the administrative record. It appears that the district .courts were skeptical, and appellees here urge that there is no showing that in fact independents would be injured during the notice and comment period. In considering this question it is essential to recognize that we are being called upon, some eight years after the fact, to review agency determinations that were, in large measure, of a judgmental or predictive nature. Whether, in the economic circumstances of late summer 1974, independents and geographic regions were particularly vulnerable to price discrimination and, more importantly, whether refiners were likely to engage in discriminatory pricing if informed of the impending rule change, are not strictly factual questions; they involve subjective judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1588-7\">Judgments of a predictive nature \u201cnecessarily involve deductions based on expert knowledge of the Agency\u201d; complete factual support in the record \u201cis not possible or required.\u201d <em>FCC </em>v. <em>National Citizens Committee for Broadcasting, </em>436 U.S. 775, 814, 98 S.Ct. 2096, 2121, 56 L.Ed.2d 697 (1978); <em>accord NAACP v. FCC, </em>682 F.2d 993, 1001 (D.C.Cir.1982); <em>NRDC v. SEC, supra, </em>606 F.2d at 1052; <em>see also Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mutual Ins. Co., supra, </em>103 S.Ct. at 2871-72. Since forecasts are not susceptible of strict factual proof, they are, in the context of substantive agency decision making, entitled to special deference. The court must simply satisfy itself that the agency explains the facts and policy concerns it relies on and that, given these, a reasonable person could have made the judgment the agency did. See <em>NAACP v. FCC, supra, </em>682 F.2d at 1001; <em>NRDC v. SEC, supra, </em>606 F.2d at 1052. Admittedly, as our discussion in part II suggests, this extreme deference might be inappropriate in reviewing compliance with procedural requirements. Nevertheless, our examination of FEA\u2019s proffered good cause rationale must reflect the predictive element in the agency\u2019s determination and the agency\u2019s special expertise over such questions. <em>See generally </em>K. Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 29.00-1 (Supp.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1588-8\">Although September 1974 was a period of increasing oil supply, it was still a volatile time, not that far removed from the Arab oil embargo of fall 1973, and far distant from the relative stability in the oil market of 1979 or 1983. Given the changed market conditions in late summer 1974, the rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1493\">*1493</page-number>tively recent awareness that this was encouraging selective cost banking, and the policy of preserving the class of purchaser scheme, we are unable to say' that the FEA\u2019s judgment that notice would lead to price discrimination and pressure on independents and regions was unreasonable. It is easy, in retrospect, to state th\u00e1t FEA\u2019s fears were exaggerated. FEA, however, was in a better position in August 1974 to appreciate the economic dynamics of the oil industry at that time than the courts are today; we must avoid being hampered by 20/20 hindsight. Certainly, just as \u201cthe announcement of a price increase at a future date <em>could </em>have resulted in producers withholding .crude oil from the market,\u201d <em>Nader v. Sawhill, supra, </em>514 F.2d at 1068 (emphasis added), and advance notice of a price freeze led to a \u201cmassive rush to raise prices,\u201d <em>DeRieux v. Five Smiths, supra, </em>499 F.2d at 1332, announcement of the deemed recovery rule could have generated selective pricing and \u201cgrandfathering\u201d of unequal prices in favor of refiner-operated stations. We are not in a position to second-guess this judgment, or the determination that this would have contributed significantly to eroding the class of purchaser scheme and undermining competitive forces.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-5\">Moreover, no one claimed otherwise in September of 1974. None of the oil companies, who were not reluctant to challenge regulations, rejected the FEA\u2019s good cause argument by attacking the procedural validity of the deemed recovery rule in 1974 or 1975. This gives some credence to the FEA\u2019s predictive judgment and finding of good cause. So, too, do the numerous comments independents submitted to the FEA in response to the FEA\u2019s concern that independents and regions were susceptible to discriminatory pricing.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>' For these reasons, we conclude that the record supports FEA\u2019s good cause finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-9\">Appellees also argue that the September 5 preamble did not adequately recite the reasons for FEA\u2019s finding of good cause.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In particular, they contend that the FEA\u2019s supposed concern with price discrimination and solicitude for independents and geographic regions is simply a post-hoc rationalization advanced by appellants in these actions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-10\">In the September 5 preamble, the FEA indicated that some sellers were \"selectively banking] increased product costs as to certain classes of purchaser,\u201d while charging others the \u201cmaximum lawful price,\u201d 39 Fed. Reg. 32306, 32307 (Sept. 5, 1974), that the \u201cimproved supply situation\u201d provided an \u201cincentive\u201d for sellers to engage in such practices, <em>id., </em>and that announcement of the proposed amendment would prompt sellers \u201cto take advantage of the situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We find this a sufficiently clear expression of concern with price discrimination. The September 5 preamble, it is true, did not specifically mention independents and regions of the country. The- preamble, however, stated that a notice of hearings on proposed revisions of the Regulations would appear \u201cin the near future,\u201d <em>id., </em>which turned out to be September 10, 1974. The September 10 notice did explicitly indicate that the deemed recovery rule served to protect independents, and regions, from selective pricing. See 39 Fed.Reg. 32718, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1494\">*1494</page-number>32722-23 (Sept. 10, 1974). The September 10 notice was a contemporaneous statement of the agency\u2019s views, and not within the \u201cmade for litigation\u201d rationalization proscribed by <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 196, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 1577, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1590-4\">For the foregoing reasons we conclude that the FEA was justified in using emergency rulemaking procedures to promulgate the deemed recovery rule under the APA, and under \u00a7 7(i)(l)(B) of the FEAA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 766(i)(1)(B), as well. <em>See Shimek </em>v. <em>DOE, </em>685 F.2d 1372, 1374-76 (TECA 1981); <em>Dorchester Gas Producing Co. v. DOE, </em>Civil No. CA-3-75-0836, slip op. at 18 (N.D.Tex. June 24, 1983). Accordingly, we hold that the deemed recovery rule was validly promulgated on September 5, 1974. The decisions of the district courts on this issue were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-5\">B. <em>December 5, 1974 Rulemaking</em></p>\n<p id=\"aps-dedup-0\">Even had the September 5, 1974 promulgation been procedurally defective, the infirmity would have been cured by the rule-making commencing on September 10, 1974 and concluding on December 5, 1974. Both district courts held that the deemed recovery rule was not validly repromulgated, the <em>Mobil </em>court finding that the September 10 notice was inadequate and the <em>Naph-Sol </em>court holding that the December 5 publication did not contain an adequate statement of \u201cbasis and purpose\u201d with respect to the deemed recovery rule. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-6\">1. <em>Adequacy of the September 10, 1974 Notice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1590-7\">The APA requires that notice of a proposed rule be published in the <em>Federal Register </em>and include \u201ceither the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(3), and that interested persons be given an opportunity to comment on the rule. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 553(c). The stricter FEAA required that notice \u201cshall be given by publication of [the] proposed rule\u201d in the <em>Federal Register </em>and that a \u201cminimum of ten days following such publication shall be provided for opportunity for comment.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 766(i)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-10\">Notice and the opportunity to comment serve to educate the agency, provide fair treatment to persons affected by the rule, and assist judicial review.. <em>See Small Refiner Lead Phase-Down Task Force v. EPA, </em>705 F.2d 506, 547 (D.C.Cir.1983); <em>Standard Oil Co. v. DOE, supra, </em>596 F.2d at 1057-58; <em>Shell Oil Co. v. FEA, </em>574 F.2d 512, 516 (TECA 1978).

DOE, </em>655 F.2d 1118, 1126 n. 6 (TECA 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-11\">In this instance, the basic question is whether the September 10 notice revealed FEA\u2019s willingness to reevaluate the deemed recovery rule<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> or, rather, that the agency\u2019s mind was closed. <em>See id. </em>at 1127 n. 7; <em>Texaco Inc. v. FEA, supra, </em>531 F.2d at 1078-79; <em>State of South Carolina ex rel. Patrick v. Block, </em>558 F.Supp. 1004, 1020 (D.S.C.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-12\">The September 10 notice proposed the elimination of the equal application requirements with two exceptions: 1) within a given geographic marketing area the costs passed through to a class of purchaser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1495\">*1495</page-number>including independents could not be greater than those passed through to classes of purchaser not including independents; and 2) the unequal pass through of costs as between marketing areas could not exceed 10%. 39 Fed.Reg. 32718, 32727 (Sept. 10, 1974) (proposed 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.83(c)(l)(iii)). The \u201ccost bank\u201d rule proposed on September 10 deleted the deemed recovery penalty as it had appeared in the September 5 promulgation. <em>See </em>39 Fed.Reg. at 32729 (proposed 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.83(l)(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-5\">The September 10 preamble expressly reserved judgment on placing restrictions on the unequal pass through of costs as between regions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1591-6\">Comments are specifically requested on <em>whether this limitation on proposed regional flexibility in pricing is needed </em>and, if so, whether the proposed 10 percent limitation is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1591-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 32723 (emphasis added). The preamble also stated that \u201cto the extent that the current [equal application] requirement serves to protect the independent sector of the market, FEA has concluded that it must be retained.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1591-8\">This last statement reveals that the FEA indeed was committed to protecting independents. Nevertheless, in view of the September 5 preamble\u2019s promising an opportunity to comment on the deemed recovery rule; the deletion of the deemed recovery penalty in its September 5 form from the September 10 proposed rule; the elimination of other equal application requirements; and the solicitation of comments on the limitation on unequal pass throughs among regions, we do not find that the September 10 notice, taken as a whole, establishes that the agency was unprepared to reevaluate the deemed recovery rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-11\">Moreover, the reaction to the notice shows that interested parties were alerted that the deemed -recovery rule was under review. Many of the comments from the large refiners. urged repeal of the deemed recovery rule and all equal application requirements, while others proposed extensive revisions.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Independents, on the other hand, supported retention of the existing rules.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Our reading of these comments convinces us that interested parties did not believe that, the FEA\u2019s mind was closed on the question of retention of the equal application/deemed recovery rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-12\">One other factor persuades us that the notice was sufficient to apprise interested parties that the deemed recovery rule was before the agency. Unlike as in the typical \u201cinadequate notice\u201d situation, the refiners, who presumably opposed the newly promulgated cost bank amendment, here had every incentive to read the September 10 notice of proposed rulemaking expansively, and to take it as an opportunity to comment on the deemed recovery rule and to urge its repeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-13\">For these reasons, we find the notice was adequate under the APA and the FEAA<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> 2. <em>December 5, 1974 Publication: Statement of Basis and Purpose</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1591-14\">Effective December 1, 1974, the deemed recovery rule was readopted in its September 5, 1974 form as section 212.83(e) of the Petroleum Price Regulations, 10 C.F.R. pt. 212 (1975); 39 Fed.Reg. 42368 (Dec. 5, 1974). The district court in <em>NaphSol v. Murphy </em>held that this December 5, 1974 repromulgation was invalid since it did not include an adequate statement of the \u201cbasis and purpose\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> for retaining the deemed recovery rule. 550 F.Supp. at 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-15\">The purpose of a contemporaneous \u201cbasis and purpose\u201d statement is to facilitate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1496\">*1496</page-number>meaningful judicial review by enabling the court to become aware of the legal and factual background of the agency\u2019s action. <em>Action on Smoking &amp; Health v.

Although an exhaustive listing of findings or a full analysis is not required, it is desirable for the agency to respond in a reasoned manner to the comments received and to explain how the decision was arrived at. <em>See Action on Smoking v. CAB, supra, </em>699 F.2d at 1216. The statement of basis and purpose need not be published at the exact same moment as the rule. The inquiry must be whether \u201cthe rules and statement are published close enough together in time so that there is no doubt that the statement accompanies rather than rationalizes the rule.\u201d <em>Tabor v. Jt. Board for Enrollment of Actuaries, </em>566 F.2d 705, 711 n. 14 (D.C.Cir.1977); <em>accord Baltimore &amp; Ohio v. United States, supra, </em>583 F.2d at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-4\">In the December 5, 1974 preamble, the FEA indicated that it had decided to revise the price regulations on the pass through of <em>non </em>-product cost increases by refiners. The preamble continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1592-5\">Action on all other revisions to the price regulations proposed in the September 10 notice is deferred until a later date.

Nevertheless, even when the basis and purpose statement is cursory, or, indeed, nonexistent, a rule may be upheld when the agency\u2019s path may reasonably be discerned. <em>Alabama Ass\u2019n of Insurance Agents v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, </em>533 F.2d 224, 237 (5th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 904, 98 S.Ct. 1448, 55 L.Ed.2d 494 (1978); <em>Hoving Corp. v.

Such is the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-9\">The September 5, 1974 preamble promised the opportunity to comment on the newly promulgated deemed recovery rule. 39 Fed.Reg. at 32307. The September 10 preamble canvassed in some detail the opposing policy considerations involved, principally the interest in permitting refiners flexibility in pricing to respond to market conditions as against the concern that regions and independents not suffer unfairly from \u201cselective\u201d flexibility. 39 Fed.Reg. at 32722-23. The comments the FEA received elaborated these competing positions. Despite the abbreviated statement of basis and purpose, then, FEA\u2019s reason for retaining the deemed recovery rule is reasonably clear: the agency concluded that the needs of regions and independents outweighed the benefits of price flexibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-10\">It should be apparent that the sort of truncated basis and purpose statement contained in the December 5 preamble is not recommended: an agency should respond meaningfully to comments and explain its decision. In this case, however, we are disinclined, some eight years after the event, to invalidate a rule on the technical ground of a deficient statement of basis and purpose when we can fairly discern the agency\u2019s aims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-11\">Accordingly, we find that the December 5, 1974 promulgation was procedurally valid. The deemed recovery rule, therefore, was validly repromulgated as of December 1, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-12\">In sum, we hold that the deemed recovery rule was validly promulgated on September 5, 1974 and validly repromulgated on December 5, 1974. The decisions of the district courts on this question are reversed. Since the <em>Mobil </em>court\u2019s ruling that the May 1977 three cent rule was procedurally invalid was premised on the invalidity of the 1974 deemed recovery rule, that ruling is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1497\">*1497</page-number>vacated. The case is therefore remanded for consideration of the impact of the September 1974 deemed recovery rule on the April 1974 three cent rule, directed toward determining whether the May 1977 three cent rule was validly promulgated as an interpretive rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-4\">That portion of <em>Naph-Sol v. Murphy </em>ruling that Naph-Sol was not entitled to recovery for overcharges due to Murphy\u2019s violation of the deemed recovery rule is vacated. The case is remanded for determination of whether, in fact, Murphy violated this rule and overcharged Naph-Sol thereby. Unlike our review of <em>Mobil v. DOE, </em>our review of <em>Naph-Sol v. Murphy </em>is not yet complete. We must consider the claim that Murphy\u2019s May 15, 1973 selling price was in violation of the contract between the parties and, therefore, of the Price Regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-5\">V. <em>Price Overcharge: May 15, 1978 Transaction Price</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1593-6\">A. <em>Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1593-7\">Initially, Murphy raises the question of our jurisdiction over Naph-Sol\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s determination that the prices Murphy charged Naph-Sol on May 15, 1983 were permissible under the parties\u2019 supply contracts and, therefore, lawful under the Price Regulations.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1593-8\">Section 211(b)(2) of the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1904 note, granted the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over all appeals from the district courts of the United States in cases and controversies arising under this title or under regulations or orders issued thereunder.\u201d Section 5 of the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 754(a)(1), incorporated this special grant of jurisdiction. Two principal inquiries guide our determination of TECA jurisdiction: whether resolution of the litigation in its entirety requires the application or interpretation of the EPAA and regulations, <em>Citronelle-Mobile Gathering, Inc. v. Gulf Oil Corp., </em>591 F.2d 711, 716 (TECA), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 879, 100 S.Ct. 168, 62 L.Ed.2d 109 (1979), and whether an EPAA issue has been adjudicated in the district court. <em>Texaco Inc. v. DOE, </em>616 F.2d 1193, 1198 (TECA 1979); <em>Coastal States Marketing Inc. v. New England Petroleum Corp., </em>604 F.2d 179, 187 (2d Cir. 1979); <em>see Francis Oil &amp; Gas Inc. v. Exxon Corp., </em>687 F.2d 484, 487 (TECA 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-12\">Naph-Sol seeks recovery for overcharges pursuant to \u00a7 210(b) of the ESA, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1904 note. Thus allegations in the complaint implicate the EPAA and its implementing regulations. Indeed, the claim rests entirely on the Regulations and its resolution involves their application. The interpretation of the terms of the supply contracts between Naph-Sol and Murphy was incident to, and interwoven with, the question whether Murphy\u2019s May 15, 1973 selling price was lawful under the Regulations. Although based on its interpretation of the contract, the district court was required to resolve the litigation and held that Murphy had not violated the Price Regulations; therefore, an EPAA issue has been adjudicated and we have jurisdiction over this appeal. <em>See Citronelle-Mobile Gathering, Inc. v. Gulf Oil Corp., supra, </em>591 F.2d at 716; <em>Mountain Fuel Supply Co. v. R.

MURPHY reserves the right at any time during the period of this agreement to increase or decrease the agreement price provided for herein. In the event any such increase or decrease in price is unacceptable to Purchaser, Purchaser shall have the right to cancel the agreement on written notice insofar as the particular product or products involved are concerned, said cancellation to be effective at the time stated in said notice. On the failure of Purchaser to exercise this right of cancellation, the increase or decrease in prices shall become automatically effective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1594-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-5\">On or shortly before May 15, 1973, Murphy began to charge prices in excess of the maximum stated in the supply agreements.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Naph-Sol accepted fuel shipments and paid these higher prices. Naph-Sol, which purchased petroleum from Murphy at least through the filing of its complaint in 1979, alleges that the prices charged by Murphy violated the supply contracts and, therefore, the Price Regulations. Murphy, relying on the price adjustment provision, maintains the prices were valid under the contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-10\">The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Murphy. The court found that the contract terms were unambiguous and that the price adjustment provision permitted Murphy to charge Naph-Sol prices in excess of the maximum in the supply agreements. Since Naph-Sol accepted fuel shipments at these prices, under the price adjustment clause the prices automatically became effective. The court rejected Naph-Sol\u2019s argument that the price adjustment term was inconsistent with the minimum-maximum provision and that the specific term (the minimum-maximum term) governed over the general term. Under the agreements Naph-Sol was obligated to purchase minimum amounts of gasoline when prices were within the minimum and maximum range. Naph-Sol, however, could be excused from meeting its minimum purchase requirements if Murphy increased its prices in accordance with the price adjustment clause. The two provisions, the court reasoned, are therefore not inconsistent. <em>Naph-Sol v. Murphy Oil, supra, </em>550 F.Supp. at 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-11\">We agree with the district court\u2019s construction. The contract terms are unambiguous. In particular, by its plain language the price adjustment clause authorized Murphy to increase its prices beyond those expressly provided for in the contracts.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Contrary to Naph-Sol\u2019s argument, advanced in the district court and renewed on appeal, this provision may reasonably be harmonized with the minimum-maximum clause, as the district court has shown, such that effect many be given to all the terms in the contract.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1499\">*1499</page-number>Accordingly, we hold that Murphy\u2019s May 15, 1973 selling price was permissible under the parties\u2019 supply agreements and, therefore, that Murphy used a lawful May 15, 1973 transaction price under the price regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-6\">VI. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1595-7\">In conclusion, we rule as follows. In <em>Mobil v. DOE </em>we hold that: 1) the April 1974 three cent rule did not itself require equal application of the three cent cost allowance; 2) the promulgation of the deemed recovery rule on September 5, 1974' was procedurally valid; and 3) the repro-mulgation of the deemed recovery rule on December 5, 1974 was procedurally valid. The district court\u2019s judgment that the May 5, 1977 three cent rule was procedurally invalid is vacated. The case is remanded for consideration of the impact of the deemed recovery rule on the April 1974 three cent rule and, in this light, of the procedural validity of the May 1977 three cent rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-11\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-12\">In <em>Naph-Sol v. Murphy Oil </em>we hold that: 1) Murphy\u2019s May 15, 1973 selling price was permissible under the parties\u2019 supply contracts and lawful under the price regulations; 2) the promulgation of the deemed recovery rule on September 5, 1974 was procedurally valid; and 3) the repromulgation of the deemed recovery rule on December 5, 1974 was procedurally valid. The case is remanded for determination of whether, in fact, Murphy violated the deemed recovery rule and thereby overcharged Naph-Sol.</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-13\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1575-8\">.

In November 1973, Congress passed the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act (\u201cEPAA\u201d). Pub.L.

Although the DOE did draw attention to the deemed recovery rule, it was Mobil, both in its complaint, <em>see </em>Stip.Record pp. 000021-22, and in its motion for summary judgment, <em>see id. </em>pp. 000235-310, that put the question of the validity, as opposed to the interpretation, of this rule into issue. Absent this, the district court would not have ruled on the validity of the deemed recovery rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1584-9\">. In an earlier ruling, relied on by Mobil here, the district court had speculated that laches might not be available. See <em>United Refining Co. v. DOE, </em>4 Energy Mgmt. (CCH) \u00b6 26,264 (W.D.Pa.1980). Upon further reflection, however, the court held to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-14\">The other case relied on by Mobil, <em>Lucken-bach Steamship Co. v. United States, </em>312 F.2d 545 (2d Cir.1963), involved a statute of limitations, not laches, and in any event, plainly sought only a simple declaration of non-liability for payments allegedly due.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1585-7\">. Interestingly, in a separate action, Mobil invoked and apparently defended the deemed recovery rule to avoid liability under a New York statute. See <em>Mobil Oil Corp. v.

A mere desire to provide guidance and information, or to clarify regulations, however, does not suffice for good cause. <em>Mobil v. DOE, supra, </em>610 F.2d at 803. To the extent that the FEA justified the need for regulations on the basis of \u201cclarifying ambiguities\u201d alone, it would not amount to good cause. However, we understand the principal justification to be the harm attendant upon announcement of the proposed rule itself: refiners \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of the situation. Moreover, FEA sought to do more than simply clarify ambiguities: \u201cIt sought to remedy shortcoming in its regulations which had become serious only as a result of sudden changes in market conditions.\u201d <em>Shimek v</em>. <em>DOE, </em>685 F.2d 1372, 1375 (TECA 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1589-6\">.

The harm that could have resulted from discriminatory pricing was clearly to the general public and not simply, as appellees maintain, to one segment of the petroleum industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-11\">The contention that FEA could have solved the problem by publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking that indicated that the rule would be effective as of the date of the notice proves too much since it would swallow the good cause exception as we have interpreted it in <em>Nader v. Sawhill, supra, </em>and <em>DeRieux v. Five Smiths, supra. </em>Moreover, the suggestion that we impose a new procedural requirement is contrary to <em>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Co. v.
