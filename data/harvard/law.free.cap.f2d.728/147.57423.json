Appellant further claims that the court should not have grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>ed summary judgment holding the surety liable for this freight forwarder\u2019s conduct without first finding that an independent contract existed between the forwarder and the carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">We find no merit in these claims and affirm substantially for the reasons stated by Judge Broderick in his Memorandum Order dated June 2, 1983, 572 F.Supp. 939. We also find no merit in appellant\u2019s claim that the court abused its discretion in granting prejudgment interest. Contrary to appellant\u2019s claim, there was no unjustifiable delay by the carrier in instituting suit in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
