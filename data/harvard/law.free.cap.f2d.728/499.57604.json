Petitioner sought review of that agency action by the board. The board held it lacked jurisdiction over petitioner\u2019s appeal because the collective bargaining agreement for petitioner\u2019s bargaining unit makes the agency\u2019s grievance process the only avenue of review. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">The appellate jurisdiction of the board is set forth at 5 CFR \u00a7 1201.3(a) (1982) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-11\">\u00a7 1201.3 Appellate jurisdiction: Definition and application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-12\">(a) Appellate jurisdiction generally. The Board has appellate jurisdiction over cases specified in the Act where there have been prior actions within an agency. This includes certain decisions of the Office of Personnel Management relating to retirement and insurance benefits. This appellate jurisdiction includes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-13\">(1) Removal or reduction-in-grade of competitive or preference eligible employees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-14\">(2) <em>Denial of within-grade step increases;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-15\">(3) Actions based upon removal, suspension for more than 14 days, reduction-in-grade or pay, or furlough for 30 days or less;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-16\">(4) Certain actions relating to the Senior Executive Service;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-17\">(5) Actions otherwise appealable to the Board involving an allegation of discrimination;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-18\">(6) Determinations relating to disability retirement, health insurance and annuities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-19\">(7) Actions involving reinstatement of preference eligibles; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-20\">(8) Those actions for which jurisdiction may be properly granted by regulations of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-21\">This jurisdiction is limited by 5 CFR \u00a7 1201.3(b) (1982) which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-22\">(b) <em>Limitations on appellate jurisdiction; </em>collective bargaining agreements and election of procedures \u2014 (1) Exclusive procedure. <em>Where an employee is covered by a collective bargaining agreement which provides exclusive negotiated grievance procedures for specific matters </em>under 5 U.S.C. 7121, <em>the employee may not appeal those matters to the Board. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-23\">The agency\u2019s decision in this case relates to a matter normally within the board\u2019s jurisdiction; denial of a within-grade step increase. But petitioner was a member of a collective bargaining unit that had entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the agency. Article 16, Section 2(b) of that agreement provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-24\">(b) The procedure contained herein shall be the sole procedure available for resolution of grievances of employees in the unit and parties hereto, except as provided in Section 3 below of this Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-25\">Section 3 of the agreement sets out the exclusions from the grievance. Denials of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>within-grade salary increases are not listed as one of the exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The authenticity of the negotiated agreement and petitioner\u2019s membership in a bargaining unit covered by the negotiated agreement is not challenged. Article 16, Section 2(b) of the collecting bargaining therefore limits the board\u2019s jurisdiction by making agency grievance procedures the sole review mechanism for denials of within-grade salary increases. Accordingly, the board properly dismissed petitioner\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Petitioner suggests that no grievance procedure was established. This contention, however, is not supported by any evidence of record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">The board also refused to consider petitioner\u2019s arguments concerning an agency decision to suspend petitioner for fourteen days because that decision was not implemented. We affirm that action by the board since any issue regarding that decision is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the board\u2019s decision dismissing petitioner\u2019s appeal is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
