In this diversity action, the petitioner seeks to recover accidental death benefits, under three separate insurance policies, for the death of her husband. Two of the policies, issued by Aetna Life Insurance Company and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, contain exclusionary clauses which require Mrs. Van Hook to establish that her husband\u2019s death was caused solely by the accident. The third policy was issued by American Motorists Life Insurance Company and contains no such requirement. Under the American Motorists policy Mrs. Van Hook must prove that an accidental injury proximately caused her husband\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">The petitioner claims that she is entitled to benefits under all three policies because her husband accidentally drowned in a motel swimming pool. The respondent insurance companies assert instead that Mrs. Van Hook\u2019s husband died as the result of heart disease which led to a fatal heart attack in the swimming pool. This was the conclusion reached by the forensic pathologist for Hamilton County, Ohio, Dr. Charles Hirsch, following an autopsy. There were no eyewitnesses to the decedent\u2019s passing. Both sides presented conflicting expert testimony from forensic pathologists concerning the cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">After a thorough evaluation of all of the evidence, Senior United States District Judge Ralph M. Freeman concluded that the medical facts and circumstances failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that Leon Van Hook\u2019s death was due to drowning, and not due to heart disease. Judge Freeman\u2019s careful opinion is reported at 550 F.Supp. 888 (E.D.Mich.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">Upon review, we are of the opinion that Judge Freeman understood and properly applied the law of Michigan in interpreting the several insurance contracts in question. We are further of the opinion that issues of fact predominated and that Judge Freeman\u2019s resolution of those issues was objective and not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
