One has merit. IMCO suggests that the court erred in stating that \u201cCervantes reported to his IMCO supervisor on October 30, 1978, that he was physically ready and able to resume his job.\u201d The underscored portion is challenged. Upon reexamination of the record, we agree and recast that sentence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-23\">Cervantes reported to his IMCO supervisor on October 30, 1978 that he had been released by his physician and was ready to return to his duties consistent with that physician\u2019s advice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-24\">In reversing the summary judgment which the district court had granted based solely on limitations, it was not our purpose to make or suggest factual findings on the merits of the case. Our decision implicates only those factual and legal determinations inherent in a proper resolution of the limitations issue. Fact findings on the merits, and the ultimate resolution of the merits by whatever procedure deemed appropriate by the district court, remains within the exclusive province of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-25\">The second suggested misstatement, relating to our characterization of the gravamen of plaintiff\u2019s individual and class action complaint, is without merit. Equally without merit is IMCO\u2019s suggestion that we should grant its motion for summary judgment on the merits, even though the trial court has not considered the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-26\">Subject to the foregoing, the petition for rehearing is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
