(\u201cODPW\u201d) practice of attributing a minor mother\u2019s federal Old Age Survivors and Disability Insurance (\u201cOASDI\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> benefits as income available to the minor mother\u2019s child for the purpose of reducing or eliminating the child\u2019s eligibility for benefits under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (\u201cAFDC\u201d) program. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and motions for class certification and summary judgment. Defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The district court judge denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification but granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined ODPW, its agents, servants and employees from treating OASDI payments made through a representative payee as income for the purposes of calculating eligibility of a potential AFDC applicant. The defendants appealed. The sole question presented for review is whether the state\u2019s treatment of OASDI benefits, paid to minor mothers\u2019 representative payees, as available income for purposes of calculating their children\u2019s entitlement to AFDC benefits, conflicts with regulations promulgated under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-13\">The facts are not in dispute. Plaintiffs are minor mothers who lived with adult relatives at the time of their applications for AFDC benefits. Plaintiff Melissa Snider received OASDI benefits because of her father\u2019s disability. Under federal law, a minor cannot receive OASDI benefits directly, but must instead receive them through a representative payee. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.2001 <em>et seq. </em>Consequently, benefits were paid to Melissa\u2019s mother as the representative payee on behalf of Melissa. Melissa applied for AFDC benefits on behalf of herself and her son David. The County Welfare Department,' pursuant to policy set by the ODPW, calculated Melissa\u2019s potential AFDC grant by first considering the income of Melissa\u2019s parents, not including the OAS-DI benefits received on her behalf. The Department compared this income to the basic needs standard for a family of three. Since the parents\u2019 income exceeded this scheduled standard of need, the Department concluded the Snider\u2019s income was sufficient to meet Melissa\u2019s needs. Melissa was thus eliminated from the \u201cassistance group\u201d, which is the term used to describe the unit making the application for AFDC benefits. This reduced the assistance group to one, Melissa\u2019s son, David. The Welfare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Department, again pursuant to ODPW policy, \u201cdeemed\u201d the OASDI benefits which should have gone to Melissa, as available to meet David\u2019s needs. Since the excess OAS-DI benefits exceeded the basic needs standard for an assistance group of one, the result of the deeming procedure was to completely exclude David from the AFDC program.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">Plaintiff Lisa Nicholas, also received her OASDI benefits through a representative payee. The ODPW deemed that portion of her OASDI benefits which exceeded the AFDC\u2019s basic standard of need, as available to her child. This reduced the AFDC grant by the amount of the excess OASDI benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The district court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and declared invalid the state\u2019s policy whereby OASDI payments made through a representative payee are deemed income for the purpose of calculating AFDC benefits. <em>Snider v. Creasy, </em>548 F.Supp. 601 (S.D.Ohio 1982). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">This Circuit recognizes that the standards for granting a summary judgment motion is strict and the rule must be invoked with caution. <em>Tee-pak, Inc. v. St. Regis Paper Co., </em>491 F.2d 1193, 1195 (6th Cir.1974); <em>Rogers v. Peabody Coal Co., </em>342 F.2d 749, 751 (6th Cir.1965); <em>Bohn Aluminum &amp; Brass Corp. v. Storm King Corp., </em>303 F.2d 425, 427 (6th Cir.1962). The trial judge should grant the motion only where \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">The facts were stipulated to by the parties in this case, and are not in dispute. Since resolution of appellants\u2019 challenge to the validity of the state\u2019s deeming policy raised purely legal questions and did not involve disputed issues of fact, the district court properly concluded that the question was ripe for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">AFDC is a categorical public assistance program established by the Social Security Act of 1935. AFDC provides federal funds to states on a matching funds basis to aid the \u201cneedy child ... who has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of death, continued absence from the home, or physical or mental incapacity of a parent, and who is living with\u201d any of several designated relatives. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 606(a). The Supreme Court in <em>Townsend v. Swank, </em>404 U.S. 282, 92 S.Ct. 502, 30 L.Ed.2d 448 (1971), held that states which seek to qualify for federal AFDC funding must operate a program not in conflict with the Social Security Act. Plaintiffs contend that Ohio\u2019s deeming policy is in direct conflict with the Social Security Act, in particular the regulations governing OASDI payments made through a representative payee. A representative payee is required by federal regulations to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-11\">(a) Use the payments he or she receives only for the use and benefit of the beneficiary in a manner and for the purposes he or she determines, under the guidelines in this subpart, to be in the best interests of the beneficiary. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.2035.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-13\">The alleged conflict arises from Ohio\u2019s policy which circumvents the representative payee\u2019s duty to exercise discretion and automatically deems the benefits available to one other than the intended beneficiary. In finding Ohio\u2019s deeming policy invalid, the district court relied upon <em>Riddick v. D\u2019Elia, </em>626 F.2d 1084 (2d Cir.1980) and <em>Barnes v. Reagen, </em>501 F.Supp. 215 (N.D. Iowa 1980). Both cases involved deeming policies identical to Ohio\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-14\">The policy of the New York Department of Social Services in <em>Riddick v. D\u2019Elia, supra, </em>was to attribute a portion of a mother\u2019s OASDI benefits as income to her child for the purpose of reducing the child\u2019s needs for AFDC benefits. Although the mother in this case was not a minor, she received benefits through a representative payee be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>cause she was mentally retarded.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The appellants argued that a conflict arose between the federal regulations governing the administration of OASDI benefits and the state\u2019s policy. The federal regulation required a representative payee to apply the benefits only for the use and benefit of the beneficiary and in the manner and for the purposes determined by the payee to be in the beneficiary\u2019s best interest. The state\u2019s policy, however, allocated a portion of the minor mother\u2019s benefits to her child, thus preventing the representative payee from fulfilling his obligation to use the income for the purposes determined by him to be in the best interest of the beneficiary. 626 F.2d at 1089. The Second Circuit concluded that \u201cin view of such a conflict with federal law, the state policy must give way under the Supremacy Clause.\u201d 626 F.2d at 1089.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Similarly, in <em>Barnes v. Reagen, </em>501 F.Supp. 215 (N.D. Iowa 1980) the court held that the state public welfare department\u2019s policy of treating as income for AFDC eligibility, the OASDI benefits paid to the representative payee on behalf of an AFDC applicant violated 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.2035 which governed the obligations of the representative payee to spend the benefits on behalf of the beneficiary \u201conly for the use and benefit of such beneficiary in the manner and for the purposes determined by him to be in the beneficiary\u2019s best interest.\u201d 501 F.Supp. at 218 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">We find these decisions and the district court\u2019s reliance thereon to be sound. The federal regulations governing the administration of benefits through a representative payee specifically require the payee to use \u201cthe benefits of the beneficiary in a manner and for the purposes, <em>he or she determines </em>... to be in the beneficiary\u2019s best interest.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.2035 (emphasis added). The representative payee\u2019s discretionary role in spending on the beneficiary\u2019s behalf is abrogated by Ohio\u2019s policy. The practical effect of this policy is to directly allocate these funds to one other than the intended beneficiary, thereby eliminating the representative payee\u2019s discretion to determine how benefits should be spent on the beneficiary\u2019s behalf. Such an abrogation is impermissible. Moreover, the duties and obligations imposed upon the representative payee, are federally mandated and failure to fulfill these obligations can expose the representative payee to criminal liability.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">Although the defendants concede that the representative payee must spend all funds for the beneficiary\u2019s best interest, they argue that since the beneficiary receives all funds, this is income which must be included in the AFDC calculation. And, since under Ohio law, the mother is obligated to support her child, these funds must be included in the determination of the AFDC grant, regardless of whether the funds are actually expended on the minor child. A reading of the relevant AFDC regulation rebuts defendant\u2019s argument. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.20(a)(3)(ii)(D) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-11\">[n]et income available for current use . . . shall be considered [for purposes of determining need, eligibility and benefit levels under the state AFDC program]; income . .. [is] considered available both when actually available and when the [AFDC] applicant or recipient has a legal interest in a liquidated sum and has the legal ability to make such sum available for support and maintenance.'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-12\">\u25a0 Defendants cannot treat as income to plaintiffs and their children, OASDI benefits paid to plaintiffs\u2019 representative payees. The regulatory restrictions placed on benefits as a result of the representative payee relationship precludes these funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>from being treated as income as that term is defined in 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.20 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">No doubt there are situations where deeming may be appropriate. For example, the Supreme Court in <em>Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, </em>453 U.S. 34, 101 S.Ct. 2633, 69 L.Ed.2d 460 (1981) upheld the right of the state to deem a spouse\u2019s income as available to a medicaid applicant. The issue in <em>Schweiker </em>was whether the Secretary exceeded his statutory authority by allowing deeming in light of regulations which provided that only available income would be considered in the eligibility determination. The Court held that the Secretary had not exceeded his broad discretion in this area. The Court also found that extensive legislative history supported a conclusion that income deemed from a spouse \u201ccould be a part of the \u2018available\u2019 income which the state may consider in determining eligibility.\u201d 453 U.S. 34, 35, 101 S.Ct. 2633, 2635, 69 L.Ed.2d 460 (1980) (citations omitted). In <em>Schweiker, </em>however, payments were made directly to the beneficiary and not through a representative payee. This distinction is crucial. Our holding is limited solely to those eases where OASDI benefits are paid through a representative payee. OASDI benefits paid directly to an AFDC applicant or recipient are income to that person under the AFDC program and may be appropriately considered in the eligibility calculus. It is only where benefits are paid through a representative payee that they may not be deemed income to an AFDC applicant or recipient for the purpose of calculating eligibility under the AFDC program. Such a policy conflicts with federal regulations governing the administration of the Social Security program and is thus invalid under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Accordingly, we find no error in the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-9\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">Every person who, under color of any statute ... of any State ... subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States ... to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b466-14\">. The regulations governing the administration of Old Age Survivor and Disability Insurance Benefits provides that a minor, disabled, or student child of an individual who receives old age insurance benefits is entitled to receive such benefits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(d)(1) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b468-6\">. A representative payee is appointed when the beneficiary is either a' minor or disabled. For purposes of this discussion, there is no distinction between the two.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b468-7\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408 provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Whoever \u2014 (e) having made application to receive payment under this subchapter for the use and benefit of another and having received such a payment, knowingly and willfully converts such a payment, or any part thereof, to a use other than for the use and benefit of such other person; ... shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b469-7\">CONTIE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ASD\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">I agree with the majority that the Ohio Department of Public Welfare (ODPW) may not \u201cdeem\u201d Old Age Survivors and Disability Income (OASDI) benefits paid to a representative payee as being available to an Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) applicant for purposes of reducing or eliminating eligibility for AFDC benefits. Although I further agree that the judgment as to plaintiff Nicholas should be affirmed, I conclude that the judgment as to plaintiff Snider should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">The majority correctly relies upon <em>Barnes v. Reagen, </em>501 F.Supp. 215 (N.D. Iowa 1980), for the proposition that ODPW\u2019s \u201cdeeming\u201d process is impermissible in cases involving representative payees. The majority does not, however, cite a footnote in <em>Barnes </em>to which the district court in the present case averted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-11\">Defendant [here, ODPW] is not precluded by this ruling from treating as income OASDI benefits paid to a representative payee on behalf of an AFDC applicant or recipient to the extent these benefits are actually applied by the representative payee to the current maintenance needs of the AFDC applicant or recipient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">501 F.Supp. at 220 n. 18 (citation omitted). Under this language, ODPW may include OASDI benefits as income in calculating AFDC eligibility if the agency can prove by direct evidence that the representative payee did in fact use the benefits for the AFDC applicant\u2019s current maintenance needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">In the present case, plaintiff and AFDC applicant Melissa Snider stipulated that \u201call of the OASDI benefits received on Melissa\u2019s behalf are spent on Melissa\u2019s needs\u201d (Stipulation # 13, app. at 40). In my view, this stipulation constitutes direct evidence that the representative payee applied the OAS-DI benefits to AFDC applicant Snider\u2019s maintenance needs. Thus, the benefits are includable as income for purposes of calculating AFDC eligibility in her case. Although I am aware that the district court did not give this effect to Snider\u2019s stipulation, I am' of the opinion that the plain language of the stipulation required the district court to do so. I would reverse the judgment as to plaintiff Snider.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
