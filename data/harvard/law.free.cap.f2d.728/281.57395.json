JONES, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">This case is presently before the Court upon Kentucky Utilities Company\u2019s (K.U.) appeal from an order of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company (L &amp; N). K.U. contends that the district court erred in applying \u00a7 214 of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 retroactively to supersede without a hearing two general rate orders of the Kentucky Railroad Commission (KRC). Upon consideration of the issues presented by this appeal, we conclude that the district court in granting summary judgment for L &amp; N, properly and prospectively applied the Staggers Act to preempt the application of KRC\u2019s tariff orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-16\">The facts of this case are not disputed. L &amp; N seeks to collect from K.U. tariffs for its rail transportation services in Kentucky. K.U. does not dispute that it is required to pay lawful freight rates for L &amp; N\u2019s services. K.U. and L &amp; N disagree however on the applicable tariff rates to be assessed. K.U. contends that the applicable rate should be $3.98 per ton, the tariff enacted by the KRC, while L &amp; N argues that the rate should be $4.69 per ton, the ICC tariff.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-17\">The different amounts stem from the application of two general rate increases to intrastate traffic. In 1978, the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) approved a 5.5% general rate increase on interstate traffic.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the increase, L &amp; N and other Kentucky railroads sought a parallel increase in intrastate rates. The KRC approved a 7% general increase of those rates.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-18\">On February 1, 1980, the nationwide rail carriers sought another interstate general increase, after which L &amp; N sought another parallel intrastate increase. After the I.C.C. approved the general interstate increase,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the KRC approved a 3.3% increase for intrastate traffic.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-19\">On October 1, 1980, the Staggers Act became effective. On November 23, 1980, the ICC, pursuant to \u00a7 214(b)(6) of the Staggers Act, granted L &amp; N the authority to implement general tariff increases for intrastate traffic. K.U. however refused to pay the increased tariffs on coal traffic after November 23, 1980. L &amp; N therefore filed suit in district court to collect from KU the disputed tariffs. L &amp; N did not seek to apply its general tariffs to coal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>movements before November 23, 1980, nor did it desire from K.U. \u201cundercharges\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Confronted with cross-motions for summary judgment, District Judge Siler concluded that prospective application of the Staggers Act preempted KRC\u2019s jurisdiction to regulate general intrastate rate increases. The court therefore granted L &amp; N\u2019s summary judgment motion and ordered K.U. to pay the difference between what was paid under the KRC rate and what was owed under the ICC rate. K.U. now appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Section 214(b)(6) of the Staggers Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, a state authority may not exercise any jurisdiction over general rate increases under Section 10706 of this title ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501(b)(6). K.U. concedes that the rate increases involved in this appeal are \u201cgeneral\u201d and that the Staggers Act withdraws from state authorities the jurisdiction to hear or approve such increases. In this case, K.U. contends that the preemption of KRC rate orders resulted from im-permissable, retroactive application of the Staggers Act. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">In the companion cases of <em>Hanna Mining Co. v. Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad Co., </em>664 F.2d 594 (6th Cir.1981) and <em>Cleveland Cliffs Iron Co. v. ICC, </em>664 F.2d 568 (6th Cir.1981), this Court refused to apply retroactively the substantive provisions of the Staggers Act to a rate dispute which was pending on appeal at the time the Act was enacted. <em>See also Iowa Power and Light Co. v. Burlington Northern, Inc., </em>647 F.2d 796 (8th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 907, 102 S.Ct. 1253, 71 L.Ed.2d 445 (1982). Both eases involved the question of which substantive legal provisions the court should apply to an appeal of a rate decision \u201cwhose genesis and conclusion span a long time frame\u201d before the enactment of the Staggers Act. After careful consideration of the legislative history and statutory direction of that Act, the <em>Cleveland Cliffs </em>court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ4\">a proper construction of the Staggers Rail Act requires us to hold that neither the ICC nor this Court is relieved of its respective obligations under the former statute to determine the reasonableness of the challenged rates ... the law to be applied is that which was in existence before the enactment of the Staggers Rail Act and upon which the Commission made its decisions in these cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">664 F.2d at 589. In <em>Hanna, </em>this Court adopted the reasoning of <em>Cleveland Cliffs </em>and found that Congressional intent would be advanced and great hardship to the parties would be avoided if pre-Staggers Act law were applied to a market dominance determination appeal which had been pending before the Act became effective. In <em>Hanna </em>and <em>Cleveland Cliffs </em>therefore this Court refused to apply retroactively to \u201cpending\u201d cases the substantive legal provisions of the Staggers Act. K.U. contends that these decisions preclude the application of the Staggers Act in this case to supersede KRC\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\"><em>Cleveland Cliffs </em>and <em>Hanna </em>however are clearly distinguishable from the case at bar. This Court will not give retroactive application to the substantive provisions of the Staggers Act where to do so would work a substantial hardship upon the parties in a \u201cpending\u201d litigation. In the case before us, by contrast, the district court applied the jurisdictional, not the substantive provisions, of the Staggers Act. Moreover, the only litigation involved in the case was instituted <em>after </em>the Staggers Act became effective and is based upon the implementation of post-Aet rate increases. Because the Staggers Act does not in this case alter the substantive law in a pending case, we conclude that <em>Cleveland Cliffs </em>and <em>Hanna </em>are not dispositive of the issues before us. We are not confronted, as were those courts, with the application of pre-Act law to rail rate disputes that were pending before the ICC or the courts before October 1, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>We are confronted instead with the application of the jurisdictional provisions of the Staggers Act to general rate increases enacted after October 1, 1980.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Faced with nearly identical situations, several circuits have applied the Staggers Act prospectively to supersede a state regulatory agency\u2019s jurisdiction over general rate increases. In <em>Indianapolis Power and Light Co. v. I.C.C., </em>687 F.2d 1098 (7th Cir.1982), the Seventh Circuit held that the Staggers Act prevented the Public Service Commission of Indiana from blocking the implementation of general railroad rate increases previously docketed and approved by the ICC. The court reasoned that the jurisdictional provisions of the Staggers Act explicitly remove from a state regulatory agency the power to suspend rate tariffs republished after the effective date of the Act. After careful consideration of the Congressional policies and intent embodied in the Staggers Act, the Court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-4\">These tariffs are not being raised retroactively and hence the state agency\u2019s initial hold-down decisions are not undone \u2014 they are simply superseded. The ICC\u2019s action allows uniform national rates to be charged prospectively, now that Congress has established that the states should no longer be able to further their own interests at the expense of the nation\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">687 F.2d at 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia agreed with this interpretation of the Staggers Act in <em>Burlington Northern R.R. v. ICC, </em>679 F.2d 934 (D.C.Cir. 1982). In that case, the ICC entered a prescription order which established as the maximum reasonable rate for transportation the \u201cper ton [rate] effective July 1, 1978, as escalated annually under the escalation formula found in the [1976] Letter of Agreement between Burlington Northern, Inc. and Iowa Power and Light Company.\u201d 679 F.2d at 940. The Court held however that a pre-Staggers Act prescription order setting a lower tariff could not prevent the implementation of an increased rate. Like the Seventh Circuit, the District of Columbia Circuit reasoned that the Staggers Act is applied prospectively when it nullifies a pre-Act prescription order. The <em>Burlington Northern </em>Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">When a rate increase is tendered to the ICC after the effective date of the Staggers Act and the tendered rate is allegedly below the Section 202 market dominance threshold, the Commission may not reject the rate simply because it is above the level specified in an outstanding prescription order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">679 F.2d at 941. The appeal before us is indistinguishable from <em>Burlington Northern </em>and <em>Indianapolis Power. </em>The KRC entered pre-Act orders limiting the amount of general increases which L &amp; N could implement. Under the reasoning of <em>Burlington Northern </em>and <em>Indianapolis Power, </em>however, the post-Act implementation of those pre-Act orders was properly precluded by the Staggers Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">The Tenth Circuit, in <em>Colorado Springs v. I.C.C., </em>724 F.2d 857 (10th Cir.1983), sanctioned this application of the Staggers Act\u2019s jurisdictional provisions. In that case, the Tenth Circuit upheld the I.C.C.\u2019s interpretation of the Staggers Act and affirmed the dismissal of the Colorado Public Utilities Commission\u2019s appeal from an ICC decision approving four general rate increases. In specifically adopting the Seventh Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>Indianapolis Power, </em>the Tenth Circuit concluded that the State of Colorado lost jurisdiction under the Staggers Act over the application of general rate increases to intrastate rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">We are persuaded by <em>Colorado Springs </em>and the bulk of applicable case-law that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>prospective application of the Staggers Act precludes the post-Act implementation of a state agency\u2019s rate order. The Staggers Act prospectively withdraws the jurisdictional base of the state agency. In the case before us, therefore, we conclude that the district court correctly and prospectively applied the Staggers Act to preclude the post-Act implementation of KRC\u2019s rate orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">The prospective application of the Staggers Act in this case is supported by the I.C.C.\u2019s interpretation of the Act, to which we owe \u201cgreat deference.\u201d <em>Federal Election Commission v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, </em>454 U.S. 27, 102 S.Ct. 38, 70 L.Ed.2d 23 (1981). <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Moreover, our disposition of this case works no \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d on K.U. because the utility had ample notice of the proposed increases, had sufficient time to file a petition for suspension with the ICC and continues to have an alternative remedy under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11701 or \u00a7 10704. Confronted with virtually identical facts, the <em>Indianapolis Power </em>court found that the utility companies were not victims of \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d within the meaning of <em>Bradley v. Richmond School Board, </em>416 U.S. 696, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974). Rather, the utility companies, like K.U., were victims of \u201ctheir own wrong guess.\u201d We conclude therefore that the district court\u2019s prospective application of the Staggers Act to preclude the implementation of K.R.C.\u2019s rate orders was consistent with the goals of Congress, the weight of controlling case-law, the I.C.C.\u2019s interpretation and <em>Bradley\u2019s </em>prohibition against \u201cmanifest injustice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">K.U. also contends that the district court erred in finding that the disputed increases could be implemented without a hearing. We find this contention to be without merit. Section 214(e) of the Staggers Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">The Commission may take action under \u25a0 the section only after a full hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">Such a hearing however is only required to prescribe a special intrastate rate increase. A hearing is not required for the enforcement of the previously authorized general rate increases in this case. The ICC did not enter prescription orders, it merely granted to L &amp; N authority to file its tariffs. The Tenth Circuit, in <em>Colorado Springs, </em>although it remanded for a hearing on a special rate increase, did not require a hearing on a general rate increase analogous to the one before this Court. As the district court correctly concluded, therefore, \u201cnothing in the statute, as amended, suggests that a hearing is necessary ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">This Court thus concludes that the district court did not err in its refusal to grant K.U. a hearing and in its prospective application of the Staggers Act. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b378-11\">.

This Circuit has not explicitly addressed the question of jurisdiction over general rate increases. In <em>Kentucky Utilities v. I.C.C., </em>721 F.2d 537 (6th Cir.1983) this Court had occasion to review under federal standards a K.R.C. order setting maximum <em>specific </em>rates for intrastate coal shipments. We vacated the I.C.C.\u2019s ruling, finding that K.R.C.\u2019s order had complied with the federal standards for <em>specific </em>rate increases established by the Staggers Act. K.R. C.\u2019s jurisdiction to approve <em>specific </em>rate increases had not been withdrawn. In the case before us, however, K.U. concedes that its proposed increases are <em>general </em>The prior <em>Kentucky Utilities v. I.C.C. </em>decision, therefore, is clearly distinguishable from the case currently before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
