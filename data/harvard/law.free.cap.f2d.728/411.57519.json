Pazsint, </em>703 F.2d 420 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>The facts are related in the earlier opinion. The assignments of error in this appeal challenge a number of rulings by the trial judge but none reveals a basis for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The points raised in the brief border upon the frivolous. The defendant asserted that the evidence was insufficient. It was overwhelming. In front of numerous independent witnesses, the defendant forced the I.R.S. agent\u2019s car off the road and at pistol point spread-eagled him against his car, announcing that he was making a \u201ccitizen\u2019s arrest.\u201d Whether or not such an exercise was justified was fully explored in the evidence and submitted to the jury with proper instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Other assignments of error are equally unsupported by the record and wanting in \u2022 foundation in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
