We affirm because under applicable Louisiana law no contract existed between Haynes and the Bourgeois, a prerequisite to the claimed penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-28\">On March 28, 1980, in Louisiana, the Bourgeois signed a document labeled \u201cContract Goods and Services\u201d for the installation of aluminum siding. The \u201ccontract\u201d had been submitted to the Bourgeois by John Martin, an independent contractor acting as Haynes Construction Company\u2019s salesman. .Martin completed the \u201ccontract\u201d with the Bourgeois and signed it. In addition to an agreement to execute a mortgage on the Bourgeois\u2019 home, the document contained the following language: \u201cThis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>agreement hereby entered into by and between Haynes Construction Company, ... [and] Billie Bourgeois.... \u201d The document also included a \u201cConsumer\u2019s right to cancel,\u201d stating that the consumer must send a letter within three days to Haynes if the consumer wished to cancel the agreement. Furthermore, the \u201ccontract\u201d stated: \u201cKeep a copy of this contract to protect your legal rights. Executed by both Buyer and Seller this 28th day of March, 1980.\u201d Finally, the back of the document contained the following: \u201cThis order must be approved by an officer of Haynes Construction Company before it is binding on the Seller.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">By letter to Haynes on March 31, 1980, the Bourgeois\u2019 lawyer gave notice of recission. There was no performance under the \u201ccontract,\u201d and the record does not reflect approval by an officer of Haynes. Indeed Haynes asserts that the recission letter was its first knowledge of the proposed agreement with the Bourgeois.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">We need not decide whether the Bourgeois were furnished with the proper disclosure documents, because no penalties for nondisclosure under the Truth-in-Lending Act can be awarded unless the transaction in question has been \u201cconsummated.\u201d Waters v. <em>Weyerhaeuser Mortgage Co., </em>582 F.2d 503, 505 (9th Cir.1978); <em>Harman v. New Hampshire Savings Bank, </em>638 F.2d 280 (1st Cir.1981); <em>Bissette v. Colonial Mortgage Corp., </em>477 F.2d 1245 (D.C.Cir.1973); <em>Stevens v. Rock Springs National Bank, </em>497 F.2d 307 (10th Cir.1974); <em>Wachtel v. West, </em>476 F.2d 1062 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 874, 94 S.Ct. 161, 38 L.Ed.2d 114 (1973). At the time of this dispute, the Code of Federal Regulations defined \u201cconsummation\u201d as the time a contractual relationship is created between the parties, irrespective of the time of performance of either party. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.2(kk) (repealed effective 1982). The Bourgeois contend that at the time this regulation was in effect determination of contract conception was a matter of federal law. The argument is without merit. <em>See Waters v. Weyerhaeuser Mortgage Co., </em>582 F.2d at 506; <em>Bissette v. Colonial Mortgage Corp., </em>477 F.2d at 1246 (Federal Reserve Board Public Information Letters stated that time of contracting should be analyzed on the basis of local law). New Regulation Z makes it clear that the time of contracting has always been determined by state law. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.2(a)(13) defines \u201cconsummation\u201d as the time a consumer becomes contractually obligated on a credit transaction, and \u00a7 226.2(b)(3) provides that, unless otherwise defined, words used in the section have the meanings given by state law or contract. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.2 (1983). The Federal Reserve Board section-by-section analysis of new Regulation Z explains the new consummation definition: \u201cAs before, state law determines when the contractual obligation arises....\u201d FRB, Section-by-Section Analysis, 46 Fed.Reg. 20,851 (1981). Therefore we look to Louisiana law to determine whether the parties had a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">Under Louisiana law no contract existed between Haynes and the Bourgeois. <em>AA Home Improvement Co. </em>v. <em>Casern, </em>145 So.2d 624 (La.App.1962); <em>Loeb v. Johnson, </em>142 So.2d 518 (La.App.1962); and <em>National Co. v. Navarro, </em>149 So.2d 648 (La.App.1963), all held documents similar to the \u201ccontract\u201d here not to be contracts but rather offers revocable until accepted. The courts refused enforcement in each of these cases relying on clauses almost identical to the one found on the back of the Bourgeois\u2019 \u201ccontract.\u201d It is manifest that the Bourgeois effectively revoked an offer before it ripened into a contract.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-6\">. Since we find that no contract was created, we need not address Haynes\u2019 contention, based on dicta in <em>Davis v. Werne, </em>673 F.2d 866 (5th Cir. 1982), that when the plaintiff has backed out of the contract Truth-in-Lending Act penalties should not be imposed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
