He alleges that he was denied his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel at trial because his court-appointed public defender failed to investigate and prepare his case adequately. His claim is not frivolous. It deserves careful scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">Petitioner was convicted in June, 1977, for armed robbery and for being an habitual criminal. His punishment was set at ten years imprisonment on each robbery count and life imprisonment for the habitual criminal count.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">In early 1978, petitioner filed a petition seeking relief under Tennessee\u2019s post-conviction procedures, set forth at Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 40-30-101 to 40-30-124 (1982). After a hearing, the petition was denied because petitioner\u2019s direct appeal of his conviction was then pending before the Court of Criminal Appeals. Subsequently, his conviction was affirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeals, and certiorari was denied by the Tennessee Supreme Court in the fall of 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">Petitioner did not attempt to remstitute his earlier post-conviction action in the Tennessee courts or to appeal the dismissal of that action. Rather, in February, 1979, he filed a <em>pro se </em>habeas corpus petition in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>the same ineffectiveness of counsel claim that is the basis of this appeal. Then-District Judge Bailey Brown held that petitioner had not exhausted his state remedies \u201csince he did not appeal the denial of his petition for post-conviction relief in which those issues were first raised.\u201d Order Granting Respondent\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment at 2. Judge Brown noted that the dismissal was without prejudice \u2014 -\u201cpetitioner may refile these claims if he fails to get satisfaction from the state courts\u201d \u2014 but warned that if petitioner failed to file a timely appeal of the denial of his Tennessee post-conviction petition, \u201cand petitioner again seeks federal habeas relief ..., [he] will have to convince the federal court that he did not deliberately bypass his state remedies,\u201d citing <em>Fay v. Noia, </em>372 U.S. 391, 438-40, 83 S.Ct. 822, 848-49, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">It appears that petitioner then filed another petition for post-conviction relief in state court, although there is no record of this second petition before us or of the Tennessee court\u2019s disposition of it. Counsel for petitioner stated in oral argument before this Court that petitioner\u2019s second petition was summarily \u2014 and erroneously \u2014 denied by the clerk of the Tennessee court as simply \u201crepetitious.\u201d Again, however, according to counsel, petitioner did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-15\">In November, 1980, petitioner filed a second <em>pro se </em>habeas petition in the District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. The Court ordered petitioner to show cause why his application should not be dismissed for failure to exhaust under Rule 9 of the Rules Governing Proceedings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254; but the Court ultimately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>entered an order stating that he was satisfied that petitioner had exhausted available state remedies, although we are not told the basis for this conclusion. The Court appointed the Federal Public Defender to represent petitioner, and counsel has performed her task in the court below and here in a diligent and careful manner. After an evidentiary hearing in May, 1982, the judge dismissed the habeas corpus petition, holding that the conduct of petitioner\u2019s trial counsel met the required standard of reasonably effective counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The statute governing federal court review of state prisoners\u2019 habeas corpus claims, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (1976), provides that a state prisoner\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus will not be granted unless the petitioner has exhausted available state court remedies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The state initially opted not to argue on appeal that petitioner had failed to exhaust available state remedies. Nevertheless, the state\u2019s omission does not free us from our obligation to consider a jurisdictional defense raised and considered in the District Court and therefore properly before this Court. <em>See Bowen v. Tennessee, </em>698 F.2d 241 (6th Cir.1983) (en banc) (total exhaustion rule, as interpreted by Supreme Court in <em>Rose v. Lundy, </em>455 U.S. 509, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982), could not be waived or conceded in district court by the state attorney general and could be noticed by the court of appeals <em>sua </em>sponte). We therefore ordered that the question be briefed, and the state now argues that the petitioner has not exhausted. Both sides have now filed careful briefs on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">It is obvious that petitioner was hampered in pursuing post-conviction remedies by his <em>pro se </em>status. The fact remains, however, that we do not have before us a claim which the state courts have had an opportunity to address on the merits. We recognize that it would be unrealistic to expect petitioner to have put forth this ineffectiveness of counsel claim on direct appeal. He was still being represented by the attorney who defended him at his trial. Even so, it remained open to petitioner to bring this claim to the attention of the state in a post-conviction appeal. It is unclear whether he in fact raised the issue in his first post-conviction action, which was dismissed on procedural grounds, and even more uncertain whether he raised it in the second post-conviction petition. There can be no doubt, however, that petitioner failed to appeal either of these state court procedural dispositions. Thus, the Tennessee state courts have not had an opportunity to examine the facts and pass on the validity of petitioner\u2019s federal constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">Counsel for petitioner argues strongly that this Court should not require him to return to the state court post-conviction process because, as the District Court suggested, \u201cno available state remedies whose pursuit would not be futile\u201d exist to protect his rights. We do not agree with this position. There is no statute of limitations in the Post-Conviction Procedure Act, and therefore a prisoner may initiate a claim at any time. <em>See </em>Anderson, <em>Post Conviction Relief in Tennessee, </em>48 Tenn.L.Rev. 605, 647 &amp; n. 188 (1981) (noting that all prisoners \u201cwho can show a present need for post-conviction relief, even petitioners who are no longer in custody ... or who clearly did not raise their claims for relief at the first opportunity, are entitled to seek post-conviction relief\u201d). Furthermore, it is by no means clear that petitioner will be deemed by the state court to have \u201cpresumptively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>waived\u201d his right to proceed under the Post-Conviction Procedure Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Moreover, it may be that the Tennessee courts will interpret the state\u2019s procedural default rules in accordance with the \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d analysis articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977). The Court held that, \u201cas a matter of comity but not of federal power,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 82, 97 S.Ct. at 2504, federal habeas courts may deny relief to petitioners with constitutional claims who have failed to comply with state procedural rules, absent a showing of \u201ccause\u201d for failing to comply and \u201cprejudice\u201d from a finding of default. Although by its terms <em>Wainwright </em>dealt with the responsibilities of federal habeas courts rather than state courts, the Court emphasized that the \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d standard should be employed so as to guarantee that the state procedural waiver rule \u201cwill not prevent a federal habeas court from adjudicating for the first time the federal constitutional claim of a defendant who in the absence of such an adjudication will be the victim of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90, 97 S.Ct. at 2508. <em>See generally Mad-dux v. Rose, </em>483 F.Supp. 661, 665 (E.D. Tenn.) (holding that <em>Wainwright </em>\u201ccause and prejudice\u201d rule is limited to procedural defaults in state trial courts, leaving in effect the <em>Fay v. Noia </em>\u201cknowing waiver\u201d and \u201cdeliberate bypass\u201d standard where the procedural default occurs on the state appellate court level), <em>affirmed, </em>627 F.2d 1091 (6th Cir.1980) (mem.).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">This case deserves review on the merits in the state court, and the presumption contained in the state post-conviction statute is expressly made rebuttable. In order to find that petitioner made such a waiver, the state court would have to find that he knowingly and understandingly failed to present the ineffectiveness of counsel claim when he had an opportunity to do <em>so </em>\u2014 viz., in his second action under the Post-Conviction Procedure Act. If, as petitioner maintains, the second petition was never considered on the merits but was dismissed on the clerk\u2019s determination that it was repetitious, there is no basis for believing that petitioner could not use this and other information to rebut the presumption. In the event that the Tennessee courts should decide that petitioner has waived the ineffectiveness of counsel claim because he did not appeal the earlier dismissal, petitioner can appeal that decision and, if still unsatisfied, return to federal court for a habeas hearing. <em>See Wainwright </em>v. <em>Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977) (when procedural default bars state litigation of a constitutional claim, state prisoner may still obtain federal habeas relief upon a showing of cause and prejudice). In short, under the circumstances, we cannot say that it would be futile for petitioner to return to the Tennessee courts and present his ineffectiveness of counsel claim. <em>Cf. Estelle v. Williams, </em>425 U.S. 501, 515, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 1698, 48 L.Ed.2d 126 (1976) (Powell, J., concurring) (the policy disfavoring inferred waivers of constitutional rights \u201cneed not be carried to the length of allowing counsel for a defendant deliberately to forgo objection to a curable trial defect, . .. simply because he thought objection would be futile\u201d) (cited in <em>Engle v. Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 71 L.Ed.2d 783 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">The exhaustion requirement to which we defer today serves to minimize friction between federal and state systems of justice by allowing the state an initial opportunity to pass upon and correct alleged violations of prisoners\u2019 federal constitutional rights. Where there is no reason to believe that state judicial remedies would be unavailable, we are obliged to hold that petitioner\u2019s sixth amendment claim may not properly be considered on the merits for the first time in a federal habeas proceeding. Accordingly, we remand petitioner\u2019s case to the Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>trict Court with instructions to dismiss the petition for the reasons set out above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-6\">.
