The nonsectarian centers brought this action against the responsible state official, challenging the constitutionality of the exemption on the basis that it violated the establishment clause of the first amendment and also denied the nonsectarian centers the equal protection of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the state defendant, holding that the exemption had both a secular purpose and primary secular effect and involved a permissible effort by the state to comply with its constitutional obligation to avoid infringement of the sectarian sponsors\u2019 rights under the religion clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">We conclude that, under the establishment clause, the challenged exemption is facially overbroad as a permissible accommodation to any free exercise rights of the sectarian operators of child care centers. On this basis, we hold that summary judgment was improperly granted to the defendant. On the same basis, we hold that summary judgment might properly be granted to the nonsectarian plaintiffs on the present record. But we conclude that because of critical inadequacies in that record and the absence as parties of the sectarian center operators, such a disposition would be inconclusive of the underlying, conflicting constitutional claims of the sectarian and nonsectarian operators in respect of the state\u2019s regulatory scheme. For this reason, we vacate and remand to allow the sectarian operators, if so disposed, to intervene to press in further proceedings their free exercise claims against the establishment clause claims of plaintiffs. Failing intervention by the sectarian operators under the conditions we express, we direct entry of summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">The Commonwealth of Virginia has regulated all child care centers since at least 1948 by requiring these centers to meet certain licensing standards. From 1968 to 1979, all persons who operated child care centers, without regard to sectarian or nonsectarian affiliation, were required to comply with the licensing requirements of Va. Code \u00a7\u00a7 63.1-195 through 63.1-219 and the regulations promulgated thereunder. An applicant for a license under these provisions was required to submit an application to the Commissioner of the Department of Welfare containing an outline of the center\u2019s proposed activities, facilities and services, \u00a7 63.1-197; the Commissioner was then required to investigate the applicant\u2019s proposal and to inquire into the character, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>reputation and financial responsibility of the applicant, \u00a7 63.1-198. The applicant was required to grant the Commissioner reasonable opportunity to inspect its facilities, books and records and to interview its employees and agents. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">If the Commissioner found that the applicant\u2019s operation was reasonably conducive to the welfare of the children it might serve and that the applicant\u2019s financial responsibility gave reasonable assurance of continued maintenance of its operation, the Commissioner was to issue a license, \u00a7 63.1-199. The Commissioner retained the right to inspect the center and to interview any employee or customer of the center at reasonable times, \u00a7 63.1-210. In addition to complying with these statutory requirements, a person seeking a license for operating a center had to comply with regulations drawn up by the State Board of Welfare that prescribe general standards and policies for the operation of child care centers. <em>See </em>\u00a7 63.1-202.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">During the early 1970\u2019s, the number of child care centers in Virginia increased significantly to meet the rising demand for outside-the-home child day care. As the number of centers increased, the Virginia Department of Welfare received numerous complaints that many of the centers were providing inadequate facilities, meals and supervision. Based upon an investigation, the Department determined that many centers were sacrificing the best interests of the children in order to maintain financial stability and to offer competitive prices. The Department further determined that many parents never visited a center before they enrolled their children there and that decisions concerning the choice of a center were often made without any parental knowledge or information about the centers.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">The Department thereupon concluded that the regulations concerning licensing and operation should be upgraded to insure that the pressures of a competitive marketplace did not intrude upon the well-being of children utilizing the service of a center. In 1976, the State Board promulgated new and more stringent regulations, which are summarized in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>tions imposed substantial requirements on all child care centers in many areas, including space, health, safety, and nutritional standards, child/staff ratios, administrative structure, staff applications, parental participation, recordkeeping, program requirements, financial disclosure, disciplinary practices and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">These standards were adopted in 1976 and applied to all child care centers, as had been the practice with prior regulations in the area. After the regulations were implemented a number of churches that operated child care centers opined to the Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Welfare, William L. Lukhard, that the new licensing requirements infringed their right freely to exercise their religious beliefs. In response to these complaints the Virginia legislature enacted Va.Code \u00a7 63.1-196.3, which exempts all \u201c[cjhild care center[s] operated or conducted under the auspices of ... religious institution[s]\u201d from compliance with the licensing requirements of \u00a7 63.1-196. Those requirements remain fully applicable to all nonsectarian child care centers, and, by express statutory provision, to any sectarian centers whose sponsors nevertheless elect to be covered. \u00a7 63.1-196.3D.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">Section 63.1-196.3, set out in the margin,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> does require the sectarian centers to meet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>several requirements but, as appears from its text, these requirements are .minimal and consist mainly of compliance with generally applicable health and safety standards related to human occupancy and use of physical facilities. In lieu of applying for and securing a license, the sectarian institutions have merely to file with the Commissioner of Welfare an initial and thereafter annual statement of intent to operate a child care center; certify that they have disclosed to all parents or guardians of enrolled children the qualifications of the staff personnel; present documentation of their tax-exempt status and of their compliance with local health and fire ordinances and with certain staff ratio requirements; and make public disclosure of certain aspects of their operations. If an exempt center fails to file the required statement of intent, the Commissioner of Welfare may take \u201csuch action as he determines appropriate,\u201d including a suit to enjoin its operation. \u00a7 63.1-196.3B. If a parent or guardian lodges a complaint with any local welfare, health, or fire department related to an exempt center\u2019s failure to comply with generally applicable health and safety regulations, those local agencies may inspect the center\u2019s facilities and take \u201cappropriate action as provided by law, including a suit to enjoin the operation of the child-care center.\u201d \u00a7 63.1-196.3C. These are the only official inspection and enforcement mechanisms provided for the exempt centers. In contrast to the nonsectarian centers, no state level inspection or enforcement mechanisms beyond that related to the filing statement requirement are provided for operation of the exempt centers.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">The net effect of the exemption in its new differentiation between sectarian and nonsectarian child care centers can therefore be summarized as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-14\">In the critical areas of licensing itself, and of program, insurance, financial resources and management, staff qualification, and internal administration following licensure, the sectarian centers are wholly relieved of official state regulation, while the nonsectarian centers remain subject in all these areas to extensive regulation under standards enforceable by state agency inspection and legal sanctions. In place of the extensive state inspection and enforcement mechanisms which remain available to enforce compliance by the nonsectarian centers with these standards, there has been substituted for the sectarian centers only limited disclosure and certification requirements respecting the qualifications (unspec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>ified) of its staff personnel, its tax-exempt status, its liability insurance coverage, its current compliance with applicable health and safety laws, and a written description of its physical facilities, enrollment capacity, food service and staff health requirements. Although the disclosure and certification requirement is itself enforceable, no sanctions with respect to the matters required to be disclosed or certified remain for the sectarian centers, as they do with respect to the nonsectarian.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">In the general areas of child health and safety, the sectarian centers are relieved of a wide range of special regulatory standards related to nutrition, space, heat, light, ventilation, and physical safety which still apply to the nonsectarian centers and are enforceable against those centers by state level inspection and sanctions. In place of these special standards related to child health and safety there has been substituted for the sectarian centers only those health and safety standards already applicable to the general population through local and state fire, safety, and sanitation codes. In place of the state level inspection and enforcement mechanisms available to enforce compliance by the nonsectarian centers with applicable general and special health and safety standards, there has been substituted for the sectarian centers only the inspection and enforcement powers (presumably already available under general law) of local health, welfare and fire departments, acting on complaints of parents or guardians of affected children.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Reacting to this substantial new differentiation in licensing requirements, standards and enforcement mechanisms, the nonsectarian center plaintiffs brought this action, challenging on constitutional grounds the state\u2019s statutory exemption of sectarian sponsored centers. Plaintiffs contended that the exemption violated the establishment clauses of the federal and state constitutions, and the equal protection clause of the federal constitution. On the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court upheld the exemption against the establishment clause and equal protection challenges, essentially on the same general ground: that the state\u2019s obligation to avoid infringing the free exercise rights of the sectarian center sponsors provided a sufficient \u201csecular purpose\u201d and \u201cprimary secular effect\u201d to withstand the establishment clause challenge and a sufficiently \u201ccompelling state interest\u201d to withstand the equal protection challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Critical to the district court\u2019s decision was its express conclusion that it was irrelevant whether free exercise rights of the sectarian center operators were actually being burdened by the pre-exemption licensing requirements and if so, to what extent. In the court\u2019s view, \u201csuch is not the question before the Court.\u201d J.A. 187. In assessing whether the exemption reflected a justifying \u201csecular legislative purpose,\u201d or a \u201ccompelling state interest,\u201d it sufficed for the court that by means of the exemption \u201cthe State hoped to prevent possible litigation of any free exercise claims against the licensing requirements and at the same time to assure the welfare of children in church centers by means which intrude as little as possible upon the activities of the church.\u201d J.A. 189. For the district court, \u201c[ljogic supports the conclusion that if regulations arguably violate the free exercise clause it is justifiable for the State to employ a less intrusive means of regulating the church-run centers.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">From the district court\u2019s resulting grant of summary judgment to defendant and denial of summary judgment to plaintiffs, plaintiffs took this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">This case presents a unique litigation clash between the religion clauses of the first amendment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Though direct clashes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>between the two are understandably avoided by the courts whenever possible, <em>see Widmar v. Vincent, </em>454 U.S. 263, 273 &amp; n. 13, 102 S.Ct. 269, 276 &amp; n. 13, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981), they are, of course not unprecedented, <em>see Sherbert v. Verner, </em>374 U.S. 398, 413-17, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 1798-01, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963) (Stewart, J., concurring). The uniqueness here has to do with the procedural setting in which this clash \u2014 an unavoidable one \u2014 occurs. Because the resulting adjudicative difficulty heavily influences the decision we reach, we commence by analyzing the way in which free exercise and establishment clause rights are here brought into conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The essence of the matter is simply stated. The \u201creligious institutions\u201d exemption is challenged on the basis that it violates the establishment clause: that in its sphere of operation the exemption impermissibly favors \u201creligion over nonreligion.\u201d <em>See Walz v. Tax Commission, </em>397 U.S. 664, 694, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 1424, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1969) (Harlan, J., concurring). As the parties and the district court properly saw, the appropriate standard for assessing this establishment clause challenge is the three-part guideline test of <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman, </em>403 U.S. 602, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971). Under that analytical test, the challenged legislation fails constitutionally unless it is found to have a secular legislative purpose, to have a primary effect that does not advance or inhibit religion, and to have no potential for fostering excessive governmental entanglement with religion. <em>Id. </em>at 612-13, 91 S.Ct. at 2111. Seeking to justify the statutory exemption under this test, the state has advanced as the \u201csecular purpose\u201d of the exemption the constitutionally compelled or permitted accommodation it makes to the free exercise rights of the exempted institutions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>By this process, constitutional compliance with one of the religion clauses has been advanced in litigation as a justifying \u201csecular purpose\u201d for legislation challenged under the other. An awkwardness results that is both conceptual and practical. Because it bears directly upon the court\u2019s ability fairly to adjudicate the conflicting religion clause claims on the summary judgment record we review, we pause to point up the special nature of the difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">In the setting of this case the persons whose free exercise rights are centrally in issue are not parties to the litigation and those rights have not been authoritatively established in any other constitutional adjudication. Rather, the rights of those persons are being indirectly asserted in this litigation by the state, which more commonly in free exercise litigation finds itself on the other side, defending or seeking to enforce legislation challenged by such persons as violative of free exercise rights.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The result of a successful defense by the state in this case would therefore be a confirmation by judicial review of a prior legislative accommodation of free exercise rights of persons whose entitlement thereto will never have been put to test in an adversarial adjudicative process in which they were parties with the normal burdens of production and persuasion on disputed factual and legal issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">To point out this awkwardness is not of course to suggest that persons claiming free exercise rights (or others of constitutional origin) may only have them officially recognized and vindicated by judicial challenges to prior legislative (or executive) action alleged to have violated them. The right to petition government for redress of grievances obviously is not so circumscribed. Neither is it to suggest, in corollary, that only the courts and not the legislative (or executive) branches of government may recognize and extend first instance protection to constitutional rights, including those secured by the religion clauses. Of course the other branches\u2014 both federal and state \u2014 may and do so. But the action of these other branches is of course then subject to judicial review if the governmental action is later put in constitutional issue in a judicial case or controversy, <em>see Marbury v. Madison, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803), and therein lies the rub here.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">Here, the state\u2019s legislative determination that it was constitutionally compelled or, at least, permitted to accommodate free exercise rights, has been put directly in issue by the state\u2019s litigation assertion that this provided the \u201csecular legislative purpose\" for the challenged exemption.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This presents a difficult problem concerning the proper scope and standard of judicial review of the resulting legislative action. For although the issue directly posed is whether under the <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman </em>test constitutional compulsion or authority constituted a justifying \u201csecular purpose\u201d for the challenged exemption, the dispositive issue must be the underlying one, indirectly raised, whether and to what extent the free exercise rights accommodated by the exemption did in fact exist. It does not seem possible \u2014 without wholly abdicating the judicial review function \u2014 to hold the accommodation a valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>secular legislative purpose for the exemption except on the basis of an independent judicial determination that free exercise rights justifying the accommodation did in fact exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Certainly it cannot be the case that merely by asserting such a legislative purpose in litigation the state is entitled to have its legislature\u2019s accommodation to assumed free exercise rights confirmed by the courts without any judicial inquiry into the validity of the assumption. The requirements of judicial deference to legislative recognition of constitutional rights cannot be thought to run that far. <em>See, e.g., Stone v. Graham, </em>449 U.S. 39, 41, 101 S.Ct. 192, 193, 66 L.Ed.2d 199 (1980) (judicial inquiry must go back of state\u2019s testimonial avowal of secular purpose); <em>Abington School District v. Schempp, </em>374 U.S. 203, 223, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 1572, 10 L.Ed.2d 844 (1963) (same); <em>Karen B. </em>v. <em>Treen, </em>653 F.2d 897, 900 (5th Cir.1981), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>455 U.S. 913, 102 S.Ct. 1267, 71 L.Ed.2d 455 (1982) (same). On such a view of things, any persons successful in pressing free exercise (or establishment clause) claims upon a legislature would have the legislature\u2019s action yielding to their claims \u2014 no matter how unfounded\u2014 effectively immunized from constitutional challenge by persons pressing conflicting judicial claims under the other religion clause (or other constitutional provisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Because we cannot accept this, we disagree with the district court in its expressed view \u2014 critical to its decision \u2014 that whether the pre-exemption regulations violated the free exercise clause was not in issue in this case. We think it was inescapably put in issue by the state\u2019s deliberate reliance upon the actuality or possibility of free exercise violation as the justifying secular purpose for the legislative exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Because it is inescapably in issue, and because its resolution is, we believe, disposi-tive, we must address it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But when we turn to that issue, we face \u2014 as did the district court \u2014 a disturbingly meager record upon which to apply free exercise doctrine as shaped by authoritative Supreme Court interpretations (or \u201cnoninterpretations\u201d) of the clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">To point up the record deficiencies it is necessary briefly to summarize the relevant free exercise doctrine that would have determined, in a head-on adversarial clash between sectarian centers and the state, whether and to what extent free exercise rights were actually burdened, or even threatened with burden, by the state\u2019s pre-exemption regulatory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">We start with the fundamental proposition that the freedom to act upon religious beliefs \u2014 to engage in religious activity \u2014 is not absolute, as is the right to hold those beliefs; activity may be curtailed in some circumstances for the protection of sufficiently compelling societal interests. <em>Cantwell v. Connecticut, </em>310 U.S. 296, 303-04, 60 S.Ct. 900, 903, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940). Whether state law impinges at all upon free exercise rights first depends upon whether \u201cthe purpose or effect of [the] law is to impede the observance of .. . religionf ].\u201d <em>Sherbert v. Verner, </em>374 U.S. 398, 404, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 1794, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963). Whether, in turn, the holding or active expression of particular beliefs involves the observance of \u201creligion\u201d depends upon the sincerity of the beliefs held and the centrality of those beliefs to an identifiable religious faith or commitment; only those laws that impede the holding or active expression of sufficiently sincere and central religious beliefs impinge upon free exercise rights. <em>See Wisconsin v. Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 215-19, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 1533-35, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972). If, under these tests, a particular law does impede \u201creligious\u201d ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>tivity, even indirectly, it violates the free exercise clause, unless the impediment is justified by a compelling state interest arising from some substantial threat to public health, safety, peace, or order, <em>see Yoder, </em>406 U.S. at 221-29, 92 S.Ct. at 1536-40; <em>Sherbert, </em>374 U.S. at 403, 83 S.Ct. at 1793, and is the least restrictive means for protecting the compelling state interest, <em>id. </em>at 406, 83 S.Ct. at 1795.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Where free exercise rights, as measured by these tests, exist, the state is constitutionally obligated to accommodate them, even if this entails some degree of disparate treatment of religious activity; by definition, constitutionally compelled accommodation of free exercise rights cannot abridge the establishment clause. <em>Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 235 n. 22, 92 S.Ct. at 1543 n. 22; <em>Sherbert, </em>374 U.S. at 409, 83 S.Ct. at 1796. And, indeed, to provide the necessary \u201cplay in the joints productive of a benevolent neutrality,\u201d <em>Walz v. Tax Commission, </em>397 U.S. 664, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1969), the range of permissible state accommodation to free exercise rights runs beyond that constitutionally compelled \u2014 out to limits ultimately imposed by the establishment clause. <em>Id. </em>at 673, 90 S.Ct. at 1413. Where those limits of permissible accommodation lie in a particular case involves a \u201cvalue judgment\u201d guided only by historical inquiry and prior authoritative judicial decisions. <em>Id. </em>at 669, 90 S.Ct. at 1411.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">All this being so, we cannot question the appropriateness of the state\u2019s seeking to defend the challenged exemption here on the basis that the accommodation it makes to the activities of \u201creligious institutions\u201d was constitutionally compelled or at least constitutionally permitted by reason of the existence of free exercise rights in those institutions, and that this provided a saving \u201csecular purpose\u201d for the exemption under establishment clause challenge. Protection of constitutional rights can properly be advanced by government as justification for governmental action that is under challenge for violation of other constitutional rights. <em>See Widmar v. Vincent, </em>454 U.S. 263, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981) (protection of establishment clause rights recognized, though rejected on merits, as cognizable \u201ccompelling state interest\u201d defense to free speech challenge). We do not suppose that a court in which such a justification issue is raised is without power to adjudicate it notwithstanding the absence as parties of those persons in behalf of whose free exercise rights the legislative accommodation was allegedly made. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(b) (criteria for \u201cindispensability\u201d of parties). It is obvious, on the other hand, that fair and complete disposition of the difficult religion clause issues raised in this case would have been greatly aided by the presence of those persons as parties. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(a) (criteria for \u201cconditionally necessary\u201d parties). A moment\u2019s reflection and a summary review of the evidence marshaled for the court by the parties on their cross-motions for summary judgment will make this plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">The plaintiffs had to do no more than hold up the challenged exemption for judicial scrutiny to demonstrate its palpable facial non-neutrality in respect of religion; the exempted activities are, by definition, only those of \u201creligious institutions\u201d and the substantiality of the degree of favor conferred upon religion in relation to nonreligion is equally palpable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>distinguished the challenge in this case from those in cases such as <em>Mueller v. Allen, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 3062, 77 L.Ed.2d 721 (1983), and <em>Walz, </em>397 U.S. 664, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1969), where the establishment clause challenges were to legislation that on its face equally favored both nonsectarian and sectarian interests, the claim being that it was nevertheless impermissible under the Establishment Clause so to favor the sectarian interests. Importantly, in each of those cases the secular purpose advanced as justification for the legislation applied broadly and equally to nonsectarian as well as sectarian interests and had to do with the intrinsic value, from society\u2019s viewpoint, of the religiously neutral conduct being encouraged, aided, or relieved of burden by the legislation. <em>See </em>Mueller, \u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 103 S.Ct. at 3066 (aid to elementary and secondary education); <em>Walz, </em>397 U.S. at 672, 90 S.Ct. at 1413 (\u201cmoral or mental improvement of community at large\u201d). It is this very breadth of coverage and focus upon societal values not peculiarly the domain of religion that has allowed the Supreme Court in those cases to find the animating purpose of the legislation to be \u201csecular,\u201d and the legislation to be \u201cbenevolently neutral\u201d both in purpose and in nonentangling primary effect. <em>See </em>Mueller,\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 103 S.Ct. at 3067 (upholding tax deduction \u201cassuring the continued financial health of private schools, both sectarian and nonsectarian\u201d); <em>Walz, </em>397 U.S. at 673, 90 S.Ct. at 1413 (upholding tax exemption to all \u201chouses of religious worship within a broad class of property owned by nonprofit, quasi-public corporations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">By contrast, the challenged exemption here is expressly designed only to benefit \u201creligious institutions,\u201d and the legislative purpose avowed for it has expressly to do only with religious values. It is for this reason, of course, that the state has perforce here rested its claim of justification\u2014 of secular purpose \u2014 solely on the existence of free exercise rights, identifying the protection of those indisputably religious interests as the \u201csecular\u201d purpose of the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">On the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, we therefore hold that the state had the burden of demonstrating the existence, as a matter of law, of free exercise rights justifying the exemption on this basis. If it failed to carry that burden, it could not properly be awarded summary judgment, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c), though its failure to do so need not on the other hand compel judgment for the plaintiffs on their cross-motion \u2014 a matter to which we will return.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">This burden could only be carried by a demonstration beyond factual dispute that the previously regulated but now exempted activities expressed sufficiently central and sincerely held religious beliefs to permit the full sweep of free exercise protections provided by the exemption. While, as noted, evidence to this effect might best have come from persons directly claiming the free exercise rights \u2014 as in free exercise litigation it typically has come \u2014 it of course lay with the state as defendant to marshal the requisite evidence from whatever sources it chose, including the testimony of exempted institutions or any favorable evidence marshaled by plaintiffs, or indeed to contend that free exercise rights were manifest as a matter of law in the very nature of the exempted activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">But when we look to the totality of the evidence marshaled and to the activities exempted from former regulation, it simply cannot be held that this burden was carried. In the first place it could not be thought carried on the basis that <em>all </em>activities, or at least all \u201cgood works\u201d activities, of conced-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>edly religious institutions, are <em>per se </em>\u201creligious,\u201d hence entitled to free exercise protections. This simply is not the law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See Walz, </em>397 U.S. at 674, 90 S.Ct. at 1414. The rule instead is that some activities of undoubtedly \u201creligious\u201d institutions may fall completely outside the realm of protected \u201creligion,\u201d notwithstanding their undoubted legitimacy or manifest social virtue, <em>see, e.g., De La Salle Institute v. United States, </em>195 F.Supp. 891 (N.D.Cal.1961) (operation of winery). Neither, obviously, does the whole sweep of exempt activities here lie so manifestly at the core of religious practices\u2014 such as prayer, worship, and ritual \u2014 as to be entitled <em>per se </em>to protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">These possibilities aside, the existence of free exercise rights justifying the full sweep of legislative protection afforded by the exemption here could only have been demonstrated by evidence \u2014 historical, ecclesiastical, and other \u2014 that sufficiently related the particular activities exempted to sincerely and centrally held religious beliefs of the sectarian sponsors of child care centers.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">The record is simply devoid of evidence from which any such specific relationship between beliefs and conduct could have been found to exist across the range of the now-exempted activities.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Indeed, the state was content to present evidence that tended merely to demonstrate the impetus for the legislature\u2019s action upon an avowed secular purpose to accommodate.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That evidence simply did not go at all to the underlying issue respecting the existence of protectible free exercise rights, except to the extent of showing that some persons had asserted their existence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">Not only was the evidence insufficient to demonstrate the existence of free exercise rights across the entire range of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>exempted activities, it actually demonstrated the converse \u2014 that some at least of the exempted activities were not entitled as a matter of law to free exercise protections. For purposes of our review it suffices to identify only the most obvious. On no possible view could the requirement that child care centers contain a minimum area of space per child, that they provide suitably spaced and covered cots and cribs, and that they provide nutritious meals, be held to impinge upon any currently known or practiced religious beliefs under free exercise protection. At least these areas of conduct (and arguably many of the other areas formerly subject to general regulation but now exempted from regulation in the sectarian center operations) are manifestly and properly concerned only with the health, safety and welfare of the children in the child care centers.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">This being so, it is not necessary to decide whether some of the exempted operations may have been entitled to free exercise protection. On the summary judgment ruling we review, it suffices to hold that the defendant has failed to demonstrate beyond factual dispute that the entire range of exempted operations were so entitled. The exemption, on its face, and as a matter of law was overbroad in relation to the secular legislative purpose claimed for it.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See King's Garden </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>498 F.2d 51, 54-55 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, 419 U.S. 996, 95 S.Ct. 309, 42 L.Ed.2d 269 (1974). The defendant was therefore not entitled to summary judgment. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The question then arises whether, as plaintiffs assert, they were entitled to summary judgment on their cross-motion. More precisely, the question is whether upon a summary judgment record demonstrating some degree of overbreadth of the challenged exemption in relation to its avowed secular purpose of accommodating free exercise rights, the plaintiffs are entitled to a summary judgment that, as written, the exemption is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">We believe that such a declaration would technically be warranted here without any necessity on the plaintiffs\u2019 part to demonstrate, or on the court\u2019s part to determine, the precise extent of overbreadth. That is to say, we do not believe it is incumbent either upon a party challenging such legislation or upon a court entertaining such a challenge to \u201cblue pencil\u201d the legislation in order to square it with the constitutional provision invoked to challenge it. The judicial function in such cases may best be served by a simple declaration that, as they stand, the two do not perfectly square, so that the legislation as it stands must perforce fall. <em>See United States v. Butler, </em>297 U.S. 1, 62, 56 S.Ct. 312, 317, 80 L.Ed. 477 (1936); see <em>also </em>W. Van Alstyne, <em>Interpreting This Constitution: The Unhelpful Contributions of Special Theories of Judicial Review, </em>35 Fla.L.Rev. 209 (1983) (extolling virtues of limited, procedurally constrained constitutional review). By this means any revision thought needed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>square the two is left to the legislature so far as the statute is concerned, or to the people so far as the Constitution is concerned. And that, in the ordinary case, is arguably where \u2014 in faithfulness to separation of powers concerns \u2014 the squaring functions should be left or at least first exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">But this general principle \u2014 even if it be accepted as ordinarily the wise one \u2014 has its exceptions. In some situations it may of course be necessary or at least prudent for the courts to do the necessary squaring of statute with Constitution by excising only the unconstitutional portions of legislation not wholly unconstitutional.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">That course is indicated as the proper one here. If we were to declare the exemption unconstitutionally overbroad as written, the likelihood that effective legislative revision without further judicial involvement would occur seems rather remote. The greater\u2014 or at least equal \u2014 likelihood would seem a belated free exercise challenge by at least some of the exempted \u201creligious institutions\u201d \u2014 either to the wholly restored legislative regulatory scheme or to any later revised version that did not make an approximately equal accommodation to that of the exemption successfully challenged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">As we have indicated at several points, such a direct free exercise challenge by the sectarian institutions would provide a much surer basis than does the present lawsuit for judicial determination of the constitutionally permissible extent of state accommodation. But this would mean two (or more) lawsuits to force a final squaring of the legislative regulatory scheme with the difficult cross-demands of the religion clauses. With the fat already so far in the judicial fire, a better solution to a problem that almost certainly will not go away short of ultimate judicial resolution would be to encourage that resolution in the present lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">This may be done here if the summary adjudication of unconstitutionality for over-breadth that we find justified on the present record is nevertheless conditionally denied, and if the persons whose free exercise rights are centrally in issue in this action are now added as parties to further proceedings in it. Both of these may properly be done under traditional procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">Even where summary judgment is appropriate on the record so far made in a case, a court may properly decline, for a variety of reasons, to grant it. <em>See generally </em>10A C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; M. Kane, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Civil </em>\u00a7 2728 (1983). We think this is such a case, for reasons earlier suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-13\">A declaration of unconstitutionality for overbreadth would not finally conclude the underlying, conflicting claims of the primary parties in interest in this litigation. Such a declaration would not by its terms, nor could it, preclude subsequent challenges by any of the presently exempted \u201creligious institutions\u201d \u2014 nonparties to this litigation\u2014 to all or any portions of the restored general regulatory scheme, or any legislatively revised version. Nor could such a declaration prevent a series of piecemeal challenges and counter-challenges by the affected sectarian and nonsectarian institutions to successive legislative attempts to accommodate their conflicting religion clause claims. In other words, summary adjudication on so limited a basis of issue and party preclusion and on so inadequate a factual record, <em>see Williams v. Howard Johnson\u2019s Inc., </em>323 F.2d 102, 105 (4th Cir.1963), is likely to be inconclusive of the underlying rights in issue, including those of the prevailing plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-14\">If, on the other hand, the action is remanded for further evidentiary proceedings with all the most directly affected parties in interest \u2014 the nonsectarian and sectarian child care center operators along with the state \u2014 those parties can fully develop their opposing legal and factual positions and a definitive resolution of their conflicting religion clause claims and defenses can be achieved in this litigation. We think the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>sectarian operators who claim entitlement to free exercise protection should be parties to this action \u2014 for reasons already adequately explained. Indeed, they appear, on our analysis of the issues in this case, to be \u201cconditionally necessary\u201d parties under the criteria of Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Under the circumstances that have developed, however, the decision whether the sectarian operators should at this late stage be made parties should be left to them. If they desire to intervene as a class<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3) and if the numerosity and other requirements of the class action rule can be met, they should be permitted to intervene as of right. Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a)(2). A fair opportunity to intervene can be provided them upon remand. If they decline then to intervene, or if intervention as a class is found infeasible, summary judgment for the plaintiffs should follow, on the basis that the exemption as now written is unconstitutionally overbroad under the establishment clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Upon intervention of the sectarian operators as a class, further evidentiary proceedings may be devoted to developing \u2014 under applicable substantive doctrine and appropriately allocated burdens of proof, <em>see </em>Part II, <em>supra </em>\u2014 the extent of any free exercise rights had by the sectarian institutions in the exempted activities, and the nature and extent of any compelling state interest in nevertheless regulating those activities. This will provide a basis \u2014 not now provided \u2014 for a properly informed \u201cvalue judgment\u201d by the court of the constitutionally permissible extent, under establishment clause constraints, of the accommodation to free exercise rights made in the challenged exemption.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">In developing such a record, the initial burden of production should be upon the sectarian institution intervenors to establish the extent, if any, of their free exercise rights in the exempted activities. If they should fail, under relevant constitutional doctrine, to establish the existence of any such rights, the exemption should be declared wholly unconstitutional. If, however, the intervenors establish the existence of free exercise rights in any of the exempted activities, it should then lie with the plaintiffs to establish the existence of a compelling state interest that nevertheless justified regulation of those free exercise activities.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The court may then proceed to exercise an informed \u201cvalue judgment\u201d in defining the line of permissible state accommodation \u2014 allowing sufficient \u201cfree play in the joints\u201d \u2014 to any free exercise rights found to have existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to defendants is vacated.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, a child-care center operated or conducted under the auspices of a religious institution shall be exempt from licensure as required by \u00a7 63.1-196. Such religious institution shall file with the Commissioner of Welfare, prior to beginning any such operation and thereafter annually, a statement of intent to operate a child-care center, certification that the child-care center has disclosed to the parents or guardians of the children in the center the qualifications of the personnel employed therein and documentary evidence that:</p>\n<p id=\"b331-15\">1.

If a religious institution operates a child-care center and does not file the statement and documentary evidence required by paragraph A hereof, the Commissioner shall give reasonable notice to such religious institution of the nature of its noncompliance and may thereafter take such action as he determines appropriate, including a suit to enjoin the operation of the child-care center.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-16\">C.

While the plaintiffs\u2019 establishment clause and equal protection challenges are conceptually different, we think that in the final analysis resolution of the issues raised under the two comes to the same thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">The \u201cequal protection\u201d allegedly denied lies in the disparate treatment accorded the sectarian and nonsectarian centers. Justification for the conceded inequality is sought by the state in a \u201ccompelling state interest\u201d in avoiding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>infringement of free exercise rights of the sectarian operators.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The establishment clause claim is that the same difference of treatment impermissibly favors religion over nonreligion. Justification for the same action as challenged in those terms is sought in the identical avoidance of free exercise rights of the sectarian operators, asserted in this context as a \u201csecular legislative purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Whether analyzed as \u201csecular purpose\u201d or \u201ccompelling state interest,\u201d the justification therefore turns on the same ultimate inquiry: whether and to what extent the free exercise rights whose protection is asserted as justification for the manifestly disparate treatment did in fact exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">While it may be as well, where possible, to avoid head-on clashes between the religion clauses, it is not possible here. If plaintiffs\u2019 claim is analyzed solely in equal protection terms, the head-on clash is only put over to a later stage in analysis. In assessing the extent to which the state\u2019s undeniably compelling interest in accommodating any actual free exercise rights justified the particular accommodation afforded by the challenged exemption, the ultimate constraint on the state\u2019s permissible range of accommodation will still be found in the establishment clause\u2019s barrier against unduly favoring religion over nonreligion.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">In these circumstances, we have confined our analysis to the establishment clause challenge and the issues joined under it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b334-10\">. The state also asserts, though with less emphasis, that the exemption permissibly accommodates establishment clause rights of the sectarian centers. The basic thrust of this \u201ccounter-establishment clause\u201d theory is, apparently, that the pre-exemption licensing requirements, particularly those having to do with inspection and compliance mechanisms,- involved \u201cexcessive entanglement\u201d of the state with the sectarian centers; that the exemption was therefore justified to avoid this consequence. A type of \u201cnegative establishment\u201d by virtue of excessive regulation without corresponding beneficial treatment of religious institutions has undoubtedly been recognized in the religion clause cases. <em>See Lemon v. Kurtzman, </em>403 U.S. at 614-25, 91 S.Ct. at 2112-17; <em>Walz </em>v. <em>Tax Commission, </em>397 U.S. at 674, 90 S.Ct. at 1414. But the contours of \u201cnegative establishment\u201d by virtue of \u201cexcessive involvement through regulation\u201d are by no means clear. In any event they involve questions of degree that we think are wholly subsumed within the more direct question whether and to what extent free exercise rights of the sectarian operators may have been burdened by the pre-exemption regulatory pattern here in issue. That is to say, we do not see how any \u201cnegative establishment clause\u201d rights to be free of \u201cexcessively entangling regulation\u201d could be greater than the more directly pertinent rights here asserted to be relieved of the same regulatory burden upon free exercise rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-13\">For this reason, we confine our analysis to the exemption\u2019s justification as a permissible accommodation to free exercise rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b335-6\">. <em>See, </em>as specifically illustrative, the following recent cases involving state laws regulating the operation of child care and related services: <em>Kansas v. Heart Ministries, Inc., </em>227 Kan. 244, 607 P.2d 1102, (enforcement action by state), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>449 U.S. 802, 101 S.Ct. 47, 66 L.Ed.2d 6 (1980); <em>Tabernacle Baptist Church v. Conrad, C/A </em>No. 79-149 (D.S.C. Oct. 27, 28, 1980) (unpublished) (action by free exercise claimants to enjoin enforcement).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b335-7\">. Two different theories respecting the nature of the state\u2019s justification are advanced on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">Taking the most extreme position possible, Christian Law Associates, as <em>amicus curiae </em>aligned in interest with the state, apparently contends that total accommodation is compelled by the mere fact that religious institutions are the sponsors of the exempt centers.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">The state takes a more cautious position\u2014 apparently that accepted by the district court\u2014 that because the exempted activities were <em>arguably </em>under free exercise protection, the state might permissibly accommodate them as a matter of allowing \u201cplay in the joints productive of a benevolent neutrality.\u201d <em>Walz, </em>397 U.S. at 669, 90 S.Ct. at 1412.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b336-7\">. Because we find the \u201csecular purpose\u201d prong of the <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman </em>inquiry not met, we do not reach the primary secular effect and non-entanglement prongs. We observe only that the primary effect of the exemption is obviously the very effect concededly \u201cpurposed\u201d by the legislature: to favor religion over nonreligion because of an asserted concern that the accommodation to religion was constitutionally compelled or permitted. The critical inquiry then is whether the asserted \u201cpurpose\u201d \u2014directly effectuated \u2014 was \u201cclearly secular.\u201d If it was not, its primary effect could not be considered secular.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b337-6\">. To emphasize the substantiality of*the relative favor shown religious institutions by this exemption, we summarize the post-exemption situations of the sectarian and nonsectarian child care centers in relation to the state\u2019s regulatory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The only substantive requirements imposed equally on the two classes of centers under the total scheme are that both must, of course, continue to comply with all otherwise applicable general laws and regulations regarding food service activities, health and sanitation, water supply, and building and fire codes (a compulsion clearly present outside and independently of this regulatory scheme); and meet the same minimum staff-child ratios (the only equally applicable standard integral to the post-exemption regulatory scheme).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">Beyond this, the nonsectarian centers alone must comply with a substantial range of other requirements: <em>inter alia, </em>to serve meals to their patrons and meet certain nutritional criteria; to supply cots and cribs for the children\u2019s rest periods; to provide individual storage space for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>the personal effects of each child; to meet minimum space requirements, with the square-foot-per-child requirement differing for eating, play and sleeping areas; to maintain <em>two </em>staff people on duty at all times (while the sectarian centers can at times have only one); to meet administrative and organizational requirements including personnel qualifications in several respects; to keep records on each child; to provide first aid kits and separate isolation rooms for sick children; and to maintain liability insurance at a certain level and to comply with program guidelines, including certain restrictions on disciplinary practices.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b339-5\">. Indeed, it seems likely that the exempted religious institutions here would make no such ultimate claim in view of their failure, so far as we are aware, to challenge the few remaining areas of modest state regulation to which they are subjected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b339-6\">. The most directly pertinent evidence respecting any such relationship in fact tends to negate any relationship. An affidavit of the Director of the Licensing Division of the Department of Welfare stated that in a conference with an attorney for church sponsored centers the attorney \u201cstated that requiring a license as a condition for operating a child care center interfered with the church\u2019s ministry, [but] he did not contend that any particular provision of the licensing standards conflicted with the center\u2019s free exercise of its religious beliefs.\u201d J.A. 153.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b339-7\">. The principal evidence of legislative purpose offered by the state was an affidavit of the defendant Commissioner of Welfare which asserted that a number of the church operated centers had opined to him that \u201cthe requirement of licensure of their respective facilities and programs ... was a violation of their rights guaranteed by the First Amendment\u201d and that these complaints prompted a state legislator to introduce legislation \u201con behalf of these churches to exempt them from licensure requirements.\u201d J.A. 131.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b339-8\">. Indeed, even if the true issue were only whether the legislature acted on a justifiable assumption that free exercise rights <em>arguably </em>required accommodation to the degree made (the issue perhaps identified as dispositive by the district court, <em>see </em>Part I, supra), the evidence on that point was by no means undisputed. Against the state\u2019s mere evidence that complaints made by churches had prompted introduction of the exemption legislation, the plaintiffs offered evidence that the state\u2019s attorney general had rendered an official opinion at the legislature\u2019s request to the effect that the pre-exemption regulations violated no rights under the free exercise or establishment clauses. That opinion, given before the exemption\u2019s enactment, read, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">The Welfare Department\u2019s child-care center standards are reasonable and permissible regulations to protect the health, welfare and safety of enrolled children. They do not violate First Amendment rights and are enforceable against centers operated by religious institutions. The regulations are consistent with a valid governmental purpose. After applying the tests for determining possible violations of the Establishment Clause or the Free Exercise Clause, I have found no instance of an impact on religious belief and practice such as to negate these regulations of general application.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-14\">Of course, as we have indicated, we do not think that the dispositive issue on the summary judgment motion was simply whether, as the state now seems to assert, and the district court seems to have ruled, the legislature acted in a good faith belief that it could permissibly act as it did in order to avoid any possibility of violating such free exercise rights as might exist and, in any event, to avoid litigation asserting those rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b340-5\">. It is also arguably overbroad in its inclusion of all \u201creligious institutions\u201d in the exempt category. As the record indicates, J.A. 119, and as the <em>amicus </em>brief of the Virginia Council of Churches forcefully emphasizes, a significant number of the facially exempted sectarian sponsors have expressly disclaimed any felt entitlement to exemption or any felt burden upon their free exercise rights under the pre-exemption regulations. This attitude was known to the legislature at the time the exemption was under consideration, <em>id., </em>and posed an obvious dilemma for that body. Any attempt to limit the exemption to only those religious institutions that might be expected to challenge the extant regulations would have posed flagrant dangers of facially favoring \u201cone religion over another.\u201d The legislature\u2019s attempted solution was to exempt all and then give any exempted institution the right nevertheless to opt for licensure and full regulation along with the nonsectarian operators. Va.Code \u00a7 63.1-196.3 D. The awkward \u2014 if not cruel \u2014 Hob-son\u2019s choice thereby imposed upon sectarian sponsors forced to choose between relinquishment of an unsought but gratuitously conferred competitive advantage over their nonsectarian counterparts and the maintenance of religious and constitutional principles at odds with those of their other sectarian counterparts may well involve still another basis for constitutional challenge. The potential that this device posed for exacerbation by the state of religious differences among the sectarian operators is obvious, and may well involve quite another set of \u201centanglement\u201d problems for the exemption as presently structured.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\">. By this we do not express any opinion as to whether portions of the statutory exemption may be found constitutional upon more com-p\u00edete inquiry. We simply recognize that as a possibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b342-6\">. We do not believe that the goal of achieving a substantially conclusive resolution of the underlying issues and of concluding all parties in interest can properly be obtained except by means of class intervention. Individual interventions in numbers too small to meet the numerosity requirement, or on the basis of non-common issues too great in number to meet the commonality of issues requirement, would not serve the purpose sought in further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Whether the class action criteria are met by those sectarian operators who indicate a desire so to intervene must, of course, be left to the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b342-8\">. This will concededly involve line-drawing between \u201creligious\u201d and \u201csecular\u201d activities of the sectarian child care center operations that the district court thought were not constitutionally required, either by the legislature or by the court. While we recognize the difficulty, we are persuaded, and hold that the effort must and can reasonably be made. <em>See generally </em>Esbeck, <em>State Regulation of Social Service Ministries of Religious Organizations, </em>16 Val.U.L. Rev. 1, 4-11 (1981) (judicial criteria for line-drawing).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">Neither that line nor the resulting limit of permissible state accommodation to free exercise rights need \u2014 or can \u2014 be drawn with bright-line precision. The legislature must in fact be allowed some range of accommodation beyond that constitutionally compelled by free exercise rights. <em>See </em>Part II, <em>supra. </em>But establishing the permissible range requires for its benchmark a general identification of those activities that are \u201creligious\u201d and those that are not under free exercise doctrine. While, as the district court perceptively put it, the state is not required to \u201cwalk[] a tightrope between the establishment clause and the free exercise clause,\u201d J.A. 187, it is required, and the courts in judicial review also, to make an informed value judgment that does more than merely placate potential free exercise challengers by granting practically unlimited accommodation in order to avoid any challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b342-13\">. Of course, showing a compelling state interest should lie with the state as well, and an opportunity should be afforded the state to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>so. In view of the state\u2019s litigation posture to this point, however, the plaintiffs must be allowed to assert the existence of such a compelling state interest, notwithstanding the state\u2019s litigation position. The state\u2019s interest is obviously that one asserted in the original regulatory design which reached all child care centers equally. The plaintiffs must be free to assert that so long as that interest is asserted through regulation of nonsectarian centers, the same interest must exist as a sufficiently compelling one to justify minimally intrusive regulation even of those sectarian child care operations found sufficiently \u201creligious\u201d to come under free exercise protection, <em>see </em>Part II, <em>supra; </em>that if the state continues its regulation of non-sectarian center operations, it must, under the establishment clause, comparably regulate the sectarian center operations out to the limits defined by the religion clauses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b343-23\">. Although plaintiffs prayed additionally for specific injunctive relief compelling the state-defendant to enforce the pre-exemption regulations against all child care center operators, we do not consider that that additional relief is required. We assume that the state will act in compliance with a declaration that the challenged exemption as written is unconstitutional and of no effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
