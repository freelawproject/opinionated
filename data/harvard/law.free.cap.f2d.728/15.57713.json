Plaintiffs claimed that the defendants\u2019 actions violated both 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, which makes it unlawful for any person acting under color of state law to deprive \u201cany citizen ... of any rights ... secured by the Constitution ...,\u201d and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3), which forbids \u201ctwo or more persons\u201d to \u201cconspire ... for the purpose of depriving ... any person ... of the equal protection of the laws .... \u201d A jury found for the plaintiffs and defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-15\">The record, with inferences drawn in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, <em>Bayamon Thom McAn, Inc. v. Miranda, </em>409 F.2d 968, 969 (1st Cir. 1969), shows essentially the following facts. For many years, Stathos worked for the Peabody Municipal Lighting Plant (\u201cPMLP\u201d) as \u201cprincipal clerk and secretary\u201d and Bailey as \u201cclerk typist.\u201d In 1977, PMLP\u2019s manager divided the plant into four departments: generation, electrical engineering, distribution, and business office. He drew up a chart, which reflected, more accurately than their job titles, his view of plaintiffs\u2019 actual status and duties. On the chart, Stathos appeared as head of the business office, reporting directly to the plant manager, and Bailey reported directly to Stathos. Stathos, as of 1978, was paid $15,-819 per year; Bailey, $13,816. Men, paid $27,139 per year, ran each of the other three departments, while men, paid $25,201 per year, reported directly to them. The manager believed the chart\u2019s suggested equivalence of rank and duty was accurate; he recommended that the Commission raise the salaries of Stathos and Bailey, paying them what other heads and assistant heads received \u2014 an increase of about $12,000 per year for each of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-16\">The Commission considered the manager\u2019s recommendations in the fall of 1978. On October 12th, the Commission discussed, not the merits of the issue, but the fact that the pay proposal had \u201cleaked\u201d to the press. On November 28th, the Commission voted to deny the proposal; it also voted to deny Stathos and Bailey a small 5 percent pay increase; but it directed that a Commission committee study the proposal. Evidently it never undertook a formal study.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>In March 1979, the Commission again considered plaintiffs\u2019 pay. It rejected a series of compromises that PMLP\u2019s manager offered. It decided, however, to create a new \u201coffice unit\u201d and to make Stathos the \u201coffice manager\u201d and Bailey her \u201cadministrative assistant.\u201d It voted them pay increases that narrowed the pay gap between the first and second \u201coffice\u201d positions and those in \u201cgenerating,\u201d \u201cengineering,\u201d and \u201cdistribution\u201d from about $12,000 to about $9,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">In January 1980, the Commission hired a professional management group, Olney Associates, to describe, compare, and suggest pay for 35 PMLP positions. The Olney report rated Stathos\u2019s job at \u201c16,\u201d equal to the number two positions in the \u201cgenerating\u201d and \u201cengineering\u201d departments, and midway between number one (at \u201c18\u201d) and number two (at \u201c14\u201d) in \u201cdistribution.\u201d The report also recommended pay increases for Stathos and Bailey. The Commission adopted the report, but denied Stathos and Bailey the recommended pay increases, leaving them the only executives paid less than the report recommended.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In the summer of 1980, Bailey asked the manager to change her title because it was shortly to lose Civil Service protection. The manager agreed and persuaded the Commission to vote 4-1 in favor of such a change. When Bailey later asked the dissenting Commissioner why he had voted \u2018no,\u2019 he answered that he thought the \u201cgirls\u201d were asking for too much money and should not have filed suit. He also remarked that the Commission\u2019s vote would change because he had talked to one of the other Commissioners. That evening the Commission voted 4-1 to deny the change in title.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">In July 1981, the manager recommended raising Stathos\u2019s and Bailey\u2019s grades. The Commission kept Stathos at 16 but raised Bailey to 14. It then voted them pay increases, but because it also raised the pay of positions one and two in the other departments, it preserved the pay disparity.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The plaintiffs presented other evidence designed to show deliberate intent to discriminate on the basis of sex. Defendants, of course, presented evidence designed to show the contrary. The case was well tried in the district court. And although we consider each of defendants\u2019 arguments for error, we see no need to discuss the facts and evidence in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">1. Defendants argue that the district court should not have excluded six studies prepared by their statistical expert, Thomas Marx. Marx presented nine studies. The court allowed him to testify as to three. These three compared (i) percentage raises that PMLP gave plaintiffs and their male PMLP counterparts from June 1969 to June 1982 and (ii) percentage raises that PMLP gave each of these groups on account of job promotions from 1973 to 1982. The third study compared two salary relationships: (i) Stathos\u2019s salary as a percentage of other top PMLP salaries with (ii) former male PMLP office managers\u2019 salaries as a percentage of the same top PMLP salaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">The six studies that the court rejected involved comparisons between plaintiffs\u2019 salaries and salaries in other Massachusetts municipal electric companies. They can be described most easily by designating the positions compared as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-11\">Plant Manager \u2014 M</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU\">Head Office Manager \u2014 Oi</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ah-dedup-0\">Assistant Office Manager \u2014 O2</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ab-dedup-0\">Superintendent of Electrical Distribution \u2014 E</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-12\">Oi and 02 at PMLP are Stathos and Bailey.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-13\">The six studies made the following salary comparisons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-14\">1) Oi and 02 at PMLP to male Oi and 02 at other Massachusetts municipal light plants;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-15\">2) the relationships at PMLP of Ox and O2 to E and M with the relationship elsewhere of male Oi and 02 to E and M;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-16\">3) Oi at PMLP to female Ox elsewhere^,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-17\">4) the relationship at PMLP of Ox to_ M with the relationship elsewhere of . female Oi to male M;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-18\">5) Oi and O2 at PMLP to Oi and O2 elsewhere;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>6) the relationship at PMLP of Oj and 02 to E and M with the relationships elsewhere of Oi and 02 to male E and M.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AA\">The district court found these six studies irrelevant. And we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The two basic issues in the case were (i) did defendants discriminate and (ii) was any discrimination intentional. <em>See Personnel Administrator v. Feeney, </em>442 U.S. 256, 272, 99 S.Ct. 2282, 2292, 60 L.Ed.2d 870 (1979); <em>Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., </em>429 U.S. 252, 264-65, 97 S.Ct. 555, 562-63, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977); <em>Washington v. Davis, </em>426 U.S. 229, 238-48, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 2046-51, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976). Defendants concede that the studies are not relevant to the second issue, for there is no evidence that they seriously considered salary levels or salary relationships at other plants when they set plaintiffs\u2019 salaries. The studies are also irrelevant to the first issue, for no one complains of discrimination between Oi and 02 at PMLP and salaries paid <em>anyone </em>at any other plant. The discrimination at issue concerns how defendants actually treated plaintiffs as holders of the Oj and 02 jobs and how they <em>would have treated </em>two men holding these same positions. The evidence of discrimination consisted of showing how defendants treated plaintiffs compared with how they treated men elsewhere in the company. The evidence was highly specific to the individual circumstances at PMLP and the actions that defendants took there. Evidence of what happened at other plants, if relevant at all, is so tangential to the case as tried as to be excludable as a \u201cwaste of time\u201d under Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">2. Defendants argue that the trial court erred in not answering a question that the jury sent out at some point between 4 p.m. on August 27,1982, when it retired to deliberate, and 4:45 p.m. The question was \u201cIs it possible to find against the Peabody Municipal Lighting Commission and not the individual Commissioners?\u201d The judge asked the clerk to see if counsel agreed that the answer should be \u201cyes.\u201d At 5:15, the clerk told counsel the judge would answer \u201cyes.\u201d Court reconvened at 5:23 to send the answer to the jury. The court was then told that the jury had reached a verdict. The judge said he would receive the verdict and neither side objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">Since defendants did not object to the court\u2019s receiving the verdict before answering the question, we review only for \u201cplain error.\u201d <em>See Sibbach v. Wilson &amp; Co., </em>312 U.S. 1, 16, 61 S.Ct. 422, 427, 85 L.Ed. 479 (1941). And we see none. The cases cited by defendants suggest that a trial judge should seek to clear up serious confusion created by his instructions. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Quintana, </em>508 F.2d 867 (7th Cir. 1975); <em>Powell v. United States, </em>347 F.2d 156 (9th Cir.1965). But here the court\u2019s instructions were initially clear. And the jury\u2019s question suggests no serious or prejudicial confusion. The jury found the individual defendants liable, not only on the \u00a7 1983 count (where arguably their individual liability stemmed from that of the Commission) but also on the conspiracy count, as to which the court clearly instructed that only they, not the Commission, could be liable. The court, moreover, instructed that conspiracy liability was strictly \u201cderivative\u201d of \u00a7 1983 liability. Thus, the risk that the jury found the individual Commissioners \u201cliable by association\u201d under the \u00a7 1983 count is not significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">3. Defendants argue that the court should have instructed the jury about \u201cgood faith\u201d immunity \u2014 a defense available to a public official in a \u201cconstitutional tort\u201d action brought under \u00a7 1983. <em>Scheuer v. Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974); <em>see Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818 &amp; n. 30, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738 &amp; n. 30, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). The court instructed the jury that to find defendants liable under \u00a7 1983, it must find \u201cfirst ... that [the plaintiffs] were discriminated against, and ... second ... that each defendant discriminated against them purposefully because they [were] women.\u201d In the circumstances of this case, the court felt that a further instruction on \u201cgood faith\u201d immunity would have been superfluous. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>In <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, supra, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cgovernment officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 818, 102 S.Ct. at 2738. The Court then discussed how a trial court should make this determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-4\">On summary judgment, the judge appropriately may determine, not only the currently applicable law, but whether that law was clearly established at the time [the] action occurred. If the law at that time was not clearly established, an official could not reasonably be expected to anticipate subsequent legal developments, nor could he fairly be said to \u201cknow\u201d that the law forbade conduct not previously identified as unlawful.... If the law was clearly established, the immunity defense ordinarily should fail, since a reasonably competent public official should know the law governing his conduct. Nevertheless, if the official pleading the defense claims extraordinary circumstances and can prove that he neither knew nor should have known of the relevant legal standard, the defense should be sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 818-19, 102 S.Ct. at 2739 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Under the court\u2019s instructions, to find liability under \u00a7 1983 the jury had to find that the defendants \u201cpurposefully\u201d discriminated against plaintiffs \u201cbecause they [were] women.\u201d And the court defined \u201cdiscrimination\u201d to mean that \u201cthe plaintiffs were treated differently or unequally under the particular relevant circumstances.\u201d The law was clear throughout this period that public officials, acting in their official capacities, could not purposely discriminate (in this sense) on the basis of sex. <em>See Personnel Administrator v. Feeney, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">We do not see how anyone could think that paying women less just because they were women would not constitute this type of unlawful discrimination. Defendants point to no \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d or other reasons why-they should not have known this. Thus, a special <em>Harlow </em>instruction was unnecessary. In fact, defendants\u2019 claim of \u201cgood faith\u201d seems to amount only to a claim that they did not \u201cpurposefully\u201d discriminate. The jury, properly instructed on this issue, found against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">4. Defendants claim that the evidence that they <em>conspired </em>to deprive plaintiffs of equal protection of the laws is inadequate. They argue that, on the basis of the record, a jury could not lawfully have found a conspiracy or acts in furtherance of a conspiracy, as \u00a7 1985(3) requires. <em>See United Brotherhood of Carpenters, Local 610 v. </em>Scott, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 3352, 3356, 77 L.Ed.2d 1049 (1983). We disagree. The record shows that defendants took a series of actions depriving plaintiffs of salary increases; that these actions involved discussions among them; that they took other concerted activity, which was necessary for their actions to be effective; and that they intended the results. Thus, under ordinary conspiracy principles, a jury could plainly impose liability \u2014 and there would be no issue\u2014 <em>were a single corporation not involved. </em>Defendants note, however, that several circuits have held that \u201cif the challenged conduct is essentially a single act of discrimination by a single business entity, the fact that two or more agents participated in the decision or in the act itself will normally not constitute the conspiracy contemplated by [\u00a7 1985(3) ].\u201d <em>Dombrowski v. Dowling, </em>459 F.2d 190, 196 (7th Cir.1972); <em>accord Herrmann v. Moore, </em>576 F.2d 453, 459 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1003, 99 S.Ct. 613, 58 L.Ed.2d 679 (1978); <em>Girard v. 94th Street &amp; Fifth Avenue Corp., </em>530 F.2d 66, 70-72 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 974, 96 S.Ct. 2173, 48 L.Ed.2d 798 (1976); <em>Baker v. Stuart Broadcasting Co., </em>505 F.2d 181, 183 (8th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">We doubt that this \u201cintracorporate\u201d exception should be read broadly. The cases employing it have rested in large part on precedent drawn from the antitrust field, where considerations underlying the need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>for an \u201cintracorporate\u201d exception to ordinary conspiracy principles are very different. <em>See </em>Handler &amp; Smart, <em>The Present Status of the Intracorporate Conspiracy Doctrine, </em>3 Cardozo L.Rev. 23, 72-73 (1981); McQuade, <em>Conspiracy, Multicorporate Enterprises, and Section 1 of the Sherman Act, </em>41 Va.L.Rev. 183, 185 (1955). The evil at which the \u201cconspiracy\u201d section of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, is aimed is an evil that exists only when two different business <em>enterprises join </em>to make a decision, such as fixing a price, that in a competitive world each would take separately. Moreover, an individual decision to do the same thing is not only legitimately socially useful but also may often require joint decision-making by managers within a single enterprise. Where \u201cequal protection\u201d is at issue, however, one cannot readily distinguish in terms of harm between the individual conduct of one enterprise and the joint conduct of several. Nor can one readily identify desirable social conduct as typically engaged in jointly by the officers of a single enterprise. Thus, the boundaries of an \u201cin-tracorporate\u201d exception to the \u00a7 1985(3) conspiracy provision should be narrower than in antitrust. Indeed, we do not see why they should extend \u2014 if at all \u2014 beyond the ministerial acts of several executives needed to carry out a single discretionary decision. <em>Cf. Novotny v. Great American Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, </em>584 F.2d 1235 (3rd Cir.1978) (en banc), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>442 U.S. 366, 99 S.Ct. 2345, 60 L.Ed.2d 957 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Regardless, defendants\u2019 activities here went beyond \u201ca single act\u201d of discrimination. Their conduct involved a series of acts over time going well beyond simple ratification of a managerial decision by directors. It consisted of joint discretionary activity \u2014 with many words and several deeds \u2014 engaged in by each of the Commissioners. <em>Cf. Rackin v. University of Pennsylvania, </em>386 F.Supp. 992 (E.D.Pa.1974). Thus, we do not believe any \u201cintracorpo-rate\u201d exception applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">5. Defendants claim the damage award to each plaintiff of $60,000 in compensatory damages under \u00a7 1983 is excessive. The jury, however, by comparing the pay PMLP\u2019s manager recommended with what plaintiffs actually received, could have awarded between $33,000 and $35,000 in \u201clost wages\u201d compensation. Pain, suffering, and related medical expenses could easily account for the rest. Such an award does not \u201cshock[ ] ... the conscience\u201d of the court. <em>Clark v. Taylor, </em>710 F.2d 4, 13 (1st Cir.1983); <em>Kolb v. Goldring, Inc., </em>694 F.2d 869, 871 (1st Cir.1982); <em>LaForest v. Autoridad de Las Fuentes Fluviales de Puerto Rico, </em>536 F.2d 443, 447 (1st Cir. 1976); <em>Rivera v. Rederi A/B Nordstjernan, </em>456 F.2d 970 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 876, 93 S.Ct. 124, 34 L.Ed.2d 128 (1972). It is well \u201cwithin the universe of possible awards that are supported by the evidence ....\u201d <em>Clark v. Taylor, </em>710 F.2d at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">6. Defendants argue that the court\u2019s award of $35,000 in attorney\u2019s fees to plaintiffs for 350 hours of legal work was excessive. First, they claim that the court erred in valuing the lead attorney\u2019s time at $85 per hour for out-of-court work and $125 per hour for in-court work and the assistant attorney\u2019s time at between $70 and $90 per hour in light of their limited experience. In fact, the lead counsel has practiced law for ten years and her assistant for four; both have considerable experience in this area; and the skill with which they (indeed, counsel for both sides) presented the case in district court and on appeal renders any claim of inexperience frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">Second, defendants argue that the rates (averaging $100 an hour for the lead attorney, for example) are too high. The rates, however, are within the boundaries of reasonable awards under principles set forth by this court and carefully applied by the district court. <em>See King v. Greenblatt, </em>560 F.2d 1024, 1026-27 (1st Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>438 U.S. 916, 98 S.Ct. 3146, 57 L.Ed.2d 1161 (1978). Other courts have awarded as much. <em>E.g., Swift v. Blum, 502 </em>F.Supp. 1140, 1147 (S.D.N.Y.1980) ($100 an hour to lead counsel, $75 an hour to co-counsel); <em>Allen v. Terminal Transport Co., </em>486 F.Supp. 1195,1198-99 (N.D.Ga.1980) (grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>ing \u201cconservative\u201d request of $90 an hour to lead counsel and $75 an hour to co-counsel), <em>aff'd sub nom. United States v. Terminal Transport Co., </em>653 F.2d 1016 (5th Cir. 1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 989, 102 S.Ct. 1613, 71 L.Ed.2d 849 (1982); <em>NAACP v. Bell, </em>448 F.Supp. 1164, 1168 (D.D.C.1978) ($100 an hour), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. NAACP v. Civiletti, </em>609 F.2d 514 (D.C. Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>447 U.S. 922, 100 S.Ct. 3012, 65 L.Ed.2d 1114 (1980); <em>Kane v. Martin Paint Stores, Inc., </em>439 F.Supp. 1054, 1056-57 (S.D.N.Y.1977) ($100 an hour to lead counsel), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>578 F.2d 1368 (2d Cir.1978). We cannot say the district court exceeded its powers in awarding the fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Third, defendants argue that the court should not have included 38.5 hours that plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys needed to defend a state declaratory judgment action that PMLP brought against them once it learned that they intended to sue PMLP in federal court. The issues in the state suit were virtually the same as in the federal case. Defendants appeared to have filed it in order to preempt the federal action. And plaintiffs were forced to defend it lest they lose their \u00a7 1983 claim in the federal courts through collateral estoppel. <em>See Allen v. McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980). Defense of the state court action was a necessary part of plaintiffs\u2019 efforts to achieve their \u00a7 1983 goal.

Defendants argue that the district court should have clarified its judgment. The judgment states \u201cjudgment shall enter for [each] plaintiff ... against each of the individually-named defendants in the following amounts .... \u201d The parties agreed at oral argument, as the district court\u2019s instructions make clear, that the judgment was intended to hold the defendants \u201cjointly and severally,\u201d not individually, liable. Although we doubt that the judgment could be read in any other way, because its language has possibly led to some difficulty with a bonding company, we shall amend it. <em>Byrd v.
