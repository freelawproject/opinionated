Quaring sought a Nebraska driver\u2019s license but refused to have her photograph taken and affixed to the license as required-by Nebraska law. For this reason, Nebraska Department of Motor Vehicles officials Peterson and Edwards (Nebraska officials) refused Quaring\u2019s application for a driver\u2019s license. Quaring then brought suit against the Nebraska officials seeking to obtain a court order requiring them to issue her a valid driver\u2019s license. She contended that her religious convictions prevented her from being photographed and that the refusal by the Nebraska officials to issue her a driver\u2019s license violated her first amendment right to the free exercise of her religion. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> agreed with Quaring\u2019s contention and enjoined the Nebraska officials from refusing to issue her a driver\u2019s license notwithstanding her refusal to be photographed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-16\">The Nebraska officials bring this appeal, arguing that 1) the statute requiring driver\u2019s licenses to contain a photograph of the licensee does not burden Quaring\u2019s exercise of her religion, 2) that even if the photograph requirement burdens her religion, the state\u2019s interests outweigh that burden, 3) that no less restrictive alternative would adequately serve the state\u2019s interests, and 4) that excepting Quaring from the photograph requirement on the basis of her religion would violate the establishment clause. We reject these arguments and affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-17\">I. <em>Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-18\">Under Nebraska law, driver\u2019s licenses issued after January 1, 1978 must, with several exceptions,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> contain a color photograph of the licensee. <em>See </em>Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 60-406.04 (Reissue 1978). Quaring meets the requirements for obtaining a driver\u2019s license except that she refuses to allow her photograph to appear on her license. For this reason, she has been unable to obtain a driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>Quaring\u2019s refusal to have her photograph taken is based on religious convictions. She believes in a literal interpretation of the Second Commandment, which states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-5\">Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1219-6\">Exodus 20:4; Deuteronomy 5:8. Quaring believes that the Commandment is violated by creating a likeness of God\u2019s creation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-7\">Quaring\u2019s belief extends beyond her refusal to allow her photograph to appear on her driver\u2019s license. She believes the Second Commandment forbids her from possessing any image having a likeness of anything in creation. She possesses no photographs of her wedding or family, does not own a television set, and refuses to allow decorations in her home that depict flowers, animals, or other creations in nature. When she purchases foodstuffs displaying pictures on their labels, she either removes the label or obliterates the picture with a black marking pen.</p>\n<p id=\"Afb\">Although Quaring is not a member of an organized church, she considers herself a Christian and attends a Pentecostal church in a nearby town with her family. She also participates in nondenominational Bible study groups. According to Quaring, Pentecostals do not share her belief that the Second Commandment forbids the making of photographs or images. Rather, her belief stems principally from her own study of the Bible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-9\">After unsuccessfully attempting to obtain an exemption from the photograph requirement, Quaring brought suit against the director and deputy director of the Nebraska Department of Motor Vehicles under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, alleging a deprivation of her right to the free exercise of religion. The district court ruled that the state\u2019s photograph requirement, as applied, violates Quaring\u2019s right to the free exercise of religion, and ordered Nebraska officials to issue her a driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-10\">II. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-11\">Quaring\u2019s exercise of her religious beliefs directly conflicts with Nebraska\u2019s requirement that driver\u2019s licenses contain a photograph of the licensee. Although the photograph requirement plainly serves a legitimate and important state interest, it may not be applied in a manner that unduly burdens Quaring\u2019s free exercise of her religion. <em>See Thomas v. Review </em>Board, 450 U.S. 707, 717, 101 S.Ct. 1425, 1431, 67 L.Ed.2d 624 (1981). Before the state may refuse to issue Quaring a driver\u2019s license, \u201c[I]t must appear either that the State does not deny the free exercise of religious belief by its requirement, or that there is a state interest of sufficient magnitude to override the interest claiming protection under the Free Exercise Clause.\u201d <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 214, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 1532, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-12\">A. <em>Quaring\u2019s Religious Beliefs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-13\">As a threshold requirement, Quaring must demonstrate that her refusal to be photographed is grounded upon a sincerely held religious belief. <em>See Stevens v. Berger, </em>428 F.Supp. 896, 899 (E.D.N.Y.1977). Although a religious belief requires something more than a purely secular philosophical or personal belief, <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder, supra, </em>406 U.S. at 215-16, 92 S.Ct. at 1533-34, courts have approved an expansive definition of religion. <em>See United States v. Seeger, </em>380 U.S. 163, 165-66, 85 S.Ct. 850, 853-54,13 L.Ed.2d 733 (1965) (test is whether \u201ca given belief that is sincere and meaningful occupies a place in the life of its possessor parallel to that filled by the orthodox belief in God\u201d); <em>see also International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Barber, </em>650 F.2d 430, 440 (2d Cir. 1981); <em>Founding Church of Scientology </em>v. <em>United States, </em>409 F.2d 1146 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 963, 90 S.Ct. 434, 24 L.Ed.2d 427 (1969). <em>See generally </em>Freeman, <em>The Misguided Search for the Constitutional Definition of \u201cReligion\u201d, </em>71 Geo.L.J. 1519 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-14\">Quaring\u2019s beliefs, though unusual in the twentieth century, are religious in nature. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>The Second Commandment, the basis for her beliefs, expressly forbids the making of \u201cany graven image or likeness\u201d of anything in creation. Exodus 20:4; Deuteronomy 5:8. Quaring\u2019s refusal to allow herself to be photographed is simply her response to a literal interpretation of the Second Commandment, not unlike the response of the Old Order Amish to the Epistle of Paul to the Romans. In <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder, supra, </em>the Supreme Court noted that the daily life and religious practices of the Amish were a response to a literal interpretation of Paul\u2019s exhortation to \u201cbe not conformed to this world,\u201d and held that their refusal to send their children to school beyond the eighth grade was religious in nature. 406 U.S. at 216, 92 S.Ct. at 1533. <em>Cf. Stevens v. Berger, supra, </em>428 F.Supp. at 902. Moreover, Quaring\u2019s literal interpretation of the Second Commandment receives some support from historical and biblical tradition. At trial, Dr. John Turner, a professor of religious studies, testified that Quaring\u2019s beliefs can be analogized to the Hebrew concept that images of things in creation are an attempt to capture God and His creations, and that such an attempt is forbidden.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1220-8\">Although members of the Pentecostal group with whom Quaring associates do not share her belief in a literal interpretation of the Second Commandment, that does not lessen the religious nature of her convictions. As the Supreme Court recently stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-9\">[T]he guarantee of free exercise is not limited to beliefs which are shared by all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>of the members of a religious sect. Particularly in this sensitive area, it is not within the judicial function and judicial competence to inquire whether the petitioner or his fellow [adherent] more correctly perceived the commands of their common faith. Courts are not arbiters of scriptural interpretation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\"><em>Thomas v. Review Board, supra, </em>450 U.S. at 715-16, 101 S.Ct. at 1430-31. Although Quaring\u2019s beliefs might seem unreasonably doctrinaire to many, that \u201cdoes not mean that they can be made suspect before the law.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ballard, </em>322 U.S. 78, 87, 64 S.Ct. 882, 886, 88 L.Ed. 1148 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">It is also clear that Quaring sincerely holds her religious beliefs. As the district court observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1221-7\">At trial [Quaring] appeared ready to support her interpretation of the Bible, based on her knowledge of several portions of the Old Testament. In addition, [her] behavior in every way conforms to the prohibition as she understands it: her home contains no photographs, television, paintings, or floral-designed furnishings, and, as she testified, she goes so far as to remove or obliterate pictures on food containers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1221-8\">Because Quaring\u2019s beliefs are based on a passage from scripture, receive some support from historical and biblical tradition, and play a central role in her daily life, they must be characterized as sincerely held religious beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-9\">B. <em>The Burden on Quaring\u2019s Religion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1221-10\">Having examined the religious nature and sincerity of Quaring\u2019s beliefs, we next turn to the question whether Nebraska\u2019s photograph requirement infringes upon those beliefs. Although the Nebraska officials correctly point out that the photograph requirement in no way compels Quar-ing to act in violation of her conscience, the Supreme Court has noted that \u201cthis is only the beginning, not the end, of our inquiry.\u201d <em>See Sherbert </em>v. <em>Verner, </em>374 U.S. 398, 403-04, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 1793-94, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963). Under the proper analysis, a burden upon religion exists when \u201cthe state conditions receipt of an important benefit upon conduct proscribed by a religious faith, * * thereby putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Review Board, supra, </em>450 U.S. at 717-18, 101 S.Ct. at 1431-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-12\">Clearly, a burden upon Quaring\u2019s free exercise of her religion exists in this case. The state refuses to issue Quaring a driver\u2019s license unless she agrees to allow her photograph to appear on the license, a condition that would violate a fundamental precept of her religion. Moreover, in refusing to issue Quaring a driver\u2019s license, the state withholds from her an important benefit. Quaring needs to drive a car for numerous daily activities, which include managing a herd of dairy and beef cattle, helping her husband manage a thousand-acre farming and livestock operation, and working as a bookkeeper in a community ten miles from home. By requiring Quaring to comply with the photograph requirement, the state places an unmistakable burden upon her exercise of her religious beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-13\">The burden on Quaring is indistinguishable from the burden placed upon a Sabbata-rian by the state in <em>Sherbert v. Verner, supra. </em>In that case, the Supreme Court held that in denying unemployment benefits to a member of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church who refused to work on Saturdays, the Sabbath of her faith, the state violated her right to the free exercise of religion. 374 U.S. at 402, 83 S.Ct. at 1792. Assessing the burden of the denial of benefits on the Sabbatarian\u2019s exercise of her religion, the Court commented,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1221-14\">The [denial] forces her to choose between following the precepts of her religion and forfeiting benefits, on the one hand, and abandoning one of the precepts of her religion [not working on Saturdays] in order to accept work, on the other hand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1221-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 404, 83 S.Ct. at 1794. Similarly, Nebraska\u2019s photograph requirement puts Quaring to the choice of following an important precept of her religion or forgoing the important privilege of driving a car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>C. <em>Balancing the State\u2019s Interest Against the Burden on Religion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\">Although Nebraska\u2019s photograph requirement burdens Quaring\u2019s exercise of her religious beliefs, that does not in itself entitle her to an exemption. Not all burdens upon religion violate the free exercise clause. <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>455 U.S. 252, 257-58, 102 S.Ct. 1051, 1055, 71 L.Ed.2d 127 (1982). The state may justify a limitation on religious liberty by showing that it is the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling state interest. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Review Board, supra, </em>450 U.S. at 718,101 S.Ct. at 1432. In articulating the standard the state must meet, the Supreme Court has said that \u201conly those interests of the highest order and those not otherwise served can overbalance legitimate claims to the free exercise of religion.\u201d <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder, supra, </em>406 U.S. at 215, 92 S.Ct. at 1533.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-5\">The Nebraska officials argue that Quaring\u2019s interest in exercising her religion must be subordinated to the state\u2019s more compelling interest in requiring that driver\u2019s licenses contain a photograph of the licensee. In weighing the competing interests, we examine not only the substantial state interests that the photograph requirement generally serves, but also whether an exemption to the requirement would impair the state\u2019s ability to achieve its objective. <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder, supra, </em>406 U.S. at 221, 92 S.Ct. at 1536; <em>see also United States v. Lee, supra, </em>455 U.S. at 259, 102 S.Ct. at 1056 (court must inquire whether accommodating exercise of religion will unduly interfere with fulfillment of government interest); L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law \u00a7 14-10, at 855 (1978) (crucial issue in free exercise cases is state\u2019s interest in denying exemption, not in maintaining underlying rule or program). To prevail, the Nebraska officials must demonstrate that their refusal to exempt Quaring from the photograph requirement serves a compelling state interest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-8\">In justifying their refusal to grant Quar-ing an exemption to the photograph requirement, the Nebraska officials advance several state interests. First, they point out that by ensuring that only persons with valid driver\u2019s licenses operate motor vehicles, the state promotes a compelling interest in public safety. <em>Cf. Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 659, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 1399, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979). They contend that only driver\u2019s licenses containing a photograph of the licensee can provide police officials with an accurate and instantaneous means of identifying a motorist. For this reason, at least 47 states require photographs of the licensee to appear on driver\u2019s licenses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Nebraska officials contend that an exemption to the photograph requirement would undermine the state\u2019s interest in ensuring that only licensed motorists drive on its roads.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-9\">Although quick and accurate identification of motorists surely constitutes an important state interest, we disagree with the Nebraska officials\u2019 contention that the state\u2019s interest is so compelling as to prohibit selective exemptions to the photograph requirement. Indeed, Nebraska law already exempts numerous motorists from having a personal photograph on their license. At trial, the associate director of the Department of Motor Vehicles testified that photographs of the licensee are not required on learner\u2019s permits, school permits issued to farmers\u2019 children, farm machinery permits, special permits for those with restricted or minimal driving ability, or temporary licenses for individuals outside the state whose old licenses have expired. In addition, motorists licensed in the few states that do not require photograph li<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>censes presumably drive through Nebraska on occasion, and those persons would be unable to present driver\u2019s licenses containing their photographs. Because the state already allows numerous exemptions to the photograph requirement, the Nebraska officials\u2019 argument that denying Quaring an exemption serves a compelling state interest is without substantial merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-4\">The Nebraska officials also argue that the state\u2019s compelling interest in ensuring the security of financial transactions justifies their refusal to exempt Quaring from the photograph requirement. Again, we disagree. Although a photograph license obviously serves an important state interest in facilitating the identification of persons writing checks or using credit cards, granting Quaring an exemption will not undermine that interest. Many people already engage in financial transactions without the benefit of a photograph license for identification: some are exempt from the photograph requirement, and some do not have any license because they do not drive. Issuing Quaring a license without her photograph places her in the same position as these people. In any event, the state may still achieve its interest in ensuring the security of financial transactions because people may freely refuse to do business with Quaring if she is unable to present adequate identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">Finally, the Nebraska officials argue that the administrative burden of considering applications for exemptions from the photograph requirement also constitutes a compelling state interest. They point out that establishing uniform criteria for granting exemptions will be difficult because 95 testing centers in Nebraska issue driver\u2019s licenses. They also argue that the religious nature of the claimed exemption will exacerbate this problem. The state would have to probe into the sincerity and religious nature of an applicant\u2019s belief, and applicants could easily show religious grounds as the basis for their objection to the photograph requirement. The Nebraska officials fear that unless the state establishes an elaborate and expensive mechanism to consider requests for religious exemptions, exemptions to the photograph requirement will be available virtually on demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-7\">Although Nebraska plainly has an interest in avoiding the administratively cumbersome task of considering applications for religious exemptions, its interest is not compelling. A state\u2019s interest in avoiding an administrative burden becomes compelling only when it presents administrative problems of such magnitude as to render the entire statutory scheme unworkable. <em>See Sherbert v. Verner, supra, </em>374 U.S. at 408-09, 83 S.Ct. at 1796-97. The record contains no evidence, however, that allowing religious exemptions to the photograph requirement will jeopardize the state\u2019s interest in administrative efficiency. Persons seeking an exemption from the photograph requirement on religious grounds are likely to be few in number. Indeed, few persons will be able to demonstrate the sincerity of their religious beliefs by showing that they possess no photographs or pictures. Furthermore, the few persons who make legitimate requests for exemptions from the photograph requirement will cause the Nebraska officials little inconvenience. Because persons requesting an exemption for religious beliefs based on the Second Commandment can easily demonstrate the sincerity and valid nature of their belief as Quaring offered to do, the state need not be greatly burdened by requests for an exemption. At least on this record, the Nebraska officials have not demonstrated that giving an exemption for photographs to Quaring and others holding similar beliefs will cause any undue administrative burden. Thus, none of the interests the Nebraska officials advance are sufficient to justify the burden upon Quaring\u2019s religious liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-8\">D. <em>Establishment of Religion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1223-9\">The Nebraska officials argue that providing an exemption for Quaring on the basis of her religion creates an impermissible establishment of religion. We disagree. In some cases, the free exercise clause requires a state to make a reasonable accommodation of religion. <em>See O\u2019Hair v. Andrus, </em>613 F.2d 931, 935 (D.C.Cir.1979). Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>accommodation does not constitute an establishment of religion. <em>See Thomas v. Review Board, supra, </em>450 U.S. at 719-20, 101 S.Ct. at 1432\u201433; <em>Sherbert v. Verner, supra, </em>374 U.S. at 409, 83 S.Ct. at 1796.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">III. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the district court\u2019s issuance of an injunction requiring the Nebraska officials to issue Quaring a driver\u2019s license without requiring her to be photographed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1218-13\">. The Honorable Warren K. Urbom, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1218-14\">. The statute does not require photographs of the licensee on learner\u2019s permits, school permits, farm machinery permits, special permits for those, with restricted or minimal driving ability, and temporary licenses for Nebraska residents who are outside Nebraska when their licenses expire. Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 60-406.04 (Reissue 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1220-4\">. In cases involving the religion clauses, courts sometimes cite authoritative works recognizing certain religious beliefs as supplemental evidence of the religious nature of a litigant\u2019s beliefs. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Seeger, </em>380 U.S. 163, 85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733 (1964); <em>Stevens v. Berger, supra. </em>Although the Nebraska officials do not seriously contest the sincerity and religious nature of Quaring\u2019s beliefs, we have briefly surveyed the literature discussing the Second Commandment\u2019s prohibition against the making of likenesses of God\u2019s creation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">The Commandments, including the Second Commandment, remain fundamental tenets of the Jewish (and the Christian) faith, as they were of the ancient Jewish faith, and within Judaism have been the subject of extensive interpretation and commentary. Some of that interpretation and commentary of the Second Commandment lends support to Quaring\u2019s personal interpretation. For example, included in early Hebrew religious beliefs were views prohibiting the reproduction of images:</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-6\">The Bible (Ex. 20:4) forbade the \u201cgraven image\u201d in the most explicit fashion, more categorically and comprehensively than the mere likeness. Hence, while the representation of human or animal figures on a plane surface was condoned or permitted most of the time during the periods in question, greater difficulties were constantly raised with regard to three-dimensional sculptures in the round. <em>Indeed, in some Orthodox circles, even making an impression with a seal bearing the human or animal form was considered religiously objectionable, since by doing so a man actually \u201cmade\u201d a graven image, even though not for worship or veneration. </em>14 Ency. Judaica 1059 (1971). (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-10\">Even modern-day interpretation of Jewish law lends some support to views similar to Quaring\u2019s. Writing in a Hebrew-language publication, Rabbi Menashe Klein, Dean of Yeshiva Beth Shearim, Brooklyn, New York (a school for advanced Hebrew studies), argues that a person has a right to prevent others from taking his picture against his will. 7 RESPONSA MISHNE HALACHOTH \u00a7 114 (1977). Rabbi Klein observes that while the dominant position in Jewish law, as well as custom and practice, permits the photographing of human beings, an authoritative, albeit minority, position prohibits photographs of humans, especially of the face. To support his position, Rabbi Klein cites the work of the noted Polish authority Rabbi Malkiel Zevi Halevi Tennenbaum, who in 3 RESPONSA DIVREI MALKI\u2019EL \u00a7 58 (1897), opines that the taking of pictures violates the Second Commandment. Rabbi Klein also cites the work of the German scholar Rabbi Jacob Emden (1697-1776) in 1 RESPONSA SHE\u2019ELAT YAVEZ \u00a7 170, who reports that his father, Rabbi Zevi Hirsch Ashkenazi, Chief Rabbi of Hamburg and later of Amsterdam, opposed any portraits of himself. Rabbi Klein concludes, therefore, in his 1977 Responsum that one who, out of sincerity and piety, wishes to conduct himself in accordance with this stringent view of the Second Commandment may do so. Accordingly, others must respect that person\u2019s freedom of religious expression and refrain from taking his photograph against his wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-11\">(The court expresses its appreciation to Professor Dov I. Frimer, Director, Institute of Jewish Law, Touro College School of Law, Huntington, New York, who supplied the court with the text and a translation of Rabbi Klein\u2019s Re-sponsum.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1222-6\">. Three courts have considered claims by licensees who objected on religious grounds to similar photograph requirements. Two courts ruled that the state\u2019s refusal to exempt the objecting licensees served a compelling state interest, see <em>Dennis v. Charnes, </em>571 F.Supp. 462 (D.Colo.1983); <em>Johnson v. Motor Vehicle Div., </em>197 Colo. 455, 593 P.2d 1363 (1979), and one court ruled that such a refusal does not serve a compelling state interest. <em>See Bureau of Motor Vehicles v.

The interest advanced by the state statute is, in my opinion, of sufficient magnitude to justify an indirect burden on Quaring\u2019s free exercise of religion. The majority, while recognizing that a photographic license requirement \u201cplainly serves a legitimate and important state interest,\u201d concludes that granting Quaring special dispensation from the requirement will not unduly hinder the state\u2019s accomplishment of its legitimate objective. I cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-8\">Nebraska\u2019s photographic license requirement advances the state\u2019s interest in public safety on the streets and highways by providing police officers in the field with an accurate and instantaneous means of identifying motorists. Significantly, a police officer arriving at the scene of an accident or stopping a vehicle in connection with a traffic violation or suspected criminal activity is assured that the individual displaying the license is in fact the individual to whom the license was issued. As noted in the majority opinion, the fact that 47 of the 50 states require a photographic driver\u2019s license indicates the unique advantage derived from this instantaneous identifier.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-9\">The majority does not attempt to advance any less restrictive means of accomplishing the state\u2019s compelling interest in \u201cquick and accurate identification of motorists.\u201d Rather, the majority states that in weighing the competing interests involved, it is necessary to consider whether granting \u201cselective exemptions\u201d to the state\u2019s requirement would impair the state\u2019s ability to achieve its objective. This approach simply ignores or casts aside the state\u2019s legitimate interest in assuring instantaneous identification for all of its regular license holders. I am convinced that accommodation of Quaring\u2019s religious practice by issuance of a driver\u2019s license lacking a photographic identifier would \u201cunduly interfere with fulfillment of the governmental interest.\u201d <em>United States v. Lee, </em>455 U.S. 252, 259, 102 S.Ct. 1051, 1056, 71 L.Ed.2d 127 (1982). \u201cThe ready certainty inherent in photographic identification would be lost.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Motor Vehicle Division, </em>197 Colo. 455, 593 P.2d 1363, 1365 (1979). To downplay the impact of granting selective exemptions to regular license holders, the majority attaches significance to the fact that Nebraska exempts certain categories of permittees and temporary licensees from the photograph requirement; however, the limitations placed upon these provisional operators deny any meaningful comparison with the state\u2019s regular license holders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-11\">I have no quarrel with the majority\u2019s observation that. Quaring may experience daily inconvenience because she cannot drive a motor vehicle. Her difficulties, however, are not insurmountable and she is not the only person that has been faced with the need to make life-style adjustments precipitated by nonconformity with driver\u2019s license requirements. Not insignificantly, and as the majority notes, Quar-ing\u2019s religious beliefs are \u201cunusual in the twentieth century\u201d and \u201cthe photographic requirement in no way compels Quaring to act in violation of her conscience.\u201d I cannot say that the state\u2019s legitimate requirement of a photographic identifier has placed impermissible pressure on Quaring to modify her behavior and violate her beliefs to the end of obtaining driving privileges upon the roadways of Nebraska.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-12\">\u201c[W]e are a cosmopolitan nation made up of people of almost every conceivable religious preference. * * * Consequently, it cannot be expected, much less required, that legislators enact no law regulating conduct that may in some way result in * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>disadvantage to some religious sects * * *.\u201d <em>Braunfeld v. Brown, </em>366 U.S. 599, 606, 81 S.Ct. 1144, 1147, 6 L.Ed.2d 563 (1961). In my view the state\u2019s compelling interest in having a photographic verification of identity upon its driver\u2019s licenses outweighs the incidental burden on Quaring\u2019s free exercise of religion. This is an instance where a religious belief must yield to the common good. I would reverse.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
