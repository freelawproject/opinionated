No. 97 (1982). This subsection reserves to the agency the authority, \u201cwith respect to filling positions, to make selections for appointment from \u2014 (i) among properly ranked and certified candidates for promotion or (ii) any other source.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1528\">*1528</page-number>The agency\u2019s authority to fill positions under \u00a7 7106(a)(2)(C) is not without limit. Section 7106(b) states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1624-4\">Nothing in this section shall preclude any agency and any labor organization from negotiating\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1624-5\">(2) procedures which management officials of the agency will observe in exercising any authority under this section; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1624-6\">(3) appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of any authority under this section by such management officials.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1624-7\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106(b)(2), (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-8\">In <em>American Federation of Government Employees Local 2782 v. FLRA, </em>702 F.2d 1183 (D.C.Cir.1983), this circuit examined the extent to which \u00a7 7106(b)(2) and (3) permit negotiation of proposals involving the filling of positions of employment otherwise reserved to management discretion by \u00a7 7106(a)(2)(C), The court found that \u00a7 7106(b)(2) permits negotiation of \u201cprocedures\u201d for implementing the substantive rights of management guaranteed by \u00a7 7106(a). In this way \u00a7 7106(b)(2) clarifies rather than limits the scope of management rights under \u00a7 7106(a). 702 F.2d at 1186. Accordingly, the court noted, this circuit has approved the Authority\u2019s \u201cdirect interference test\u201d to determine if a proposal may be characterized as \u201cprocedural\u201d and therefore negotiable. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[A] proposal ... [is] nonnegotiable if its implementation would \u2018directly interfere with the agency\u2019s basic right\u2019 \u201d as reserved under section 7106(a). <em>Dept. of Defense v. FLRA, </em>659 F.2d 1140, 1159 (D.C.Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied sub nom. AFGE v. FLRA, </em>455 U.S. 945, 102 S.Ct. 1443, 71 L.Ed.2d 658 (1982) (quoting <em>AFGE v. Air Force Logistics Command, </em>2 F.L.R.A. 604, 613 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-9\">The <em>American Federation </em>court contrasted the clarifying function of \u00a7 7106(b)(2) with the limiting function of \u00a7 7106(b)(3).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aoy-dedup-0\">There is no way to regard \u201cappropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected\u201d as a <em>clarification </em>of the scope of management prerogatives. \u201cAppropriate arrangements\u201d (unlike \u201cprocedures\u201d) is a meaningless clarification \u2014 and one that would not have to be limited to \u201cemployees adversely affected\u201d as opposed to <em>all </em>employees. The conclusion is unavoidable that what was intended was an <em>exception </em>to the otherwise governing management prerogative requirements of subsection (a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1624-11\">702 F.2d at 1187 (emphasis in original). The court found the Act\u2019s legislative history further supports a reading of \u00a7 7106(b)(3) as permitting the negotiation of some constraints on \u00a7 7106(a) management prerogatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-12\">With this understanding of the interplay of \u00a7\u00a7 7106(a)(2)(C), (b)(2) and (b)(3), we turn to the proposals at issue in this case. Proposal II provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1624-13\">Except where management is required by law, regulation, or this contract to select a particular person, selections for vacancies will be made by officials choosing from a certificate of best-qualified applicants for the position. The parties may, from time to time, agree to deviations from this requirement in individual cases or categories of cases, when they deem it advisable for affirmative action or other legitimate purposes. The parties note that they are in disagreement over the agency\u2019s claim that 5 U.S.C. 7106(a) gives it the legal right or duty to unilaterally disregard the competitive selection requirement under certain circumstances. The merits of the management claim in any particular case will be considered by the parties in their efforts to resolve any resulting grievance, and the parties note the obligation of arbitrators to interpret contract provisions in light of governing law. The parties note further that an arbitration award ordering remedies contrary to governing law may be overturned on appeal to the Federal Labor Relations Authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1624-14\">The Authority interpreted Proposal II as requiring OPM to make \u201cselections for appointments from among properly ranked and certified candidates for promotion under section 7106(a)(2)(C)(i) . .. and as a corollary . .. not [to] make selections for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1529\">*1529</page-number>appointments from any other appropriate source under section 7106(a)(2)(C)(ii).\u201d The Authority therefore concluded Proposal II interfered with agency discretion reserved by subsection (a)(2)(C)(ii), and was nonnegotiable. On review, the Authority simply argues that Proposal II requires that management fill positions from a limited list of best qualified candidates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-4\">The question for us is whether the Authority\u2019s application of the Act is \u201carbitrary, capricious, abusive of discretion [or] contrary to law.\u201d <em>National Treasury Employees Union </em>v. <em>FLRA, </em>691 F.2d 553, 564 (D.C.Cir.1982). We cannot say the Authority\u2019s finding concerning Proposal II is any of those.</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-5\">Local 32 disputes the Authority\u2019s interpretation of Proposal II. The union explains that its proposal for a certificate of best qualified applicants was meant to insure that the merits of candidates from all sources be considered in the formulation of a certified list; the proposal was not intended to require that management select only from promotion eligibles. It suggests that management could make its best qualified certificate large enough to include every qualified applicant, and conceivably could choose the comparatively least qualified one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-6\">Although the language of the Proposal could conceivably be stretched to that extent, it is contrary to the ordinary meaning of the terms \u201cbest qualified.\u201d The Federal Personnel Manual explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1625-7\"><em>Best qualified candidates </em>are measured against other candidates. They are qualified candidates who rank at the top when compared with other eligible candidates for a position. A reasonable number of the best qualified candidates are referred for selection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1625-8\">Federal Personnel Manual 335-3 (1981). Judged by ordinary meaning, Proposal II appears to entail the filling of positions from among some number of applicants comparatively rated as having superior qualifications. It would follow that Proposal II would limit management\u2019s authority to select an applicant who was qualified but not on the certificate of best qualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-12\">Under the circumstances, we are unable to find the Authority acted unreasonably in interpreting Proposal II as restricting OPM\u2019s right under \u00a7 7106(a)(2)(C) to select from among properly ranked and certified candidates for promotion or any other appropriate source.</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-13\">Local 32 asks, in the event we accept the Authority\u2019s interpretation of Proposal II, that we remand for consideration whether Proposal II is \u201cprocedural\u201d in nature, making it negotiable under \u00a7 7106(b)(2). We decline. In effect, the Authority has already rejected the proposition that Proposal II is procedural. The Authority has held, and this Circuit has approved, that a proposal which directly interferes with a substantive right reserved by \u00a7 7106(a) to management discretion is by definition not \u201cprocedural\u201d under \u00a7 7106(b)(2). <em>See American Federation, </em>702 F.2d at 1186; <em>Dept. of Defense, </em>659 F.2d at 1159. The Authority has already determined that Proposal II, as interpreted, interferes with management rights under \u00a7 7106(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-14\">Proposal VI reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1625-15\">Notwithstanding any other provision of this contract, a repromotion eligible (i.e., an employee demoted through no fault of his or her own) will be selected for the first vacancy at his or her former grade level which management would otherwise fill competitively, for which the employee is qualified and for which he or she applies, unless there are persuasive reasons for passing the employee over. An employee will retain this eligibility until re-promoted to his or her former grade.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvE\">Proposal VI is nearly identical to the repro-motion eligible proposal considered in <em>American </em>Federation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In that case, this circuit acknowledged that a provision re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1530\">*1530</page-number>quiring the hiring of a repromotion eligible might restrict an agency\u2019s \u00a7 7106(a)(2)(C) right to hire from any source. But the court rejected the Authority\u2019s position, also advanced here, that a provision limiting a \u00a7 7106(a) right is never negotiable. The court concluded that repromotion proposals may be negotiable under \u00a7 7106(b)(3) as \u201cappropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of .. . [management] authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-4\">The <em>American Federation </em>court decided that the word \u201cappropriate\u201d in the phrase \u201cappropriate arrangements\u201d can bear some, if little, weight. \u201cUndoubtedly, some arrangements may be inappropriate because they infringe upon management prerogatives- <em>to an excessive degree.\u201d </em>702 F.2d at 1188. In remanding, this court left the Authority free to determine whether the Proposal was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-6\">We find a remand unnecessary here. Proposal VI can be distinguished from the <em>American Federation </em>proposal because the arrangement for which the union wishes to negotiate would permit passing over the demoted employee if \u201cthere are persuasive reasons\u201d for doing so. With that safety valve present, it would be very difficult to make a claim that the arrangement, if negotiated, would infringe upon management prerogatives to an excessive degree.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1626-7\">The Authority\u2019s decision with respect to Proposal II is AFFIRMED, and with respect to Proposal VI is REVERSED and REMANDED for the entry of an order requiring bargaining.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1623-22\">. The union proposals under review by this court were two of six considered by the Authority. We retain the original numbering of. the proposals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1623-23\">. OPM was permitted to intervene in this case but did not file a separate brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1625-9\">. The <em>American Federation </em>court considered the following proposal:</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-10\">Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, a repromotion eligible (i.e., an employee demoted through no fault of his or her own) will be selected for the first available vacancy for which he or she fully meets the qualification standards and which the agency determines to fill.</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-16\"><em>See </em>7 F.L.R.A. 91 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1626-5\">. The Authority has already approved a provision that only permitted the agency to pass over a repromotion eligible for \u201cgood cause,\u201d where the phrase \u201cgood cause\u201d encompasses \u201crights reserved to management under the statute.\u201d See <em>American Federation of Government Employees Local 2782 v. Bureau of Census, </em>6 F.L.R.A. 314 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
