We affirm the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-14\">On May 10, 1982, pursuant to 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1100.251-.253 (1981), Stewco, Inc., a Texas Corporation, filed an application with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) for an extension of motor carrier operating authority. The application was considered under the modified procedure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Stewco requested authority to transport liquid commodities, in bulk, between two Arkansas counties, on the one hand, and all points in the continental United States on the other hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-15\">The application was accompanied by a verified statement from Stewco\u2019s president. The statement included: an acknowledgment of Steweo\u2019s existent interstate authority for other commodities; a description of Stewco\u2019s facilities in Arkansas; a description of the services the company intended to offer the supporting shipper; a detailed list of Stewco\u2019s available equipment; and an assertion that the grant of authority would permit Stewco to eliminate deadhead mileage and its accompanying waste of fuel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-16\">Stewco\u2019s application was supported by one shipper, Riceland Foods, Inc., (Rice-land). Riceland stated that it had been receiving intrastate service from Stewco, and that a grant of interstate authority would enable Stewco to provide more efficient service. Riceland anticipated tendering approximately ten shipments per week to Stewco. Riceland maintains facilities in the two Arkansas counties from which Stewco requested authority to transport. For representative destinations, Riceland simply named fifteen states surrounding Arkansas.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Riceland also documented, nu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>merous service problems it had experienced with motor carriers, none of which involved the petitioner in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-4\">Written protest to Stewco\u2019s application was filed by four trucking companies, only one of whom, Erickson Transport Corporation, appealed to this court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Prior to Stewco\u2019s application, Erickson had been providing interstate service to Riceland since 1980. Erickson had invested a significant amount of money in order to provide service to Riceland and, in turn, Erickson drew a significant amount of its revenue from this service. In the protest statement submitted to the ICC, Erickson acknowledged that it handled approximately 95% of Riceland\u2019s interstate shipping business. Riceland had previously supported Erickson\u2019s petition to the ICC for interstate authority. Erickson\u2019s business with Riceland had enabled Erickson to reduce its deadhead mileage and expenses. Before the review board, and on appeal to this court, Erickson asserted that granting Stewco\u2019s application would divert traffic from Erickson which, in turn, would result ultimately in a loss of revenue, wasted fuel, unemployment, rate increases and a disruption in the flow of commercial traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-5\">On September 17, 1982, an ICC review board approved a partial grant of the application, extending Stewco\u2019s authority to the fifteen states named by Riceland in its statement of support, rather than to all points in the continental United States as Stewco had requested. In its decision, the review board found that Stewco had proved there was a need for its service by submitting Riceland\u2019s supporting statement. The board noted that, while the evidence was less specific than might be desired, it was sufficient to establish a need between the Arkansas counties and the states named in Riceland\u2019s statement. The board held Erickson had failed to establish that granting the authority to Stewco was inconsistent with the public convenience and necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-12\">Specifically, the board found: Stewco\u2019s service would serve a useful public purpose, responsive to a public demand or need; Stewco was fit, willing and able to perform the service and; granting the application would not affect either the quality of the human environment or the conservation of energy resources. Erickson entered an appeal from the review board\u2019s opinion. The appeal was denied and a final order granting Stewco interstate authority was rendered. Erickson petitions for judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. Because this is the first time this Circuit has reviewed the new guidelines for licensure under the 1980 Motor Carrier Act, we consider the petitioner\u2019s arguments in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-14\">Until 1980, entry into the trucking industry was governed by the Motor Carrier Act of 1935.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The guidelines for licensure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>motor carriers under the 1935 Act were, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-5\">(a) ... the Interstate Commerce Commission shall issue a certificate to a person authorizing that person to provide transportation ... as a motor common carrier or water common carrier, respectively, if the Commission finds that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-6\">(1) the person is fit, willing and able\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-7\">(A) to provide the transportation to be authorized by the certificate; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-8\">(B) to comply with this subtitle and regulations of the Commission; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-9\">(2) the transportation to be provided under the certificate is or will be required by the present or future public convenience and necessity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1157-10\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10922(a) (Supp. II 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-11\">The Motor Act of 1980 effected a radical change in the 1935 Act. By adding a new paragraph to the law, Congress changed the entire thrust of the public policy behind motor carrier regulation. The law now provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-12\">It is the policy of the United States government ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-13\">... (7) with respect to transportation of property by motor carrier, to promote <em>competitive </em>and efficient transportation services ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1157-14\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101(a)(7) (Supp. V 1981) (emphasis added). To this end, Congress also amended the guidelines for licensure. In addition to the requirements of the 1935 Act, noted above, the 1980 Act also provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-15\">(b) (1) ... the Interstate Commerce Commission shall issue a certificate to a person authorizing that person to provide transportation ... as a motor common carrier of property if the Commission finds\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-16\">(A) that the person is fit, willing and able to provide the transportation to be authorized by the certificate and to comply with this subtitle and regulations of the Commission; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-17\">(B) on the basis of evidence presented by persons supporting the issuance of the certificate, that the service proposed will serve a useful public purpose, responsive to a public demand or need; unless the Commission finds, on the basis of evidence presented by persons objecting to the issuance of a certificate, that the transportation to be authorized by the certificate is inconsistent with the public convenience and necessity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1157-19\">(2) In making a finding under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Commission shall consider and, to the extent applicable, make findings on at least the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-20\">(A) the transportation policy of section 10101(a) of this title; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-21\">(B) the effect of issuance of the certificate on existing carriers, except that the Commission shall not find diversion of revenue or traffic from an existing carrier to be in and of itself inconsistent with the public convenience and necessity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1157-22\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10922(a)-(b)(l) &amp; (2) (Supp. V 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-23\">If these amendments, by themselves, do not reflect clearly the Congressional intent behind the changes, the intent is made crystal clear in the Act\u2019s legislative history. Congress intended to remove the protective shield which served to shelter existing motor carriers from competition, and open up the industry to competition in order to better serve the public. <em>H.R.Rep. No. 1069, </em>96th Cong., 2d Sess. 3, 12, 14, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 <em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News </em>2283, 2285, 2294, 2295.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-24\">In the House Report, the Committee on Public Works and Transportation noted the policy behind licensure under the 1935 Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASk\">[t]he Motor Carrier Act of 1935 adopted a regulatory scheme of limited entry into the business of transportation by motor vehicle \u201con the premise that the public interest in maintaining a stable transportation industry so required.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1157-25\"><em>Id. </em>at 12, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 <em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, </em>2294, <em>quoting United States v. Drum, </em>368 U.S. 370, 373-74, 82 S.Ct. 408, 409-10, 7 L.Ed.2d 360 (1962). To this end, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>the ICC had defined the statutory standard of public convenience and necessity which an applicant for motor carriage would have had to meet, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF1\">whether the new operation or service will serve a useful public purpose, responsive to a public demand or need; whether this purpose can and will be served as well by existing lines or carriers; and whether it can be served by applicant with the new operation or service proposed without endangering or impairing the operations of existing carriers contrary to the public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1158-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 13, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 <em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News </em>2295, <em>quoting Pan-American Bus Lines Operations, </em>1 M.C.C. 190, 203 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-5\">The legislative history of the 1980 Act reveals that it was to stand in stark contrast to the 1935 Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aca\">the Committee clearly rejects the historic approach of the Commission toward applications for authority to operate as motor common carriers of property. [The amendment] reflects the Committee\u2019s strong belief that increased competition and potential competition will bring about the most efficient and economical delivery of transportation service to the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1158-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 14, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 <em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News </em>2296. Prior to the 1980 Act, granting interstate authority to a new carrier solely for purposes of competition was disallowed because competition was viewed as harmful to the public as well as to other motor carriers. <em>See Argo-Collier Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>611 F.2d 149, 155 (6th Cir.1979). Under the 1980 Act it appears that competition is, per se, in the public interest. <em>See House Report, </em>3, 12, 14, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 <em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News </em>2285, 2294, 2295.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-8\">Our review of an ICC order is governed by the Administrative Procedure Act. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A)-(E).

Co. </em>v. <em>Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n, </em>671 F.2d 1214, 1216-17 (8th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-13\">Under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test the Commission\u2019s findings will be affirmed when the evidence would be sufficient to justify a refusal to direct a verdict if the trial was to a jury. <em>Illinois Central R.R. Co. </em>v. <em>Norfolk &amp; Western R.R. Co., </em>385 U.S. 57, 66, 87 S.Ct. 255, 260, 17 L.Ed.2d 162 (1966). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>American Textile Mfrs., Inst. v. Donovan, </em>452 U.S. 490, 522, 101 S.Ct. 2478, 2497, 69 L.Ed.2d 185 (1980), <em>quoting Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 477, 71 S.

Under this test the record must be reviewed as a whole. <em>Illinois Central, </em>385 U.S. at 66, 87 S.Ct. at 260; <em>Illinois Terminal, </em>671 F.2d at 1216-17. In addition, \u201cthe test must take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight.\u201d <em>Universal Camera Corp. v.

Civil Aeronautics Bd., </em>657 F.2d 999, 1002 (8th Cir.1981). The possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not mean the agency\u2019s findings are unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>American Textile, </em>452 U.S. at 523, 101 S.Ct. at 2497. Finally, ICC orders are vested with a presumption of validity which is not disturbed easily on appeal. <em>Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n v. City of Jersey City, </em>322 U.S. 503, 512-13, 64 S.Ct. 1129, 1133-34, 88 L.Ed. 1420 (1944); <em>see Warren Transp., Inc. v. United States, </em>525 F.2d 148, 151 (8th Cir.1975) (\u201cIt is rare that a Commission order is not based on relevant factors or that the exercise of its expertise can be termed such an abuse of discretion as to require reversal....\u201d) With these standards in mind, we review the petitioner\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-7\">The procedure to be followed in federal agency determinations is governed by the Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As to the burden of proof, the proponent of a rule or order carries the initial burden. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 556(d) (1976). The Motor Carrier Act of 1980 did not change this assignment, thus applicants for authority have the initial burden of proof under the 1980 Act<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> just as they did under the 1935 Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, the 1980 Act did redistribute the weight of the burdens which applicants and protestants would bear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-10\">Congress adopted the 1980 Act in order to liberalize entry into the trucking industry. <em>House Report </em>at 14, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 <em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News </em>2296. The 1980 Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1159-11\">provides for a balanced approach to entry, which, by lessening the burden of proof on applicants and correspondingly increasing the burden on persons opposing the application, will encourage new applicants to file for authority to provide needed service.... Whereas, in the past, applicants have been expected to carry the greater evidentiary burden, <em>the Act now assigns to protestants a much larger share of the evidentiary burden.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"avk-dedup-0\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Initially, the applicant must prove it is \u201cfit, willing and able\u201d to provide the proposed service and that the service will serve a \u201cuseful public purpose, responsive to a public demand or need .. . . \u201d <em>C &amp; H Transp. Co., Inc. v. Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n, </em>704 F.2d 850, 853, 856 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Kenosha Auto Transp. Co. v. United States, </em>684 F.2d 1020, 1026 (D.C.Cir.1982); <em>Baggett Transp.

Print 1980), and should be satisfied when the applicant has the wherewithal! to perform the service. The \u201cpublic purpose\u201d test can be satisfied by any number of ways. This demonstration \u201ccould be made by public officials, shippers, receivers, trade associations, civil associations, consumers and employee groups, as well as by the applicant itself.\u201d <em>House Report </em>at 14 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number><em>reprinted in </em>1980 <em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News </em>2296. There is some, albeit slim, authority for the proposition that any one of these factors would satisfy the public purpose test. <em>Kenosha </em>684 F.2d at 1028; 126 <em>Cong.Rec. </em>16,042-43 (1980) (remarks of Sen. Packwood).</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">Once the applicant has satisfied both of these tests, i.e., made a prima facie case, the burden of proof shifts to the protestant to show that the issuance of the certificate is inconsistent with the public convenience and necessity. <em>Refrigerated Transp. Co., Inc. v. Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n, </em>709 F.2d 1430,1432 (11th Cir.1983); <em>Dean Truck Lines, Inc. v.

In other words, once the applicant has established a prima facie case, the statute creates a rebuttable presumption that granting the application is consistent with the public convenience and necessity. <em>C &amp; H Transp. Co., Inc. v. Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n, </em>704 F.2d 834 at 841 (5th Cir.1983); <em>House Report </em>at 15, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 <em>U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News </em>2297.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\">Under the statutory guidelines, the ICC is to consider and, to the extent applicable, make findings on the policy behind the Act and on the effects which issuance of a new certificate will have upon existing carriers. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10922(b)(2) (Supp. V 1981). However, diversion of revenue or traffic from an existing carrier is <em>not, </em>in and of itself, inconsistent with the public convenience and necessity. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10922(b)(2)(B) (Supp. V 1981). Protestants must show that issuance of a new certificate will result in specific harm to the public interest, i.e., harm which damages existing carriers to the extent that the public is deprived of essential services. <em>Deaton, Inc. v. Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n, </em>693 F.2d 128, 131 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-9\">Erickson contends, for several reasons, that Stewco failed to meet both the \u201cfitness\u201d and \u201cpublic purpose\u201d tests. First, Stewco did not meet the fitness test because it failed to offer any proof that it was financially able to provide the proposed service or that it would have the equipment necessary for interstate movement available. Neither of these contentions have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-10\">Under the rules published by the ICC pursuant to the 1980 Act, applicants are no longer required to submit specific evidence regarding financial fitness in order to obtain operating authority.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>American Transfer &amp; Storage Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n, </em>719 F.2d 1283, 1304, 1305 (5th Cir. 1983). In addition, the record shows that, at the time the application was submitted, Stewco was involved in the interstate movement of other commodities, Stewco was providing intrastate service to the supporting shipper and Stewco had established a satellite terminal to accommodate the supporting shipper\u2019s needs. Further, along with its application Stewco submitted a detailed list of its available equipment. Petitioner did not introduce any evidence to the contrary. Based on the record, the Commission\u2019s finding that Stewco was fit, willing and able to provide the proposed service was supported by substantial evidence and was neither arbitrary nor capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>Erickson also contends that Stewco failed to meet the \u201cpublic purpose\u201d test. First, Erickson asserts that it was meeting Rice-land\u2019s needs and thus Stewco\u2019s service was not needed by either the public or Riceland. Under the 1980 Act, this assertion no longer carries any weight. Under the 1935 Act, the ICC guidelines for licensing new motor carriers included the criterion of whether the proposed service was being served adequately by existing lines or carriers. <em>Pan-American Bus Lines Operations, </em>1 M.C.C. 190, 203 (1936). However, this particular requirement was abandoned even before the 1980 Act, <em>see Assure Competitive Transp., Inc. v. United States, </em>635 F.2d 1301, 1304 (7th Cir.1980), and the abandonment was reinforced with passage of the 1980 Act. <em>See House Report </em>at 14, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 <em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News </em>2296. <em>See also </em>126 <em>Cong.Rec. </em>16,042 (1980) (\u201cThe fact that another carrier is performing the service is no longer an obstacle to acquiring new authority.\u201d) (remarks of Sen. Cannon).</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\">Second, Erickson contends that the shipping public will suffer harm if Stewco\u2019s application is granted because Erickson will have to terminate service to some shippers and increase its rates in order to compensate for the traffic Stewco will divert. Erickson\u2019s argument fails to take account of significant points. Riceland, as a member of the shipping public, requested Stewco\u2019s service. In addition, Congress has determined that increased competition is in the public\u2019s best interests. <em>See House Report </em>at 3, 11, 12, 14, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 <em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News </em>2285, 2293, 2294, 2296. Before Stewco entered the picture, Erickson monopolized 95% of Riceland\u2019s interstate business. This type of monopoly is what the 1980 Act was intended to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-13\">Increased competition inevitably results in short term, and perhaps permanent, harm to existing carriers. However, the 1980 Act provides that this harm is an insufficient basis for denying an extension of operating authority. Whether we agree with the policy of increased competition is irrelevant. It is not within the province of this court to substitute its judgment for that of the Congress. Where, as here, a shipper\u2019s business is monopolized by one carrier the Congressional mandate is clear \u2014 the public will benefit from increased competition and the ICC is to review applications for licensure utilizing that rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-14\">Finally, Erickson contends that the ICC\u2019s order must be reversed because the Commission failed to make specific findings on each element of the National Transportation Policy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, neither the 1980 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>Act on its face nor the Act\u2019s legislative history requires the Commission to make individual findings on each element of the National Transportation Policy. To the contrary, the legislative history indicates that the Commission is to \u201cbalance\u201d these factors while recognizing \u201ccompetition and efficiency in motor carrier operations as the most desirable means for achieving national transportation goals and objectives.\u201d <em>House Report </em>at 14, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 <em>U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News </em>2294. Unless these means collide with the public interest, they are to be given primary consideration. The Commission\u2019s decision reflects consideration of these goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-4\">There is some support in case law for Erickson\u2019s contention. <em>See Central Freight Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>669 F.2d 1063, 1072 (5th Cir.1982) (\u201c. . . the Commission cannot disregard the statutory mandate to consider fuel and economic efficiencies under the National Transportation Policy .... Of course, these factors will not necessarily be determinative .... Nevertheless, the Commission should ordinarily engage in explicit consideration of these factors.\u201d) <em>But see C &amp; H Transp. Co., Inc. v. Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n, </em>704 F.2d 834, 847, 847 n. 20 (5th Cir.1983) (\u201cThe National Transportation Policy must guide the ICC in all its decisions. However, the ICC need not explicitly discuss in its decision each factor enumerated in section 10101. All that is necessary is that the essential basis of the ICC\u2019s rationale be clear enough so that a court can satisfy itself that the ICC has performed its function.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-5\">Further, it must be conceded that judicial review of ICC decisions would be facilitated if the ICC did make specific findings on the elements in the National Transportation Policy. Making specific findings also might quiet the contentions of protestants, particularly because Congress made the Policy available to protestants as a means for objecting to new authority. <em>House Report </em>at 15, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 <em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News </em>2297. However our review of the legislative history behind the 1980 Act and case law convinces us that the Commission\u2019s failure to make explicit, individual findings under the National Transportation Policy is not a basis for reversal. <em>See RTC Transp., Inc. v. Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n, </em>708 F.2d 620, 626 (11th Cir.1983); <em>C &amp; H Transp. Co., </em>704 F.2d at 847, 847 n. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-9\">Our review of the record reveals that there is a rational connection between the Commission\u2019s findings and its decision which is supported by substantial evidence. Stewco established its prima facie case by demonstrating that it was fit, willing and able to perform the proposed service and that there was a public need for the service. Erickson failed to rebut the presumption arising from the prima facie case; that Erickson will experience financial injury and increased competition is insufficient to carry its burden of controverting the Commission\u2019s finding that the transportation proposed would serve a useful public purpose. Thus, the order granting interstate authority to Stewco was not erroneous and the decision of the Commission must be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1155-11\">.

It failed to find sufficiently that Stewco is \u201cfit, willing, and able\u201d to provide the service applied for, and it failed to provide sufficiently specific findings to support its decision. I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-12\">To justify the issuance of a certificate authorizing a person as a motor common carrier of property, the ICC must find \u201cthat the person is fit, willing, and able to provide the transportation to be authorized by the certificate and to comply with this subtitle and regulations of the Commission.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10922(b)(1)(A) (Supp. V 1981). The ICC was able to make this finding here because, in 1980, it abandoned the requirement that applicants prove their fitness in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>financial terms. <em>Rules Governing Applications for Operating Authority, </em>Ex Parte No. 55 (Sub-No. 43), 364 I.C.C. 539 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-5\">Notwithstanding the 1980 abandonment, both the Tenth and Fifth Circuits have since left the financial requirement intact, defining \u201cfitness\u201d under the statute as: (a) the applicant\u2019s financial fitness or ability to perform the service it seeks to provide; (b) its willingness to comply with the Interstate Commerce Act and regulations promulgated thereunder; and (c) its ability to perform the proposed service in a proper and safe manner for the protection of the public. <em>C &amp; H Transportation Co. v.

Abandoning the financial fitness requirement contradicts the intention of Congress in passing the Motor Carrier Act of 1980. To be sure, Congress did intend \u201cincreased opportunities for new carriers to get into the trucking business and for existing carriers to expand their services.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1069, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 3, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2283, 2285. Congress chose to make it easier for carriers to acquire an operating certificate by modifying the traditional \u201cpublic convenience and necessity\u201d test. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C.\u00a7 10922(b); H.R.Rep. No. 1069, <em>supra, </em>at 13-14, 1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 2295-2296. In essence, under the new law, public convenience and necessity is to be determined less by the ICC, and more by the marketplace. <em>Id. </em>at 14-15, 1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 2296-2297.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-10\">Congress made it clear, however, that it wanted fitness to be determined by the ICC, as in the past.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The House Report specifies that while modifying the public convenience and necessity test, and in some instances removing it entirely, Congress intended to keep the fitness requirement intact. H.R.Rep. No. 1069, <em>supra, </em>at 13-16, 1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 2295-2298. Thus, it appears to be Congress\u2019s view that competition is promoted by entry of healthy, fit competitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-11\">It should be noted that the ICC had proposed to eliminate individual consideration of applications altogether, and instead adopt a \u201cmaster certification approach.\u201d Ex Parte No. MC-135, <em>Master Certificates and Permits. </em>Congress refused, however, to allow the ICC such expansive discretion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2c4\">[I]t is incumbent on the Congress to provide the Commission with guidance regarding motor carrier entry policy. A liberalized entry policy will have a significant impact on the motor carrier industry. For example, relaxed entry standards and increased competition for traffic will have a direct effect on employment in the industry and on the industry itself. Broad policy decisions of this type should be made by the Congress and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>should not be left to the discretion of the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\">H.R.Rep. No. 1069, <em>supra, </em>at 13, 1980 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 2295.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-5\">We have no right to do what Congress refused to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-6\">The ICC has adopted its own entry policy in which individual consideration of applications is no longer a meaningful process. In the instant case, the ICC\u2019s entire evaluation of Stewco\u2019s fitness was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aya\">Applicant has been serving shipper in intrastate commerce, shipper is satisfied with its service, and applicant appears able to provide it an interstate service which should be of some value. If applicant is unable to provide service comparable to that of protestants, then protestants need have no fear of its competition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1164-7\"><em>Stewco, Inc., Extension </em>\u2014 Two <em>Arkansas Counties, </em>No. MC-127253 (Sub-No. 56), slip op. at 4-5 (Sept. 7, 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-8\">The ICC\u2019s final decision on appeal simply stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1164-9\">The Commission no longer examines a carrier\u2019s financial position, and only in rare circumstances does it attach significant weight to operational concerns. We see nothing here to suggest that applicant is unable to provide the shipping and receiving public a service that is shown to be needed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1164-10\"><em>Stewco, Inc., Extension </em>\u2014 Two <em>Arkansas Counties, </em>No. MC-127253 (Sub-No. 56), slip op. at 1 (Nov. 18, 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-11\">The problem is that Stewco\u2019s application provided very little if any information to show that it was fit, financially or otherwise. The ICC\u2019s decision is written as though Stewco does not bear the burden of showing fitness, although the statute clearly places that burden on the applicant. The only evidence offered by Stewco in support of its application centered on its existing interstate authority to transport other commodities, and the intrastate service it performs for the shipper. If the ICC is granting certificates to anyone who states that they have a truck in their possession and has not violated safety regulations, then the fitness test is meaningless and judicial review is absurd.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-14\">In fact, counsel for the ICC reported to the Court that no applications since at least September 1, 1981, have been denied by the ICC due to financial fitness concerns. Only seven applications were denied in whole or in part on any kind of fitness consideration; these were due to the carrier\u2019s bad safety record and/or demonstrated misconduct. Thus, the ICC\u2019s policy and practice are contrary to congressional intent both to retain the fitness requirement in full, and to keep the burden of proving fitness on the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-15\">The Commission\u2019s action has direct and significant consequences. Failing to screen out unfit carriers has not promoted a healthy and competitive trucking industry. Instead, large numbers of established carriers have failed financially and many truck drivers have lost their jobs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It was concern over these very problems which led Congress to limit the ICC\u2019s discretion over entry policy through the fitness requirement. The ICC has not respected Congress\u2019s directive. Accordingly, I would hold that the ICC failed to find that Stewco was a fit carrier as required by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-16\">In addition to finding fitness, the ICC is required by section 10922(b)(2) to consider and, to the extent applicable, make findings on the transportation policy factors spelled out in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101(a), quoted <em>supra, </em>at 1065-66 n. 10. While courts have made clear that the ICC need not discuss each of the policy factors listed in the statute in detail, <em>see, e.g., J.H. Rose Truck Line, Inc. v. ICC, </em>683 F.2d 943, 951 (5th Cir.1982), it must provide the reviewing court with discernible reasons and essential basic find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>ings, <em>Central Transport, Inc. v. United States, </em>694 F.2d 968, 971-72 (4th Cir.1982); <em>Star Delivery &amp; Transfer v. United States, </em>659 F.2d 81, 83 (7th Cir.1981); <em>International Detective Service, Inc. v. ICC, </em>613 F.2d 1067, 1077 (D.C.Cir.1979); <em>Argo-Collier Truck Lines Corp. v. United States, </em>611 F.2d 149, 153 (6th Cir.1979). The ICC has failed in this case to provide in its discretion sufficient basic findings to allow meaningful judicial review. This is not the first time the ICC has faced such a criticism. As the Fourth Circuit recently observed, \u201c[t]he cases are legion in which the Commission has been criticized for making perfunctory, conclusory findings couched in the statutory language and for omitting its reasoning and findings on all but those ultimate facts.\u201d <em>Central Transport, Inc. v. United States, supra, </em>694 F.2d at 972 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-4\">The certificate application process is useless unless the Commission relates the basic facts of the case to the transportation policy articulated in the statute. For example, the ICC\u2019s failure to require an adequate showing of fitness seriously impairs the Commission\u2019s ability to consider the transportation policy factors of section 10101(a). Without financial information, the ICC is in no position to consider how Stewco\u2019s entry will affect economic conditions of the relevant sector of the industry, the possibilities of unfair or destructive competitive practices, or opportunities for adequate profits and fair wages and working conditions \u2014 explicit policy concerns articulated in the statute \u2014 and we certainly are in no position to review its decision. If Congress intends that anyone should be permitted to enter the trucking business, it should say so and eliminate the ICC permitting function and judicial reviewing function. Until it does so, I for one will continue to refuse to rubber-stamp agency actions based on theory rather than fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-5\">DECISION AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1163-7\">. The definition of fitness utilized in the cited cases appears to have been based on prior ICC decisions, <em>see, e.g., Consolidated Carrier, Inc., Common Carrier Application, </em>131 M.C.C. 104, 108 (1978); <em>Eagle Motor Lines, Inc., Investigation and Revocation of Certificates, </em>117 M.C.C. 30, 35 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-8\">A different Fifth Circuit panel than that which decided the <em>C &amp; H Transportation </em>cases recently approved the ICC's move to abandon the financial fitness requirement, based on deference to its expertise, in <em>American Transfer &amp; Storage Co. v.
