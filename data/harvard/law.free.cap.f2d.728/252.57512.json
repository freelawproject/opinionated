Bernstein (Bernstein), a minor, brought suit by his mother and next friend Florence C. Bernstein, against his high school band director, Jack Menard, and his principal, school superintendent, and district school board chairman, claiming a violation of his rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The district court granted defendants\u2019 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss and entered judgment for defendants on December 1, 1982. 557 F.Supp. 90. Defendants moved for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees on December 10, 1982, and on February 15, 1983, the district court awarded defendants attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $2,250 after finding that plaintiff\u2019s suit was frivolous and vexatious. 557 F.Supp. 92. Bernstein filed his notice of appeal on March 8, 1983. We dismiss the appeal from the trial court\u2019s 12(b)(6) action because Bernstein\u2019s appeal was not timely filed, and affirm the subsequent award of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Until September 30, 1982, Bernstein played first trumpet in the J.R. Tucker High School Band. On that day a student section leader without authority over Bernstein told him to play second trumpet. Bernstein\u2019s refusal led to a brief dispute between Bernstein and Menard resulting in Bernstein\u2019s being sent home. As punishment for the incident, Bernstein was told that he could dress in band uniform for the school\u2019s Friday evening football game but that he would have to remain in the bandstand while the band performed on the football field. Punishment was suspended while Bernstein unsuccessfully appealed the decision to various administrators. Bernstein was finally dismissed from the band when his mother refused to let him participate in a band trip to Florida. This suit followed this unfortunate misunderstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Although Bernstein did not file his appeal until three months after the district court granted the defendants\u2019 12(b)(6) motion, he contends that his appeal was filed within the thirty days required by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1) because the judgment did not become final and appealable until the district court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees on February 15, 1983. The general rule, however, is that a judgment is final and appealable when the court enters a decision ending the litigation, leaving nothing to be done except the execution of the judgment, <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 467, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 2457, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978). The judgment here was final before defendants sought attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Bernstein argues, at least implicitly, that the judgment was not final as long as it was still possible for defendants to raise an attorneys\u2019 fees issue. We cannot agree and believe that this case is governed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>White v. New Hampshire Department of Employment Security, </em>455 U.S. 445, 102 S.Ct. 1162, 71 L.Ed.2d 325 (1982). The issue in <em>White </em>was whether a \u00a7 1988 motion for attorney\u2019s fees is a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a judgment and therefore subject to the rule\u2019s ten-day timeliness standard. The Court held that it is not, reasoning that Rule 59(e) usually is invoked only to support reconsideration of matters properly encompassed in a decision on the merits, in contrast to a \u00a7 1988 request for attorney fees, which raises issues collateral to the main cause of action. 455 U.S. at 452, 102 S.Ct. at 1166. The Court noted that because \u00a7 1988 provides for an award to the \u201cprevailing party\u201d only, there cannot be an inquiry on entitlement until one party has prevailed. Furthermore, the fees are not compensation for the injury giving rise to the action and thus are not an element of relief. 455 U.S. at 452, 102 S.Ct. at 1166.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">Although the issue in <em>White </em>was not precisely the simple finality issue presented in this appeal, the Court\u2019s characterization of the fee award as collateral to the judgment on the merits is dispositive. The <em>White </em>court also expressly indicated that a merits judgment is not made less final or appealable by an outstanding fee question. Consequently, we find that Bernstein\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s dismissal order is untimely. <em>Accord West v. Keve, </em>721 F.2d 91 (3d Cir.1983); <em>Smillie v. Park Chemical Co., </em>710 F.2d 271, 273-74 (6th Cir.1983); <em>Webb v. Department of Health and Human Services, </em>696 F.2d 101, 104-05 (D.C.Cir. 1982); <em>Cox v. Flood, </em>683 F.2d 330, 331 (10th Cir.1982).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">Bernstein also asserts that even if the trial court correctly dismissed his cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>of action, it erred in assessing attorneys\u2019 fees against him. We conclude, however, that an award of attorneys\u2019 fees was justified under the <em>Christiansburg </em>Garment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> standard for \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable or groundless\u201d claims. The district court considered the <em>Barber v. Kimbrell\u2019s, Inc., </em>577 F.2d 216, 226 n. 28 (4th Cir.1978) criteria for determining the amount of the award before fixing the fee amount. We cannot say that it abused its discretion in making these two determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-6\">. Our holding that a judgment on the merits of the controversy may be final and appealable prior to the entry of a \u00a7 1988 fee award is not predicated on the fact that the attorneys\u2019 fees request was a post-judgment motion. The Supreme Court stated that \u201cregardless of when attorney\u2019s fees are requested, the court\u2019s decision of entitlement to fees will therefore require an inquiry separate from the decision on the merits \u2014 an inquiry that cannot even commence until one party has \u2018prevailed.\u2019 \u201d <em>White, </em>455 U.S. at 451-52, 102 S.Ct. at 1166-67. Therefore, to the extent that it is inconsistent with <em>White, </em>we will no longer follow our holding in <em>Anderson v. Morris, </em>658 F.2d 246, 248 (4th Cir.1981), that an order is not final until a request for attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 1988 is decided.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b350-15\">. <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v.
