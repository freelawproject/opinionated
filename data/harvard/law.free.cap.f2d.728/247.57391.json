We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b344-16\">There is no dispute as to the facts of this case. The plaintiff-appellant, Emmett J. Jafari, enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Reserve for a six year term in December 1978. On or about September 8, 1980, Mr. Dennis Weed, representing himself to be an agent of Jafari\u2019s civilian employer, Southern Railways Company, requested from Jafari\u2019s Reserve organization information regarding Jafari\u2019s attendance at various reserve drills and a two-week training program. A Captain John R. Murphy provided Mr. Weed with the requested information by consulting Jafari\u2019s Individual Drill Attendance and Retirement Transaction Card. The information contained on the card related only to Jafari as it was the normal practice to maintain such a card on each member of the Reserve.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Initially, Captain Murphy made an oral disclosure of the information to Mr. Weed, but subsequently reduced the information to writing. The information disclosed was later confirmed, in writing, by Jafari\u2019s commanding officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Jafari filed a complaint pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(g)(l)(D). Alleging that the defendant had released to Jafari\u2019s private employer information concerning Jafari\u2019s non-attendance at reserve drills and a two-week training program in violation of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a, and 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 701.1, Subpart A, et seq., Jafari sought monetary and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court granted defendant\u2019s motion and denied Jafari\u2019s. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">This appeal turns on application of interrelated provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Privacy Act of 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">The relevant provision of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(b), forbids agency disclosure of any \u201crecord . .. contained in a system of records\u201d without request by or consent of the subject of the record \u201cunless disclosure ... would be \u2014 (2) required under section 552 [of the FOIA].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">The relevant cross-referred FOIA provisions are \u00a7 552(a)(3) and (6) and \u00a7 552(b)(6). Section 552(a)(3) generally requires the disclosure \u201cto any person\u201d of agency \u201crecords\u201d properly requested by that person. But \u00a7 552(b)(6) then exempts, <em>inter alia, </em>from this general disclosure requirement \u201cpersonnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d And \u00a7 552(a)(6) requires, in a provision undoubtedly intended mainly, if not wholly, for the benefit of the person requesting information, that upon any request made for records, the agency shall \u201cdetermine ... whether to comply\u201d within a specified period.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">Jafari argued below and here that the disclosure of information from the agency records of his attendance or non-attendance at reservist drills, not having been requested or consented to by him, and not having properly been determined by its custodian to be disclosable, violated the relevant Privacy Act provision, \u00a7 552a(b), and cross-referenced FOIA provision, \u00a7 552(a)(6), and entitles him to relief. The Navy Department contended below and here that disclosure was authorized under the circumstances, without Jafari\u2019s request or consent, because, per 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6), the information, though contained in a \u201cpersonnel file\u201d was properly determined by its custodian, in compliance with \u00a7 552(a)(6), not to be of a type whose disclosure \u201cwould constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">The district court agreed with the Navy\u2019s position, drawing specifically upon an agency interpretive regulation, 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 701.107(b)(2) (1982), which included \u201cduty status\u201d among items of information properly disclosable under \u00a7\u00a7 552(a) and 552(b)(6) construed <em>in pari materia. </em>The district court accepted the Navy\u2019s interpretation that drill attendance information fell within the \u201cduty status\u201d category. We also agree with the Navy\u2019s general position, but prefer to rest decision on a basis that does not depend upon the interpretive regulation and the district court\u2019s application of its \u201cduty status\u201d category to the information here disclosed. We hold instead that under \u00a7\u00a7 552(a) and 552(b)(6), the custodian of records here properly determined that, under the specific facts of the case, disclosure of the information requested, though from \u201cpersonnel files\u201d related to Jafari, would not constitute a \u201cclearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">The only information released concerned Jafari\u2019s absence from reserve drills and training programs and the dates of such absences. No information was released relating to the official nature of those absences, nor to any reasons that may have been assigned for them by Jafari. Moreover, the person requesting the information positively identified himself as an agent of Jafari\u2019s civilian employer. Civilian employers are required to grant leaves of absence whenev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>er an employee is required to perform active or inactive reserve duty training. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2024(d). The corporate employer\u2019s interest in the information here disclosed transcended any purely private concerns of the employer or of Jafari and involved the employer\u2019s own legal obligations to the government agency involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">On the basis of these facts, we believe that the information released might properly be determined by its government custodian to be \u201cnonconfidential matter ... not to be insulated from disclosure .... \u201d <em>Department of the Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 372, 96 S.Ct. 1592, 1604, 48 L.Ed.2d 11 (1976). Moreover, we conclude that the custodian of the information, Captain Murphy, impliedly and properly made a determination, prior to disclosure, that no clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy would result, thereby satisfying any requirement for such a determination that might be thought imposed by \u00a7 552a(b) for the benefit of the subjects of disclosed information such as Jafari, a matter on which we express no opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
