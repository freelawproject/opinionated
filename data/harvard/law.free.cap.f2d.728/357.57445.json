The Board has filed a cross-application for enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Gordy was hired by Airborne Freight in December, 1979, and was fired in September, 1980, allegedly for falsifying his time-card. Gordy filed a charge with the Board alleging that his discharge violated section 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(3) (1976). He later amended his charge to allege a violation of section 8(a)(4) as well. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(4). Subsequently the Regional Director consolidated Gordy\u2019s case with another case in which Airborne Freight was charged with engaging in unfair labor practices. The administrative law judge (ALJ) found, <em>inter alia, </em>that Gordy had been discharged in retaliation for supporting the Union and for providing the NLRB with information during its investigation. This finding was affirmed by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Airborne Freight has appealed only that part of the Board\u2019s order relating to Gordy. First, it argues that the Board ignored un-controverted evidence that the Company\u2019s consistent practice was to fire dishonest employees. Next, it contends that the Board erred in substituting its own subjective judgment for the Company\u2019s business judgment that Gordy\u2019s offense warranted his termination. Finally, the Company asserts that the General Counsel failed to make a prima facie showing that Gordy\u2019s protected conduct was a motivating factor in the discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">We agree with the Company that the Board incorrectly relied upon the ALJ\u2019s subjective assessments of whether the Company should have believed that Gordy had lied or should have fired him for dishonesty. Upon consideration of the record as a whole, we conclude that the uncontroverted evidence shows that, rightly or wrongly, Gordy\u2019s superiors believed that Gordy had deliberately falsified his timecard. Although it was arguably harsh to fire Gordy for this reason, his discharge was totally consistent with the Company\u2019s policy in the past. Indeed, Gordy\u2019s superior testified that he had expressly made this policy clear to Gordy at the time of Gordy\u2019s hiring. This testimony was not refuted later by Gordy when he was called to testify on rebuttal. Moreover, there was no evidence of leniency toward other employees accused of dishonesty from which it could be inferred that Gordy\u2019s protected conduct was a motivating factor in his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">In such circumstances, the evidence leads only to the conclusion that Gordy would have been terminated absent his protected activities. Accordingly, the Company has met its burden under the allocation of the burden of proof set forth in <em>Wright Line, a Division of Wright Line, Inc., </em>251 NLRB 1083 (1980) and upheld in <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Transportation Management Corp., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 2469, 76 L.Ed.2d 667 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-14\">Enforcement DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
