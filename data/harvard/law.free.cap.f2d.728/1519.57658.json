(Multi-State), challenges two orders of the Federal Communications Commission (Commission). The first order reallocated television Channel 9 from New York to New Jersey and granted, without a comparative hearing, a five-year license to operate Channel 9 to Intervenor RKO General, Inc. (RKO). 53 Rad.Reg.2d (P &amp; F) 469 (1983). The second order dismissed as moot Multi-State\u2019s competing application for a license to operate Channel 9. 53 Rad.Reg.2d (P &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1521\">*1521</page-number>F) 671 (1983). Multi-State contends that these orders misconstrued section 331 of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 331 (West Supp.1983), and violated Multi-State\u2019s constitutional rights. For reasons expressed below, we affirm the Commission\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-6\">In 1972, RKO filed an application to renew its license to operate WOR-TV, a commercial television station on very high frequency (VHF) Channel 9 in New York City.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, Multi-State challenged RKO\u2019s renewal request by filing a competing application to operate Channel 9. Because the competing applications were mutually exclusive, the Commission ordered a comparative hearing to determine which applicant was better qualified to be licensee of the New York station. <em>RKO General, Inc. (WOR-TV), </em>46 F.C.C.2d 246 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-7\">At the comparative hearing, the Commission indicated that it would examine six financial and character qualification issues. 46 F.C.C.2d at 250. Three of these issues were identical to issues already under consideration in another proceeding involving an application by RKO to renew its license to operate a Boston television station. <em>Id. </em>at 248-49. To avoid duplication, the Commission stated that its findings on the three common issues under consideration in the Boston proceeding would be res judicata on RKO\u2019s renewal request for the Channel 9 license. <em>Id. </em>at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-8\">In the Boston proceeding, the Commission found that RKO lacked the requisite character qualifications for renewal of its Boston license. <em>RKO General, Inc. (WNACTV), </em>78 F.C.C.2d 1 (1980), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>670 F.2d 215 (D.C.Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 927, 102 S.Ct. 1974, 72 L.Ed.2d 442 (1982). Because this finding was res judicata on RKO\u2019s renewal request for the Channel 9 license, the Commission denied renewal of RKO\u2019s license for Channel 9 in New York. <em>RKO General, Inc. (WOR-TV), </em>78 F.C.C.2d 357, 358 (1980). On December 4, 1981, this court reversed and remanded the Commission\u2019s decision regarding the Channel 9 license on the ground that the Commission had not provided a \u201cprincipled explanation\u201d for disqualifying RKO as the licensee of Channel 9.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>RKO General, Inc. v. FCC, </em>670 F.2d 215, 237 (D.C.Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1119, 102 S.Ct. 2931, 73 L.Ed.2d 1331 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-13\">During the course of these administrative and judicial proceedings, Congressmen from New Jersey introduced legislation to secure a commercial VHF television station \u25a0 for their state. These efforts included a bill proposed in July 1982 by Senator Bradley of New Jersey that would require the Commission to issue a license to any existing licensee that volunteered to move to an unserved state.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Senator Bradley\u2019s bill' became law on September 3, 1982, and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqW\">It shall be the policy of the Federal Communications Commission to allocate channels for very high frequency commercial television broadcasting in a manner which ensures that not less than one such channel shall be allocated to each State, if technically feasible. In any case in which [a] licensee of a very high frequency commercial television broadcast station notifies the Commission to the effect that such licensee will agree to the reallocation of its channel to a community within a State in which there is allocated no very high frequency commercial television broadcast channel at the time [of] such notification, the Commission shall, notwithstanding any other provision of law, order such reallocation and issue a license to such licensee for that purpose pursuant to such notification for a term of not to exceed 5 years as provided in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1522\">*1522</page-number>Section 307(d) of the Communications Act of 1934.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1618-4\">47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 331 [hereinafter cited as section 331].</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-5\">On September 7, 1982, while its license renewal application was still pending, RKO notified the Commission that it agreed, pursuant to section 331, \u201cto the reallocation of Channel 9 from New York, New York, to Secaucus, New Jersey, upon issuance by the Commission to RKO of a regular license ... having a term of five years.\u201d Joint Appendix (J.A.) at 62. The Commission determined that a reallocation pursuant to section 331 should not be followed by a comparative hearing proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiE\">[Section 331] specifically says that, upon notification by a licensee of its agreement to reallocate its channel to an unserved State, \u201cthe Commission shall, <em>notwithstanding any other provision of law, </em>order such reallocation and issue a license to such licensee\u201d for a term of up to five years. The emphasized language, in our view, includes those statutory and regulatory provisions pertaining to comparative proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1618-7\">53 Rad.Reg.2d at 471, J.A. at 3. Accordingly, the Commission ordered the reallocation and granted RKO a five-year license. 53 Rad.Reg.2d (P &amp; F) 469 (1983), J.A. at 1. In a companion order, the Commission dismissed as moot Multi-State\u2019s competing application for the Channel 9 license. 53 Rad. Reg.2d (P &amp; F) 671 (1983), J.A. at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-8\">This appeal followed, in which Multi-State contends that the Commission\u2019s orders misconstrued section 331 and violated Multi-State\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-9\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-10\">A. <em>The Application of Section 331 to New Jersey</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1618-11\">Multi-State first argues that the Commission erred in reallocating Channel 9 to New Jersey because section 331 is, by its express terms, not applicable to New Jersey. Section 331 applies only to situations where an existing licensee volunteers to move its channel to \u201ca State in which there is <em>allocated </em>no [VHF] commercial broadcast channel .. .. \u201d 47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 331 (emphasis added). Multi-State contends that the term \u201callocated\u201d is synonymous with the term \u201cassigned.\u201d In 1952, the Commission assigned Channel 13 to Newark, New Jersey, as a VHF commercial station. <em>Television Assignments </em>\u2014 Sixth <em>Report and Order, </em>41 F.C.C. 148, 258-59 (1952).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because Channel 13 continues to be assigned to New Jersey in the Commission\u2019s Table of Assignments, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.606(b) (1982), Multi-State argues that New Jersey plainly is outside the scope of section 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-14\">At first glance, Multi-State\u2019s construction of \u201callocated\u201d has some appeal. Construing a statutory term, however, requires more than a superficial and isolated examination of the statute\u2019s plain words. Ascertaining congressional intent requires us to examine \u201cthe context in which statutory words are set \u2014 the statute\u2019s purpose, structure, and history .. . . \u201d <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>EPA, 725 </em>F.2d 761 at 769 (D.C.Cir.1984). <em>See also FBI v. Abramson, </em>456 U.S. 615, 625 &amp; n. 7, 102 S.Ct. 2054, 2061 &amp; n. 7, 72 L.Ed.2d 376 (1982). Our understanding of the purpose of section 331 and our examination of its legislative history compel us to reject Multi-State\u2019s construction of the term \u201callocated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-15\">We first observe that although New Jersey was assigned Channel 13 in 1952, the Commission in 1961 approved the transfer of that channel\u2019s license from a commercial operator in New Jersey to a noncommercial operator in New York. <em>NTA Television Broadcasting Corp., </em>44 F.C.C. 2563 (1961). Since 1961, Channel 13 has been operated as part of the New York state educational network. 53 Rad.Reg.2d at 470 n. 2, J.A. at 2 n. 2. Thus, prior to the enactment of section 331, New Jersey had been without an operating VHF commercial television station for more than twenty years. The absence of such a station resulted in dissatisfied television viewers in New Jersey due to incomplete coverage of local events. <em>See, e.g., Petition for Inquiry Into the Need for Adequate Television Service for the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1523\">*1523</page-number><em>State of New Jersey, </em>58 F.C.C.2d 790 (1976); <em>Second Report and Order, </em>59 F.C.C.2d 1386 (1976); <em>Third Report and Order, </em>62 F.C.C.2d 604 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-5\">Consequently, New Jersey Congressmen introduced legislation in an effort to secure a VHF station for their state.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On March 31, 1982, Senator Bradley of New Jersey introduced a bill that was identical in language to section 331.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 128 Cong.Rec. S3160 (daily ed. Mar. 31,1982). When introducing this bill, Senator Bradley emphasized New Jersey\u2019s need for a VHF commercial television station.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>He said that this bill would solve New Jersey\u2019s problem because it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1619-6\">directed [the Commission] to accept and grant the application of any current license holder who voluntarily requests to have its . commercial VHF TV license moved to a State which does not have one.... It is my hope that with the barriers to a voluntary resolution to New Jersey\u2019s problem removed, a New York station owner will step forward to move to New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1619-7\"><em>Id. </em>Although the Senate adopted Senator Bradley\u2019s bill, it was appended to another bill that did not become law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-8\">Senator Bradley therefore introduced the same bill again on July 22, 1982. 128 Cong. Rec. S8922 (daily ed. July 22, 1982). The Bradley bill again passed the Senate and this time was added to the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982. This bill, with the Bradley amendment, was referred to a House-Senate conference committee.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The conference committee retained the Bradley amendment and reported on the amendment as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1619-14\">New Jersey and Delaware are the only two States that do not have a commercial VHF television station. The [Bradley] amendment affirms the congressional intent that it is in the public interest for every State to have at least one VHF television station. In order to implement that intent, the amendment provides that, upon notice by any licensee in another State that it agrees to the reallocation of its channel to a community in a State in which there is no such channel, the Federal Communications Commission shall order the reallocation and issue a license to the licensee for such purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1619-15\">This provision will remove impediments which currently discourage a licensee in a State which has more than one VHF television station from voluntarily moving to a State which has none. . It is the intention of Congress that any current licensee which exercises the option of seeking the transfer of its license to an unserved State ... will . .. operate for the public benefit of the unserved State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APl\">H.R.Rep. No. 760, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 690 (1982); S.Rep. No. 530, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 690 (1982), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1982, pp. 781, 1453. The conference report was adopted by both Houses on August 19, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1524\">*1524</page-number>1982,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and Senator Bradley\u2019s bill became law on September 3, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-4\">The frequent references to New Jersey make it clear that the sponsor and proponents of section 331 intended New Jersey to be within the statute\u2019s scope. More importantly, the conference report illustrates beyond cavil that Congress intended section 331 to apply to New Jersey. The conferees expressly noted that \u201cNew Jersey and Delaware are the only two States that do not have a commercial VHF television station. [Section 331 affirms and implements] the congressional intent ... for every State to have at least one [such] station.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 760, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 690 (1982); S.Rep. No. 530, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 690 (1982), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1982, p. 1453. The conferees thus clearly contemplated New Jersey as being within the ambit of section 331 notwithstanding that New Jersey already was assigned a VHF commercial channel. The conference report, viewed against the backdrop of five years of legislative efforts by New Jersey Congressmen to secure a VHF station for their state, reveals that the purpose of section 331 is to provide each \u201cunserved\u201d state with an <em>operating </em>VHF commercial television station. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we must reject Multi-State\u2019s invitation to construe \u201callocated\u201d synonymously with \u201cassigned,\u201d because such a construction would ignore congressional intent and thwart the legislative will. <em>See Philbrook v. Glodgett, </em>421 U.S. 707, 713, 95 S.Ct. 1893, 1898, 44 L.Ed.2d 525 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-5\">B. <em>The Commission\u2019s Grant of the License to RKO</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1620-6\">Multi-State next argues that RKO is not a \u201clicensee\u201d within the meaning of section 331 in light of the Commission\u2019s earlier disqualification of RKO as the licensee of Channel 9. <em>See </em>78 F.C.C.2d 357 (1980). Contrary to Multi-State\u2019s assertion, we find that RKO\u2019s earlier disqualification did not destroy its status as a licensee. When RKO volunteered to move from New York to New Jersey pursuant to section 331, RKO was the licensee of Channel 9. Although RKO\u2019s application for renewal of its license was before the Commission on remand from this court, <em>RKO General, Inc. v. FCC, </em>670 F.2d. 215 (D.C.Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1119, 102 S.Ct. 2931, 73 L.Ed.2d 1331 (1982), RKO\u2019s status as a licensee during the pendency of the renewal proceeding was unaltered. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 558(c) (1982) (when a licensee applies for renewal, the license will not expire until the application has been finally determined by the agency); 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 307(d) (Supp. V 1981) (pending a final decision on a license renewal application, the Commission shall continue such license in effect).</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-11\">Multi-State also contends that the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 307 (1976 &amp; Supp. V 1981), mandates that the Commission conduct a comparative hearing to determine which of two or more competing license applicants would better serve the public interest. Multi-State therefore argues that the Commission erred in not conducting a comparative hearing for RKO and Multi-State with respect to Channel 9. We find no error in the Commission\u2019s decision to proceed without the comparative hearing. The plain language of section 331 commands that if any licensee volunteers to move to an unserved state, \u201cthe Commission <em>shall, </em>notwithstanding any other provision of law, <em>order such reallocation and issue a license </em>.. .. \u201d 47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 331 (emphasis added). <em>See Boyden v. Commissioner of Patents, </em>441 F.2d 1041, 1043 n. 3 (D.C.Cir.) (\u201c \u2018[s]hall\u2019 is the language of command\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 842, 92 S.Ct. 139, 30 L.Ed.2d 77 (1971). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1525\">*1525</page-number>Commission thus complied with the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-4\">Furthermore, the phrase, \u201cnotwithstanding any other provision of law\u201d overrides any prior, inconsistent provision of the Communications Act. <em>See New Jersey Air National Guard v. FLRA, </em>677 F.2d 276, 283 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 988, 103 S.Ct. 343, 74 L.Ed.2d 384 (1982). <em>See also Devine v. White, </em>697 F.2d 421, 429 (D.C.Cir. 1983); <em>Bryant v. Civiletti, </em>663 F.2d 286, 292 (D.C.Cir.1981). Through its use of the phrase, \u201cnotwithstanding any other provision of law,\u201d Congress expressly made inapplicable all provisions of law that would prevent or impede the voluntary movement of a VHF commercial station to an unserved state. This conclusion is buttressed by the conference committee report, which says that section 331 was designed to \u201cremove impediments which currently discourage a licensee in a State which has more than one VHF television station from voluntarily moving to a State which has none.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 760, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 690 (1982); S.Rep. No. 530, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 690 (1982), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1982, p. \u2014. Section 331 thus displaced the normal procedures for channel reallocation as well as the normal procedures for issuing licenses, including the requirement of a comparative hearing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1621-7\">C. <em>The Alleged Constitutional Violation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1621-8\">Finally, Multi-State argues that its constitutional right to due process was violated when the Commission applied section 331 to deprive Multi-State of its vested right to a comparative hearing. Multi-State contends that it acquired a vested right to a hearing pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ashbacker Radio Corp. v. FCC, </em>326 U.S. 327, 66 S.Ct. 148, 90 L.Ed. 108 (1945). In <em>Ashbacker, </em>the Supreme Court, in construing section 309(a) of the Communications Act,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> held that \u201cwhere two <em>bona fide </em>[license] applications are mutually exclusive the grant of one without a hearing to both deprives the loser of the opportunity which Congress chose to give him.\u201d 326 U.S. at 333, 66 S.Ct. at 151. Multi-State contends that the Commission committed constitutional error in interpreting section 331 so as to divest Multi-State of its right to a hearing pursuant to <em>Ash-backer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1621-11\">Contrary to Multi-State\u2019s assertion, the decision in <em>Ashbacker </em>does not confer upon Multi-State a constitutional right to a hearing. The right to a hearing in <em>Ashbacker </em>stemmed from a statutory scheme in the Communications Act that ordinarily precludes denial of a license application without a hearing. The enactment of section 331, however, altered the statutory scheme discussed in <em>Ashbacker. </em>In section 331, Congress made one limited exception to the comparative hearing requirement to achieve the overriding objective of bringing an operational VHF commercial television station to unserved states such as New Jersey and Delaware. Thus, in the limited context of section 331, Congress made moot the hearing procedures construed in <em>Ashbacker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1621-12\">Congress, of course, has paramount power in the regulatory field. <em>See F.H.A. v. Darlington, Inc., </em>358 U.S. 84, 91 n. 6, 79 S.Ct. 141, 146 n. 6, 3 L.Ed.2d 132 (1958). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1526\">*1526</page-number>We find section 331 to be permissible regulation of future action: it directs the Commission, under specified and limited circumstances, to reallocate a VHF channel and issue a license for that channel.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court said in <em>Darlington:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1622-4\">Federal regulation of future action based upon rights previously acquired by the person regulated is not prohibited by the Constitution. So long as the Constitution authorizes the subsequently enacted legislation, the fact that its provisions limit or interfere with previously acquired rights does not condemn it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1622-5\">358 U.S. at 91, 79 S.Ct. at 146 (quoting <em>Fleming v. Rhodes, </em>331 U.S. 100, 107, 67 S.Ct. 1140, 1144, 91 L.Ed. 1368 (1947)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-6\">We recognize that the Commission\u2019s action pursuant to section 331 terminates abruptly, albeit temporarily,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Multi-State\u2019s pursuit of a license for Channel 9. Nevertheless, Congress elevated the goal of providing unserved states with an operational VHF commercial television station. The Commission merely effected congressional intent. The fact that the Commission\u2019s action frustrated Multi-State\u2019s expectations is no basis for finding that the Commission committed constitutional error. <em>See Motor and Equipment Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, </em>627 F.2d 1095, 1128 (D.C.Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 952, 100 S.Ct. 2917, 64 L.Ed.2d 808 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-8\">In construing section 331, our duty is to find that interpretation which most fairly can be said to effect the legislative will. <em>See Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Org., </em>441 U.S. 600, 608, 99 S.Ct. 1905, 1911, 60 L.Ed.2d 508 (1979). Our interpretation of section 331 coincides with that of the Commission. Although we sympathize with the situation in which Multi-State finds itself as a result of the Commission\u2019s orders, we find that the actions taken by the Commission were mandated by Congress. Accordingly, the Commission\u2019s orders are</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1617-9\">. RKO has been the licensee of VHF Channel 9 in New York City since 1952.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1617-10\">.
