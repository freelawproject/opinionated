DuPont deNemours and Company (defendant-appellee) to recover for injuries sustained as a consequence of an accident that occurred at DuPont\u2019s plant in Old Hickory, Tennessee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the conclusion of a five day jury trial, a verdict was returned in favor of DuPont. On appeal, appellants raise two issues which merit discussion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First, appellants claim that the trial court erred by instructing the jury that a landowner owes no duty to invitees to furnish protection against hazards on the landowner\u2019s premises. Second, appellants assert that the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on the issue of negligence <em>per se. </em>Although the instruction concern-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>mg a landowner\u2019s duty to invitees is ambiguous, we conclude that such ambiguity is harmless. We hold, however, that the court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on the issue of negligence <em>per se </em>was improper and prejudicial. Accordingly, this case is affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded for a trial solely on the issue of negligence <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">The Daniel Construction Company (Daniel Construction) entered into a contract with DuPont to dismantle and remove hydraulic bailers from DuPont\u2019s plant. The bailers occupied three floor levels within the plant and were used to compress synthetic Dacron\u00ae fiber. Hydraulic \u201crams\u201d provided the force necessary to compress the fiber. The rams were located below the ground floor in a \u201cbailer pit\u201d, access to which was provided by a straight and permanently affixed ladder. On March 14, 1979, Richard Teal, an employee of Daniel Construction, fell approximately seventeen feet from the ladder to the floor of the bailer pit. Richard Teal brought this action against DuPont alleging that his fall and injuries were the direct and proximate result of DuPont\u2019s negligence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">One of appellant\u2019s negligence theories concerned DuPont\u2019s duty to invitees to \u201cfurnish protection against dangers\u201d on DuPont\u2019s property. Initially, the trial court instructed the jury that a landowner\u2019s duty to invitees is \u201cto give warning of, or use ordinary care to furnish protection against such dangers to employees of the contractor who are without actual or constructive notice of the dangers.\u201d After the jury had retired for deliberations, it requested additional instructions. Specifically, the jury asked the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-6\">Do DuPont employees wear safety belts on ladders: was it DuPont\u2019s responsibility to see that Richard Teal wore a safety belt?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">The trial court again instructed the jury that a landowner owes a duty to invitees \u201cto give warning of or use ordinary care to furnish protection against\u201d dangers on the landowner\u2019s property. The court further instructed the jury, however, that \u201can owner or occupant of land who has an independent contractor or who employs employees to perform work owes a duty to warn of hazards, but he is not under a duty to specify the manner in which those hazards should be avoided.\u201d Appellants claim that the latter instruction is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">Appellants\u2019 second argument concerns their negligence <em>per se </em>claim. During the course of the trial, appellants introduced evidence which indicated that DuPont\u2019s ladder failed to conform to federal regulations promulgated pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. 29 U.S.C. Sec. 651 <em>et seq. </em>Specifically, OSHA regulations require a clearance of not less than seven inches \u201cfrom the centerline of the rungs, cleats or steps to the nearest permanent object in back of the ladder.\u201d 29 C.F.R. Sec. 1910.27(c)(4). The uncontro-verted testimony of Robert B. Taylor, a director of the Division of Occupational Safety and Health for the Tennessee Department of Labor, indicated that the ladder failed to conform with the seven inch clearance requirement. Because DuPont had breached a regulatory obligation, appellants requested the trial court to instruct the jury on the issue of negligence <em>per se. </em>The trial court refused; instead, it informed the jury that the OSHA regulation \u201cmay be considered ... as some evidence ... of the (appropriate) standard of care.\u201d Appellants claim that the district court\u2019s refusal to charge on the issue of negligence <em>per se </em>is reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">When a federal court\u2019s jurisdiction is based solely on diversity of citizenship, the federal court must apply state law. <em>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). In this case, the law of Tennessee is the substantive law to be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Although state law determines the substance of jury instructions in a diversity of citizenship case, federal law governs our standard of review for determining whether a jury instruction is prejudicial. <em>E.g., Hrzenak v. White-Westinghouse Appliance Co., </em>682 F.2d 714, 719 (8th Cir.1982); <em>Wright v. Albuquerque Auto-Truck Stop Plaza, Inc., </em>591 F.2d 585, 587 (10th Cir. 1979). Generally, a charge that contains an inaccurate or ambiguous statement does not constitute reversible error if the inaccuracy or ambiguity is unlikely to mislead the jury. <em>E.g., Vicksburg Furniture Mfg., Ltd. v. Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co., </em>625 F.2d 1167, 1169 (5th Cir.1980). In determining whether an isolated clause in the jury instructions is likely to have misled the jury, a reviewing court must consider the entire charge. <em>E. g., Blackwell v. Sun Electric Corp., </em>696 F. 2d 1176, 1181 (6th Cir.1983); <em>Haislah v. Walton, </em>676 F.2d 208, 212 (6th Cir.1982); <em>Hrzenak v. White-Westinghouse Appliance Co., </em>682 F.2d 714, 719 (8th Cir.1982). Thus, the critical inquiry is whether the instructions as a whole provide the jury with sufficient guidance concerning the issues to be tried. Consistent with these principles, we address appellant\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">Appellants argue that the trial court\u2019s instruction that a landowner \u201cowes a duty to invitees to warn of hazards, but need not specify the manner in which those hazards should be avoided,\u201d states imprecisely the law of Tennessee. According to appellants, the jury could have interpreted this instruction to mean that a landowner <em>never </em>owes a duty to invitees to furnish protection against hazards by specifying ways to avoid particular dangers. Such an interpretation is inconsistent with established case law. A landowner\u2019s duty to invitees is defined in the disjunctive: a landowner must either warn invitees of hazards on his premises, <em>or </em>furnish protection against such dangers. <em>E.g., Jackson v. Tennessee Valley Authority, </em>413 F.Supp. 1050, 1056 (M.D.Tenn.1976). In other words, a landowner owes a duty to invitees to furnish protection against hazards only if he fails to warn of the hazards. We agree with appellant\u2019s assertion that the trial court\u2019s statement to the jury is ambiguous. We disagree with appellant\u2019s claim, however, that the instructions failed to provide the jury with sufficient guidance concerning a landowner\u2019s alternative duties to invitees.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">In our view, the jury instructions as a whole informed the jury sufficiently of DuPont\u2019s alternative duty to invitees to furnish protection against dangers on its premises. In its initial charge, the trial court instructed the jury that a landowner\u2019s duty to invitees is \u201cto give warning of, <em>or </em>use ordinary care to furnish protection against\u201d dangers. Clearly, this instruction states correctly a landowner\u2019s duty to invitees. Thereafter, the jury requested further instructions. In response to the jury\u2019s questions, the trial court again informed the jury that a landowner\u2019s duty to invitees is \u201cto give warning of, <em>or </em>use ordinary care to furnish protection against\u201d dangers on the landowner\u2019s premises. In light of these instructions, we doubt that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s ambiguous statement. In all likelihood, the jury interpreted the disputed statement to mean that if a landowner warns of a hazard, he owes no <em>further </em>duty to specify the manner in which the hazard should be avoided. In short, we believe that the instructions as a whole were sufficient to inform the jury of the issues to be tried. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court\u2019s ambiguous statement of law is harmless error. In this respect, the jury\u2019s verdict is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">The second issue on appeal concerns the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on the issue of negligence <em>per se. </em>Pursuant to Tennessee case law, a breach of a duty imposed by statute or regulation is negligence <em>per se </em>if the party injured is a member of the class of persons the statute or regulation was intended to protect. <em>E.g., Alex v. Armstrong, </em>215 Tenn. 276, 385 S.W.2d 110 (1964); <em>Taylor v. Coburn, </em>597 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>S.W.2d 319, 322 (Tenn.App.1980); <em>Berry v. Whitworth, </em>576 S.W.2d 351, 353 (Tenn.App. 1978). In this case, the parties agree that Richard Teal was, at the time of the accident, an employee of Daniel Construction, an independent contractor, and that Teal fell from a permanently affixed ladder in DuPont\u2019s plant. Further, the parties agree that the OSHA regulation established a duty owed by DuPont and that DuPont breached its duty to conform with the specifications of the regulation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the primary dispute is whether an employee of an independent contractor is a member of the class of persons that the OSHA regulation was intended to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">DuPont argues that the stated purposes for the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 reveal that Congress did not intend to impose a duty upon employers to protect the safety of an independent contractor\u2019s employees who work in the employer\u2019s plant. In support of this proposition, DuPont relies upon the plain language of the Act which provides that \u201ceach employer shall furnish to each of <em>his </em>employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to <em>his </em>employees.\u201d 29 U.S.C. Sec. 654(a)(1) (emphasis added). Although DuPont\u2019s legal position is not without support, <em>see Melerine v. Avondale Shipyards, Inc., </em>659 F.2d 706 (5th Cir.1981), we believe that an employer\u2019s duty to comply with OSHA regulations is broader than DuPont suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">Congress\u2019 primary purpose for enacting the Occupational Safety and Health Act is \u201cto assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions.\u201d 29 U.S.C. Sec. 651(b). To further this primary goal, Congress imposed statutory duties on employers and employees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under the Act, an employer\u2019s duty is two-fold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-10\">Each employer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-11\">(1) Shall furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-12\">(2) Shall comply with Occupational Safety and Health standards promulgated under this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-13\">29 U.S.C. Sec. 654(a). The first duty is a \u201cgeneral duty\u201d imposed on an employer to protect its employees from hazards that are likely to cause death or serious bodily injury. The second duty is a \u201cspecific duty\u201d imposed on employers to comply with the OSHA regulations. These separate duty clauses have been subject to varying interpretations. <em>Compare, Beatty Equipment Leasing, Inc. v. Secretary of Labor, </em>577 F.2d 534, 536-37 (9th Cir.1978); <em>Marshall v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number><em>Knutson Construction Co., </em>566 F.2d 596, 599-600 (8th Cir.1977); <em>Brennan v. OSHRC, </em>513 F.2d 1032, 1036-39 (2d Cir.1975); <em>Anning-Johnson Co. v. OSHRC, </em>516 F.2d 1081, 1091 (7th Cir.1975) (dictum); <em>with Melerine </em>v. <em>Avondale Shipyards, Inc., </em>659 F.2d 706, 710-11 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Brennan v. Gilles &amp; Cotting, Inc., </em>504 F.2d 1255 (4th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">The difficulty which courts have experienced in attempting to define a particular employer\u2019s responsibilities under the Act is due primarily to the varying nature of the separate duty provisions. The general duty clause was intended by Congress to cover unanticipated hazards; Congress recognized that it could not anticipate all of the potential hazards that might affect adversely the safety of workers. Accordingly, it enacted the general duty clause to cover serious hazards that were not otherwise covered by specific regulations. <em>Southern Ohio Building Systems, Inc. v. OSHRC, </em>649 F.2d 456, 458 (6th Cir.1981). Pursuant to Sec. 654(a)(1), every employer owes a duty of reasonable care to protect his employees from recognized hazards<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that are likely to cause death or serious bodily injury. The protection from <em>exposure </em>to serious hazards is the primary purpose of the general duty clause, <em>e.g., Anning-Johnson Co. v. United States O.S. &amp; H.R. Com\u2019n, </em>516 F.2d 1081, 1086 (7th Cir.1975), and <em>every </em>employer owes this duty regardless of whether it controls the workplace, whether it is responsible for the hazard, or whether it has the best opportunity to abate the hazard.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In contrast, Sec. 654(a)(2) is the specific duty provision. The class of employers who owe a duty to comply with the OSHA regulations is defined with reference to control of the workplace and opportunity to comply with the OSHA regulations. Accordingly, an employers\u2019 responsibilities under the Act depend upon which duty provision the employer is accused of breaching. Similarly, the class of persons for whom each of these duty provisions was enacted must be determined with reference to the particular duty in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">In this case, DuPont is accused of breaching the specific duty imposed on employers by Sec. 654(a)(2). Accordingly, DuPont\u2019s reliance on the plain language of the general duty clause is misplaced.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The very narrow question on appeal does not concern the scope of an employer\u2019s general duty to protect employees from exposure to recognized hazards, but rather, the scope of an employer\u2019s duty to comply with the specific OSHA regulations. If the special duty provision is logically construed as imposing an obligation on the part of employers to protect <em>all </em>of the employees who work at a particular job site, then the employees of an independent contractor who work on the premises of another employer must be considered members of the class that Sec. 654(a)(2) was intended to protect. In other words, one cannot define the scope of an employer\u2019s obligation under Sec. 654(a)(2) as including the protection of another\u2019s employees and, at the same time, claim that these \u201cother\u201d employees are unintended beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">We believe that Congress enacted Sec. 654(a)(2) for the special benefit of <em>all </em>employees, including the employees of an independent contractor, who perform work at another employer\u2019s workplace. The specific duty clause represents the <em>primary </em>means for furthering Congress\u2019 purpose of assuring \u201cso far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions.\u201d 29 U.S.C. Sec. 651(b). (Emphasis added). The broad remedial nature of the Occupational Health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>and Safety Act of 1970 is the Act\u2019s primary characteristic. <em>E.g., Southern Ohio Building Systems, Inc. v. OSHRC, </em>649 F.2d 456, 458 (6th Cir.1981); <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Whirlpool Corporation, </em>593 F.2d 715, 722 (6th Cir. 1979). Consistent with the broad remedial nature of the Act, we interpret the scope of intended beneficiaries of the special duty provision in a broad fashion. In our view, once an employer is deemed responsible for complying with OSHA regulations, it is obligated to protect every employee who works at its workplace. <em>See, e.g., Marshall v. Knutson Construction Co., </em>566 F.2d 596, 599 (8th Cir.1977) (duty of general contractor extends to protection of all employees). Thus, Richard Teal, an employee of an independent contractor, must be considered a member of the class of persons that the special duty provision was intended to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">As we have indicated, Tennessee case law establishes that the breach of a duty imposed by regulation is negligence <em>per se </em>if the plaintiff is a member of the class of persons which the regulation was intended to protect. DuPont concedes that it owed a duty to comply with the OSHA regulation in question and that it breached this duty. Because Richard Teal is a member of the class of persons that the OSHA regulation was intended to protect, the appellants were entitled to a jury instruction on their negligence <em>per se </em>claim. Accordingly, we hold that the district court erred by refusing to give the requested instruction on the issue of negligence <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">The district court\u2019s decision is affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b896-16\">. Tina Teal, Richard Teal\u2019s wife, joined in this action to recover for the loss of her husband\u2019s services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b896-27\">. Appellants raise a number of other issues on appeal. Upon full consideration of the arguments, we hold that none of the remaining assignments of error warrant reversal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b897-7\">. In their complaint, appellants assert that DuPont acted negligently by failing to warn of latent dangers on DuPont\u2019s premises. Alternatively, appellants claim that DuPont breached its duty to protect against dangers in its plant. Additionally, appellants assert that DuPont failed to provide a safe place to work, failed to provide safe equipment and proper safety devices, and failed to inspect properly its equipment. Finally, appellants allege that DuPont\u2019s breach of an OSHA regulation is negligence <em>per se.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b899-6\">. DuPont concedes that it breached the regulatory obligation. DuPont argues, however, that its breach is <em>\u201cde minimus </em>\u201d, and, thus, that the variance from the clearance specifications established by 29 C.F.R. Sec. 1910.27(c)(4) is not negligence <em>per se. </em>In contrast, appellants claim that even a slight variation from standards established by regulation is negligence <em>per se. </em>Furthermore, appellants argue that the trial court erred by permitting any testimony which characterized DuPont\u2019s breach of duty as <em>\u201cde minimus.\" </em>We agree with appellants\u2019 assertion that even a <em>de minimus </em>breach of a statutory or regulatory duty is negligence <em>per se. </em>We disagree, however, with appellants\u2019 claim that the court permitted improperly testimony concerning the <em>de minimus </em>nature of DuPont\u2019s breach of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">If the plaintiff proves that the defendant breached a statutory or regulatory obligation, and that the statutory or regulatory duty was enacted for the plaintiff\u2019s benefit, then the defendant is considered negligent as a matter of law. A determination that the defendant is negligent <em>per se, </em>however, does not require necessarily an award of damages. Negligence <em>per se </em>only establishes a defendant\u2019s duty and breach thereof. The question whether the breach of the duty is a proximate cause of a plaintiff\u2019s injury and the question concerning the extent, if any, of injury are jury questions that survive a determination that the defendant is negligent <em>per se. </em>In our view, testimony that a defendant\u2019s breach of duty is <em>de minimus </em>concerns the issue of proximate cause, and thus, is admissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b899-15\">. Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. Sec. 654(b), every employee owes a duty to \u201ccomply with occupational safety and health standards and all rules, regulations, and orders issued pursuant to the Act which are applicable to his own actions and conduct.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b900-5\">. In order to establish a violation of the general duty clause, the Secretary of Labor must prove that there was a hazard, that the employer knew or should have known of the hazard, and that the hazard was causing or was likely to cause death or serious bodily injury. <em>E.g., Southern Ohio Building Systems, Inc. v. OSHRC, </em>649 F.2d 456, 458 (6th Cir.1981); <em>Empire</em>\u2014Detroit <em>Steel v. OSHRC, </em>579 F.2d 378, 383 (6th Cir.1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b900-9\">.
