Bonner, claimant, from an order of the Circuit Court for Garrett County. The appellant, an employee of the Celanese Corporation of America, on August 23, 1944, injured her back while working at the Celanese plant near Cumberland, Maryland. She received compensation for this injury until November 28, 1944, when she returned to work for Celanese.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">She claimed that on March 1, 1946, she again suffered an injury to her back while at work at the Celanese plant and filed a claim with the State Industrial Accident Commission. On September 3, 1947, the Commission passed an order terminating her temporary total disability and finding that there was no permanent disability. An appeal was taken from that order to the Circuit Court for Allegany County.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">At the trial of the case in Garrett County on April 6, 1948, two issues were submitted to the jury. In answer to the first issue the jury found that the appellant suffered permanent disability as a result of the accident. To the second issue: \u201cIf the Jury finds that she is suffering from any such permanent disability, what is the percentage of such disability?\u201d, the jury answered: \u201c100 per cent\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>On the same day a motion for a new trial was filed by the Celanese Corporation of America, employer, and the American Motorists Insurance Company, insurer, appellees. As a result of that motion the trial judge filed an opinion in which he stated, among other things, the following: \u201cIt seems to this Court that the disability of claimant should be measured by her ability to engage in a gainful occupation while wearing a brace. Since the testimony most favorable to her was that her disability, measured while wearing the brace, was 50 per cent, the finding of the Jury that she was 100 per cent disabled was not supported by the evidence. The jury\u2019s finding was probably brought about in this way: the appeal seems to have been pursued under the belief of both parties that the disability was only a partial one. It was only after the evidence was completed that claimant\u2019s counsel presented the issue as to permanent <em>total </em>disability \u2014 which issue was not allowed. However, counsel for the claimant argued before the jury at some length\u2014 and the Court was in error in permitting this to be done \u2014 that claimant could not even work around her home at her domestic chores without wearing a brace. It is clear now to the Court that he should have been restricted in his arguments before the jury to the effect of the disability so far as gainful occupations are concerned,\u201d On the 27th day of July, 1948, the trial judge passed an order \u201c(4) That the motion of the defendant for a new trial is hereby granted, unless on or before the 17th day of August, 1948, the claimant or her counsel will file a written order to the Clerk authorizing the amending of the answer of the Jury to the second issue by inserting the words, \u2018Fifty Per Cent\u2019 in place of \u2018One Hundred Per Cent\u2019.\u201d From that order the appellant appeals here.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">The appellees have filed in this case a motion to dismiss the appeal for the reason that the appeal is from an order granting a new trial and that no judgment has been entered on the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Article 101, Section 57, 1947 Supplement of the Code, providing for appeals in Workmen\u2019s Compensation cases, states in part: \u201cAppeal shall lie from the judgment of the Circuit Court of the County or the Common Law-Courts of Baltimore City to the Court of Appeals as in other civil cases, * * There was no judgment in this case. The case of <em>Bethlehem Steel Company v. DeMario, </em>164 Md. 272, 164 A. 748, involved an appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court of Baltimore City reversing the decision of the State Industrial Accident Commission wherein the claimant was denied compensation. The fourth exception in that case was to the overruling of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. This Court stated in that case 164 Md. at page 278, 164 A. 748, that that action was not reviewable by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">It has been stated many times that it is well settled in this State that the action of a trial court in granting or refusing a motion for a new trial is not appealable. <em>Morrison v.

It has also been stated many times that no appeal can be taken from an interlocutory order. The judgment must be final before this Court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal. <em>Elkton Supply Co. v.
