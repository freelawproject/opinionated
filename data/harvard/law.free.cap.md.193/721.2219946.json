But, as stated by Judge Bailey: \u201cIt is true that Section 744 of Article 3, Code of Public Local Laws (1930), excepts all felonies from trial upon criminal information. But the copy of the criminal information filed with the petition discloses that the petitioner was charged with statutory breaking under Section 34, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Article 27, Code (1939). This is not a felony but a misdemeanor. <em>Bowser v.
