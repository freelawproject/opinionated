He brought suit in the Baltimore City Court against Standard, alleging negligence on the part of its employees in the operation, upon the pier, of a power crane to which the grab bucket was attached. Standard filed a general issue plea and a motion for leave to join Rukert as a third party defendant, which was granted by order of court. Thereupon Standard filed a third party complaint against Rukert, alleging negligence on the part of Rukert in failing to provide Williams with a safe place to work and to instruct him as to a safe manner in which to perform his duties. The complaint denied Standard\u2019s negligence and demanded that Rukert make a defense to the complaint and to the plaintiff\u2019s claim for damages. Rukert filed a motion to vacate the court\u2019s order allowing the impleading, to quash the summons and dismiss the complaint, on the ground that the accident and injuries to the plaintiff occurred while he was performing stevedore services for Rukert aboard a ship in navigable waters; that Rukert had paid him compensation for injuries and provided medical expenses, through its insurance carrier, Pennsylvania Threshermen and Farmers Mutual Casualty Insurance Company, in accordance with the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U. S. C. A. \u00a7 901 <em>et seq., </em>and that by making such provision for compensation to its employee, Rukert was thereby relieved of liability growing out of injuries to the plaintiff, not only to its employee, the plaintiff, but also to any third party. Upon hearing, this motion was granted, and judgment for costs entered in favor of Rukert. The appeal is from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">We may assume, for the purposes of this appeal, that the allegations of the declaration describe a maritime tort. There has been no demurrer to the declaration or complaint and the employer\u2019s motion to dismiss the third party complaint would seem to concede the point, since it relies upon the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, which would be inapplicable to a non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>maritime tort. If the nature of the tort should become material in later stages of the case, we leave the question open.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">The common law courts of a state have jurisdiction to entertain an action arising from a maritime tort, under that clause of the Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C. A. \u00a7 371,1 \u201csaving to suitors in all cases the right of a common-law remedy where the common law is competent to give it * * From a procedural point of view, the Maryland courts afford an adequate remedy for the recovery of damages, and a comprehensive third party practice. General Rules of Practice and Procedure, part two, subd. Ill, Third Party Practice, Rule 4, Code 1947 Supp. p. 2042. It is unnecessary to decide to what extent the saving clause of the Judicial Code would permit the state courts to modify or supplement the maritime law by principles derived from the common law or state statutes. Here the question whether the appellee can be brought in as a third party defendant depends upon the construction of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act. In construing that act, we are bound by authoritative construction placed upon it by the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The stevedore\u2019s remedy for compensation against his employer, 33 U. S. C. A. \u00a7 904, is not exclusive of remedies against others. He may elect to proceed against a negligent third party, or, in case he elects to receive compensation, the Longshoremen\u2019s Act provides for assignment of his rights against third persons to his employer, binding the latter to remit to him any excess over the compensation received, including medical expenses. 33 U. S. C. A. \u00a7 933; <em>Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, </em>328 U. S. 85, 102, 66 S. Ct. 872, 90 L. Ed. 1099; <em>Moragnel v. Moore McCormack Lines, </em>D. C. 75 F. Supp. 969; <em>cf. Chapman v. Hoage, </em>296 U. S. 526, 56 S. Ct. 333, 80 L. Ed. 370. There is certainly no suggestion in these provisions that the employer might be made a party defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The pertinent language of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, 33 U. S. C. A. \u00a7 905, provides: \u201cExclusiveness of liability. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>The liability of an employer prescribed in section 904 of this chapter shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer to the employee, his legal representative, husband or wife, parents, dependents, next of kin, and anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages from such employer at law or in admiralty on account of such injury or death * * *.\u201d The appellant does not deny that an employee is prevented by this section from bringing suit against a negligent employer, but contends that the expression \u201canyone otherwise entitled to recover damages from such employer\u201d should be limited to claimants standing in the shoes of the employee or deriving their rights through him. It contends that under the admiralty law the right of a third party complainant to contribution is not derivative, through substitution or subrogation, but an original right arising from the tort itself, citing <em>Erie R. R. v. Erie Transportation Co., </em>204 U. S. 220, 27 S. Ct. 246, 51 L. Ed. 450. Hence it argues that it is not a person \u201cotherwise entitled to recover damages from such employer,\u201d since indemnity or contribution is not \u201cdamages.\u201d The appellee contends that the plain meaning of the language quoted forbids such limitation, and includes all claimants, whether asserting a derivative right or \u201cotherwise.\u201d The appellee further contends that the complaint seeks exoneration or indemnity, and not contribution, and that the necessary effect would be to substitute the employer as the sole person liable, in the teeth of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">On the latter point, it is sufficient to say that although each defendant denies liability and seeks to put the blame upon the other, the pleadings would permit a finding of liability on the part of each. The motion to dismiss seems to assume that this is the case, for it is alleged that \u201cneither the original plaintiff nor the original defendants have any cause of action against the third party defendant or any right of contribution from the third party defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The only case in which the higher federal courts have had to consider the construction of sec. 905 is <em>Porello v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number><em>United States, </em>2 Cir., 153 F. 2d 605; <em>American Stevedores v. Porello, </em>330 U. S. 446, 67 S. Ct. 847, 91 L. Ed. 1011. In that case a stevedore was injured aboard a Navy transport, and brought suit against the United States under the Public Vessels Act, 46 U. S. C. A. \u00a7 781 <em>et seq.; </em>his employer, American Stevedores, Inc., was impleaded. The District Court entered a decree against the United States for damages due to the injury, less a sum received by the libellant as compensation under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, with contribution as to one-half from the employer. It is not clear that the employer\u2019s right to reimbursement from the employee was considered, or how this formula could even operate to put the negligent parties on a parity. On appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said [153 F. 2d 607] : \u201cSince the libellant has no cause of action against his employer, the United States can claim no contribution on the theory of a common liability which it has been compelled to pay.\u201d However, the Court found that the United States was entitled to full indemnity under its contract with the employer. On petition for rehearing, the Court said: \u201cThe petitioner argues that our opinion is erroneous in applying common law principles of contribution to a suit in admiralty in which we have affirmed findings that the libellant\u2019s injury resulted from the concurrent negligence of both the respondent and the impleaded respondent. * * * the point may be considered left open since determination of the right of contribution is not essential to decision as to indemnity under the respondent\u2019s contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Upon <em>certiorari </em>to the Supreme Court, the case was remanded to the District Court, to permit the taking of evidence as to the intention of the parties, as an aid to construction of the indemnity clause in the contract, which the court found to be ambiguous. The Court said [330 U. S. 446, 67 S. Ct. 854] : \u201cFrom the record it is not clear whether the District Court made any finding as to the meaning of the contract. We believe its interpretation should be left in the first instance to that court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>which shall have the benefit of such evidence as there is upon the intention of the parties. If the District Court interprets the contract not to apply to the facts of this case, the court would, of course, be free to adjudge the responsibility of the parties to the contract under applicable rules of admiralty law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">The appellant contends that the sentence last quoted recognizes that there could be a liability on the part of the employer to the third party complainant. We think the contention is unsound. A statement that the court is \u201cfree to adjudge * * * under applicable rules,\u201d does not determine what those rules are, as applied to the facts of the case, but simply leaves the question open, as it was left open by the Circuit Court of Appeals. The appellant contends that District Judge Kirkpatrick, in <em>Coal Operators Casualty Co. v. United States, </em>E. D. D. C. Pa., 76 F. Supp. 681, 683, thought that the Supreme Court \u201cwas remanding the case with instructions and in the sentence quoted was telling the District Judge that, absent the contract of indemnity, he would be free to apply the admiralty rule of contribution.\u201d Feeling bound by this decision, he naturally allowed recovery of contribution against the employer. But his reason for thinking so was that \u201cthe Circuit Court of Appeals had squarely ruled that there could be no contribution and the Supreme Court, although it did not mention the position of the Circuit Court of Appeals, certainly must have intended to overrule it.\u201d The Circuit Court of Appeals did originally take that position, but as pointed out above, modified its opinion to leave the question open, on motion for rehearing. In the more recent case of <em>Johnson v. United, States, </em>D. C. Or. 79 F. Supp. 448, 449, District Judge MeColloch said: \u201cI do not think the Supreme Court\u2019s language in the <em>Por ello </em>case justifies the claim made for it.\u201d He held there could be no contribution from the employer. \u201cTo hold that an employer under a compulsory (as to him) compensation act can be sued indirectly, as proposed here, is like opening a hole in a dike. It destroys the basic principle of compensation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>As well say the employer can be offered to the injured workman as a co-defendant, under Admiralty Rule. 56, 28 U. S. C. A. following section 723. The difference is a matter of words only.\u201d In <em>Frusteri v. United States, </em>E. D. D. C. N. Y., 76 F. Supp. 667, 669, District Judge Inch dismissed a petition impleading an employer, \u201con the ground that owing to * * * having proved that it whs ready, able and willing to pay compensation, under the. Longshoremen\u2019s Act it was not liable to the libellant, in tort, in action in admiralty, for libellant\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">There are, .however, a number of cases in the District Courts where indemnity or contribution has been allowed against an employer. See <em>Rederii v. Jarka Corporation, </em>D. C. Me., 26 F. S. 304; <em>The Tampico, </em>D. C. N. Y., 45 F. Supp. 174; <em>Green v. War Shipping Administration, </em>D. C. N. Y., 66 F. Supp. 393; <em>The S. S. Samovar, </em>D. C. Cal., 72 Supp. 574, 588. The cases in the New York District Courts reach the same results as the New York Court of Appeals' (by a divided court) in construing its Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, McK. Unconsol. Laws, c. 67. <em>Westchester Lighting Co. v. Westchester, </em>278 N. Y. 175, 15 N. E. 2d 567; <em>cf. Burris v. American Chicle, </em>2 Cir., 120 F. 2d 218. The California Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act seems to have been construed to reach the same result as was reached in the <em>Samovar, supra; Baugh v. Rogers, </em>24 Cal. 2d 200, 148 P. 2d 633, 152 A. L. R. 1043, (3 Judges dissenting). We have construed our Compensation Act to prevent recovery for the negligent act of an employer, producing or contributing to an injury, through a third party complaint. <em>Baltimore Transit Company v. State, use Schriefer, </em>183 Md. 674, 682, 39 A. 2d 858, 861, 156 A. L. R. 460. The \u201cprocedural difficulty due to the lack of a comprehensive third-party practice act,\u201d has been remedied by the new rules. But the language quoted was used in discussing the possibility of cutting off \u201cthe employer\u2019s right of reimbursement and to limit the. .recovery of the injured employee against the negligent third party to the excess over and above the compensation payable.\u201d On the question of liability on the part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>employer, after citing cases construing similar statutes in Wisconsin, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and elsewhere, we said: \u201cWe think the weight of authority supports the proposition that the Compensation Law limits the employer\u2019s liability as well as the employee\u2019s recovery. The employer should not be held liable indirectly in an amount that could not be recovered directly, for this would run counter to one of the fundamental purposes of the compensation law,\u201d <em>i. e. </em>that liability for compensation be exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">The appellant stresses the fact that we were dealing, in the <em>Schriefer </em>case, with a right of contribution among joint tort-feasors, which was \u201ca derivative right and not a new cause of action.\u201d The question we were considering was whether the Joint Tort Feasors\u2019 Act, adopted in 1941, Code Supp. 1947, art. 50, 21 <em>et seq., </em>modified the employer\u2019s immunity from suit under the Compensation Act. In the case at bar, the question is whether the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, setting up an employer\u2019s immunity from suit by an employee, or \u201canyone otherwise entitled to recover damages from such employer at law or in admiralty on account of such in jury * * modified the preexisting right to indemnity, or contribution under the admiralty law. We have found no controlling federal decision on the point. Cases construing the Harter Act, 46 U. S. C. A. \u00a7 192, are distinguishable. The <em>Chattahoochee, </em>173 U. S. 540, 19 S. Ct. 491, 43 L. Ed. 801; <em>Erie R. R. v. Erie Transportation Co., supra; Aktieselskabet Cuzco v. The Sucarseco, </em>294 U. S. 394, 55 S. Ct. 467, 79 L. Ed. 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">A different situation would be presented if the employer had undertaken, by agreement, to assume an obligation to indemnify apart from his legal obligation. That was the situation in the <em>Porello </em>case, and some of the other cases cited. Immunity is obviously not of such a character that it cannot be waived. In the absence of waiver, the employer\u2019s conformance with the statute, by providing compensation in all cases regardless of fault, prevents recovery against him on the ground of negligence. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>statute declares his liability for compensation to be exclusive. If it should be construed to preserve his liability, for the payment of a sum measured in whole or in part by the damages sustained by the employee, merely because the negligence of a third party concurred, or is claimed to have concurred, with his own in producing the injury, his liability for compensation would not be exclusive. It is probable that his liability would in most cases exceed the limits set up in the statute. We think it is immaterial whether his liability to a joint tort feasor stems from a statutory right to contribution or from general principles of the admiralty law. In either event it is essentially a liability to pay, or share in the payment of, damages for the injury to his employee, of which the statute relieves him. We think the appellant falls squarely within the definition of \u201canyone otherwise entitled to recover damages from such employer at law or in admiralty on account of such injury.\u201d It follows that his right to indemnity or contribution is foreclosed by the Act, and hence the employer cannot be impleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">In so holding, we do not decide as to the extent of the appellant\u2019s liability, if any. We leave open the question whether the appellant would be entitled to issues or instructions fixing or limiting recovery against it to a proportionate share of the damages, for which it may be found responsible, under the admiralty doctrine of comparative negligence, or otherwise. We also leave open the question as to the employer\u2019s right to reimbursement, if any, out of any damages recovered against appellant, and to what extent that right could be affected by the allowance of a credit for compensation paid. We think the action of the trial court in dismissing the third party complaint was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
