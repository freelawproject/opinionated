He left a will, dated July 22, 1890, and two codicils. The provisions of the codicils are not now material.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">After charitable bequests and provisions for his wife (who renounced) and a brother, he left the residue of his estate in trust, to be divided into four portions, the income of each one fourth portion to be paid to each of his four children, Levi, Joseph, Lillie Fleischmann and Bertha Weiller, for life, each son to have the right to absolute payment, free of trust, of $100,000 out of his portion, to be deducted therefrom. The fourteenth clause then provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">\u201c14th. Immediately upon the death of any of my said children, his or her one fourth portion (less the sum of One hundred thousand dollars, if paid to my sons as aforesaid) shall vest absolutely per stirpes and not per capita in his or her descendants then living, if any, and if no such descendant or descendants be then living, the same, (subject to the provision hereinafter made for the husbands of my said daughters) shall vest absolutely in the survivor or survivors of all of my said children, and the descendant or descendants, if any, of any deceased child or children then living, to be equally divided between them per stirpes but not per capita, and in either of those events, immediately from and after the death of any of my said children, all trusts as to his or her fourth portion shall cease, determine and be executed. <em>Provided, however, that if either of my said daughters should die leaving only one child or descendant living at the time of her death, then only a one-half part of her </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number><em>one fourth- portion shall vest in said child or descendant, and should she die leaving only two children or descendants living at the time of her death, then a two thirds part of her one fourth portion shall vest in said children or descendants, and in either of those events the remainder of her one fourth portion shall vest absolutely in the survivor or survivors of all of my said children, and the descendant or descendants of any deceased child or children, then living to be equally divided between them per stirpes and not per capita.\u201d </em>[Italics supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">All four children survived the testator. Levi died in 1923, leaving one child, Mrs. Gideon, the appellant. Joseph died in 1942 without issue. Mrs. Fleischmann died on January 15, 1948, leaving two sons, Albert and Edwin. Albert then had three children, Edwin two, and both together had seven grandchildren. Mrs. Weiller, who is still living, had two children and three grandchildren. Mrs. Fleischmann\u2019s one-fourth portion with accumulated income, now amounts to approximately $290,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Appellees contend, and the lower court held, that Mrs. Fleischmann left more than \u201ctwo children or descendants living at the time of her death,\u201d therefore the proviso (italicized above) in clause 14th does not affect her portion, and her portion vested one-half in Albert and one-half in Edwin. Appellant contends that, since Mrs. Fleischmann left, as takers, \u201conly two children or descendants living at the time of her death\u201d, therefore under the proviso two-thirds of her portion vested in her sons and the remainder of her portion in the survivor (Mrs. Weiller) of the testator\u2019s children and the descendants of deceased children, then living, including Albert and Edwin, to be equally divided per stirpes. Thus the opposing contentions turn on the construction of the condition in the proviso, viz., \u201cif either of my said daughters should die leaving only one child or descendant living at the time of her death\u201d or \u201cshould she die leaving only two children or descendants living at the time of her death.\u201d The consequent of the condition, viz., \u201cthen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>only a one-half part of her one fourth portion shall vest in said child or descendant\u201d or \u201cthen a two thirds part of her one fourth portion shall vest in said children or descendants,\u201d presents no disputed question of construction affecting the devolution of Mrs. Fleisehmann\u2019s portion. If the condition is not restricted to takers, then it is not applicable to the Fleischmann portion at all and the consequent likewise is not applicable. If the condition is restricted to takers, then the consequent is similarly restricted and is applicable as contended by appellant. The consequent, however, may or may not reflect light on the construction of the condition. Appellant construes \u201cleaving only two children or descendants\u201d as meaning \u201cleaving only two <em>such </em>children or descendants\u201d or \u201cleaving, <em>as takers, </em>only two children or descendants\u201d or \u201cleaving only two children or descendants of <em>deceased children\u201d. </em>Appellees construe these words as meaning \u201cleaving only two <em>efe\u00fc\u00e9^en </em>\u2014 &amp;\u00a5 descendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">If the words of the proviso are susceptible of two constructions, one of which would produce an absurd result and the other would carry out the testator\u2019s intention, the latter construction should be adopted. <em>Cf. Gibbs v. Meredith, </em>187 Md. 566, 570, 51 A. 2d 77. Appellant earnestly argues that the result of the construction below is absurd, that if the amount to be taken is limited by the number not only of takers but also of other descendants who are not takers, then the proviso is \u201cwithout rhyme or reason\u201d and serves no purpose at all; that the unvarying purpose expressed in clause 14th is to make division <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita, </em>and not to classify together any descendants and their living parents <em>(cf. Mazziotte v. Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>180 Md. 48, 50, 23 A. 2d 4), and the words \u201cchildren or descendants\u201d mean only children or descendants of deceased children. Appellees argue that the condition must be strictly construed to avoid divesting vested, but defeasible, remainders in Albert and Edwin, or repugnancy between the clause and the proviso, and even suggest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>that in case of such repugnancy the proviso may be void. For essentially the same reason, neither of these opposing arguments is decisive. There can be no \u201crepugnancy\u201d between the proviso and the clause or the purpose of the clause. The proviso is part of the clause, not foreign to it. The purpose of the proviso is to change the effect of the rest of the clause by carving out an exception for different treatment. The question is how large an exception is carved out. Conceivably a testator may decrease the amount of a distributive share in the event of a small number of either <em>(a) </em>takers or <em>(b) </em>other descendants who may be dependents of takers, are potential future takers from first takers, and were alternative contingent takers in a contingency which did not occur, or (c) both. This much at least is clearly illustrated in <em>Appeal of Barry, </em>10 A. 126, 6 Pennsylvania Supreme Court Cases (Saddler) 132, though the exact scope of that desicion is not clear, because some of the provisions of the will which are referred to in the opinions are not set out in the report of the case. Likewise, when this testator said \u201cchildren or descendants,\u201d without words (used elsewhere) of division <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita, </em>he may have meant something different from \u201cchildren or descendants of deceased children\u201d (also used elsewhere), or from division <em>per stirpes </em>and <em>not per capita. </em>Nor are vested remainders (if any) in Albert and Edwin material to the question now presented. Provision that immediately upon the death of the life tenant the corpus \u201cshall <em>vest </em>absolutely in her descendants <em>then living\u201d </em>seems unequivocally to create a contingent remainder. <em>Evans v. Safe Deposit and Trust Company, </em>190 Md. 332, 338-341, 58 A. 2d 649, 652, 653. The word \u201cvested\u201d is, however, sometimes used with the secondary meaning of \u201ctransmissible,\u201d <em>e. g., </em>a vested interest in a contingent remainder or executory devise. <em>Reese v. Reese, [Chism v. Reese], </em>190 Md. 311, 320, 58 A. 2d 643, 647; <em>Hans v. Safe Deposit and Trust Co., </em>178 Md. 52, 62, 12 A. 2d <em>208; Evans v. Safe Deposit and Trust Company, supra. </em>If in this secondary sense Albert and Edwin had vested interests during their mother\u2019s life, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>this circumstance is not now material. The question is the <em>quantum </em>of their interests, not whether their interests were vested or in what sense they were vested.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The <em>residuum </em>of these arguments of appellees is: it is clear that, without the proviso, clause 14th would give Albert and Edwin the whole of their mother\u2019s portion, and it is not clear that the condition \u201cshould she die leaving only two children or descendants living at the time of her death\u201d is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">If we seek \u201cfrom the four corners of the will\u201d the intention of the testator, we get no further than the words of the proviso. \u201c* * * should she die leaving only two children or descendants living at the time of her death, then a two thirds part of her * * * portion shall vest in <em>said </em>children or descendants, * * Appellant says the \u201cchildren or descendants\u201d in the condition therefore are (1) the same as the takers under the proviso and (2) are only \u201cchildren or descendants of deceased children.\u201d But assuming the first conclusion to be correct, the second would not necessarily follow. The result might be the opposite, <em>viz., </em>that should she leave <em>any </em>two, but only two, descendants, <em>said </em>descendants shall take the two thirds per capita. Assuming, without deciding, that the latter is the true construction of the proviso, it would follow that if the only descendants Mrs. Fleischmann left had been one son and one descendant of that son, the descendant and the living parent would have shared equally two thirds of the Fleischmann portion. This may seem anomalous, but almost any exception to a uniform equal provision for \u201cdescendants then living, <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita,\u201d </em>based either on number of all descendants or on number of descendants who are takers, involves anomalies. The more the class of \u201cchildren or descendants\u201d in the condition is narrowed, the more the scope of the proviso is broadened and the more the anomalies and the more anomalous they are. Under appellant\u2019s construction the share of Albert and Edwin, who had twelve children and grandchildren, would be diminished in favor of appellant, an only child, even if she had had no descendants at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>all; if one of the Fleischmanns had never had any children, the death of the other before his mother would have increased by 50 per cent, the share not only of his own descendants but also of his childless brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The technical words in the proviso must be given their technical meaning, not only because the will obviously was drawn by an experienced lawyer, but also because they happen to be words which have no other meaning. The question is, not what any single word means, but how all shall be construed in connection with their context. Unlike \u201cissue,\u201d \u201cdescendants\u201d ordinarily is a word of fixed meaning and is all-comprehensive. <em>Levering v. Orrick, </em>97 Md. 139, 145, 54 A. 620; <em>Mazziotte v. Safe Deposit and Trust Company, supra. </em>We are not persuaded that the condition should be restricted to \u201cchildren or descendants of deceased children.\u201d The results of the more literal construction, we think, are more reasonable \u2014 or less unreasonable \u2014 than the results of appellant\u2019s construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed, costs to be paid out of the trust estate.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
