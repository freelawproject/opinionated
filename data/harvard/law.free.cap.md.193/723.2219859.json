He was represented by counsel duly appointed by the court. He complains that he was \u201cunder the impression that he was being held only as a material witness,\u201d and not informed of the charge until the day before the trial. He does not allege, however, that his counsel was not appointed in sufficient time to prepare the case for trial. He complains that his counsel did not \u201chave the petitioner\u2019s interest at heart\u201d and was incompetent; and that certain witnesses, whose names petitioner gave to the sheriff, were not summoned. But it does not appear that he made any complaint to the court about the lawyer who appeared for him, or sought postponement of the trial. <em>Cf. Loughran v. Warden, </em>192 Md. 719, 725, 64 A. 2d 712, 715. We agree with the conclusion of the trial judge that there is no \u201cbasis for the contention that he was not given a fair trial or was deprived of his constitutional rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">\n<em>Application denied, without costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
