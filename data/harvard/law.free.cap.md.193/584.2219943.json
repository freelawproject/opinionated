Athletic Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>mission. By the lease lessor lets to plaintiff and plaintiff leases and takes from lessor all the premises known as the Coliseum Arena, \u201ctogether with the equipment in the Arena necessary to conduct professional boxing bouts, such as bleacher seats, chairs and boxing ring, for the exclusive use and possession\u201d by plaintiff, of the Arena on Monday night of each week, from 7 p. m. to 1 a. m., for a term of five years to begin April 7, 1946 and to end April 7, 1951, \u201cat the following rental\u201d which plaintiff covenants to pay: Five per cent of \u201cthe gross receipts accruing from all professional boxing bouts, contests and exhibitions\u201d, less all taxes, present or future, \u201cimmediately after the computation of the amounts\u201d each Monday night, with the privilege to plaintiff \u201cto use the box office\u201d in the afternoon from \u201cnoon and upwards\u201d when called for by plaintiff. Lessor will not lease the Arena to anyone else \u201cto stage and promote professional boxing bouts\u201d at any time during the term of the lease. If \u201cthe percentage of the rent receipts\u201d shall amount to less than $75 for any Monday night, plaintiff will pay lessor the difference. Should plaintiff \u201ccall off any scheduled boxing bout\u201d before the day of the bout, no charge will be made by lessor to plaintiff; should plaintiff call it off on \u201cthe day of the fight\u201d up until 6 p. m., plaintiff will pay lessor $50, if after 6 p. m. $75. Plaintiff will not during the term of the lease stage or promote any professional boxing contest in Baltimore elsewhere than at the Coliseum, except one such contest during any fiscial year, for which plaintiff will pay lessor 2^ per cent of its gross receipts, less taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Lessor will keep the cooling system in operation and furnish heat, will furnish chairs and bleacher seats, and \u201cthe present regulation size boxing ring\u201d with lights in the entire building and over the ring, \u201cwill keep the inside of the Coliseum Arena clear of all debris and fit for the purpose intended\u201d, chairs are to be placed by lessor in their proper location, to be \u201cfit for the use intended\u201d and to be \u201cdusted and made reasonably fit for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>use\u201d by lessor before 8 p. m., the opening for the seating of patrons. Lessor is to furnish hot water for showers and to keep all the plumbing and toilets in condition for use by patrons.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Paragraph 6 provides: \u201cThe Landlord agrees to allow the Tenant or its agent, the privilege of broadcasting the boxing bouts and also allows the tenant, or its agent, to install Western Union wires direct to the ring. The Landlord agrees to furnish a reasonably adequate loudspeaker for the purpose of announcing the various fights during the course of the evening\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Should plaintiff fail for four consecutive Monday nights to stage a contest, lessor has an option to cancel the lease. Plaintiff, unless, otherwise ordered by the State Athletic Commission, will have, at each show, at least one ten-minute intermission \u201cjust prior to the main bout\u201d. \u201c* * * all rights and concessions for the sale or distribution of food and beverages\u201d are reserved to lessor, and lessor, \u201cits vendors, employees and agents may conduct said business and sell and dispense food and beverages during the hours of tenancy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">By an agreement contemporaneous with the lease, plaintiff agreed with three individuals to pay them, for services in procuring the lease, five per cent of \u201cthe gross receipts accruing from all professional boxing bouts, contests and exhibitions\u201d, less taxes. Thus ten per cent in the aggregate was payable by plaintiff under the two contracts. Defendants are successors in interest to both lessor and these individuals, and in these capacities receive ten per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The current lease of April, 1943 was preceded by a similar five-year lease, dated April 1, 1941, between the same parties, which contained the same provision, above quoted, for \u201cthe privilege of broadcasting\u201d and allowing plaintiff \u201cto install Western Union wires direct to the ring.\u201d In October, 1947 lessor was dissolved and by a liquidating dividend distributed its assets, including the current lease, to defendants, who were the owners of all its capital stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>During 1945 plaintiff \u201cbroadcasted boxing bouts over the entire United States under the sponsorship\u201d of a hat manufacturer, which paid plaintiff a sum varying between $1000 and $1250 each week for ten consecutive weeks. Plaintiff also \u201cconducted a world\u2019s championship boxing match and exercised the privilege of having sports writers from the leading newspapers of the country telegraph the blow-by-blow description to their various home papers * * * in the various large cities of the United States\u201d. The bill alleges that: \u201cRecently the art of broadcasting has developed to a point where, by the improved use of electric pulsations or * * * waves, the broadcasters not only can transmit sound but also can transmit sight, that is, transmit visually the fight itself within a limited radius.\u201d In short, television has become commercially practicable. Plaintiff \u201cis in a position to have the boxing bouts broadcasted by television\u201d, but defendants refuse to permit plaintiff \u201cto broadcast the boxing bouts by television\u201d. Plaintiff has never included its receipts from broadcasting in the computation of percentages, payable by it under the two agreements, of \u201cthe gross receipts accruing from all professional boxing bouts, contests and exhibitions\u201d. Defendants do not concede that such receipts need not be included in such computation.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The question presented is whether, by the true construction of the lease of October, 1943, plaintiff has \u201cthe privilege of broadcasting the boxing bouts\u201d by television. What does the word \u201cbroadcast\u201d mean in this context?</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In 1888 the verb \u201cbroadcast\u201d was defined: \u201c1. To scatter (seed, etc.) abroad with the hand. [Use in 1813 quoted.] 2. fig. To scatter or disseminate widely. [\u201cThe * * * doctrine * * * has been broad-cast.\u201d 1829.]\u201d Oxford Dictionary. By 1933 it had acquired another more specific meaning: \u201c3. To disseminate (a message, news, a musical performance, or any audible matter) from a wireless transmitting station to the receiving sets of the listeners. [Uses in 1921, 1922, 1923 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>and 1924 quoted.]\u201d Oxford Dictionary, 1933 Supplement. Substantially the same literal, figurative and specific meanings are given in more recent dictionaries. <em>Cf. </em>The New Century Dictionary (1936); Funk and Wagnalls\u2019 New Standard Dictionary (1949); Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary (1936, 1946) ; Webster\u2019s International Dictionary (1943); American College Dictionary (1947). Webster\u2019s adds a specific meaning (to plow in a certain way) with reference to agriculture. In the American College Dictionary the radio meaning is the one first mentioned. We have been referred to no definition, and have found none, of \u201cbroadcast\u201d as meaning to transmit by television. The Standard so defines \u201ctelevise\u201d and \u201ctelecast\u201d, which in the American College is defined as meaning to broadcast by television. Doubtless the word \u201cbroadcast\u201d, in its general figurative sense or in its specific radio sense, figuratively used, can, with a limiting context (e. <em>g., </em>\u201cbroadcast by television\u201d), be applied to television. It may often have been said, with reference to telegraph or newspapers, that news, gossip, a baseball game or a prize-fight was broadcasted, or with reference to a loudspeaker or amplifier, that a speech was broadcasted. The parties to the lease now in question, who were engaged in the boxing industry, not in radio or television science, art or business, did not indulge in figures of speech or in coining new words or new uses of old words. They contracted specifically \u201cto furnish a reasonably adequate loudspeaker\u201d for announcing fights, to allow plaintiff \u201cto install Western Union wires direct to the ring\u201d, and to allow plaintiff \u201cthe privilege of broadcasting the boxing bouts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">\u201cAs of January 1, 1942, there were 9 commercial television stations and 23 experimental television stations licensed.\u201d Federal Communications Commission Mimeograph No. 57,820. <em>Warner, Radio and Television Law, </em>sec. 72 (b) p. 644. In <em>Norman v. City of Las Vegas, </em>1947, 64 Nev. 38, 177 P. 2d 442, 450, a case not similar to the instant case, the court, referring to the word \u201cdisseminate\u201d, said, \u201cThe word creates the same picture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>as \u2018broadcast\u2019, which Webster defines as \u2018to disseminate widely\u2019, and whose present popular meaning is identified with radio, which disseminates information to the four corners of the earth.\u201d In April, 1941 or April, 1943 \u2014 or now \u2014 the only ordinary meaning of \u201cthe privilege of broadcasting the boxing bouts\u201d that has any commercial application at all has reference to radio and not to television.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Plaintiff contends, and the lower court apparently holds, that for each of two reasons plaintiff has the right to transmit its boxing bouts by television: 1. That radio and television operate on the same scientific principle, differ only in details, are two means to one end, and the \u201cprivilege of broadcasting\u201d should therefore be construed broadly as including the end by either means and should not be restricted to one means. 2. That if the \u201cprivilege of broadcasting\u201d does not include television, then \u201cthe exclusive use and possession\u201d of the property leased, independent of paragraph 6, includes all uses not expressly reserved to lessor, and therefore includes both radio and television. We are unable to concur in either of these views.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">1. We cannot accept either the premises or the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s first contention. Construction of a contract depends upon the intention of the parties as expressed in the contract. When in plain unambiguous words the parties contract for a specific instrumentality, the courts may not speculate about an ulterior scientific purpose or end and broaden the words of the contract so as to cover different means to the supposed end. The unambiguous words of this boxing contract cover radio and not television. Moreover, even if the contract did contain both general and specific words which left room for construction as to whether the specific should prevail over the general, <em>cf. Maguire v. State, </em>192 Md. 615, 65 A. 2d 299, or vice versa, <em>cf. Warren v. Fitzgerald, </em>189 Md. 476, 486-487, 56 A. 2d 827, 831-832, it would not necessarily follow that because the parties bargained for the actuality of radio rights, they also intended to bar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>gain for the unknown possibilities of commercially non-existing television rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Plaintiff relies upon <em>Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Co. v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Telegraph Co., </em>66 Md. 399, 7 A. 809, 59 Am. Rep. 167, in which it was held that a \u201ctelegraph company\u201d incorporated under the general incorporation law of 1868 (before the telephone was invented) was authorized to do a general telephone business and was subject to the regulatory provisions of the general incorporation law applicable to telegraph companies. In that case this court said: \u201cBut it is clear, if we take the term \u2018telegraph\u2019 to mean and include any apparatus or adjustment of instruments for transmitting messages or other communications by means of electric currents and signals, that term is comprehensive enough to embrace the telephone. And that the telephone is so embraced within the definition of the telegraph has been expressly decided in England, after the most careful analysis and comparison of the different instrumentalities, and the manner of using them, in the two systems. <em>Att\u2019y-Gen. v. Telph. Co. </em>6 Q. B. Div. 244.\u201d 66 Md. 410, 7 A. 810. This definition of \u201ctelegraph\u201d was, in the English case cited, a statutory definition in an act of 1869 which gave the Postmaster General the exclusive privilege of transmitting telegrams. In the English case, however, the court also said, \u201cThis view does no violence to the common use of language\u201d (6 Q. B. D. 249), citing Webster\u2019s Dictionary (1856), and use by Thomas A. Edison of \u201ctelegraph\u201d as including telephone. Before arrival of the Morse electric telegraph, the word \u201ctelegraph\u201d had been in use for half a century and had had the general meaning (which has now disappeared) of an apparatus for transmitting messages to a distance, usually by signals of some kind [visible or audible, <em>e. g. </em>the semaphore]. This Maryland case and this English case, and several others construing state telegraph statutes as applicable to telephone, were distinguished in <em>Richmond v. Southern Bell Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>1897, 174 U. S. 761, 773-776, 19 S. Ct. 778, 781, 43 L. Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>1162, in which it was held that the act of Congress of 1866, which gave telegraph companies the right to operate \u201clines of telegraph\u201d over post roads of the United States, had no application to telephone companies, whose business is that of \u201celectrically transmitting, or receiving articulate speech\u201d, and that, \u201cIt is not the function of the judiciary, because of discoveries after the act of 1866, to broaden the provisions of that act so that it will include corporations or companies that were not, and could not have been at that time, within the contemplation of congress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">When the public policy underlying a statute, or the purpose of a private contract, requires that future acquisitions or discoveries be covered, it is common practice to do so by use of appropriate language, <em>e. g., </em>in bond mortgages covering after-acquired property or in patent licenses covering future improvements. By a statutory definition of \u201cradio communication\u201d as including \u201cthe transmission by radio of * * * pictures, and sounds of all kinds\u201d television is covered by the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U. S. C. A. \u00a7 153 (6), as it was by the former Radio Act of 1927, 44 Stat. 1162. In case of ambiguity such a policy in a statute is more readily found than such a purpose in a private contract. In <em>Kalem Co. v. Harper Bros., </em>222 U. S. 55, 32 S. Ct. 20, 56 L. Ed. 92, Ann. Cas. 1913a, 1285, it was held that a moving picture of \u201cBen Hur\u201d is a dramatization of it and therefore an infringement of the copyright of the novel. When the novel was copyrighted, moving pictures were unknown. The opinion, by Mr. Justice Holmes, remarks that pantomime is undeniably drama and would be none the less so if exhibited by mirrors and not by direct vision. On the other hand, in <em>Manners v. Morosco, </em>252 U. S. 317, 40 S. Ct. 335, 64 L. Ed. 590, (opinion also by Mr. Justice Holmes), it was held that a grant, by contract in 1912 (when moving pictures were a familiar mode of representation), of \u201cthe sole and exclusive license and liberty to produce, perform and represent\u201d a copyrighted play, did not, in the light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>the context, give moving picture rights, but only the right of regular stage performance. In <em>Kirkle La, Shelle Co. v. Paul Armstrong Co., </em>263 N. Y. 79, 188 N. E. 163, 165, by a contract made when \u201ctalkies\u201d were unknown, the plaintiff acquired an interest in the profits from production of a copyrighted play and a right to have all contracts affecting the dramatic rights \u201c(exclusive of motion picture rights)\u201d submitted to him for approval. It was held that \u201ctalkie\u201d rights could not be said to be within the contemplation of the parties either as a subject for the transfer of an interest therein or as included in the \u201cmotion picture rights\u201d specifically excepted. <em>Contra, </em>in <em>L. C. Page &amp; Co., Inc. v. Fox Film Corporation, </em>2 Cir., 83 F. 2d 196, 199, it was held that a grant by contract, when \u201ctalkies\u201d were not commercially known, of \u201cthe exclusive moving picture rights\u201d in a copyrighted novel, included \u201ctalkie rights\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">In the instant case, to repeat, \u201cthe privilege of broadcasting boxing bouts\u201d did not in 1941 or 1943 \u2014 and does not now \u2014 include television.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">2. Defendants contend \u2014 and plaintiff denies \u2014 that the \u201clease\u201d in question is not really a lease, but is only a license to make occasional, non-continuous use of the premises for limited purposes. These opposing contentions, which might be material in a suit by a stranger <em>(e. g., </em>for negligence with respect to use or condition of the premises), are immaterial as between the parties to the contract and involve inverted reasoning. Whether the contract is a lease or a license depends upon the intention of the parties; it is not a guide to ascertaining their intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">We agree with defendants that the provision in the lease for \u201cexclusive use and possession\u201d by plaintiff is so qualified (not to say contradicted) by other provisions (quoted or mentioned above) that plaintiff has \u201cexclusive use and possession\u201d only for the limited \u201cpurpose and use intended\u201d, <em>viz. </em>\u201cpromotion and staging of boxing bouts\u201d, and subject to concurrent use and possession by lessor for the exercise and performance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>of its own rights and obligations under the contract, including the \u201cbusiness\u201d of \u201csale or distribution of food and beverages\u201d. Any residuum of plaintiff\u2019s \u201cexclusive use and possession\u201d, over and above conduct of its boxing business, is less than nil. Moreover, express provision in paragraph 6 for \u201cbroadcasting\u201d by radio, newspaper and loudspeaker would be useless and meaningless if plaintiff\u2019s \u201cexclusive use and possession\u201d included all radio, television and other \u201cbroadcasting\u201d rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">Plaintiff and the lower court say that under the lease either plaintiff or defendants must have television rights, and if defendants have them, they may be exercised to the destruction or damage of plaintiff\u2019s radio rights. This does not follow. It has been held in analogous cases that there is an implied obligation on the part of a grantor not to exercise ungranted rights to the detriment of granted rights. <em>Manners v. Morosco, supra </em>(holding that a copyright owner could not exercise ungranted moving picture rights without the consent of his grantee of dramatic rights) ; <em>Kirke La Shelle Co. v. Paul Armstrong Co., supra </em>(holding that a grantor of an interest in dramatic rights could not dispose of ungranted \u201ctalkie\u201d rights without accounting for the proceeds with his grantee).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">In the instant case, to paraphrase Judge Hough\u2019s language in <em>Harper Bros. v. Klaw, </em>D. C. 232 F. 609, the result is that neither party to the lease can \u201cbroadcast\u201d the boxing bouts by television except by bargain with the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">\n<em>Decree reversed and bill dismissed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
