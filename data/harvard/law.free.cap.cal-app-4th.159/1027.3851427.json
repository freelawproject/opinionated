Plaintiffs sued Timo, the magazine, and its publisher for a variety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>of tort and contract claims, including breach of employment contract and defamation. The trial court struck the entire complaint pursuant to the anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuit against public participation) statute, Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We find that the anti-SLAPP motion was properly granted, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">Timo ceased working for the company in 2005. Subsequently, he gave an interview to the magazine, then owned by defendant A-Lehdet (the publisher). The magazine published an article based on the interview in June 2005 (the June 2005 article). In it, Timo claimed that while working for the company, he \u201c \u2018slaved . . . without a break,\u2019 \u201d endured \u201c \u2018pestering/taunting round the clock,\u2019 \u201d had to \u201c \u2018slave/drudge almost without a break the whole time,\u2019 \u201d and felt himself \u201c \u2018used.\u2019 \u201d Further, he said, Nyg\u00e1rd wanted him to \u201c \u2018work round the clock,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018keeps an eye on his workers like a hawk,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018didn\u2019t want to let his employees to even go and see a doctor\u2019 \u201d when injured. Finally, he revealed that dancer Aira Suvio-Samulin and her granddaughters were Christmas guests in Nyg\u00e1rd\u2019s home in the Cayman Islands.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">On October 26, 2005, the company filed a complaint against Timo, the magazine, and the publisher for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, intentional interference with contract, breach of the duty of loyalty, and defamation. The complaint alleged that Timo intentionally revealed the company\u2019s confidential information in violation of express and implied contractual duties; that Timo and the magazine made false and disparaging statements about the company that exposed it to \u201chatred, contempt, ridicule, and obloquy\u201d; and that the magazine interfered with the contractual relationship between Timo and the company by \u201csoliciting [the company\u2019s] confidential information in order to defame and otherwise damage [the company].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">Timo, the magazine, and the publisher (collectively, defendants) filed anti-SLAPP motions to strike the complaint pursuant to section 425.16 on June 26, 2006. They contended that the June 2005 article concerned public figures and addressed issues of public interest; there was no evidence that the statements were false or were made with actual malice; neither the confidentiality agreement executed between Timo and the company, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, nor the duty of loyalty prevented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>Timo from speaking about the company\u2019s working conditions; and there was no evidence that the publisher knew about the confidentiality agreement when it published the article. Thus, they asserted, the complaint should be stricken under the anti-SLAPP statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">The court granted the motions to strike on July 19, 2006. According to the court, in resolving a special motion to strike, \u201cthe trial court must engage in a two-step analysis: first, has the defendant shown that the challenged causes of action arise from, <em>e.g., </em>\u2018free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,\u2019 and second, has the plaintiff demonstrated that it can probably prevail on the claim.\u201d The court found that defendants met the first prong of the test because their evidence showed that the company and its founder, Nyg\u00e1rd, \u201care internationally known public figures who spend a great deal of money and effort to promote their business, success, wealth and lifestyle.\u201d Further, plaintiffs employ over 12,000 employees worldwide. Thus, the court said, the statements made by Timo and published by the magazine involved highly visible public figures and issues of public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">Accordingly, the court said, the burden shifted to plaintiffs to show that they would probably prevail at trial on their various causes of action. The court concluded that plaintiffs failed to meet their burden. First, while plaintiffs\u2019 declarations characterized some of Timo\u2019s statements as \u201cinaccurate,\u201d \u201cwhat they really provide is the individual employment experience of these four employees and their opinions about Nyg\u00e1rd\u2019s working conditions. These different personal experiences do not render Timo\u2019s statements false or defamatory.\u201d Second, plaintiffs\u2019 declarations failed to establish actual malice as required to prevail in a defamation cause of action against a public figure. Third, the court concluded that plaintiffs could not establish their causes of action for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, or breach of the duty of loyalty because Labor Code section 232.5 prohibits employers from requiring employees to \u201crefrain from disclosing information about the employer\u2019s working conditions.\u201d Thus, regardless of the terms of Timo\u2019s employment contract, Timo was free to speak about his working conditions. Finally, plaintiffs\u2019 evidence did not even attempt to show that plaintiffs could probably prevail on their claim of intentional interference by the publisher and the magazine.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>Defendants served notice of ruling on the anti-SLAPP motions on July 27, 2006. Plaintiffs timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">I. <em>The Anti-SLAPP Statute and the Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">A special motion to strike under section 425.16\u2014the so-called antiSLAPP statute\u2014allows a defendant to seek early dismissal of a lawsuit that qualifies as a SLAPP. \u201cSLAPP is an acronym for \u2018strategic lawsuit against public participation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Jarrow Formulas, Inc. </em>v. <em>LaMarche </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 728, 732, fn. 1 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 636, 74 P.3d 737].) A SLAPP is \u201c[a] cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) Such an act includes \u201c(1) any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law; (2) any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding authorized by law; (3) any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest; (4) or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">A SLAPP is subject to a special motion to strike \u201cunless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) Thus, evaluation of an anti-SLAPP motion requires a two-step process in the trial court. \u201cFirst, the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one \u2018arising from\u2019 protected activity. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) If the court finds such a showing has been made, it then must consider whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.\u201d <em>(City of Cotati v. Cashman </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 69, 76 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 519, 52 P.3d 695]; see <em>Kronemyer v. Internet Movie Database Inc. </em>(2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 941, 946 [59 Cal.Rptr.3d 48].) \u201cOnly a cause of action that satisfies <em>both </em>prongs of the anti-SLAPP statute\u2014i.e., that arises from protected speech or petitioning <em>and </em>lacks even minimal merit\u2014is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>SLAPP, subject to being stricken under the statute.\u201d <em>(Navellier </em>v. <em>Sletten </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 89 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 530, 52 P.3d 703].)</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">\u201cReview of an order granting or denying a motion to strike under section 425.16 is de novo. <em>(Sylmar Air Conditioning v. Pueblo Contracting Services, Inc. </em>(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1049, 1056 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 882].) We consider \u2018the pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits . . . upon which the liability or defense is based.\u2019 (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(2).) However, we neither \u2018weigh credibility [nor] compare the weight of the evidence. Rather, [we] accept as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff [citation] and evaluate the defendant\u2019s evidence only to determine if it has defeated that submitted by the plaintiff as a matter of law.\u2019 <em>(HMS Capital, Inc. v. Lawyers Title Co. </em>(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 204, 212 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 786].)\u201d <em>(Soukup v. Law Offices of Herbert Hafif </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 260, 269, fn. 3 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 638, 139 P.3d 30]; see <em>Kronemyer v. Internet Movie Database Inc., supra, </em>150 Cal.App.4th at p. 946.)</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">II. <em>Protected Activity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">As we have noted, the defendant in an alleged SLAPP suit bears the initial burden of showing that the suit falls within the class of suits subject to a motion to strike under section 425.16. <em>(Fox Searchlight Pictures, Inc. v. Paladino </em>(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 294, 304 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 906].) A defendant meets this burden by showing that the acts underlying the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action fall within one of the four categories of conduct described in section 425.16, subdivision (e). <em>(Siam v. Kizilbash </em>(2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1563, 1569 [31 Cal.Rptr.3d 368].)</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the statements at issue in this case come within section 425.16, subdivision (e)(3)\u2014i.e., they are \u201cwritten or oral statements] or writingfs] made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court properly found that this suit arose out of activity protected by the anti-SLAPP statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">A. <em>Public Forum</em></p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">To be protected by section 425.16, subdivision (e)(3), the statements on which a suit is based must have been made \u201cin a place open to the public or a public forum.\u201d A \u201cpublic forum\u201d traditionally has been defined as a place that is open to the public where information is freely exchanged. <em>(Clark </em>v. <em>Burleigh </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 474, 482 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 455, 841 P.2d 975]; <em>Damon v. Ocean Hills Journalism Club </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 468, 475 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 205].)</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>The Courts of Appeal have disagreed whether a newspaper or magazine is a \u201cpublic forum\u201d within the meaning of section 425.16, subdivision (e)(3). <em>Lafayette Morehouse, Inc. v. Chronicle Publishing Co. </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 855 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 46] <em>(Lafayette </em>Morehouse) is typical of the cases that have held that newspapers and magazines are not public fora. There, the court explained that newspapers are not public fora because members of the public cannot freely publish their opinions in them: \u201cNo authorities have been cited to us holding a newspaper printing allegedly libelous material is a \u2018place open to the public or a public forum.\u2019 Newspaper editors or publishers customarily retain the final authority on what their newspapers will publish in letters to the editor, editorial pages, and even news articles, resulting at best in a controlled forum not an uninhibited \u2018public forum.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 863, fn. 5.) <em>Weinberg v. Feisel </em>(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1122, 1130 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 385] <em>(Weinberg) </em>reached a similar result, concluding that \u201cMeans of communication where access is selective, such as most newspapers, newsletters, and other media outlets, are not public forums.\u201d (See also <em>Zhao v. Wong </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1114, 1131 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 909], disapproved on other grounds in <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Eden Council for Hope &amp; Opportunity </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1106, 1124 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 471, 969 P.2d 564] [adopting <em>Lafayette Morehouse </em>analysis].)</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">Other courts have disagreed, concluding that newspapers and magazines are public fora because the opinions they express are readily available to members of the public and contribute to the public debate. In <em>Damon v. Ocean Hills Journalism Club, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th 468, 476-477, for example, the court held that the Village Voice, a homeowners association newsletter, was a public forum: \u201cThe Village Voice was a public forum in the sense that it was a vehicle for communicating a message about public matters to a large and interested community. All interested parties had full opportunity to read the articles in the newsletter. Although the Village Voice newsletter may not have offered a \u2018balanced\u2019 view, the Association\u2019s other newsletter\u2014the Board\u2019s official newsletter\u2014was the place where Association members with differing viewpoints could express their opposing views. It is in this marketplace of ideas that the Village Voice served a very public communicative purpose promoting open discussion\u2014a purpose analogous to a public forum. Given the mandate that we broadly construe the anti-SLAPP statute, a single publication does not lose its \u2018public forum\u2019 character merely because it does not provide a balanced point of view.\u201d (See also <em>Annette F. v. Sharon S. </em>(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1146, 1161 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 100] [letter to editor published in Gay and Lesbian Times was made in a public forum: \u201cThis court has concluded that a news publication is a \u2018public forum\u2019 within the meaning of the anti-SLAPP statute if it is a vehicle for discussion of public issues and it is distributed to a large and interested community.\u201d]; <em>Wilbanks v. Wolk </em>(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 883, 896-897 [7 Cal.Rptr.3d 497] [single-source Web site <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>was a public forum: \u201cIn our view, whether a statement is \u2018made in a place open to the public or in a public forum\u2019 depends on whether the means of communicating the statement permits open debate. We agree that [defendant\u2019s] Web site\u2014and most newspapers\u2014are not public forums in and of themselves. It does not follow, however, that statements made on a Web site or in a newspaper are not made in a public forum. Where the newspaper is but one source of information on an issue, and other sources are easily accessible to interested persons, the newspaper is but one source of information in a larger public forum.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">We conclude that newspapers and magazines are public fora within the meaning of section 425.16, subdivision (e)(3). As an initial matter, we note that subdivision (e)(3) provides that a written statement is within the anti-SLAPP statute if it is made <em>either </em>in \u201ca place open to the public\u201d <em>or </em>\u201ca public forum.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (e)(3).)  Under well-established principles of statutory construction, we must \u201c \u2018accord[] significance, if possible, to every word, phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Y.R. </em>(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 99, 109 [60 CAl. Rptr. 3d 820], quoting <em>Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1386-1387 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323]), avoiding an interpretation that \u201c \u2018 \u201crenders a part of the statute . . . \u2018surplusage\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Chaffee v. San Francisco Public Library Com. </em>(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 109, 114 [36 Cal.Rptr.3d 1]). Accordingly, a \u201cpublic forum\u201d cannot be synonymous with \u201ca place open to the public\u201d\u2014if it were, the Legislature would not have defined the categories of protected speech in the disjunctive.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">Moreover, nearly all publicly available written communication traditionally has been made in fora that are subject to editorial control and, thus, would not come within the narrow definition of \u201cpublic forum\u201d articulated in <em>Lafayette Morehouse </em>and <em>Weinberg. </em>Indeed, most non-Intemet-based forms of public communication, including newspapers, magazines, pamphlets, and leaflets, are subject to some form of editorial control. Nothing in the language of the statute or its legislative history suggests that the Legislature intended to exclude this large category of traditional print media from anti-SLAPP protection. Thus, we agree with the court in <em>Damon v. Ocean Hills Journalism Club, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th at pages 476-477, that a broad reading of \u201cpublic forum\u201d \u201ccomports with the fundamental purpose underlying the anti-SLAPP statute, which seeks to protect against \u2018lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of constitutional rights\u2019 and \u2018abuse of the judicial process ....\u2019(\u00a7 425.16, subd. (a).) This purpose would not be served if we were to construe the statute to make section 425.16, subdivision (e)(3) inapplicable to all newspapers, magazines, and other public media merely because the publication is arguably \u2018one-sided.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>Finally, we note that in the cyber context, our Supreme Court has held that public access, not the right to public <em>comment, </em>is the hallmark of a public forum: \u201cWeb sites accessible to the public ... are \u2018public forums\u2019 for purposes of the anti-SLAPP statute.\u201d <em>(Barrett v. Rosenthal </em>(2006) 40 Cal.4th 33, 41, fn. 4 [51 Cal.Rptr.3d 55, 146 P.3d 510]; see also <em>Wilbanks </em>v. <em>Wolk, supra, </em>121 Cal.App.4th 883, 895, cited with approval by <em>Barrett v. Rosenthal </em>[holding that Web site that did not post information or opinions from other sources was a public forum].) Applying that analysis here compels the conclusion that a newspaper or magazine need not be an <em>open </em>forum to be a <em>public </em>forum\u2014it is enough that it can be purchased and read by members of the public. Accordingly, we conclude the magazine is a \u201cpublic forum\u201d within the meaning of section 425.16, subdivision (e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">B. <em>Issue of Public Interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">To come within section 425.16, a statement must not only be made in a \u201cplace open to the public or a public forum,\u201d it must also be made \u201cin connection with an issue of public interest.\u201d The company concedes that the statute does not define \u201cpublic interest,\u201d but it contends that the phrase\u2019s meaning \u201cis linked to the statute\u2019s purpose of promoting participation in matters of public significance.\u201d Thus, the company suggests, an issue of \u201cpublic interest\u201d includes \u201cgovernment matters and private conduct that affect[s] a community in a manner similar to a government entity,\u201d but excludes \u201ccelebrity gossip.\u201d Defendants disagree; they contend that speech concerns a matter of public interest if, among other things, \u201c \u2018[t]he subject of the statement or activity precipitating the claim was a person or entity in the public eye.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">Section 425.16 does not define \u201cpublic interest,\u201d but its preamble states that its provisions \u201cshall be construed broadly\u201d to safeguard \u201cthe valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (a).) The directive to construe the statute broadly was added in 1997, when the Legislature amended the anti-SLAPP statute \u201cto address recent court cases that have too narrowly construed California\u2019s anti-SLAPP suit statute.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 1296 (1997-1998 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 23, 1997, p. 2.) Specifically, the legislative history of the 1997 amendment notes that it \u201cwas intended specifically to overrule <em>Zhao </em>v. <em>Wong[, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th 1114]\u201d <em>(Briggs v.

The trial court struck the complaint under the anti-SLAPP statute, but the Court of Appeal reversed, concluding that the matters alleged in the complaint did not concern a matter of \u201cpublic interest.\u201d The court explained that the legislative purpose of the anti-SLAPP statute, as expressed in section 425.16, subdivision (a) is to encourage participation in \u201c \u2018matters of public significance.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Zhao, </em>at p. 1120.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That term, the court said, has a narrow meaning, embracing only those matters \u201coccupying \u2018the highest rung of the heirarchy [iic] of First Amendment values,\u2019 that is, to speech pertaining to the exercise of democratic self-government.\u201d <em>(Zhao, </em>at pp. 1120, 1122.) Further, the court said, the Legislature intended the categories of protected activity enumerated in section 425.16, subdivision (e) to be \u201cgoverned by the restricted scope of the statement of legislative purpose in Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (a).\u201d <em>(Zhao, </em>at pp. 1128-1129.) That is, \u201cThe very fact that the Legislature included a precisely drafted statement of legislative purpose in the statute manifests an intent that the application of the statute be governed by this statement of purpose.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1129.) It thus concluded that the present suit did not concern a \u201cpublic issue\u201d: \u201c[T]he question whether the statements concerned a matter of public interest cannot be determined on the basis of media coverage, notoriety or potential newsworthiness. ...[][] The existence of a public issue depends rather on whether the statements possessed the sort of relevance to self-government that places them in a specially protected category of First Amendment values described in <em>Connick </em>v. <em>Myers </em>[(1983)] 461 U.S. [138,] 145 [75 L.Ed.2d 708, 103 S.Ct. 1684], Though the unusual and intriguing circumstances surrounding Tai-Kin Wong\u2019s death and the discovery of a purported holographic will may have been newsworthy, they did not involve a \u2018public issue\u2019 in the sense that we interpret the term.\u201d <em>(Zhao, supra, </em>at pp. 1131-1132.)</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">The court rejected <em>Zhao's </em>narrow interpretation of the anti-SLAPP statute in <em>Braun </em>v. <em>Chronicle Publishing Co., supra, </em>52 Cal.App.4th 1036, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>concluding that the Legislature had intended a much more expansive definition of \u201cpublic issue.\u201d There, a University of California medical director sued a newspaper and others for defamation after the newspaper published articles discussing an investigative audit of the medical center that disclosed mismanagement and other improprieties. The trial court struck the complaint under the anti-SLAPP statute and the Court of Appeal affirmed. It explained that <em>Zhao </em>had erred in attempting to harmonize the various provisions of section 425.16 by reading an independent \u201cpublic significance\u201d requirement into the four categories of protected conduct enumerated in section 425.16, subdivision (e). Instead, the court said, because legislative intent is gleaned from the statute as a whole, \u201cthe meaning ascribed to the concept of \u2018public significance\u2019 in the preamble must accommodate the singular, clearly defined protected activities set forth in each clause of section 425.16[,] subdivision (e).\u201d (52 Cal.App.4th at p. 1048.) In other words, the court said, to harmonize subdivisions (a) and (e) of section 425.16, \u201cthe term \u2018significance\u2019 should be read as simply the meaning or import of a particular matter. Thus a matter has <em>public </em>meaning or significance within the language of section 425.16, subdivision (a) because and solely because (1) it occurs within the context of the proceedings delineated in clause one (i.e. \u2018any statement or writing made before . . . .\u2019); or (2) it occurs in connection with an issue under consideration or review by one of the bodies or proceedings delineated in clause two; or (3) it is an issue of public interest that is aired to the public or in a public forum.\u201d (52 Cal.App.4th at p. 1048.) The court thus concluded that the statements alleged in the present suit had \u201cpublic significance\u201d within the meaning of subdivision (a) because they came within the terms of section 425.16, subdivision (e). (52 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1043, 1048-1049.)</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">The court adopted a similarly broad view of the anti-SLAPP statute in <em>Averill v. Superior Court, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th 1170. There, the defendant was a critic of a plan by a charitable organization to convert a house in her neighborhood into a shelter for battered women. Because of comments defendant made about the organization to her employer, it sued her for slander. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1172.) The Court of Appeal held that the suit was subject to dismissal under the anti-SLAPP statute. It explained that the allegedly slanderous statements arguably fell within the enumerated protected acts under section 425.16, subdivision (e), but that even if the statements were not expressly covered by subdivision (e), the categories enumerated there are not all-inclusive. (42 Cal.App.4th at p. 1175.) The court explained; \u201cThe acts in furtherance of a person\u2019s right to free speech specified by the statute is preceded by the word \u2018includes.\u2019 The word \u2018includes\u2019 is ordinarily a term of enlargement rather than limitation. [Citation.] The use of \u2018includes\u2019 implies that other acts which are not mentioned are also protected under the statute. [Citation.] . . . Considering the stated purpose of the statute, which includes protection of not only the constitutional right to \u2018petition for the redress of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>grievances,\u2019 but the broader constitutional right of freedom of speech, we conclude the Legislature intended the statute to have broad application.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1175-1176.)</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">Taken together, these cases and the legislative history that discusses them suggest that \u201can issue of public interest\u201d within the meaning of section 425.16, subdivision (e)(3) is <em>any issue in which the public is interested. </em>In other words, the issue need not be \u201csignificant\u201d to be protected by the anti-SLAPP statute\u2014it is enough that it is one in which the public takes an interest. Judged by this standard, the trial court correctly concluded that the statements on which the present suit is based concern an issue of public interest. According to evidence introduced by defendants in support of their motions to strike, there is \u201cextensive interest\u201d in Nyg\u00e1rd\u2014\u201ca prominent businessman and celebrity of Finnish extraction\u201d\u2014among the Finnish public. Further, defendants\u2019 evidence suggests that there is particular interest among the magazine\u2019s readership in \u201cinformation having to do with Mr. Nyg\u00e1rd\u2019s famous Bahamas residence which has been the subject of much publicity in Finland.\u201d The June 2005 article was intended to satisfy that interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">Our conclusion about the scope of the anti-SLAPP statute is consistent with two cases cited by defendants in which \u201ctabloid\u201d issues were held to be protected by the anti-SLAPP statute. In <em>Seelig v. Infinity Broadcasting Corp. </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 798 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 108] <em>(Seelig), </em>the plaintiff was one of 50 contestants in the television program <em>Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire </em>(Fox Network, Feb. 15, 2000). A San Francisco radio show mocked the plaintiff\u2019s participation in the show, and the plaintiff sued the radio station for slander and other torts. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 801-806.) The Court of Appeal held that the suit was subject to a special motion to strike. Among other things, it held that the offending comments were made \u201c \u2018in connection with an issue of public interest\u2019 \u201cThe offending comments arose in the context of an on-air discussion between the talk-radio cohosts and their on-air producer about a television show of significant interest to the public and the media. This program was a derivative of <em>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, </em>which had proven successful in generating viewership and advertising revenue .... By having chosen to participate as a contestant in the Show, plaintiff voluntarily subjected herself to inevitable scrutiny and potential ridicule by the public and the media.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 807-808.)</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">The court reached a similar result in <em>Sipple </em>v. <em>Foundation for Nat. Progress </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 226 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 677]. There, the plaintiff was a nationally known political consultant who had developed advertising campaigns for major political candidates. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 230.) He brought a suit for defamation and other torts after the defendant, doing business as Mother Jones, published an article about a custody dispute between Sipple and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>second wife. Among other things, the article discussed Sipple\u2019s first and second wives\u2019 testimony at the custody trial that he had physically and verbally abused them. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The trial court struck the complaint under the anti-SLAPP statute and the Court of Appeal affirmed, holding that the article concerned a matter of public interest. It explained: \u201cCentral to the article . . . are the allegations of physical and verbal abuse against a prominent media strategist by two former wives .... In 1994, appellant devised media strategy based on gender-based advertising against domestic violence for the gubernatorial races of Pete Wilson in California, George W. Bush in Texas and Jim Edgar in Illinois. Ironically, the custody dispute occurred while appellant was running the media strategy for Bob Dole\u2019s 1996 presidential campaign based on morality issues. In other words, appellant was able to capitalize on domestic violence issues in order to further his career.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 238.) Accordingly, the court concluded, \u201c[T]he details of appellant\u2019s career and appellant\u2019s ability to capitalize on domestic violence issues in his advertising campaigns for politicians known around the world, while allegedly committing violence against his former wives, are public issues, and the article is subject to the protection of section 425.16.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 239-240.)</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Plaintiffs urge that we should reject the analyses of these cases in favor of those of <em>Condit </em>v. <em>National Enquirer, Inc. </em>(E.D.Cal. 2002) 248 F.Supp.2d 945 and <em>Rogers v. Home Shopping Network, Inc. </em>(C.D.Cal. 1999) 57 F.Supp.2d 973, 985, footnote 7, but we decline to do so. <em>Condit </em>concerned several articles published in the National Enquirer that falsely reported that just days before the disappearance of Chandra Levy, then an intern to Congressman Gary Condit, Condit\u2019s wife phoned Levy and \u201cverbally attacked [her].\u201d (248 F.Supp.2d at p. 948.) Mrs. Condit alleged three claims of libel arising out of these articles, and the district court held that her claims were not subject to a special motion to strike. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court reasoned that \u201cCalifornia\u2019s anti-SLAPP statute applies to the Offending Statements only if they can be characterized as statements made in connection with an issue of public interest for reasons other than that they were made in a widely distributed publication.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 954.) The court concluded that the statements about Mrs. Condit were not issues of public interest, as so defined, because Mrs. Condit \u201cis not a public official,\u201d Levy\u2019s disappearance \u201cdoes not concern the performance of duties by Mr. Condit in his capacity as a public official,\u201d and \u201c[t]he criminal investigation of the disappearance of Ms. Levy is not necessarily a political or community issue in which public opinion and input is inherent and desirable . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">The court\u2019s analysis in <em>Rogers v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., supra, </em>57 F.Supp.2d 973, 985, footnote 7, was similar. In dicta, it said: \u201cIt is true that California courts have found the public issue or issue of public interest element to be satisfied by speech on many different subjects. [Citations.] However, none of these cases held that celebrity-watching is inherently a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>public issue. That a celebrity might be a public figure for purposes of the First Amendment should not mean that all speech about that celebrity is necessarily a public issue or an issue of public interest for purposes of \u00a7 425.16(e).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">Initially, we note that we are not bound by lower federal court decisions. <em>(People v. Avena </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 394, 431 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 301, 916 P.2d 1000].) We also do not agree with plaintiffs that <em>Condit </em>and <em>Rogers </em>correctly interpret \u201cpublic interest\u201d within the meaning of section 425.16, subdivision (e). To the contrary, <em>Condif </em>s suggestion that only a \u201cpolitical or community issue in which public opinion and input is inherent and desirable\u201d can be an issue of public interest (248 F.Supp.2d at p. 954) echoes the analysis of <em>Zhao, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th at pages 1120, 1122, that issues of public interest are limited to matters \u201coccupying \u2018the highest rung of the heirarchy <em>[sic] </em>of First Amendment values,\u2019 that is, to speech pertaining to the exercise of democratic self-government.\u201d <em>(Zhao, supra, </em>at p. 1122.) The Legislature expressly rejected this limited view of the anti-SLAPP statute when it amended the statute in 1997 and, thus, we will not adopt it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">III. <em>Probability of Prevailing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">\u201c \u2018In order to establish a probability of prevailing on the claim (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1)), a plaintiff responding to an anti-SLAPP motion must \u201c lstate[] and substantiate^ a legally sufficient claim.\u2019 \u201d [Citations.] Put another way, the plaintiff \u201cmust demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.\u201d [Citations.] In deciding the question of potential merit, the trial court considers the pleadings and evidentiary submissions of both the plaintiff and the defendant (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(2)); though the court does not <em>weigh </em>the credibility or comparative probative strength of competing evidence, it should grant the motion if, as a matter of law, the defendant\u2019s evidence supporting the motion defeats the plaintiff\u2019s attempt to establish evidentiary support for the claim. [Citation.]\u2019 <em>([Wilson v. Parker, Covert &amp; Chidester </em>(2002)] 28 Cal.4th [811,] 821 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 19, 50 P.3d 733], original italics.)\u201d <em>(Taus </em>v. <em>Loftus </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 683, 713-714 [54 Cal.Rptr.3d 775, 151 P.3d 1185].)</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">For the reasons outlined below, we conclude that plaintiffs have failed to make a prima facie showing of any one of their five causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">A. <em>Breach of Contract</em></p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">The first cause of action alleges that Timo breached the confidentiality provision of his employment contract with the company by revealing confidential information to the magazine without the company\u2019s permission. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>confidentiality provision says: \u201cYou acknowledge that, in the course of your consulting contract with the Company, all information acquired by you is confidential to, and the exclusive property of, the Company. You agree not to directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, except for use in the performance of your employment duties, disclose to any person or use at any time either during or after your contract has been renewed or terminated, any information, knowledge or data of the Company or of a third party which has been provided to the Company, unless first obtaining the written approval of Nyg\u00e1rd International Partnership. Such information includes, without limiting the generality of the foregoing: methods of doing business; trade and design secrets; financial data as to costs, revenues, prices, profits; market information and sales or customer lists; suppliers and corporate contact names, addresses and telephone numbers; and records pertaining to employees, including their names, addresses and telephone numbers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">Timo\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion asserted that his disclosures did not violate the terms of the confidentiality provision because the published statements attributed to Timo concerned only Timo\u2019s personal experiences while working for Nyg\u00e1rd, not sensitive economic information such as trade secrets, financial data, customer information, or information about other Nyg\u00e1rd employees. We agree. Under the principle of <em>ejusdem generis </em>(literally, \u201cof the same kind\u201d) <em>(Harris v. Capital Growth Investors XIV </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 1142, 1160 &amp; fn. 7 [278 Cal.Rptr. 614, 805 P.2d 873]; <em>Engelmann v. State Bd. of Education </em>(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 47, 56, fn. 11 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 264]), where specific words follow general words in a contract, \u201cthe general words are construed to embrace only things similar in nature to those enumerated by the specific words.\u201d <em>(California Farm Bureau Federation </em>v. <em>California Wildlife Conservation Bd. </em>(2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 189 [49 Cal.Rptr.3d 169]; see also <em>International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 21, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2007) 42 Cal.4th 319, 342 [64 Cal.Rptr.3d 693, 165 P.3d 488] [doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis </em>\u201c \u2018presumes that if the Legislature intends a general word to be used in its unrestricted sense, it does not also offer as examples peculiar things or classes of things since those descriptions then would be surplusage\u2019 \u201d].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>As applied to the present case, the principle of <em>ejusdem generis </em>requires that the phrase <em>\u201cany </em>information, knowledge or data of the Company\u201d must be construed in light of the kinds of protected information enumerated in the sentence that follows.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As Timo correctly notes, all of these examples are of proprietary information or trade secrets. <em>None </em>of the information Timo revealed to the magazine is proprietary to the company; instead it concerns Timo\u2019s alleged working conditions and Nyg\u00e1rd\u2019s lifestyle and guests. Nor do we agree with plaintiffs that the identity of celebrity guests entertained by the company\u2019s president at his residence is \u201cof the same general nature or class\u201d as the company\u2019s confidential trade secrets and proprietary information. Accordingly, we conclude that plaintiffs have not made a prima facie case that Timo\u2019s disclosures to the magazine breached the confidentiality provision of the employment contract.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">B. <em>Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing and Breach of the Duty of Loyalty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">The second cause of action alleges that Timo\u2019s disclosures to the magazine violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and the fourth cause of action alleges that the disclosures breached Timo\u2019s duty of loyalty to the company. Both causes of action are premised on Timo\u2019s contractual duty of confidentiality: Plaintiffs assert that Timo breached the implied covenant of good faith and the duty of loyalty by disclosing \u201cinformation <em>he agreed </em>to keep confidential.\u201d (Italics added.) Because we have concluded that Timo\u2019s disclosures did not breach the express terms of the confidentiality provision of the employment contract, we necessarily conclude that they also did not breach the implied covenant of good faith or the duty of loyalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>C. <em>Interference with Contract</em></p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">The third cause of action alleges intentional interference with contract. The elements of intentional interference are: \u201c(1) a valid contract between plaintiff and a third party; (2) defendants\u2019 knowledge of the contract; (3) defendants\u2019 intentional acts designed to induce a breach or disruption of the contractual relationship; (4) actual breach or disruption of the contractual relationship; and (5) resulting damage.\u201d <em>(Tuchscher Development Enterprises, Inc. v. San Diego Unified Port Dist. </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 1219, 1239 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 57].)</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">We agree with the trial court that plaintiffs failed to make a prima facie showing of intentional interference with contract. Like the causes of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and breach of the duty of loyalty, this cause of action is based on Timo\u2019s alleged breach of the confidentiality provision of his employment contract: The complaint alleges that the magazine and the publisher interfered with Timo\u2019s employment contract by \u201cengaging] in a deliberate and/or reckless course of conduct to interfere with Plaintiffs\u2019 contractual relationships by unlawfully soliciting Plaintiffs\u2019 confidential information in order to defame and otherwise damage Plaintiffs.\u201d Because we have concluded that plaintiffs failed to make a prima facie showing of breach of Timo\u2019s employment contract, the cause of action for intentional interference with contract necessarily also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">D. <em>Defamation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">The fifth cause of action is for defamation. It alleges that the June 2005 article was defamatory in that it contained the following descriptions of Timo\u2019s working conditions at Nyg\u00e1rd International: (1) \u201c \u2018Time\u2019s horror experiences about Peter Nyg\u00e1rd: \u201cI was used!\u201d \u2019 \u201d; (2) \u201c \u2018Timo slaved\u2014 essentially without a break while working for Peter Nyg\u00e1rd\u2014I Felt Myself Used!\u2019 (3) described Timo\u2019s \u201c \u2018horrible working experiences while employed by Peter Nyg\u00e1rd\u2019 \u201d; (4) asserted that Timo had to \u201c \u2018endure . . . pestering/taunting round the clock\u2019 \u201d; (5) \u201c T had to slave/drudge almost without a break the whole time I was at [Nyg\u00e1rd\u2019s] estate. Apparently he hasn\u2019t heard about working hours but rather wanted me to work round the clock\u2019 \u201d; (6) \u201c \u2018Nyg\u00e1rd didn\u2019t want to let his employees to even go and see a doctor\u2019 \u201d when injured; (7) Peter Nyg\u00e1rd \u201c \u2018keeps an eye on his workers like a hawk.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">Defamation is \u201ca false and unprivileged publication that exposes the plaintiff \u2018to hatred, contempt, ridicule, or obloquy, or which causes him to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>shunned or avoided, or which has a tendency to injure him in his occupation.\u2019 (Civ. Code, \u00a7 45.)\u201d <em>(McGarry v.

Further, when the plaintiff is a public figure, he or she \u201cmust also show the speaker made the objectionable statements with malice in its constitutional sense \u2018 \u201cthat is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Reader\u2019s Digest Assn. v.

University of San Diego, supra, </em>at p. 114.)</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that plaintiffs failed to make a prima facie showing that the challenged statements were false, as required to establish a cause of action for defamation. Thus, this cause of action fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">1. <em>None of the Challenged Statements Are \u201cProvably False\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">\u201c \u2018The <em>sine qua non </em>of recovery for defamation ... is the existence of a falsehood.\u2019 <em>(Letter Carriers </em>v. <em>Austin </em>(1974) 418 U.S. 264, 283 [41 L.Ed.2d 745, 94 S.Ct. 2770].) [][] The falsehood requirement is grounded in the First Amendment itself. \u2018Under the First Amendment there is no such thing as a false idea. However pernicious an opinion may seem, we depend for its correction not on the conscience of judges and juries but on the competition of other ideas.\u2019 <em>(Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc. </em>(1974) 418 U.S. 323, 339-340 [41 L.Ed.2d 789, 94 S.Ct. 2997], fn. omitted; <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 596, 600-601 [131 Cal.Rptr. 641, 552 P.2d 425].)\u201d <em>(Baker </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Herald Examiner </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 254, 259-260 [228 Cal.Rptr. 206, 721 P.2d 87].)</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">To state a defamation claim that survives a First Amendment challenge, thus, a plaintiff must present evidence of a statement of fact that is \u201cprovably false.\u201d <em>(Seelig, supra, 91 </em>Cal.App.4th 798, 809, citing <em>Milkovich v.

Union High School Dist. </em>(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 720, 724 [275 Cal.Rptr. 494].)\u201d <em>(Seelig, supra, </em>at p. 809.)</p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>To ascertain whether the statements in question are provably false factual assertions, courts consider the \u201c \u2018 \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Seelig, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.4th at p. 809.) Whether challenged statements convey the requisite factual imputation is ordinarily a question of law for the court, <em>(id. </em>at p. 810.)</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">In <em>James </em>v. <em>San Jose Mercury News, Inc. </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 890] <em>(James), </em>the court applied this standard to conclude that plaintiffs could not prove a libel claim because none of the assertedly libelous statements were provably false. There, a criminal defense attorney sued a newspaper and one of its reporters after the newspaper published an article criticizing the attorney\u2019s litigation tactics in defense of a man charged with molesting a young girl. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 4\u20148.) The court acknowledged that the article \u201cundeniably impugned [the attorney\u2019s] professional reputation\u201d\u2014 indeed, it said, the article suggested that in the opinion of the prosecutor, the victim\u2019s father and the columnist, the defense attorney \u201cis a member of a class of lawyers that engages in, and his conduct in this instance is an example of, sleazy, illegal, and unethical practice against which the public should be warned.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 12.) Nonetheless, it said, the trial court properly ruled that the column was not libelous as a matter of law. The court explained that the pertinent question \u201cis whether a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the publication as a whole, or any of its parts, directly made or sufficiently implied a false assertion of defamatory <em>fact </em>that tended to injure James\u2019s reputation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 13.) In considering this question, two tests should be applied. First, \u201c \u2018a statement on matters of public concern must be provable as false before there can be liability under state defamation law, at least in situations . . . where a media defendant is involved.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 13, quoting <em>Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., supra, </em>497 U.S. at pp. 19-20.) Second, \u201c \u2018statements that cannot \u201creasonably [be] interpreted as stating actual facts\u201d \u2019 \u201d cannot give rise to a cause of action for defamation. <em>(James, </em>at p. 13.) \u201c \u2018This provides assurance that public debate will not suffer for lack of \u201cimaginative expression\u201d or the \u201crhetorical hyperbole\u201d which has traditionally added much to the discourse of our Nation. [Citation.]\u2019 <em>(Milkovich </em>v. <em>Lorain Journal Co., supra, </em>497 U.S. at p. 20 . . . .)\u201d <em>(James, supra, </em>at p. 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">The court concluded that many of the column\u2019s statements fell into the \u201cprotected zone of \u2018 \u201cimaginative expression\u201d \u2019 or \u2018 \u201crhetorical hyperbole\u201d \u2019: [Defense attorney] James\u2019s acquisition of the records was a \u2018really scary part of this story\u2019; in the father\u2019s view James went to \u2018 \u201cextreme lengths\u201d \u2019; in [the prosecutor\u2019s] view the defense practice he described and criticized was \u2018a common and sleazy tactic to ruin kids as witnesses\u2019 that made him \u2018angry\u2019; [the prosecutor] is \u2018 \u201cseeing case after case in which the defense goes on a fishing expedition to attack the character of the kid\u201d \u2019; taken as a whole the column was \u2018[a] sad lesson in \u201cjustice\u201d \u2019; the columnist wanted readers to \u2018[c]onsider\u2019 his column a \u2018warning.\u2019 \u201d <em>(James, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.4th at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>p. 14.) According to the court, each of these statements \u201cis clearly recognizable as opinion and could not reasonably be understood as a statement of literal fact.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">The remaining statements, the court said, \u201cfall somewhere between fact and hyperbole .... To determine whether these statements should be regarded as fact or as opinion[, the court] rel[ied] on <em>Milkovich\u2019s </em>first test: Do the statements contain <em>provably false </em>factual connotation?\u201d <em>(James, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.4th at p. 15.) It concluded that they did not. \u201cThe statements that \u2018when the legal community turns on kids, it doubles their trauma,\u2019 and that counsel \u2018 \u201cget[s] hassled all the time by attorneys wanting school records without going through the proper motions,\u201d \u2019 contain too many generalizations, elastic terms, and elements of subjectivity to be susceptible of proof or disproof. When does the \u2018legal community\u2019 \u2018turn on\u2019 \u2018kids\u2019? What is \u2018trauma\u2019 in this context, and how can its increments be measured? What does \u2018hassled\u2019 mean? What are \u2018the proper motions,\u2019 and what is the implication of the fact attorneys do not want to go through them: Beyond \u2018hassling,\u2019 are we to understand that these attorneys would simply take the records without going through the proper motions?\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Further, \u201cThe columnist\u2019s perception that \u2018the judge has taken a dim view of the defense tactics\u2019 is plainly labeled as opinion but arguably implies that the judge has indeed taken \u2018a dim view.\u2019 But what is a \u2018dim view\u2019? In common parlance it means disapproval or dissatisfaction. But how much or how little <em>of </em>either would suffice to connote a \u2018dim view\u2019? These matters, again, are not susceptible of proof or disproof.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, it concluded, because no reasonable fact finder could have found explicit or implicit false statements of fact, summary judgment was properly granted. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">The court reached a similar conclusion in <em>Campanelli </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 572 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 891] <em>(Campanelli). </em>There, a terminated university basketball coach brought a libel action against the university and its employees based on statements made to the press after his firing. The trial court sustained the defendants\u2019 demurrer, and the Court of Appeal affirmed. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 575-577.) The court explained that because a publication must contain a false statement of fact to give rise to a cause of action for defamation, statements of opinion, even if objectively unjustified or made in bad faith, cannot form the basis for a libel action. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 578.) Applying these principles, the court concluded that the vice-chancellor\u2019s statement <em>that a </em>player\u2019s father \u201c \u2018felt that . . . [the coach] was putting so much pressure on his son he was making him physically ill\u2019 \u201d could not be characterized as statement of fact. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 579.) \u201cFirst, [the vice-chancellor] made clear that the statement did not express his own sentiment, but was something he was told by a <em>parent. </em>Second, the statement was not couched in terms of a factual assertion, but a <em>feeling </em>(\u2018Jason Kidd\u2019s father <em>felt </em>. . . .\u2019 [citation]). The very word \u2018felt\u2019 inherently connotes a subjective judgment.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number><em>(Ibid.) </em>Further, \u201c[p]arents are not generally thought of as experts in the medical field. A statement such as the one attributed to Kidd\u2019s father has a much different effect on the reader when made by a parent than if the same statement were uttered by a professional with some expertise in the subject matter. [Citation.] When a parent states that he feels someone or something is making his son sick, the general public would not reasonably expect the parent to be making an observation which could be proven true or false in a medical sense. Yet the objective \u2018truth\u2019 of such a statement is exactly what Campanelli would have a jury decide. Campanelli is not entitled to a jury trial on the issue of whether Kidd\u2019s father\u2019s \u2018feeling\u2019 about the effect of Campanelli\u2019s behavior on his son was empirically sound or medically justified.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 580.)</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">The court similarly concluded with regard to the athletic director\u2019s statement to the newspaper that \u201c \u2018The players were beaten down and in trouble psychologically ...,\u2019\u201d which, the coach asserted, amounted to a false charge that he inflicted psychological damage on his players. <em>(Campanelli, supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th at p. 580.) The court disagreed. \u201cIn light of the nature of the controversy and the overall tenor of the article, we cannot conclude the Bockrath statement was intended to be a factual assertion. Bockrath was not seriously maintaining that Cal\u2019s players had suffered \u2018psychological damage\u2019 in any scientific, verifiable sense. Instead, the phrase \u2018in trouble psychologically\u2019 was an emphatic way of expressing Bockrath\u2019s central theme that he thought the players felt \u2018beaten down\u2019 as a result of Campanelli\u2019s harsh methods. The totality of the remarks and the background against which they were made dispel the notion that Bockrath\u2019s comment was imbued with the meaning which Campanelli would ascribe to it, i.e., that Cal\u2019s players had suffered measurable damage to their psyches, which could be causally attributed to Campanelli. Instead, Bockrath\u2019s statement was of the kind typically generated in a spirited dispute between two divergent viewpoints\u2014in short, nonactionable opinion.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 581; see also <em>Ferlauto </em>v. <em>Hamsher, supra, </em>74 Cal.App,4th at pp. 1403-1404 [descriptions of plaintiff\u2019s motion as \u201c \u2018stupid,\u2019 \u2018laughed at,\u2019 \u2018a joke,\u2019 \u2018spurious,\u2019 and \u2018frivolous\u2019 \u201d are \u201cnothing more than \u2018the predictable opinion\u2019 of one side to the lawsuit\u201d; \u201cthe phrases \u2018creepazoid attorney\u2019 and \u2018loser wannabe lawyer\u2019 are classic rhetorical hyperbole which \u2018cannot \u201creasonably [be] interpreted as stating actual facts . . .\u201d \u2019 \u201d]; <em>Ruiz v.

No reasonable reader could understand the description of Time\u2019s work experience with plaintiffs as \u201c \u2018horrible\u2019 \u201d and a \u201c \u2018horror\u2019 \u201d to mean that Timo was literally struck with horror while working for the company. Instead, \u201c \u2018horrible\u2019 \u201d and a \u201c \u2018horror\u2019 \u201d colorfully convey Time\u2019s subjective belief that working for the company was unpleasant. His subjective reaction does not contain \u201cprovable facts,\u201d and no reasonable reader could understand these words as statements of actual working conditions. Time\u2019s statements that \u201c T was used!\u2019 \u201d and \u201c 1 Felt Myself Used!\u2019 \u201d also connote his subjective judgment that working for the company was unpleasant. Further, as in Campanelli, Time\u2019s judgment is couched in terms of a \u201cfeeling,\u201d not a factual assertion. <em>(Campanelli, supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th at p. 579.) Accordingly, these statements \u201c[are] clearly recognizable as opinion and could not reasonably be understood as . . . statements] of literal fact.\u201d <em>(James, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.4th at p. 14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">Most of the remaining statements on which the defamation claim is based also come within the \u201cprotected zone of \u2018 \u201cimaginative expression\u201d \u2019 or \u2018 \u201crhetorical hyperbole\u201d \u2019 \u201c \u2018Timo slaved\u2014essentially without a break while working for Peter Nyg\u00e1rd\u2019 Timo had to endure pestering or taunting \u201c \u2018round the clock\u2019 Timo had to \u201c \u2018slave/drudge almost without a break the whole time [he] was at [Nyg\u00e1rd\u2019s] estate\u2019 Nyg\u00e1rd \u201c \u2018[apparently .. . hasn\u2019t heard about working hours but rather wanted [Timo] to work round the clock\u2019 \u201d; Peter Nyg\u00e1rd \u201c \u2018keeps an eye on his workers like a hawk.\u2019 \u201d As in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number><em>James </em>and <em>Campanelli, </em>no reasonable fact finder could conclude that these statements imply provably false factual assertions. The article did not seriously maintain that Timo was required to work 24 hours each day or that defendants literally enslaved him. Instead, the article\u2019s statements that Timo worked \u201c \u2018round the clock\u2019 \u201d and had to \u201c \u2018slave[] . . . without a break\u2019 \u201d were hyperbolic expressions of Timo\u2019s belief that he was expected to work unreasonably long hours. Similarly, the statement that Nyg\u00e1rd \u201c \u2018hasn\u2019t heard about working hours\u2019 \u201d was not intended to suggest that Nyg\u00e1rd literally was not familiar with maximum hour limitations. Rather, this statement was a colorful way of expressing Timo\u2019s opinion that Nyg\u00e1rd was an overly demanding boss. And, no reasonable fact finder could conclude that the article was literally asserting that Nyg\u00e1rd watched Timo \u201c \u2018like a hawk\u2019 \u201d; rather, the only reasonable reading of the passage is that Timo believed that Nyg\u00e1rd too closely oversaw his employees\u2019 work.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">One statement remains\u2014that Nyg\u00e1rd \u201c \u2018didn\u2019t want to let his employees to even go and see a doctor\u2019 \u201d when injured. While this statement arguably could be understood as implying facts capable of being proved true or false, it is not actionable if it discloses all of the statements of fact on which the opinion is based and those statements are true. <em>(Integrated Healthcare Holdings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fitzgibbons </em>(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 515, 527 [44 Cal.Rptr.3d 517], citing <em>Ruiz v. Harbor View Community Assn., supra, </em>134 Cal.App.4th 1456, 1471.) We conclude that the statement meets this standard. Immediately after the quoted statement, the article says: \u201cI was installing a large and complicated home theatre system in [Nyg\u00e1rd\u2019s] house. It had to be completed before the Super Bowl game as Nyg\u00e1rd had invited some friends to his house. After having worked round the clock Timo hurt himself falling in the stairs. I lost my balance in the stairs being dead tired. I cut my elbow and realized I needed a doctor. I called Nyg\u00e1rd who snorted that work had to be finished first. However, I went to see my boss. After a long talk he gave me permission to see a doctor. He did not show me any kind of sympathy. He just said that he had never had time to see a doctor while he\u2019d been working. Afterwards he scolded me for not having completed the home theatre before the Super Bowl game.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">Read in context, it is clear that the statement on which the defamation claim is based\u2014that Nyg\u00e1rd wouldn\u2019t have liked to allow his employee even to see a doctor\u2014is Timo\u2019s opinion based on the incident he describes. The relevant question, then, is whether plaintiffs made a prima facie showing that Timo\u2019s factual assertions were false. We conclude that they did not. In opposition to the anti-SLAPP motion, plaintiffs submitted four declarations. Two declarations were submitted by Timo\u2019s coworkers; both stated that: \u201cTo the extent the article characterizes Plaintiffs or Mr. Nyg\u00e1rd as not wanting to let its/his employees see doctors, I find that characterization to be inaccurate. Based on my experience and observation, including my experience and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>observations while working in the Nyg\u00e1rd Cay Bahamas Resort, Plaintiffs and Mr. Nyg\u00e1rd have never prevented or discouraged its/his employees from seeking medical attention.\u201d A third was submitted by another coworker who said that based on his experience, denying employees medical attention \u201cdoes not sound like the behavior Peter Nyg\u00e1rd or anyone else acting on behalf of the Nyg\u00e1rd Companies would engage in. In fact, in my experience, Mr. Nyg\u00e1rd and Plaintiffs have been very accommodating towards the personal needs of their employees.\u201d Finally, a fourth was submitted by the employee in charge of arranging medical attention for Nyg\u00e1rd personnel; it said that neither plaintiffs nor Nyg\u00e1rd discourage employees from seeking medical attention and that she did not recall Timo ever seeing her for the purpose of seeking medical attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">We conclude that none of these declarations is prima facie evidence that the incident described by Timo did not occur. While each declaration is evidence either that the declarant was not aware of Nyg\u00e1rd denying any employee medical attention or that the incident Timo described was not typical of the company\u2019s or Nyg\u00e1rd\u2019s employment practices, none states that he or she witnessed the specific event Timo described. Moreover, if Time\u2019s version of events was inaccurate, plaintiffs could have submitted prima facie evidence of its falsity through the declaration of Nyg\u00e1rd. Because plaintiffs did not do so, we conclude that plaintiffs failed to carry their burden of making a prima facie showing of falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">2. <em>Defendants\u2019 Request for Judicial Notice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">Defendants have asked us to take judicial notice of the recent unpublished decision in <em>Nygard </em>v. <em>Iltalehti </em>(June 21, 2007, B192639), which arguably concludes that the Nyg\u00e1rd plaintiffs are \u201cpublic figures.\u201d Under United States Supreme Court precedent, where a defamation plaintiff is a public figure, he or she must establish that the allegedly defamatory statements were made with \u201cactual malice\u201d\u2014\u201c 1 \u201cthat is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Reader\u2019s Digest Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 256.)\u201d <em>(McGarry v.

Defendants contend that the court\u2019s conclusion in <em>lltalehti </em>that plaintiffs are public figures collaterally estops plaintiffs from asserting a contrary position here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">Because we have concluded that plaintiffs have not made a requisite showing of falsity, we need not consider whether plaintiffs are public figures or whether the challenged statements were made with actual malice.

Moreover, \u201cinformation\u201d is susceptible of more than one interpretation.

Gabor </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1455, 1476 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 235] [assertions that plaintiff \u201changs out in sleazy bars\u201d and \u201c \u2018is broke, had to sell her house in Hollywood, now lives in the worst section\u2019 \u201d were actionable notwithstanding the subjective judgments conveyed by \u201csleazy\u201d and \u201cworst\u201d: \u201cThe evidence in this case established that Sommer did not frequent bars of whatever nature, was not broke, did not have to sell her house in Hollywood, and did not move, whether to the \u2018best\u2019 or \u2018worst\u2019 part of town. Thus, the statements were indeed proven to be false in their broad sense, so that it did not matter what kind of bars were described or to what part of town she was alleged to have moved.\u201d]; <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Connell </em>(2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1270-1271 [20 Cal.Rptr.3d 673] [assertion that plaintiff was \u201c \u2018extremely rude\u2019 \u201d is not defamatory because it does not make a factual assertion capable of being proven true or false; however, statement that plaintiff was not \u201c \u2018there to help [decedent] but he was there to help himself\u2019 \u201d was arguably defamatory because it was capable of being proven true or false].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
