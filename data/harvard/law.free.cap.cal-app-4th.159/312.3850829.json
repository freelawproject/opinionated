The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>court imposed the upper term of eight years for the rape based on its finding that \u201cthe circumstances in mitigation are not outweighed by those in aggravation, . . . including the following, the crime involved great violence, great bodily injury with the threat of great bodily injury; defendant used or was armed with a weapon, and the victim was particularly vulnerable.\u201d For making a criminal threat, the court imposed a consecutive term of eight months.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">On appeal, defendant contends the court\u2019s imposition of the upper term for the rape based on its finding of the above factors violated his constitutional right to have the aggravating factors determined by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt as required by <em>Cunningham v. California </em>(2007) 549 U.S. 270 [166 L.Ed.2d 856, 127 S.Ct. 856], <em>Blakely v. Washington </em>(2004) 542 U.S. 296 [159 L.Ed.2d 403, 124 S.Ct. 2531], and <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 466 [147 L.Ed.2d 435, 120 S.Ct. 2348], We reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Following the filing of the briefs in this case, the California Supreme Court rendered its decision in <em>People v. Black </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 799 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 569, 161 P.3d 1130], concluding that \u201cimposition of the upper term does not infringe upon the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to jury trial so long as one legally sufficient aggravating circumstance has been found to exist by the jury, has been admitted by the defendant, <em>or is justified based upon the defendant\u2019s record of prior convictions.\u201d {Id. </em>at p. 816, italics added.) Consequently, \u201c[t]he issue to be determined in each case is whether the trial court\u2019s factfinding increased the sentence that otherwise <em>could </em>have been imposed, not whether it raised the sentence above that which otherwise <em>would </em>have been imposed.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 815.)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Here, although the court did not mention defendant\u2019s six prior misdemeanor convictions as a reason for imposing the upper term,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> those convictions qualified as an aggravating circumstance under rule 4.421(b)(2) of the California Rules of Court, which provides that circumstances in aggravation include that \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s prior convictions as an adult or sustained petitions in juvenile delinquency proceedings are numerous or of increasing seriousness.\u201d Six prior convictions are plainly \u201cnumerous.\u201d Because one legally sufficient aggravating circumstance was justified based on defendant\u2019s record of prior convictions, the trial court\u2019s finding of additional aggravating circumstances did not violate defendant\u2019s constitutional rights under <em>Black.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Blease, Acting P. J., and Morrison, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied May 14, 2008, S161251.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b286-7\"> In discussing why it would have denied defendant probation even if he were not statutorily ineligible for probation, the trial court did note that \u201cdefendant\u2019s prior record of criminal conduct indicates a pattern of regular, increasing serious conduct. He has six prior misdemeanors, even though this is his first felony . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
