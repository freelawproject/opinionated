Sess.), a new schedule for rating permanent disabilities of injured workers was adopted and became effective on January 1, 2005. The Legislature also amended Labor Code section 4660, subdivision (d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (section 4660(d)), which provides that the new schedule applies prospectively to compensable injuries on or after the effective date, as well as to compensable claims arising before January 1, 2005, \u201cwhen there has been either no comprehensive medical-legal report or no report by a treating physician indicating the existence of permanent disability, or when the employer is not required to provide the notice required by Section 4061 to the injured worker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Zenith Insurance Company petitions for writ of review and contends that the new schedule applies to respondent Randolph Cugini\u2019s 2004 industrial injury, because section 4061, subdivision (a) (section 4061(a)) expressly requires the notice with the last payment of temporary disability indemnity in 2005 and not the first payment in 2004 as determined by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB). Petitioner also contends that the new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>schedule applies because the treating physician\u2019s report in 2004 that indicated the existence of permanent disability was an unsupported conclusion and not substantial evidence. In addition, permanent disability did not exist because Cugini\u2019s condition was not permanent and stationary until 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Based on the plain language of section 4061(a), which provides for notice of permanent disability indemnity \u201c[tjogether with the last payment of temporary disability indemnity,\u201d we agree with petitioner that the WCAB erred in ruling that the requirement to provide the notice arose with the first payment of temporary disability indemnity in 2004. However, we conclude that the WCAB should determine on remand whether there is a comprehensive medical-legal or treating physician\u2019s report \u201cindicating the existence of permanent disability\u201d under section 4660(d), which is substantial evidence considering the entire record. We also conclude that the injured worker\u2019s permanent and stationary status is not required before a physician\u2019s report can indicate the existence of permanent disability under section 4660(d), for the reasons we stated in <em>Genlyte Group, LLC v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 705 [69 Cal.Rptr.3d 903] <em>(Genlyte). </em>Accordingly, the WCAB\u2019s decision is annulled and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">1. <em>Cugini\u2019s Industrial Injury and Treatment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Randolph Cugini, a swimming pool technician for Browning\u2019s Pool Service, insured for workers\u2019 compensation by Zenith Insurance Company (Zenith), injured his back at work on June 18, 2004, when he lifted two gallons of chlorine out of the bed of a pickup truck. Cugini was referred to Little Company of Mary Hospital for treatment, and an MRI was performed that revealed a five-millimeter disc bulge at L3, a small disc protrusion with moderate narrowing at L3-4, and multilevel degenerative disc disease and diffuse disc bulging. Cugini treated with various physicians and medications were prescribed and back surgery discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Cugini also was referred to Robert Fenton, M.D., for an orthopedic consultation and treatment. In a report dated October 12, 2004, Dr. Fenton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>indicated that the diagnosis was \u201cL2-3 left-sided inter-foraminal disc herniation refractory to conservative care\u201d based upon the history, medical record review, X-rays and physical examination. Dr. Fenton recommended that Cugini remain temporarily totally disabled and off work, and undergo evaluation by a neurosurgeon.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a three-sentence report dated December 28, 2004, Dr. Fenton stated that, \u201cI am a treating physician for the above-referenced applicant. There is a reasonable medical probability that permanent disability exists as a result of the injury or injuries for which I am treating this patient. I will describe that disability further in a subsequent report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">On December 15, 2005, Dr. Fenton reported that an inter-foraminal left-sided discectomy at L2-3 was performed on March 29, 2005, and Cugini\u2019s condition had reached maximum medical improvement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Fenton also reported permanent disability under the former schedule, including no repetitive bending or hyperextension at the waist or lifting, pushing, or pulling over 20 pounds, and that Cugini had lost 60 percent of his preinjury capacity to perform such activities. Dr. Fenton further indicated that there was 13 percent whole person impairment under the new schedule, there was no apportionment to nonindustrial causes, and Cugini required vocational rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Zenith obtained a medical-legal evaluation from Phillip Ranter, M.D. Dr. Ranter reported that Cugini\u2019s condition had reached maximum medical improvement on November 15, 2005, he was precluded from repetitive heavy lifting, bending, pushing, pulling, stooping and crawling under the former schedule, there was 13 percent whole person impairment under the new schedule, there was no apportionment and vocational rehabilitation was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">2. <em>Proceedings Before the WCAB</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The parties proceeded to trial before the workers\u2019 compensation administrative law judge (WCJ), and submitted on the record and briefing which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>schedule applied. The WCJ determined that temporary disability indemnity was paid from June 19, 2004, through December 2, 2005, and permanent disability was 42 percent under the former schedule or $50,150 permanent disability indemnity. In the opinion on decision, the WCJ explained that the former schedule applies under section 4660(d) because a WCAB panel decision determined that the duty to provide the notice of permanent disability indemnity arises with the initial payment of temporary disability indemnity under section 4061(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Zenith petitioned the WCAB for reconsideration that the new schedule applies because the notice of permanent disability indemnity was required with the last payment of temporary disability indemnity in 2005 under the express language of section 4061(a). Cugini answered that the former schedule is applicable based on the WCAB\u2019s panel decision, and Dr. Fenton\u2019s report of December 28, 2004, indicated the existence of permanent disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">In the report on reconsideration, the WCJ explained that \u201cConsidering the treatment that Applicant has undergone including surgery and a long recuperative period, it is hard to argue that the assessment of Dr. Fenton in 2004 was not accurate and thoughtful. This consideration in addition to the fact that temporary disability was paid and there is no evidence of the notice [having] been provided as indicated in the Labor Code, Applicant\u2019s right to have this permanent disability assessed under the 1997 schedule appears thoroughly appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The WCAB adopted the WCJ\u2019s decision and report and denied Zenith reconsideration. However, Commissioner Brass disagreed that Zenith\u2019s duty to provide notice of permanent disability indemnity arose in 2004 under section 4061(a), but concluded that Dr. Fenton\u2019s December 28, 2004, report \u201cis a report by a treating physician indicating the existence of permanent disability. Therefore, the prior rating schedule applies in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Zenith petitions for writ of review and contends further that the new schedule applies because the notice of permanent disability indemnity under section 4660(d) was not required until the last payment of temporary disability indemnity in 2005 under the express language of section 4061(a). In addition, Dr. Fenton\u2019s report of December 28, 2004, is not substantial evidence permanent disability existed because it is a three-sentence conclusion and Cugini was not permanent and stationary.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Cugini answers that the former schedule is applicable because the requirement to provide notice of permanent disability indemnity arose when Zenith paid temporary disability indemnity in 2004. In addition, Dr. Fenton\u2019s supplemental report of December 28, 2004, is substantial evidence of the existence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>of permanent disability under section 4660(d) when read with his initial report of October 12, 2004. Moreover, numerous medical reports in 2004 indicated permanent disability existed. While section 4660(d) expressly refers to permanent disability, permanent and stationary status is not mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">1. <em>Standard of Review and Rules of Statutory Construction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\"><em>A </em>decision by the WCAB that is based on factual findings which are supported by substantial evidence is affirmed by the reviewing court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Substantial evidence generally means evidence that is credible, reasonable, and of solid value, which a reasonable mind might accept as probative on the issues and adequate to support a conclusion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A factual finding, order, decision or award is not based on substantial evidence if unreasonable, illogical, arbitrary, improbable, or inequitable considering the entire record and statutory scheme.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The reviewing court also may not isolate facts which support or disapprove of the WCAB\u2019s conclusions and ignore facts which rebut or explain the supporting evidence, but must examine the entire record.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Similarly, the reviewing court may not reweigh evidence or decide disputed facts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Interpretation of governing statutes or application of the law to undisputed facts is decided de novo by the reviewing court, even though the WCAB\u2019s interpretation is entitled to great weight unless clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Legislature\u2019s intent should be determined and given effect.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Legislature\u2019s intent is generally determined from the plain meaning of the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>language, unless the language or intent is uncertain or ambiguous.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Interpretation of the statutory language should be consistent and harmonized with the purpose of the statute and the statutory framework as a whole.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Where statutory language or the Legislature\u2019s intent is uncertain or ambiguous, rules of construction, legislative history or historical use aid in determining the meaning or intent.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">In addition, the reviewing court is obligated to liberally construe workers\u2019 compensation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, liberal construction under \u201cSection 3202 is a tool for resolving statutory ambiguity where it is not possible through other means to discern the Legislature\u2019s actual intent.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">2. <em>The 2004 Reform of Workers\u2019 Compensation Under Senate Bill No. 899</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">On April 19, 2004, the Legislature enacted a comprehensive reform of workers\u2019 compensation under Senate Bill No. 899 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) (Senate Bill 899). Senate Bill 899 was an urgency measure \u201cdesigned to alleviate a perceived crisis in skyrocketing workers\u2019 compensation costs,\u201d although some employee benefits increased.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Section 4660, which governs how the percentage of permanent disability is determined,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> was amended by the Legislature as part of the reform. Part of the amendment required a new schedule which incorporated the American Medical Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Impairment (5th ed.)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> on or before January 1, 2005.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The new schedule went into effect on January 1, 2005, superseding the former 1997 schedule.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> As with the 1997 schedule under former section 4660, subdivision (c), the new schedule applies prospectively to compensable injuries on or after the effective date under amended section 4660(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">However, section 4660(d) also provides that the new schedule applies to compensable claims arising before January 1, 2005, \u201cwhen there has been either no comprehensive medical-legal report or no report by a treating physician indicating the existence of permanent disability, or when the employer is not required to provide the notice required by Section 4061 to the injured worker.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u201cIn other words, when any of these three circumstances have occurred before January 1, 2005, the percentage of permanent disability will be calculated using the earlier schedule that was in effect on the date of the injury.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u201cOn the other hand, when <em>none </em>of the three circumstances has occurred before January 1, 2005, then the 2005 schedule applies.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>In many cases, application of the new schedule reduces the injured worker\u2019s permanent disability percentage, rating and compensation.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In this case, the parties stipulated that the permanent disability rating under the former schedule was 42 percent based on Dr. Fenton\u2019s opinion and 37 percent based on Dr. Ranter\u2019s opinion. Under the new schedule, both physicians reported 13 percent whole person impairment which the parties stipulated is a permanent disability rating of 22 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">3. <em>The Notice Under Section 4660(d) Is Required with the Last Payment of Temporary Disability Indemnity Under the Express Language of Section 4061(a)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Zenith contends that the new schedule applies under section 4660(d) because section 4061(a) expressly states that the notice of permanent disability indemnity is required with the last payment of temporary disability, and not the first payment in 2004 as determined by the WCJ. Zenith argues that the WCJ\u2019s application of the former schedule is contrary to the Legislature\u2019s intent to include as many cases as possible under the workers\u2019 compensation reform.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Cugini contends that the WCJ\u2019s application of sections 4660(d) and 4061(a) and the former schedule is correct, as confirmed by <em>Pendergrass v. Duggan Plumbing </em>(2007) 72 Cal.Comp.Cases 95, 98 <em>(Pendergrass I). </em>In <em>Pendergrass </em>/, the WCAB in bank concluded that the former schedule applied under section 4660(d), because the duty to provide notice of permanent disability indemnity arises with the first payment of temporary disability indemnity, and execution of the duty occurs with the last payment under section 4061(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">We conclude that the notice requirement is not triggered with the first payment of temporary disability indemnity simply because the notice will be required once temporary disability indemnity has been paid. The plain and unambiguous language of section 4061(a) states that notice of permanent disability indemnity shall be provided by the employer \u201c[t]ogether with the last payment of temporary disability indemnity.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Moreover, <em>Pendergrass I </em>was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>not final when the decision was reversed on reconsideration by <em>Pendergrass </em>v. <em>Duggan Plumbing </em>(2007) 72 Cal.Comp.Cases 456 <em>(Pendergrass </em>77),<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and is not binding on this court in any case.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In addition, appellate courts that have interpreted section 4660(d) with section 4061(a) have concluded that the notice is required with the last payment of temporary disability indemnity.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> To find that the notice requirement is triggered upon payment of temporary disability indemnity would render the other two exceptions under section 4660(d) virtually meaningless,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and violate the Legislature\u2019s expressed intent to include specified claims under the new or former schedule.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Therefore, the notice exception to applying the new schedule under section 4660(d) was not satisfied by Zenith\u2019s payment of temporary disability indemnity in 2004 where the last payment was after January 1, 2005, and the decision must be annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">4. A <em>Treating Physician\u2019s or Other Qualifying Report Indicating the Existence of Permanent Disability Under Section 4660(d) Must Be Substantial Evidence in Light of the Entire Record</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Zenith also contends that the new schedule applies because Dr. Fenton\u2019s report of December 28, 2004, is a three-sentence conclusion that permanent disability exists, which is unsupported by the history, facts, a diagnosis or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>reasoning and is not substantial evidence under <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1311, 1315 [53 Cal.Rptr.3d 568] <em>(State Fund) </em>(new schedule applies where physician\u2019s 2004 report indicating the existence of permanent disability under \u00a7 4660(d) not substantial evidence). Cugini contends that Dr. Fenton\u2019s report should be read with his initial report of October 12, 2004, and there are numerous medical reports indicating the existence of permanent disability under section 4660(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">We conclude that determining whether Dr. Fenton\u2019s December 28, 2004, report is substantial evidence \u201cindicating the existence of permanent disability\u201d under section 4660(d), or there are other qualifying medical reports, should be based on the entire record.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Although the court in <em>State Fund </em>determined that the treating physician\u2019s report, consisting of the single sentence \u201c T believe permanent disability is within reasonable medical probability emanating from this injury . . . ,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> was not substantial evidence, the court considered the physician\u2019s previous medical reports in reaching its conclusion. The court explained that, \u201cNothing in the reports, however, appears to tie the range of motion and pain symptoms to Dr. Morales\u2019s December 15, 2004 prediction of permanent disability. To the contrary, the reports make no mention at all of prognosis, but instead simply declare that Echeverr\u00eda remained temporarily totally disabled. None of the reports provide any reasoning to support Dr. Morales\u2019s December 15, 2004 conclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">However, the circumstances in this case are very different than the situation described in <em>State Fund. </em>The history, facts and diagnosis of L2-3 disc herniation were documented in Dr. Fenton\u2019s report of October 12, 2004, and are supported by objective findings such as the positive MRI. The consulting neurosurgeon also confirmed the need for back surgery before Dr. Fenton\u2019s report of December 28, 2004. The WCJ and Commissioner Brass indicated that the record provided the reasoning for Dr. Fenton\u2019s opinion in 2004 that permanent disability existed within the meaning of section 4660(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">However, it is well settled that the finding of permanent disability is a question of fact,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and the two other commissioners on the WCAB panel in this case applied the former schedule based on an incorrect interpretation of the notice provision of section 4660(d) and did not decide the issue. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Accordingly, whether Dr. Fenton\u2019s report \u201cindicating the existence of permanent disability\u201d under section 4660(d) is substantial evidence in light of the entire record, or there is any other qualifying medical report, should be decided on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">5. <em>The Injured Worker\u2019s Condition Need Not Be Permanent and Stationary for the Comprehensive Medical-legal or Treating Physician\u2019s Report to Indicate the Existence of Permanent Disability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Zenith further contends that permanent disability did not exist as reported by Dr. Fenton on December 28, 2004, because Cugini\u2019s condition was not permanent and stationary. As indicated by Dr. Fenton and the WCJ, Cugini reached permanent and stationary status in December 2005. If Zenith is correct that a permanent and stationary status is required under section 4660(d), then the new schedule would necessarily apply to Cugini\u2019s permanent disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Zenith relies on <em>Vera, supra, </em>154 Cal.App.4th 996, which applied the new schedule because \u201cthe treating physician\u2019s report must indicate that the claimant has a ratable disability that has reached permanent and stationary status, and that in enacting section 4660, subdivision (d), the Legislature was using the term \u2018permanent disability\u2019 as another way of referring to the status of having a ratable disability that is \u2018permanent and stationary.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The <em>Vera </em>court was persuaded that the terms \u201cpermanent and stationary\u201d and \u201cpermanent disability\u201d are interchangeable under section 4660(d) because applicable regulations define identically \u201cpermanent and stationary status\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and when \u201c[a] disability is considered permanent.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> (See <em>Vera, supra, </em>154 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1005-1007.) In addition, the treating physician is not required to report permanent disability under the applicable schedule until permanent and stationary status is achieved pursuant to California Code of Regulations, title 8, section 9785, subdivision (g).<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> (See <em>Vera, supra, </em>154 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1005-1007.)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>For reasons we expressed in <em>Genlyte, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.4th 705, we conclude that the terms \u201cpermanent disability\u201d and \u201cpermanent and stationary\u201d are not interchangeable, and a permanent and stationary status is not required in order for the comprehensive medical-legal or treating physician\u2019s report to indicate the existence of permanent disability under section 4660(d). The term \u201cpermanent disability,\u201d although not defined in the Labor Code,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> has been historically defined in workers\u2019 compensation jurisprudence as the impairment of earning capacity, impairment of the normal use of a body member or function, or a competitive handicap in the open labor market.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The Legislature has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to distinguish the terms \u201cpermanent disability\u201d and \u201cpermanent and stationary\u201d in this area of the law when that is what it intends. Section 4061, subdivision (a)(2) requires the employer to provide \u201cNotice that permanent disability indemnity may be or is payable, but that the amount cannot be determined because the employee\u2019s medical condition is not yet permanent and stationary. The notice shall advise the employee that his or her medical condition will be monitored until it is permanent and stationary . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> As Cugini points out, the Legislature only used the term \u201cpermanent disability\u201d and not the term \u201cpermanent and stationary\u201d in section 4660(d).  \u201cWe are reluctant to conclude that the Legislature\u2019s use of different terms, at different times in the statutory scheme, is meaningless.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Moreover, section 4660(d) is worded broadly to include any comprehensive medical-legal or treating physician\u2019s report \u201cindicating the existence of permanent disability.\u201d The language is not limited to what the <em>Vera </em>court describes as the typical final or permanent and stationary report,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> in which the extent of ratable permanent disability is reported.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> In an appropriate case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>a physician is not precluded from reporting that permanent disability exists prior to permanent and stationary status or the extent of ratable permanent disability is known.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">By providing for notice of permanent disability indemnity that may be or is payable before the employee\u2019s medical condition is permanent and stationary under section 4061, subdivision (a)(2), the Legislature acknowledged that permanent disability may exist and be reported by physicians in order for employers to provide the required notice before permanent and stationary status is achieved. Similarly, the claims administrator must provide notice of permanent disability indemnity that is or may be payable even though the employee\u2019s medical condition is not yet permanent and stationary under California Code of Regulations, title 8, section 9812, subdivision (g).<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Recognition by the Legislature under the statutory scheme that permanent disability may exist before there is permanent and stationary status is also consistent with case law. In instances of insidious and progressive occupational diseases, such as from exposure to asbestos, permanent disability may be rated and indemnity advances ordered before the employee\u2019s medical condition is permanent and stationary, with jurisdiction reserved pending permanent and stationary status or permanent total disability.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>disability before permanent and stationary status may also be found in cases involving serious injuries, such as severe bums, deafness or the loss of sight or limbs.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">Therefore, the terms \u201cpermanent disability\u201d and \u201cpermanent and stationary\u201d status are not used interchangeably under the statutory scheme and case law, nor did the Legislature indicate in section 4660(d) or Senate Bill 899 that such use was intended. We therefore conclude that a permanent and stationary status is not required in order for the comprehensive medical-legal or treating physician\u2019s report to indicate the existence of permanent disability under section 4660(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">6. <em>Remand to the WCAB Is Necessary to Determine If Dr. Fenton\u2019s December 28, 2004, Report, or Any Other Qualifying Medical Report, Indicates the Existence of Permanent Disability Under Section 4660(d)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">As we have previously explained, two commissioners on the WCAB panel in this case applied the former schedule based on the incorrect interpretation of the notice provision in section 4660(d), and did not determine whether there is a comprehensive medical-legal or treating physician\u2019s report indicating the existence of permanent disability as did the WCJ and Commissioner Brass.
