Saxena died in February 2003 after seeking treatment from Dr. Willie H. Goffney for an open wound on his right leg. Plaintiffs brought a wrongful death action against Goffney (and others involved in Saxena\u2019s medical care) for wrongful death, negligence, and battery. The jury concluded Goffney was negligent in the diagnosis or treatment of Saxena and that he performed a procedure on Saxena without his \u201cinformed consent.\u201d The jury awarded plaintiffs $12.1 million in noneconomic damages, over $600,000 in economic damages, and allocated 100 percent of the fault to Goffney.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">Goffney moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) on plaintiffs\u2019 battery claim. He also moved for a new trial and to conform the judgment to the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act (MICRA). Despite concluding the special verdict form\u2014prepared by plaintiffs and given at their request\u2014did not require the jury to determine whether Goffney committed a battery, the court denied the JNOV motion. Instead, it granted a new trial on plaintiffs\u2019 battery and informed consent negligence claims, and on damages. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>The court denied Goffney\u2019s motion for new trial on plaintiffs\u2019 negligence cause of action and declined to consider Goffney\u2019s MICRA motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Goffney appeals the denial of his JNOV motion. Plaintiffs cross-appeal the order partially granting a new trial. In a separate petition, Goffney seeks a writ of mandate and/or prohibition compelling the court to grant his motion for new trial on plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claim. We consolidate the writ petition with the appeals to promote judicial efficiency and avoid piecemeal adjudication of the issues.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">We conclude the court should have granted Goffney\u2019s JNOV motion. Accordingly, we reverse the JNOV and new trial orders. We remand with directions to grant Goffney\u2019s JNOV motion on the battery claim, to consider Goffney\u2019s MICRA motion, and to enter the resulting judgment for plaintiffs on the negligence claims and for Goffney on the battery claim. We deny Goffney\u2019s writ petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">In January 2003, Saxena sought treatment from Goffney at the La Palma Wound Center (Wound Center) for an open wound in his right leg. The plan was for Goffney, a general surgeon, to perform a series of debridements\u2014a surgical procedure used to remove dead or infected tissue from an open wound\u2014on Saxena\u2019s leg. Goffney would then cover the wound with Apligraf, a synthetic skin-like substitute, to promote healing. During his initial appointment with Goffney, Saxena signed a consent form authorizing Goffney to evaluate, assess, and treat his wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">Goffney performed debridements on January 13, 23, and 27. By early February, however, Saxena\u2019s heath declined: The wound on his leg was bleeding constantly; he was using crutches; he had a fever; and he was having difficulty breathing. During an appointment on February 3, Saxena complained to Goffney that he had chills and a fever. Goffney concluded Saxena had the flu and performed another debridement. Saxena\u2019s wife, Neelofer Saxena, took Saxena to the emergency room on February 5 because he continued to have a fever.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">Saxena was scheduled to return to the Wound Center on February 10 for the final debridement and Apligraf application. That morning, Neelofer felt Saxena\u2019s health was getting \u201cworse and worse\u201d so she tried, unsuccessfully, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>to reschedule the appointment. At the request of a nurse in Goffney\u2019s office, Neelofer brought Saxena to the Wound Center that evening. According to Neelofer, she listened as Saxena told Goffney he wanted to postpone the debridement and Apligraf procedure. Neelofer also testified she \u201cbegged and pleaded\u201d for Goffney to postpone the procedure until her husband regained his strength. In response, Goffney explained he would have to throw out the Apligraf\u2014which cost $1,200\u2014if he did not use it that day. He debrided the wound, applied the Apligraf, and sent Saxena and Neelofer home. Saxena died the following day of congestive heart failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Plaintiffs alleged wrongful death and negligence claims against Goffney and others. The first amended complaint added a battery claim against Goffney. The battery cause of action alleged Goffney \u201cperformed medical procedures on [Saxena] without his informed consent. These medical procedures included intentional, unlawful and harmful contact by said Defendants.\u201d Plaintiffs further alleged \u201c[a]s a direct and proximate result of the battery [Saxena] suffered injuries resulting in death.\u201d The court overruled Goffney\u2019s demurrer to the battery claim, concluding the allegations were sufficient to state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Trial proceeded against Goffney only. After the close of evidence, Goffney moved for a nonsuit on plaintiffs\u2019 battery claim. The court denied the motion. The court then gave the jury two instructions on the battery claim. The first instruction, based on former Judicial Council of California Civil Jury Instructions (2006) CACI No. 530, recited the elements of battery as follows; \u201cPlaintiffs claim that [Goffney] committed a battery. To establish this claim, Plaintiffs must prove all of the following: [][] 1. That [Goffney] performed a medical procedure without [Saxena\u2019s] consent; [][] 2. That [Saxena] was harmed; and [][] 3. That [Goffney\u2019s] conduct was a substantial factor in causing [Saxena\u2019s] harm, [f] A patient can consent to a medical procedure by words or conduct.\u201d Over Goffney\u2019s objection, the court also gave the jury a special instruction on plaintiffs\u2019 battery claim which provided: \u201cIf you find that [Goffney] performed a surgical procedure on [Saxena] or provided other medical treatment to [Saxena] without his informed consent, you may find [Goffney] liable for battery, even if you find that the surgery was skillfully performed and he was not negligent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The court presented plaintiffs\u2019 version of the special verdict form to the jury. The special verdict form asked the jury to answer the following questions: (1) \u201cWas [Goffney] negligent in the diagnosis or treatment of [Saxena]?\u201d; (2) \u201cWas [Goffney\u2019s] negligence a substantial factor in causing the death of [Saxena]?\u201d; (3) \u201cDid [Goffney] perform a debridement and Apligraf procedure on [Saxena] on February 10, 2003?\u201d; (4) \u201cDid [Saxena] give his informed consent for the debridement and Apligraf procedure on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>February 10, 2003?\u201d; (5) \u201cWould a reasonable person in [Saxena\u2019s] position have refused the debridement and Apligraf procedure if he or she had been fully informed of the possible results and risks of the procedure, and alternatives to the procedure?\u201d; (6) \u201cWould [Saxena] have consented to the . . . procedure performed on him on February 10, 2003 even if he had been given enough information about the risks of the procedure?\u201d; and (7) \u201cWas [Saxena] harmed as a consequence of a result or risk that [Goffney] should have explained before the debridement and Apligraf procedure was performed?\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Questions eight through 14 of the special verdict form asked the jury to calculate plaintiffs\u2019 damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The jury returned a verdict for plaintiffs. It concluded Goffney was negligent in the diagnosis or treatment of Saxena and that Goffney performed the debridement and Apligraf procedure on February 10 without Saxena\u2019s informed consent. The jury also determined Saxena would have refused the debridement and Apligraf procedure on February 10 had he been fully informed of the possible risks of, and the alternatives to, the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">After the verdict was rendered but before judgment was entered, Goffney moved for JNOV on plaintiffs\u2019 battery claim and for a new trial. Goffney also filed a motion to conform the judgment to MICRA. The court denied the JNOV motion. Instead, it ordered a new trial on the battery and lack of informed consent negligence claims, and on damages. The court concluded the special verdict form did not require the jury to make a finding on battery and that plaintiffs\u2019 special jury instruction was \u201cmanifestly prejudicial\u201d to Goffney because it improperly blended the legal doctrines of battery and negligence. The court also determined the damages award could not stand because of the instructional error, the deficiencies in the special verdict form, and the jury\u2019s failure to apportion damages between the battery and negligence claims. The court denied Goffney\u2019s new trial motion on plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">\n<em>The Court\u2019s Denial of Goffney\u2019s JNOV Motion Was Erroneous</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">We turn first to the court\u2019s denial of Goffney\u2019s JNOV motion. As an initial matter, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the court\u2019s denial of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>motion is not appealable because the issue of damages \u201cremain[s] before the trial court for determination.\u201d An appeal may be taken from an order denying a motion for JNOV even where the trial court has granted, or denied, a new trial motion. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 629, 904.1, subd. (a)(4); see also Eisenberg et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Appeals and Writs (The Rutter Group 2007) | 2:146, p. 2-72.4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Goffney contends the court\u2019s denial of his JNOV motion was erroneous because there was insufficient evidence he committed battery or intended to harm Saxena. We need not reach these issues because we agree with Goffney\u2019s third basis for reversal: The jury\u2019s special verdict did not include any findings on plaintiffs\u2019 battery cause of action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\n<em>The Informed Consent Doctrine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">To place the issues in context, we briefly discuss the distinction between negligence and battery as set out by the California Supreme Court in <em>Cobbs v. Grant </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 229, 241-242 [104 Cal.Rptr. 505, 502 P.2d 1] <em>(Cobbs). </em>An action \u201cshould be pleaded in negligence\u201d when the doctor performs an operation to which plaintiff consents, but without disclosing sufficient information about the risks inherent in the surgery. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 240-241.) \u201cThe battery theory should be reserved for those circumstances when a doctor performs an operation to which the patient has not consented.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 240.)</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Our high court has made it clear that battery and lack of informed consent are separate causes of action. A claim based on lack of informed consent\u2014which sounds in negligence\u2014arises when the doctor performs a procedure without first adequately disclosing the risks and alternatives. In contrast, a battery is an intentional tort that occurs when a doctor performs a procedure without obtaining any consent. (See, e.g., <em>Conte v. Girard Orthopaedic Surgeons Medical Group, Inc. </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1266 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 855] [a battery \u201cis an intentional and offensive touching of a person who has not consented to the touching\u201d]; <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Shaw </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 658, 664 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 70] [doctor committed battery\u2014a claim distinct from professional negligence\u2014when he \u201cperformed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>an operation to which [plaintiff] did not consent\u201d]; <em>Warren v. Schecter </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1189, 1194 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 573] [discussing statute of limitations for \u201cmedical malpractice action arising out of a failure to obtain informed consent to surgery\u201d]; <em>Nelson v. Gaunt </em>(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 623, 634 [178 Cal.Rptr. 167] [battery \u201cshould be reserved for those circumstances where a doctor performs an operation to which the patient has not consented\u201d].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\n<em>The Special Verdict Form Was Fatally Defective Because It Did Not Require the Jury to Make a Finding on Plaintiffs\u2019 Battery Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">We analyze the special verdict form de novo. <em>(City of San Diego v. D.R. Horton San Diego Holding Co., Inc. </em>(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 668, 678 [24 Cal.Rptr.3d 338] [\u201c \u2018[A] special verdict\u2019s correctness must be analyzed as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d].) A \u201cspecial verdict must present the conclusions of fact as established by the evidence, and not the evidence to prove them; and those conclusions of fact must be so presented as that nothing shall remain to the Court but to draw from them conclusions of law.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 624.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018The requirement that the jury must resolve every controverted issue is one of the recognized pitfalls of special verdicts. \u201c[T]he possibility of a defective or incomplete special verdict, or possibly no verdict at all, is much greater than with a general verdict that is tested by special findings <em>(Myers Building Industries, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Interface Technology, Inc. </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 949, 960 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 242] <em>(Myers); </em>see also <em>Falls v. Superior Court </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 851, 854-855 [239 Cal.Rptr. 862] <em>(Falls).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">A special verdict is \u201cfatally defective\u201d if it does not allow the jury to resolve every controverted issue. <em>(Fuller-Austin Insulation Co. v. Highlands Ins. Co. </em>(2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 958, 1005-1006 [38 Cal.Rptr.3d 716] <em>(Fuller-Austin); Myers, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th 949, 959-960.) <em>Myers </em>is instructive. There, the owner of a building and its general contractor filed cross-complaints against each other for breach of contract, fraud, and other claims. By special verdict, the jury concluded the building owner breached its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>contract with the general contractor, and awarded the general contractor punitive damages. <em>(Myers, </em>at p. 956.) The Court of Appeal struck the punitive damages award because \u201c[n]o special verdict findings were submitted to the jury on any cause of action except breach of contract, even though [the general contractor] had pleaded a cause of action against [the building owner] for . . . fraud.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 958.) According to the <em>Myers </em>court, the punitive damages award could not be sustained because the jury \u201cwas neither requested to nor [made] the necessary factual findings\u201d for a tort verdict. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 960.)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><em>Fuller-Austin, supra, </em>135 Cal.App.4th at pages 1005-1006, reached a similar result. That case concerned the reasonableness of an insured\u2019s bankruptcy settlement and the effect of its reorganization plan on its excess insurers. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the insured, and a jury calculated the amount of the insurers\u2019 liability. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 966.) The appellate court reversed the jury\u2019s liability findings. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1006.) It concluded the special verdict form was \u201cfatally defective\u201d because it \u201cdid not require the jury to make any finding on the issue of [the] reasonableness\u201d of the reorganization plan. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1005.) As the <em>Fuller-Austin </em>court explained, \u201c[T]he jury\u2019s finding that [the insured] was not guilty of inequitable misconduct did not answer the distinctly different question of whether the Plan was unreasonable.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1006.)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The same is true here. The jury concluded Goffney performed the debridement and Apligraf procedure on February 10 without Saxena\u2019s \u201cinformed consent\u201d by answering \u201cno\u201d to the following question: \u201cDid [Saxena] give his <em>informed consent </em>for the debridement and Apligraf procedure performed on February 10, 2003?\u201d (Italics added.) The special verdict form did not require the jury to answer the separate and distinct question of whether Goffney performed the procedure with \u201cno consent\u201d at all. Because the special verdict form did not require the jury to make a finding on battery, it \u201cis like a puzzle with pieces missing; the picture is not complete.\u201d <em>(Falls, supra, </em>194 Cal.App.3d at p. 855.)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Plaintiffs offer several arguments urging us to overlook the deficiencies in the special verdict form, all of which fail. First, plaintiffs contend the use of the phrase \u201cinformed consent\u201d in question four of the verdict form \u201cmade no functional difference\u201d because lack of informed consent and lack of any consent are the same. This argument has no merit for the reasons discussed above. Moreover, the related questions on the verdict form dealt with lack of informed consent, not the lack of any consent. Thus, the jury found a reasonable person in Saxena\u2019s position would have refused the procedure if he or she had been fully informed of the risks, and Saxena would not have consented to the procedure had he been given enough information about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>risks. Further, the cases plaintiffs cite to support their contention are inapposite because they either concern conditional consent, a theory plaintiffs did not pursue here, or address situations where a doctor\u2019s fraudulent misrepresentations about a proposed procedure vitiated the patient\u2019s consent. (See <em>Ashcraft </em>v. <em>King </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 604, 609-610 [278 Cal.Rptr. 900]; <em>Rains </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 150 Cal.App.3d 933, 938 [198 Cal.Rptr. 249].)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Plaintiffs also contend the \u201conly interpretation [of the verdict] consistent with the evidence\u201d is the jury concluded Saxena did not consent to the procedure. We disagree. At plaintiffs\u2019 request, the court instructed the jury it could find Goffney liable for battery if he performed the procedure without Saxena\u2019s <em>informed </em>consent. This instruction conflated the theories of negligence and battery: It allowed the jury to find Goffney liable for battery by concluding he performed the procedure without Saxena\u2019s consent, or by concluding Saxena consented without sufficient information.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Performing a medical procedure without informed consent is not the same as performing a procedure without any consent. But the verdict form read as a whole unmistakably relates to the lack of informed consent. Because it is impossible to determine how the jury would have resolved the battery issue had it been instructed properly and had it been asked to answer the question of whether Goffney performed a procedure without Saxena\u2019s consent, we will not \u201c \u2018 \u201cspeculate upon the basis of the verdict.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Bracisco v. Beech Aircraft Corp. </em>(1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 1101, 1108 [206 Cal.Rptr. 431].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Instead, we will read the verdict to mean what it says. The jury found Goffney did not have Saxena\u2019s informed consent when Goffney performed the procedure on February 10 and that Saxena would not have consented to the procedure had he been given enough information about the risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">We also reject plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Goffney waived his right to challenge the special verdict form. Goffney is not challenging the special verdict form as such. He merely argues the verdict form submitted by plaintiffs, and the verdict returned by the jury, does not support entry of judgment on a battery theory. Moreover, courts have declined to apply the waiver rule \u201cwhere the record indicates that the failure to object was not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>result of a desire to reap a \u2018technical advantage\u2019 or engage in a \u2018litigious strategy.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Woodcock v. Fontana Scaffolding &amp; Equip. Co. </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 452, 456, fn. 2 [72 Cal.Rptr. 217, 445 P.2d 881]; see 7 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Trial, \u00a7 385, pp. 438-439 [\u201cfailure to raise the objection [to special verdict form] does not always result in a waiver; some element of negligence or culpability must appear\u201d].) There is no waiver here because Goffney raised the issue in the trial court. He alerted the court to the difference between medical negligence and battery in his demurrer to plaintiffs\u2019 battery cause of action and he also objected to plaintiffs\u2019 special jury instruction on the grounds that it \u201cconfuses [the issue of] informed consent with battery.\u201d As defense counsel explained, under <em>Cobbs, </em>\u201clack of informed consent is medical negligence. Lack of consent, period, is a battery in the medical context. [The special jury instruction] tends to equate both of those\u201d legal theories. Goffney also raised the error in his motion for new trial. Although he did not object to the phrase \u201cinformed consent\u201d in the special verdict form, there is no indication Goffney failed to object as part of a litigation strategy or to gain a technical advantage. He tried, but failed, to persuade the court it was allowing plaintiffs to conflate the distinct legal theories of negligence and battery. It was plaintiffs\u2019 responsibility to tender their case to the jury. If plaintiffs chose to submit a verdict form tendering less than their full case to the jury, Goffney had no further incentive to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Plaintiffs cite <em>Jensen v. BMW of North America, Inc. </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 131 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 295] <em>(Jensen), </em>for the proposition that a party always waives any error regarding a special verdict form by failing to object to it before the court discharges the jury. In <em>Jensen, </em>a jury awarded damages for BMW\u2019s failure to comply with the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (Act; Civ. Code, \u00a7 1790 et seq.). The trial court denied BMW\u2019s motion for new trial and BMW appealed, contending the special verdict form was defective because it \u201cfailed to submit for jury resolution the primary issue of BMW\u2019s liability under the Act.\u201d (35 Cal.App.4th at p. 131.) The Court of Appeal affirmed, holding the special verdict form was not prejudicially defective and, in any event, BMW had waived its right to challenge the form by not objecting before the jury was discharged. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\"><em>Jensen </em>is inapposite. There, the jury was allowed to award damages without first being asked if BMW was liable for violating the Act. BMW wanted the jury to find it was liable before awarding damages, but it did not ensure the question was in the verdict form. Here, and unlike BMW, Goffney did not want the jury to conclude he committed a battery, so he had no obligation to ensure that questions on the verdict form addressed plaintiffs\u2019 battery claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 next contention\u2014that the invited error doctrine precludes Goffney from challenging the special verdict form\u2014is also unavailing. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>\u201c \u2018doctrine of invited error\u2019 is an \u2018application of the estoppel principle\u2019: \u2018Where a party by his conduct induces the commission of error, he is estopped from asserting it as a ground for reversal\u2019 on appeal.\u201d <em>(Norgart </em>v. <em>Upjohn Co. </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 383, 403 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 453, 981 P.2d 79] <em>(Norgart).) </em>The purpose of the doctrine is to \u201cprevent a party from misleading the trial court and then profiting therefrom in the appellate court.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>Plaintiffs, not Goffney, invited the error. The jury did nothing more than follow the explicit instructions in the special verdict form, which plaintiffs\u2019 counsel prepared. If plaintiffs wanted the jury to answer additional questions when navigating the special verdict form, they should have included them. They did not and, as a result, they are bound by the defective special verdict form. <em>(Myers, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at p. 960, fn. 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">We note Goffney submitted a similar verdict form. But Goffney had already lost his argument on plaintiffs\u2019 erroneous special battery instruction and his motion for a nonsuit had already been denied. Plaintiffs were responsible for pursuing an erroneous battery theory both in the special instruction and in the verdict form. Plaintiffs received what they asked for: A verdict establishing liability for medical negligence and nothing more. Even if we assume, for the sake of argument, that Goffney caused the defective verdict form, the invited error doctrine does not apply. The doctrine does not extend to situations where a party induces the commission of the error, but does \u201cnot in fact mislead the trial court in any way\u2014as where a party \u2018 \u201c \u2018endeavor[s] to make the best of a bad situation for which [it] was not responsible.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Norgart, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 403; see also <em>Huffman v. Interstate Brands Corp. </em>(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 679, 706 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 397] [\u201cthe invited error doctrine requires affirmative conduct demonstrating a deliberate tactical choice on the part of the challenging party . . .\u201d]; <em>De Anza Santa Cruz Mobile Estates Homeowners Assn. </em>v. <em>De Anza Santa Cruz Mobile Estates </em>(2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 890, 908 [114 Cal.Rptr.2d 708].) Here, there is no evidence Goffney made a deliberate tactical choice to keep quiet about the verdict form at trial and then profit from it on appeal, nor is there any evidence Goffney misled the trial court. In fact, the opposite is true: Goffney repeatedly\u2014but unsuccessfully\u2014advised the court about the differences between lack of any consent and lack of informed consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The court below was troubled by the failure of the special verdict form to address plaintiffs\u2019 battery claim. In its order denying the JNOV motion, the court noted the distinction between negligence and battery and \u201cthe absence, in the special verdict, of any findings that defendant committed a battery, even though the jury was presented with evidence of that intentional tort.\u201d The court\u2019s analysis of the problem was correct. Its solution, however, was not. The proper way to remedy the defective verdict was to grant Goffney\u2019s motion for JNOV on plaintiffs\u2019 battery claim, not to order a new trial. (See <em>Myers, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at p. 960, fn. 8.) \u201cThe grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>for a new trial are wholly statutory, and there is no inherent power in the trial court to grant a new trial.\u201d (8 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Attack on Judgment in Trial Court, \u00a7 19, p. 524.) Simply put, Goffney\u2019s claim that the special verdict form did not include a finding on plaintiffs\u2019 battery claim was not a ground for a new trial under any provision of section 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\n<em>The Court\u2019s Denial of Goffney\u2019s Motion for New Trial Was Not an Abuse of Discretion; The Court\u2019s Exclusion of Two Defense Witnesses Was Harmless Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The court declined to grant a new trial on plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claim because it concluded the errors in the verdict form and special jury instruction \u201cdid not infect the jury\u2019s finding that [Goffney] breached the standard of care; nor was there any irregularity in that finding.\u201d The court also determined it properly excluded the testimony of Dr. Gary Flashner and nurse James Palmer, two defense witnesses. In his writ petition, Goffney contends a new trial on the negligence claim will \u201ccure the evidentiary error of excluding [Flashner and Palmer].\u201d Goffney contends Flashner and Palmer \u201cwould have rebutted plaintiffs\u2019 testimony . . . that . . . Saxena was not a candidate for surgery.\u201d Specifically, Goffney argues Flashner (who treated Saxena during his February 5 emergency room visit) would have testified Saxena did not display any symptoms of congestive heart failure. Palmer, who apparently was present during the February 10 debridement and Apligraf procedure, would have testified Saxena was breathing normally and that neither Saxena nor Neelofer asked Goffney to postpone the procedure.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The court\u2019s exclusion of Flashner and Palmer stemmed from Goffney\u2019s failure to identify them during discovery. Plaintiffs served Judicial Council of California Form Interrogatory No. 12.1 (Interrogatory 12.1), which asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Goffney to provide the name, address, and telephone number for each individual who \u201cwitnessed the incident or the events occurring immediately before or after the incident\u201d; \u201cwho made any statement at the scene of the incident\u201d; \u201cwho heard any statements made about the incident by any individual at the scene\u201d; or who \u201chas knowledge of the incident.\u201d In response, Goffney stated he was \u201cnot aware of any witnesses to decedent\u2019s medical care other than those individuals identified in her [\u00bfvc] medical records.\u201d Goffney also failed to identify Flashner and Palmer in response to Judicial Council of California Form Interrogatory No. 15.1 (Interrogatory 15.1), which asked Goffney to list all witnesses having information supporting his denial of all material allegations and his affirmative defenses. In his response to that interrogatory, Goffney stated, \u201cit is anticipated that some or these entire affirmative defense <em>[sic] </em>will be supported by documents in [yz'c] decedent\u2019s medical records that are available to all parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Ten days before trial, apparently as part of the pretrial \u201cissue conference\u201d required by local court rule, plaintiffs served a motion in limine for an order excluding the testimony of \u201cwitnesses not identified in discovery.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The motion was nonspecific; neither Flashner, nor Palmer, nor any other potential witness was identified. Also, apparently as part of the same issue conference pursuant to local rule, Goffney listed Flashner and Palmer on his trial witness list. On the first day of trial, Goffney served a supplemental response to Interrogatory 12.1 listing 16 names, including Flashner and Palmer, but failing to provide their contact information. The record on appeal does not contain any information regarding the court\u2019s ruling, if any, on the motion in limine, but Goffney\u2019s counsel referred to the anticipated testimony of Flashner and Palmer during his opening statement without objection by plaintiffs. Near the conclusion of plaintiffs\u2019 case, however, when Goffney announced that Flashner and Palmer would be his witnesses for the next day, plaintiffs objected. After hearing argument, the court excluded the testimony of both witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In his motion for new trial, Goffney argued excluding Flashner and Palmer was \u201chighly prejudicial\u201d because they would have \u201crebutted [plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Mr. Saxena\u2019s health was so impaired that the debridement and Apligraf procedure should not have been performed.\u201d Goffney also claimed his failure to list Flashner and Palmer in his interrogatory responses was not a \u201c[m]is-use[] of the discovery process\u201d under section 2023.010. Presumably relying on <em>Thoren </em>v. <em>Johnston &amp; Washer </em>(1972) 29 Cal.App.3d 270, 274 [105 Cal.Rptr. 276] <em>(Thoren), </em>the court concluded that excluding Flashner and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Palmer\u2014whom it characterized as witnesses with regard to the two issues that were \u201camong the most important at the trial\u201d\u2014was proper because their identities were \u201cwell known\u201d to Goffney when he responded to plaintiffs\u2019 interrogatories and because Goffney \u201cunjustifiably failed to list them in his responses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\u201c \u2018Broadly speaking, an appellate court reviews any ruling by a trial court as to the admissibility of evidence for abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People ex rel. Lockyer v. Sun Pacific Farming Co. </em>(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 619, 639 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 115].) The court\u2019s \u201c \u2018discretion is only abused where there is a clear showing [it] exceeded the bounds of reason, all of the circumstances being considered.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 640.) Even where a trial court improperly excludes evidence, the error does not require reversal of the judgment unless the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 13.) Goffney has the burden to demonstrate it is reasonably probable a more favorable result would have been reached absent the error. (\u00a7 475; <em>Tudor Ranches, Inc. v. State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1431-1432 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 574] <em>(Tudor Ranches).) </em>As we discuss below, the court abused its discretion by excluding the testimony of Flashner and Palmer. But we cannot, on the record before us, conclude the court\u2019s exclusion of the two defense witnesses was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Precluding a witness from testifying at trial is proper where a party <em>willfully and falsely </em>withholds or conceals a witness\u2019s name in response to an interrogatory. <em>(Thoren, supra, </em>29 Cal.App.3d at p. 274.) \u201cWhere the party served with an interrogatory asking the names of witnesses to an occurrence then known to him deprives his adversary of that information by a <em>willfully false response, </em>he subjects the adversary to unfair surprise at trial.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (29 Cal.App.3d at p. 274, italics added.) Under these circumstances, \u201can order barring the testimony of the witness must be sustained as a sanction . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">We note <em>Thoren </em>\u201cdoes not stand for the proposition that evidence may be excluded based on the mere failure to supplement or amend an interrogatory answer that was truthful when originally served.\u201d <em>(Biles </em>v. <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. </em>(2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1325 [22 Cal.Rptr.3d 282]; see also <em>R &amp;B Auto Center, Inc. v. Farmers Group, Inc. </em>(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 327, 356-357 [44 Cal.Rptr.3d 426].) Nor does <em>Thoren </em>stand for the proposition that evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>may be excluded on the ground an interrogatory answer is evasive or incomplete. The Civil Discovery Act (\u00a7 2016.010 et seq.) provides specific remedies for evasive or incomplete discovery responses. The imposition of an evidence sanction is not one of the remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Section 2030.300, subdivision (a)(1), provides that the party propounding an interrogatory may file a motion to compel a further response where the answer received is \u201cevasive or incomplete.\u201d And the failure timely to file a motion to compel a further response to an evasive or incomplete answer constitutes a waiver of any right to a further response. (\u00a7 2030.300, subd. (c).) The prevailing party on a motion to compel further responses is limited to an award of monetary sanctions. (\u00a7 2030.300, subd. (d).) An evidence sanction is available <em>only </em>where the responding party \u201cfails to obey an order compelling further response to interrogatories.\u201d (\u00a7 2030.300, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The Civil Discovery Act also warns, however, that the failure to respond to discovery, or the making of evasive responses to discovery, is not condoned. The \u201c[f]ail[ure] to respond ... to an authorized method of discovery\u201d (\u00a7 2023.010, subd. (d)), and \u201c[m]aking an evasive response to discovery\u201d (\u00a7 2023.010, subd. (f)) are defined as \u201c[mjisuses of the discovery process.\u201d (\u00a7 2023.010.) But the <em>sanctions </em>for misuse of the discovery process are limited \u201c[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or any other provision of [the Civil Discovery Act].\u201d (\u00a7 2023.030.) Thus, the sanctions available to remedy evasive or incomplete responses to <em>interrogatories </em>are limited to those contained in chapter 13 of the Civil Discovery Act (\u00a7 2030.010 et seq.).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The <em>Thoren </em>case involved conduct not specifically covered by the Civil Discovery Act\u2014serving a willfully false answer to an interrogatory. Giving a willfully false answer is not even included in the Civil Discovery Act\u2019s definitions of a \u201cmisuse of discovery,\u201d unless the prohibition against causing \u201cunwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense\u201d (\u00a7 2030.090, subd. (b)) is broadly construed. (See \u00a7 2023.010, subd. (c).) The <em>Thoren </em>court, relying on a <em>former </em>provision of the Civil Discovery Act, approved the exclusion of a witness\u2019s testimony as a sanction for giving a willfully false answer, likening the false answer to no answer at all. <em>(Thoren, supra, </em>29 Cal.App.3d at p. 274 [\u201cA willfully false answer to an interrogatory must be treated as the equivalent of no answer at all. . .\u201d].) The discovery statute then extant authorized the imposition of an evidence sanction for the willful failure to serve and file answers to interrogatories. (See fn. 10, <em>ante.) </em>While current law continues to treat a failure to respond to discovery as a \u201cmisuse of the discovery process\u201d (\u00a7 2023.030; see \u00a7 2023.010, subd. (d)), the imposition of an evidence sanction is now conditioned upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>the violation of an order compelling the response (\u00a7\u00a7 2023.030, 2030.290, subd. (c)). Thus, current law has replaced the former requirement for the imposition of an evidence sanction\u2014that the failure to respond was \u201cwillful\u201d\u2014with the requirement that the responding party violated an order compelling the response.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Although the statutory basis for the imposition of an evidence sanction has changed, <em>Thoren </em>has never been overruled. Its application, however, is narrow, covering a circumstance not specifically dealt with in the Civil Discovery Act. Thus, in the absence of a violation of an order compelling an answer or further answer, the evidence sanction may only be imposed where the answer given is <em>willfully false. </em>The simple failure to answer, or the giving of an evasive answer, requires the propounding party to pursue an order compelling an answer or further answer\u2014otherwise the right to an answer or further answer is waived and an evidence sanction is not available. \u201c[T]he burden is on the propounding party to enforce discovery. Otherwise, no penalty attaches either for the responding party\u2019s failure to respond or responding inadequately!\u201d (Weil &amp; Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2007) ][ 8:1136, p. 8F-59.)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The party moving to exclude evidence as a sanction for discovery abuse has the initial burden of establishing grounds supporting the request. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 500.) Where, as here, the court has not issued an order compelling a response or further response to an interrogatory (and where such an order has not been violated), the party moving for the exclusion of evidence has the burden of establishing the answer given by the responding party was willfully false, i.e., <em>intentionally not true. </em>Here, Goffney\u2019s responses to Interrogatories 12.1 and 15.1 directed plaintiffs to look in Saxena\u2019s \u201cmedical records\u201d to determine the identities of individuals with knowledge of the incident, or who had information supporting Goffney\u2019s affirmative defenses. Plaintiffs presented no evidence establishing or implying these answers were untrue, i.e., that Flashner\u2019s and Palmer\u2019s names were <em>not </em>contained within medical records in plaintiffs\u2019 possession. It was plaintiffs\u2019 burden to do so, and they failed. Goffney\u2019s interrogatory answers were incomplete and evasive, and clearly merited the issuance of an order compelling further answers and an award of monetary sanctions. But plaintiffs failure to seek such an order constituted a waiver of any right to a further response. (\u00a7 2030.300, subd. (c).) As discussed above, in the absence of a violation of an order compelling further answers, incomplete and evasive answers are themselves an insufficient basis to exclude evidence. Accordingly, the court erred in excluding Flashner\u2019s and Palmer\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The error, however, was harmless. \u201c[W]here evidence is improperly excluded, the error is not reversible unless \u2018 \u201cit is reasonably probable a result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>more favorable to the appellant would have been reached absent the error.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Tudor Ranches, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1431-1432.) Goffney offered Flashner\u2019s testimony as evidence that Saxena did not display any symptoms of congestive heart failure during his February 5 emergency room visit. But Dr. Ronald Neuman, Goffney\u2019s medical standard of care expert, described in substantial detail Flashner\u2019s observations of Saxena\u2019s condition on February 5, as reflected in Flashner\u2019s medical chart notes of that visit. This testimony included a description of Saxena\u2019s complaints as recorded by Flashner (fever and neck discomfort). Flasher\u2019s chart showed Saxena had a normal respiration rate of 18; dry lips and mucous membranes; clear lungs; normal respiratory effort; skin not adequately hydrated; and a heart rate of 117. The chart contained no indication of respiratory distress. Flashner also ordered a chest X-ray; the X-ray was diagnosed as \u201cnormal.\u201d Dr. Flasher\u2019s February 5 chart notes came into evidence through Neuman\u2019s testimony without objection and without any request for a limiting instruction. Under these circumstances we perceive no prejudice arising from the exclusion of Flashner\u2019s live testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Goffney offered Palmer\u2019s testimony as evidence that Saxena was breathing normally at the time of the February 10 procedure, and that neither Saxena nor Neelofer asked Goffney to postpone the procedure. The latter point has little, if any, relevance in light of plaintiffs\u2019 failure to tender the battery issue to the jury. As to the proffered testimony concerning Saxena\u2019s respiration, the jury was made aware of the measured respiration rate of 36 noted on Saxena\u2019s February 10 medical chart. Plaintiffs\u2019 medical experts described a respiration rate of 36 as abnormally elevated; Goffney described the rate as normal if Saxena had been engaging in strenuous activity near the time the respiration was measured. Goffney also testified Saxena did not exhibit shortness of breath on February 10, and Goffney\u2019s expert testified the elevated rate as recorded was inconsistent with Saxena\u2019s other vital signs. In light of the objective measurement of Saxena\u2019s respiration rate, the medical debate concerning its significance or accuracy, Goffney\u2019s testimony regarding his observation of normal respiration, and Neelofer\u2019s testimony regarding Saxena\u2019s shortness of breath, the addition of Palmer\u2019s testimony, given three years after his actual observation, would have added little persuasive force to the other evidence presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Accordingly, it is not reasonably probable Goffney would have received a more favorable result had Flashner and Palmer testified. The exclusion of their testimony does not constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">The order denying the JNOV motion and partially granting a new trial is reversed and remanded with directions to the court to: (1) grant Goffney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>JNOV motion on the battery claim; (2) hear and decide Goffney\u2019s MICRA motion; and (3) enter the resulting judgment for plaintiffs on the negligence claims and for Goffney on the battery claim. Goffney\u2019s writ petition is denied. In the interests of justice, each party shall bear its own costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Sills, R J., and Rylaarsdam, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The petition of plaintiffs and appellants for review by the Supreme Court was denied April 30, 2008, S161452.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-11\"> We grant Goffney\u2019s unopposed motion for judicial notice of the record submitted in case No. G037363. <em>(,Stephenson </em>v. <em>Drever </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 1167, 1170, fn. 1 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 764, 947 P.2d 1301]; Evid.

Questions three through seven are taken from verdict form 501, entitled, \u201cMedical Negligence\u2014Informed Consent\u2014Affirmative Defense That Plaintiff Would Have Consented Even If Informed.\u201d (See CACI VF-501.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b296-8\"> With the benefit of hindsight, Goffney did not need to file a JNOV because, as we will conclude, the jury made no findings supporting a battery claim, and thus a judgment could not have been entered for battery. Because the court granted a partial new trial before judgment was entered, Goffney never had the opportunity to object to any form of judgment which would have potentially reflected a judgment for battery. And Goffney was legitimately concerned the court would view the findings on lack of informed consent as supporting a battery judgment because the court had earlier overruled his objections that plaintiffs were improperly conflating negligence and battery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b297-11\"> After the parties filed their respective opening briefs, the Judicial Council of California issued a revised jury instruction pertaining to medical battery. The revised instruction, CACI No. 530A, requires a plaintiff pursuing a medical battery claim to prove, among other things, that defendant \u201cperformed a medical procedure without [plaintiff\u2019s] <em>informed consent.\u201d </em>(CACI No. 530A, italics added.) In contrast, CACI No. 530, the former jury instruction for medical battery, required the plaintiff to prove the defendant \u201cperformed a medical procedure without [plaintiff\u2019s] consent.\u201d (Former CACI No. 530.) The Use Note to CACI No. 530A does not indicate a reason for requiring plaintiff to prove a lack of <em>informed </em>consent rather than lack of any consent. We believe the use of the phrase \u201cinformed consent\u201d in the current jury instruction blurs the distinction between negligence and battery as described by our high court in <em>Cobbs, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at pages 241-242.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b297-12\"> Unless noted, all further statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b299-7\"> In the trial court, plaintiffs conceded the jury\u2019s conclusion regarding the \u201clack of informed consent\u201d could mean Saxena did not consent to the procedure, or that he consented, but without enough information about the risks of, and alternatives to, the procedure. Indeed, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel admitted that\u2014\u201cif [he] had it to do over\u201d\u2014he would take out the word \u201cinformed\u201d from question four on the special verdict form.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b299-8\"> We reject plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the defects in the verdict form are immaterial because substantial evidence supports a finding of battery. In <em>Myers, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at page 961, the court rejected a similar argument and held that \u201cthe fact that the evidence might support such a finding\u201d cannot save a special verdict form where the jury does not render an \u201cactual verdict\u201d on a cause of action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b302-7\"> Goffney also contends the court\u2019s denial of a new trial on the negligence claim was an abuse of discretion because (1) the verdict on plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claim was \u201ctainted\u201d by the defective special verdict and the erroneous special jury instruction; and (2) there is confusion regarding the \u201ctheory and facts [on which] the jury\u2019s \u2018negligence\u2019 finding was based.\u201d We disagree. Goffney acknowledges \u201c[plaintiffs\u2019 evidence offered the jury three different bases for finding Dr. Goffney was negligent.\u201d Goffney has failed to cite any persuasive authority entitling him to clarify his \u201cconfusion.\u201d The jury unambiguously found both negligence and lack of informed consent negligence based on substantial evidence. One of plaintiffs\u2019 expert witnesses testified that the \u201cmedical probability is that failing to diagnose Mr. Saxena\u2019s problems, and complicating that with proceeding with an elective procedure in the face of Mr. Saxena\u2019s underlying illness, contributed significantly to his death within the next 12 to 24 hours.\u201d Another expert testified Saxena \u201cwas at high risk. And this is because he had a respiratory rate of 36, which is highly predictive of ventilatory problems later. Having an elevated respiratory rate is an extremely serious issue. Having a diagnosis of heart failure puts one at a very high risk.\u201d The jury could reasonably find from this testimony both ordinary medical negligence in Goffney\u2019s failure to diagnose and his failure adequately to explain the risks to Saxena.
