The judgments and orders are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-13\">Marilyn S. is the 27-y ear-old mother of eight children. This appeal concerns five of the children, B.D., A.D., Joanna E, Israel F. and Eric F. (collectively the children).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The children are now 10, seven, six, five and three years respectively. In May 2004 as a result of ongoing domestic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>violence between Marilyn and a boyfriend, Israel E,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the children were adjudicated dependents of the juvenile court. B.D. and his older sister S.D. also reported that Marilyn and Israel hit them and the other children with hands, belts, hangers and a telephone cord.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">At the disposition hearing, the court removed the children from Marilyn\u2019s custody and ordered a plan of family reunification services. Marilyn\u2019s case plan was focused on helping her understand the dynamics of domestic violence and its impact on her children, and to gain the stability and maturity necessary to provide a safe and secure home for her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-6\">The San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (Agency) placed the five children in three foster care homes and provided services to meet their developmental and emotional needs. Joanna and Eric were placed in foster care for approximately six months and then moved to the home of a parental relative, where they remained. Two-year-old Joanna had developmental delays and behavioral problems. Eric, who was detained at birth, was happy, healthy and active.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-7\">Four-year-old A.D. was placed in foster care. In December 2004 due to behavioral problems, she was moved to another foster home with S.D. A.D. was assessed in the borderline range of mental development. She had significant language deficits and displayed severe tantrums and defiance. With continued therapy and in-home services, A.D.\u2019s behavior improved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-8\">B.D. and Israel had multiple placements, many of them together. Between April 2004 and May 2006, B.D. was in a relative placement, three foster homes, a group home and two temporary placements. Israel was placed with a relative, and then in three foster homes. He also had two temporary placements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-9\">B.D., who was six years old when he was removed from Marilyn\u2019s care, was upset about not being able to live with his mother. He had problems sleeping and cried frequently for long periods of time. B.D. was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder, recurrent. His behavior and school performance improved after he was treated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-10\">Israel was 22 months old when he was detained. Evaluators believed he was mildly mentally delayed. Israel was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>disorder and unspecified disturbance of conduct. His behaviors included defiance, sexualized conduct, eating problems, tantrums and spreading feces.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-5\">Marilyn was offered reunification services for 18 months. At the time of the 18-month review hearing, Marilyn was not attending individual therapy, had not participated in a court-ordered psychological evaluation and was not visiting tihe children regularly. In January 2006 the court found that she made minimal progress with her case plan and terminated reunification services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-6\">In May 2006 the Agency requested a continuance of the section 366.26 hearing to assess the children\u2019s needs and to develop the most appropriate permanency plan for them. In September the Agency identified adoption as the preferred plan. The court authorized psychological evaluations for B.D., A.D. and Joanna to assess factors that might affect the proposed adoptions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Evaluations for Joanna and A.D. were completed in October. At the time of the section 366.26 hearing in January 2007, B.D.\u2019s evaluation had not yet been scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-7\">Rosa Grunhaus-Belzer, Ph.D., diagnosed A.D. with depressive disorder, NOS (not otherwise specified), adjustment disorder with anxiety and impulse-control disorder, NOS. Dr. Grunhaus-Belzer opined that A.D.\u2019s temper tantrums and aggression toward others were partly related to depression and anxiety. A.D. told the psychologist that her \u201cnumber one\u201d wish was to live with her mom. Dr. Grunhaus-Belzer recommended a carefully thought-out transition plan to avert a \u201crocky transition and an intensification of acting out behaviors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-8\">Elaine Spencer, Psy.D., stated that five-year-old Joanna appeared to be a good candidate for adoption by parents who were able to meet her needs and understand her background. Joanna was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with mixed emotions and conduct, and tested below average in cognitive and intellectual functioning. Dr. Spencer believed Joanna\u2019s current behavioral and emotional issues were related to the upcoming change in placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-9\">In November 2006 Marilyn filed petitions for modification under section 388 (modification petitions) seeking the children\u2019s return to her care. The modification hearing was heard on November 30 and December 18, 2006, and January 4, 2007. The court considered the evidence presented at the modification hearing at the section 366.26 hearing, which took place on January 4 and 12, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-10\">Marilyn testified that she had stable housing with her boyfriend and their baby. She was working at a fast-food franchise. Marilyn completed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>domestic violence program in November 2005 and had attended three support group sessions. There was no domestic violence in her current relationship. Marilyn believed the children\u2019s behavioral problems were due to their placement in foster care, and the children would not have problems once they were returned to her care. Marilyn stated that if she had to choose between B.D. living with his siblings or living with her, she would want B.D. to stay with siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-5\">B.D. testified he wanted to return home. He did not want to be adopted with or without his siblings. B.D. said of Marilyn, \u201cShe\u2019s the best mom I ever had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-6\">Social worker Jessica Parker opined that the risk to the children in Marilyn\u2019s care continued to be high. Marilyn gave birth to her eighth child in June 2006. She did not have stable housing during the reunification period and was currently dependent on others for her housing needs. The baby\u2019s father was on probation for an assault with a firearm in 2000 related to gang activity and had a history of methamphetamine use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-7\">Parker believed Marilyn loved the children but her role was that of an older sibling rather than a parent. Marilyn was loving and affectionate with the children during visitation and provided clothes and shoes when she could. In view of the love and affection between Marilyn and the children, Parker did not find it easy to recommend adoption. However, returning the children to Marilyn\u2019s care was not a realistic option. No permanency plan other than adoption would allow the children to be raised together in a stable, secure home.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-8\">Parker opined that the children were adoptable. They were making good progress and all but Israel were on track academically. Eric was a very active toddler and required constant supervision. Four-year-old Israel had tantrums and developmental delays but otherwise was a healthy, socially engaging and likable child. Joanna struggled to behave, but there were no obstacles to adoption. A.D. was a sociable, engaging child. Although her behaviors were challenging, they had improved with structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-9\">Although B.D. did not want to be adopted, Parker believed his feelings about adoption would change once he had the opportunity to live in a stable, violence-free home with his siblings. B.D. had an affectionate relationship with Marilyn and sought her approval for his projects. If adopted, B.D. would need therapy to ameliorate the grief and loss of losing his relationship with Marilyn. He would also be grieved if his relationships with his siblings were severed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-10\">Parker testified the children had strong, affectionate sibling relationships. B.D. and Israel had an \u201cincredibly special bond.\u201d When A.D. was with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>them, the three children held hands while they walked. The children enjoyed each other\u2019s company and supported each other. Joanna and Eric were very close to each other and enjoyed their relationships with their siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\">Parker strongly believed the best outcome would be to keep the children together for adoption, but would consider separating the children into two groups if the Agency was not able to find an adoptive home for the sibling group of five. She was aware of a family that was interested in adopting a sibling group of five children, and had talked to them in hypothetical terms about the children. The family did not have an approved foster or adoptive home study and had not been introduced to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-6\">The court found that Marilyn had made modest progress with services after reunification services were terminated, but her circumstances remained unstable. The court determined it was not in the children\u2019s best interests to return to Marilyn\u2019s care and denied the modification petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-7\">B.D.\u2019s attorney, Michael Bradfield, asked the court to identify adoption as B.D.\u2019s permanency plan and continue the hearing for 180 days under section 366.26, former subdivision (c)(3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Bradfield argued the evidence was not clear the Agency would be able to place the five siblings in an adoptive home, and it was premature to assess whether it would be detrimental to B.D. to terminate parental rights under an alternative plan. In view of B.D.\u2019s strong feelings against adoption, Bradfield recommended the court continue the proceedings to allow B.D. to complete a psychological evaluation, meet any prospective adoptive family and participate in therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-8\">The court found that although the case was complicated by the number, ages and individual interests of the children, it was likely they would be adopted within a reasonable time. The court had no doubt adoption was the best permanency plan for the younger children. In view of B.D.\u2019s love for his mother, the court stated that long-term foster care might arguably be an appropriate option were he an only child. However, B.D.\u2019s relationships with his siblings were exceptionally strong, and adoption would promote B.D.\u2019s well-being to a greater extent than would long-term placement in foster care or severing his relationships with his siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-9\">The court found that no exceptions to termination of parental rights outweighed the benefits that adoption would provide the children, even if they had to be separated into two sibling groups. The court terminated parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>APPELLATE PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">In August 2007 counsel for A.D., Joanna, Israel and Eric (minors\u2019 counsel) informed this court that his clients and B.D. were placed with a prospective adoptive family on July 23, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-6\">On September 17, 2007, this court augmented the record to include reports and court orders filed or lodged after January 17, 2007. This court asked the parties to submit simultaneous letter briefs addressing the following: \u201cDid the trial court err by not proceeding under Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.26, subdivision (c)(3)? If so, may this court consider the supplemental transcript here to determine whether error, if any, was harmless? Has the portion of the appeal challenging adoptability been rendered moot by subsequent proceedings?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-9\">\n<em>Introduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-10\">Marilyn contends the court abused its discretion when it denied her modification petitions to return the children to her care. She asserts insufficient evidence supports the finding the children were likely to be adopted within a reasonable time. Marilyn also argues termination of parental rights is detrimental to the children under section 366.26, former subdivision (c)(1)(A), (E).</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-11\">B.D. contends insufficient evidence supports the finding he was likely to be adopted, with his siblings or separately, within a reasonable time. He argues the court should have granted his request to continue the permanency plan hearing under section 366.26, former subdivision (c)(3). B.D. asserts he may become adoptable if placed in an approved adoptive home with his siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-12\">The Agency maintains the court properly denied Marilyn\u2019s modification petitions and contends Marilyn has not met her burden on appeal to show that no substantial evidence supports the court\u2019s findings under section 366.26, former subdivision (c)(1). Minors\u2019 counsel joins the Agency\u2019s opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">\n<em>The Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion When It Denied Marilyn\u2019s Petitions for Modification Under Section 388</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">Marilyn asserts the court abused its discretion when it denied her modification petitions. She contends she proved changed circumstances and new evidence that demonstrated the children\u2019s return to her care was in their best interests. Marilyn argues she satisfied all the conditions the Agency imposed: She severed her relationship with the perpetrator of domestic violence, completed a 52-week domestic violence program, was in a stable relationship with the father of her baby, visited the children regularly and had resumed therapy. Marilyn also asserts she had appropriate housing and an adequate income for herself and the children, and her children longed to be with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-7\">The Agency contends Marilyn had not made substantive changes and therefore did not show a \u201c \u2018genuine\u2019 . . . change of circumstances.\u201d <em>(In re Aaliyah R. </em>(2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 437, 447-448 [38 Cal.Rptr.3d 876].) It asserts the evidence shows that Marilyn did not complete her case plan and lacked the maturity and insight to provide a stable home for her children and to meet their emotional, behavioral and developmental needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-8\">Under section 388, a parent, interested person or the dependent child (genetically, petitioner) may petition the court to change, modify or set aside a previous order on the grounds of changed circumstances or new evidence. (\u00a7 388, subd. (a).) The petitioner has the burden to show a change of circumstances or new evidence and the proposed modification is in the child\u2019s best interests. <em>(In re Jasmon O. </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 398, 415 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 85, 878 P.2d 1297].) Generally, the petitioner must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the child\u2019s welfare requires the modification sought. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 5.570(f)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-9\">We review the grant or denial of a petition for modification under section 388 for an abuse of discretion. <em>(In re Shirley K. </em>(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 65, 71 [43 Cal.Rptr.3d 897]; <em>In re Casey D. </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 38, 47 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 426].) While the abuse of discretion standard gives the trial court substantial latitude, \u201c[t]he scope of discretion always resides in the particular law being applied, i.e., in the \u2018legal principles governing the subject of [the] action . . . . \u2019 Action that transgresses the confines of the applicable principles of law is outside the scope of discretion and we call such action an \u2018abuse\u2019 of discretion. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(City of Sacramento v. Drew </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1287, 1297 [255 Cal.Rptr. 704].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>In evaluating whether the petitioner has met his or her burden to show changed circumstances, the trial court should consider: \u201c(1) the seriousness of the problem which led to the dependency, and the reason for any continuation of that problem; (2) the strength of relative bonds between the dependent children to <em>both </em>parent and caretakers; and (3) the degree to which the problem may be easily removed or ameliorated, and the degree to which it actually has been.\u201d <em>(In re Kimberly F. </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 519, 532 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 495] [\u201cWhile this list is not meant to be exhaustive, it does provide a reasoned and principled basis on which to evaluate a section 388 motion.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">Here, the children were removed from Marilyn\u2019s custody because of their exposure to domestic violence and physical abuse. The case continued because Marilyn did not complete her case plan, relied on others for housing and support and was not able to place her children\u2019s needs first. She stopped attending therapy in September 2006, which was a prerequisite to participating in conjoint counseling with the children and understanding their needs. Marilyn did not visit the children when she became upset with the social worker and caregivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-6\">Social worker Parker opined that the risk to the children in Marilyn\u2019s care continued to be high. After several years of services, Marilyn did not understand the impact that her inability to provide structure, stability and consistency had on the children. During visits, Marilyn was unable to consistently discipline and control the children. Parker did not believe Marilyn had the ability to meet the children\u2019s emotional, behavioral and developmental needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-7\">Marilyn did not complete a court-ordered psychological evaluation until the court terminated reunification services and set a section 366.26 hearing. The evaluating psychologist reported that Marilyn\u2019s home had been one of \u201ctransience and instability both financially and emotionally.\u201d Marilyn was dependent on others. In the past, she was pathologically dependent on a man who had battered her. While in her care, the children received very poor structure and parenting and were not protected from violence and physical abuse. Marilyn did not see the connection between the conditions in her home and the children\u2019s problematic behaviors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-8\">The psychologist concluded that Marilyn\u2019s goal of caring for the children was unrealistic in view of her lack of responsibility and independence, and her limited means to care for the children. Further, Marilyn\u2019s passivity and dependency presented a risk of exposure to the children of domestic violence or physical or sexual abuse from others.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>Marilyn did not inform the psychologist that she was five months pregnant at the time of the evaluation or that the baby\u2019s father was then incarcerated for assault with a firearm and had a recent history of methamphetamine use. Thus, the court could conclude that the predictive risks noted by the psychologist in Marilyn\u2019s evaluation were present in her life and presented a serious current risk to the children\u2019s safety and well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">The court reasonably determined Marilyn\u2019s circumstances were not sufficiently changed to permit the safe return of the children to her care. Despite offered services, Marilyn did not show she was able to offer the children a structured, secure and protective environment free from the risk of abuse and neglect. She did not understand the difficulty in caring and providing for children who had significant and varied emotional, behavioral and developmental needs. (Cf. <em>In re Dakota H. </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 212, 230 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 337].) Marilyn was dependent for support on a person with a history of violence and substance abuse. Thus, the problem that initially brought the children within the dependency system had not been removed or ameliorated. <em>(In re Kimberly F., supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th at pp. 531-532.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-6\">In view of the children\u2019s needs and Marilyn\u2019s current circumstances, the court reasonably found that it was not in the children\u2019s best interests to be returned to Marilyn\u2019s care. We conclude the court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Marilyn\u2019s petitions to return the children to her care.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-8\">\n<em>Section 366.26, Former Subdivision (c)(1)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-9\">\n<em>A. Introduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-10\">Marilyn contends the court\u2019s finding the children were likely to be adopted within a reasonable time (adoptability finding) is not supported by substantial evidence. She argues the children are strongly bonded to each other and need to retain their sibling ties; thus the size of the sibling group and the children\u2019s emotional, developmental and behavioral problems belie a finding that they are specifically or generally adoptable. Marilyn further contends substantial evidence does not support a finding that B.D. was adoptable because he consistently and adamantly opposed adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-11\">B.D. argues the court\u2019s finding that termination of parental rights would not be detrimental to him was premised on the condition that he would be adopted with his siblings. B.D. contends the court erred when it terminated parental rights in the absence of clear and convincing evidence the Agency would be able to meet this condition. He argues the children\u2019s proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>adoptive placement with a family not yet screened for factors required in the assessment report under section 366.22, subdivision (b) does not constitute substantial evidence that B.D., as a member of a bonded sibling group, would be adopted within a reasonable time. (Cf. <em>In re L. Y. L. </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 942, 956 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 688].) B.D. also asserts he was not generally adoptable in view of his unequivocal opposition to losing his relationship with his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-5\">The Agency argues the children are generally and specifically adoptable based on the number of families interested in adopting the children \u201cindividually and in groups\u201d and the existence of a family interested in adopting all five children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-6\">B. <em>Statutory Framework</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1153-7\">At a section 366.26 hearing, the court may (1) terminate parental rights and free the child for adoption, (2) identify adoption as the permanency plan goal and continue the hearing for no more than 180 days to locate an appropriate adoptive home for the child, (3) appoint a legal guardian, or (4) order the child\u2019s placement in long-term foster care. (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (b).) At all proceedings under section 366.26, the court must consider the wishes of the child and act in the best interests of the child. (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (h)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-8\">To select adoption as the permanency plan, the court must find by clear and convincing evidence the child is likely to be adopted within a reasonable time. The fact that the child is not yet placed with a family prepared to adopt the child, \u201cshall not constitute a basis for the court to conclude that it is not likely the child will be adopted.\u201d (\u00a7 366.26, former subd. (c)(1).) If the court finds that the child is likely to be adopted, it must order adoption unless termination of parental rights would cause serious detriment to a child under one or more specific statutory exceptions. (Ibid.; <em>In re Autumn H. </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 567, 573 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 535].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-9\">C. <em>Adoptability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1153-10\">A finding of adoptability requires \u201cclear and convincing evidence of the likelihood that adoption will be realized within a reasonable time.\u201d <em>(In re Zeth S. </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 396, 406 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 683, 73 P.3d 541] <em>(Zeth S.).) </em>The question of adoptability usually focuses on whether the child\u2019s age, physical condition and emotional health make it difficult to find a person willing to adopt that child. <em>(In re Sarah M. </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1642, 1649 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 82].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-11\">If the child is considered generally adoptable, we do not examine the suitability of the prospective adoptive home. <em>(In re Scott M. </em>(1993) 13 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>Cal.App.4th 839, 844 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 766].) When the child is deemed adoptable based solely on a particular family\u2019s willingness to adopt the child, the <em>trial court </em>must determine whether there is a legal impediment to adoption. <em>(In re Carl R. </em>(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1051, 1061 [27 Cal.Rptr.3d 612].) The juvenile court should also explore a child\u2019s feelings toward his or her parents, foster parents and prospective adoptive family. <em>(In re Amanda D. (1997) </em>55 Cal.App.4th 813, 820 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 108]; <em>In re Christopher L. </em>(2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1326, 1334 [50 Cal.Rptr.3d 57]; see \u00a7 366.26, subd. (h)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-5\">On review, we determine whether the record contains substantial evidence from which the court could find clear and convincing evidence that the child was likely to be adopted within a reasonable time. <em>(In re Gregory A. </em>(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1554, 1561-1562 [25 Cal.Rptr.3d 134]; see also <em>Zeth S., supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 406.) The evidence must be sufficiently strong to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind. <em>(In re Jerome D. </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 1200, 1205-1206 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 449].) We give the court\u2019s adoptability finding the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolve any evidentiary conflicts in favor of the judgment of the trial court. <em>(In re Autumn H., supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at p. 576.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-6\">Here, social worker Parker opined that the children were adoptable. Although A.D., Joanne and Israel had problems, they had made progress. Parker acknowledged B.D. and A.D. wanted to return to Marilyn\u2019s care, and B.D. would require a long therapeutic process before he would accept adoption. Because of his opposition, the Agency would \u201ctake a transition more slowly.\u201d In discussing A.D.\u2019s need for a carefully structured transition, Parker stated, \u201cThe transition period is going to be very big in this case in making sure we are not moving too quickly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-7\">Parker strongly believed the children should be placed for adoption as a sibling group of five, and stated, \u201cI am passionate about doing everything in my power as a social worker to place the kids together.\u201d Parker testified if the Agency could not find an adoptive home for the sibling group of five, it would place Eric and Joanne in one adoptive home, and B.D., A.D. and Israel in another.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-8\">In the general database of families interested in adopting a child or a sibling group, Parker found seven families that had expressed interest in adopting a child with B.D.\u2019s characteristics, 18 families interested in a child like A.D., 26 in a child like Joanna, 22 in a child like Israel and 33 in a child with Eric\u2019s characteristics. Eight or nine families were interested in adopting a sibling pair tike A.D. and Israel, and the same number had expressed an interest in a adopting a sibling pair like Joanna and Eric. Parker also found on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>the database five approved out-of-county families that were interested in adopting a sibling group like the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-5\">We are not persuaded by the Agency\u2019s argument that the number of families interested in adopting the children \u201cindividually and in groups\u201d supports a finding the children are generally and specifically adoptable. (See, e.g., <em>In re Asia L. </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 498, 512 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 733] [children\u2019s emotional and psychological development present a potential obstacle to adoption and require a specialized placement]; <em>In re Amelia S. </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1060, 1065 [280 Cal.Rptr. 503] [reports indicating a few families were considering adoption does not constitute clear and convincing evidence to establish the likelihood of adoption]; <em>In re Brian P. </em>(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 616, 624 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 326] [a social worker\u2019s conclusion alone is insufficient to support an adoptability finding].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-6\">Parker was not considering homes that only wanted a single child. She acknowledged that it would not be easy to find a suitable adoptive home for the sibling group. Parker testified if the Agency\u2019s efforts to place the children together were not successful, then the Agency would separate the children into two groups after it had exhausted placement possibilities for the adoption of the five children as a sibling group. We note there is no evidence in the record to support a finding that B.D., A.D. and Israel were likely to be adopted as a sibling group within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-7\">The Agency contends the presence of one family that had expressed an interest in adopting a sibling group constitutes substantial evidence of the children\u2019s adoptability. We are not persuaded by this contention. The record shows the family did not have a foster care license or an approved adoptive home study. Because of their status, Parker could not provide specific information to the family about the children and spoke to them in \u201chypotheticals\u201d about \u201cmore extreme behaviors.\u201d Parker \u201choped\u201d the family would be approved for foster care licensing in February 2007, but declined to speculate on when the family\u2019s adoptive home study would be completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-8\">Although the foster care and adoptive home studies for the family were in progress, we believe the absence of a foster care license or a preliminary assessment constitutes a legal impediment to adoption.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It prevents a social worker from providing information about the children to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>family, facilitating contact between the children and the family and placing the children in a preadoptive placement with the family. Thus, here, there was a legal impediment to adoption by the only family that had expressed a specific interest in adopting the children at the time of the section 366.26 hearing. <em>(In re Carl R., supra, </em>128 Cal.App.4th at p. 1061.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-5\">In addition, this is not a case in which the children had any previous relationship with a family interested in adopting them. The record shows that once an approved prospective adoptive parent was identified, the transition process would be lengthy, especially with respect to B.D. and A.D. Parker voiced concern about proceeding \u201ctoo quickly\u201d for A.D. and opined that B.D.\u2019s adoption would require a long therapeutic process. B.D.\u2019s therapy was discontinued in August 2006 due to a change in placement and had not been rescheduled. B.D.\u2019s psychological evaluation, authorized by the court in September 2006, had not been scheduled at the time of the section 366.26 hearing. Thus, the record does not indicate the therapeutic issues would be resolved, or that a transition to an approved adoptive placement would be completed, within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-6\">D. <em>Beneficial Parent-child Relationship Exception</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1156-7\">Marilyn asserts the court erred when it determined the beneficial parent-child relationship exception under section 366.26, former subdivision (c)(1)(A) did not apply to preclude termination of parental rights. She contends she maintained consistent and regular visitation with the children and had strong and close relationships with the children, particularly with B.D., A.D. and Joanna.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-8\">Section 366.26, former subdivision (c)(1)(A) provides an exception to termination of parental rights when \u201c[t]he parents have maintained regular visitation and contact with the child and the child would benefit from continuing the relationship.\u201d We recognize that interaction between parent and child will usually confer some incidental benefit to the child. <em>(In re Autumn H., supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at p. 575.) To overcome the statutory preference for adoption, the parent must prove he or she occupies a parental role in the child\u2019s life resulting in a significant, positive emotional attachment of the child to the parent. <em>(In re Derek W. </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 823, 827 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 739]; <em>In re Elizabeth M. </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 318, 324 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 557].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-9\">When applying the beneficial parent-child relationship exception, the court balances the strength and quality of the parent-child relationship in a tenuous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>placement against the security and sense of belonging that a stable family would confer on the child. If severing the existing parental relationship would deprive the child of \u201ca substantial, positive emotional attachment such that the child would be greatly harmed, the preference for adoption is overcome and the natural parent\u2019s rights are not terminated.\u201d <em>(In re Autumn H., supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at p. 575.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-5\">We determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the court\u2019s ruling by reviewing the evidence most favorably to the prevailing party and indulging in all legitimate and reasonable inferences to uphold the court\u2019s ruling. <em>(In re Misako R. </em>(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 538, 545 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 217].) The reviewing court must affirm a trial court\u2019s rejection of these exceptions if the ruling is supported by substantial evidence. <em>(In re Autumn H., supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at p. 576; <em>In re Zachary G. </em>(1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 799, 809 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 20].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-6\">Marilyn does not meet her burden on appeal to show there is insufficient evidence to support the court\u2019s determination that the parent-child relationship was outweighed by the security and sense of belonging that adoption would confer on each child. <em>(In re Autumn H., supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at p. 575.) When the children were in Marilyn\u2019s care, they were subjected to physical abuse and exposed to domestic violence. Israel and Erie were less than two years old when removed from her care, and Joanna had just turned three. They have spent a significant portion of their lives with other caregivers. Although B.D. and A.D. lived with Marilyn for a substantial period of their lives and wanted to return to her care, Parker believed they were seeking a protective, nurturing parent who would be able to provide the security of a safe and stable home and were too young to realize that Marilyn could not meet their needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-7\">Parker opined Marilyn was more like an older sibling to her children than a parent. Marilyn\u2019s therapist reported that Marilyn was \u201cimmature in her parenting skills.\u201d Examples of Marilyn\u2019s immaturity included having men in her home during the children\u2019s unsupervised visits, not visiting the children because she was upset with the social worker and caregivers, lying to B.D. and the social worker about the birth of her youngest child and becoming dependent on a man who had a criminal and substance abuse history.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-8\">The children had emotional, developmental and behavioral needs that required stability, consistency and structure. After several years of services, Marilyn did not understand the impact of her lack of consistent parenting on the children and her inability to meet their special needs. <em>(In re Dakota H., supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th at pp. 230-231.) We conclude that substantial evidence supports the court\u2019s finding that the security of a permanent home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>with committed, capable and loving adoptive parents outweighed the children\u2019s interest in continuing their relationships with Marilyn. <em>(In re Autumn H., supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at p. 575.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-5\">E. <em>Sibling Relationship Exception</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1158-6\">Marilyn contends the court erred when it did not apply the sibling relationship exception under section 366.26, former subdivision (c)(1)(E). She argues the Agency\u2019s plan to find an adoptive home for the sibling group was speculative, and therefore the court could not have properly found the exception did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-7\">The Agency maintains substantial evidence supports a finding that adoption would not substantially interfere with the siblings\u2019 relationships under the alternative plans approved by the court and, to the extent it did, the children\u2019s individual interests in adoption outweighed their interests in maintaining their sibling relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-8\">An exception to termination of parental rights exists when termination of parental rights would cause \u201csubstantial interference with a child\u2019s sibling relationship, taking into consideration the nature and extent of the relationship . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 366.26, former subd. (c)(1)(E).) Here, the record leaves no doubt the nature and extent of the children\u2019s sibling relationships were strong and important, and the parties and the court believed that maintaining the sibling relationships were crucial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-9\">The sibling relationships were the basic foundation of the proposed permanency plan. Parker was \u201cpassionate\u201d about doing everything within her power to keep the children together. Marilyn believed B.D.\u2019s relationships with his siblings were more important than was his relationship with her. The court found that \u201cwhat ties everything together then is the connection between the siblings and how important it is. These kids know each other and love each other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-10\">In view of our previous discussion about the sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding the children were likely to be adopted as a sibling group, we agree with Marilyn\u2019s assertion the determination of the sibling relationship exception was premature. This court has previously held that where there are tentative alternative plans for adoption and one plan may substantially interfere with the sibling relationship, the better approach is to continue the hearing until the uncertainty has been resolved. <em>(In re Salvador M. </em>(2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1415, 1422 [35 Cal.Rptr.3d 577].) However, as we discuss <em>post </em>at pages 1240-1241, the postjudgment evidence shows the children have been placed together in an adoptive home; therefore the contention that termination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>of parental rights would cause substantial interference with the sibling relationships has been rendered moot by subsequent proceedings. (133 Cal.App.4th at p. 1422.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-5\">\n<em>Consideration of Postjudgment Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-6\">A. <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1159-7\">At trial, B.D.\u2019s attorney asked the court to continue the section 366.26 hearing for 180 days to see whether the Agency would be able to place him with his siblings in an adoptive home. (\u00a7 366.26, former subd. (c)(3).) In his opening brief, B.D. argues the court erred when it did not proceed under section 366.26, former subdivision (c)(3). The parties did not respond to B.D.\u2019s argument in initial briefing. We requested further briefing whether the trial court erred when it did not continue the hearing and, if so, whether this court may consider postjudgment evidence in its assessment of the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-8\">In view of his current circumstances, B.D. posits that the court\u2019s error in not proceeding under section 366.26, former subdivision (c)(3) was harmless, and his argument concerning adoptability has been rendered moot. B.D. contends <em>Zeth S. </em>does not bar consideration of postjudgment evidence to avoid further delay of his opportunity for stability and permanence in an adoptive home with his siblings. <em>(In re Salvador M., supra, </em>133 Cal.4th at p. 1422.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-9\">Marilyn contends the court should not have proceeded under section 366.26, former subdivision (c)(3) because the exceptions under section 366.26, former subdivision (c)(1)(A), (E) applied to preclude termination of parental rights. Marilyn asserts this court should not consider postjudgment evidence in determining whether the court erred when it found the children were likely to be adopted within a reasonable time. <em>(Zeth S., supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at p. 406.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-12\">The Agency contends the court acted within its discretion when it did not continue the section 366.26 hearing for 180 days. The Agency argues that despite the children\u2019s behavioral problems and B.D.\u2019s opposition to adoption, the evidence showed the children were likely to be adopted within a reasonable time. Alternatively, the Agency argues that if the court erred by not continuing the section 366.26 hearing, any error is harmless and the issue of adoptability has been rendered moot by the children\u2019s adoptive placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>Minors\u2019 counsel argues the court did not err when it did not continue the hearing for 180 days. He acknowledges the children were difficult to place as a sibling set of five, but asserts the statute did not apply because there was an identified prospective adoptive family at the time of the section 366.26 hearing. Minors\u2019 counsel argues any procedural error was harmless and has been rendered moot. Finally, minors\u2019 counsel contends that if this court concludes postjudgment evidence should be received, the issue of adoptability is also moot. <em>(In re Sarah M., supra, </em>22 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1649-1650.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\">B. <em>Section 366.26, Former Subdivision (c)(3)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-6\">When a child\u2019s needs or circumstances make the child particularly difficult to place for adoption, the court may identify adoption as the permanency plan goal and give the Agency additional time to find an appropriate adoptive home. (\u00a7 366.26, former subd. (c)(3); <em>In re Gabriel G. </em>(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1428, 1433-1434 [36 Cal.Rptr.3d 847].) If the court has determined that termination of parental rights would not be detrimental to the child under the exceptions listed in section 366.26, former subdivision (c)(1), the court may continue the section 366.26 hearing if it finds that \u201cthe child has a probability for adoption but is difficult to place for adoption and there is no identified or available prospective adoptive parent .. . .\u201d (\u00a7 366.26, former subd. (c)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-7\">\u201cA child is considered difficult to place for adoption only if the lack of a current placement is due to \u2018the child\u2019s membership in a sibling group, or the presence of a diagnosed medical, physical, or mental handicap, or the child is the age of seven years or more.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Gabriel G., supra, </em>134 Cal.App.4th at p. 1434, quoting \u00a7 366.26, former subd. (c)(3).) If these circumstances apply, the court may identify adoption as the permanency plan goal and, without terminating parental rights, order that efforts be made to locate an appropriate adoptive family for the child within a period not to exceed 180 days. \u201cAlthough difficult to place initially, the child\u2019s odds for adoption may improve to \u2018likely\u2019 by the end of the 180-[day] period . . . .\u201d <em>(In re Y.R. </em>(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 99, 110 [60 Cal.Rptr.3d 820].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-8\">Here, the record supports a finding that the children had a probability of adoption but were \u201cdifficult to place.\u201d (\u00a7 366.26, former subd. (c)(3); see <em>In re Y.R., supra, </em>152 Cal.App.4th at pp. 109-110.) The children were members of a sibling group of five, several of whom had diagnosed mental handicaps. <em>(In re Gabriel G., supra, </em>134 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1433-1434; <em>In re Asia L., supra, </em>107 Cal.App.4th at p. 512.) Two of the children were, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>would soon be, seven years old or older,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> an age at which children are generally considered unlikely to be adopted. <em>(In re Salvador M., supra, </em>133 Cal.App.4th at p. 1422.) One of the older children was adamantly opposed to adoption, and the other would consider adoption only on the condition she was able to stay with her siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\">The Agency posits section 366.26, former subdivision (c)(3) did not apply because the children were adoptable. As we have discussed, the evidence does not support a finding that the children were likely to be adopted within a reasonable time. Minors\u2019 counsel contends the statute did not apply because there was an identified prospective adoptive parent at the time of the section 366.26 hearing. For reasons previously discussed, see <em>ante </em>at pages 1233-1234, we do not believe the family identified at the time of the section 366.26 hearing can be characterized as a \u201cprospective adoptive\u201d family within the meaning of section 366.26, former subdivision (c)(3). (Cf. <em>In re L. Y. L., supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at p. 956.) We also discussed the inapplicability of the beneficial parent-child exception under section 366.26, former subdivision (c)(1)(A). Thus contrary to Marilyn\u2019s contention, the exception does not preclude a continuance under section 366.26, former subdivision (c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-6\">Throughout the proceedings, the Agency explicitly and implicitly acknowledged the children were difficult to place as a sibling group of five, and their behaviors and needs would challenge a competent family. Further, without the additional procedural protections of section 366.26, former subdivision (c)(3), the risk that B.D. would be left a legal orphan or would suffer detriment as a result of termination of parental rights was unacceptably high. <em>(In re Carl R., supra, </em>128 Cal.App.4th at p. 1062, fn. 6 [\u201cLegal orphanage is a consequence the law abhors.\u201d].) Under these circumstances, we conclude the better practice is to continue the hearing under section 366.26, former subdivision (c)(3) to allow the Agency to identify a qualified prospective adoptive parent willing to adopt the children as a sibling group. <em>(In re Gabriel G., supra, </em>134 Cal.App.4th at p. 1434; cf. <em>In re Salvador M., supra, </em>133 Cal.App.4th at p. 1422.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-7\">C. <em>We Consider Postjudgment Evidence to Determine Whether the Error Was Harmless</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1161-8\">\u201cIt has long been the general rule and understanding that \u2018an appeal reviews the correctness of a judgment as of the time of its rendition, upon a record of matters which were before the trial court for its consideration.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number><em>(Zeth S., supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 405, quoting <em>In re James V. </em>(1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 300, 304 [153 Cal.Rptr. 334].) The state has a strong interest in expediting dependency proceedings and promoting the finality of the court\u2019s orders and judgment. <em>(Zeth S., supra, </em>at pp. 412-413.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-5\">In <em>In re Salvador M., supra, </em>133 Cal.App.4th at pages 1421-1422, this court permitted a party to augment the record on appeal to demonstrate that the issues raised in the appeal were moot and the appeal should be dismissed. This court noted that, unlike the postjudgment evidence at issue in <em>Zeth S., </em>the postjudgment evidence before it was not the unsworn statement of counsel. The evidence would have been admissible and relevant if known to the court, and the party\u2019s purpose in requesting the augmented record was to promote the finality of the juvenile court\u2019s judgment. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>In re Josiah Z. </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 664, 676 [31 Cal.Rptr.3d 472, 115 P.3d 1133].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-6\">Here, to avoid further delay and to promote the finality of the judgment, we augment the record on appeal to include the Agency\u2019s addendum reports and the court\u2019s orders contained in the supplemental clerk\u2019s transcript filed September 27, 2007. <em>(In re Salvador M., supra, </em>133 Cal.App.4th at p. 1422.) The augmented record shows the family identified at the section 366.26 hearing withdrew from consideration, as did an out-of-state family several months later and a local family in June 2007. Eric was diagnosed with ADHD, oppositional defiant behavior and suspected developmental delays. Israel continued to receive services for developmental delays, and his behavior improved. With structure and support, A.D. and Joanna stabilized their behaviors. B.D. remained opposed to adoption until Marilyn talked to him and emphasized the importance of staying with his siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-7\">On July 11, 2007, the Agency reported that B.D., A.D., Joanna, Israel and Eric are \u201ca bonded sibling group [that has] waited a long time for an adoptive family. The Agency has located a family that. . . can meet the special needs of these children. The Interstate Compact Placement of Children (ICPC) has approved the placement of these children.\u201d On July 13 the court authorized the children\u2019s placement in the approved adoptive home effective July 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-8\">The augmented record shows the Agency identified an adoptive home for the children within 180 days of the section 366.26 hearing. Thus, the postjudgment evidence shows the issue of adoptability has been rendered moot by the children\u2019s subsequent placement in an approved adoptive home,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and any procedural error was harmless. We are mindful however \u201c[t]hat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>subsequent events bore out this speculation is little more than happenstance, which normally should not be the basis of court orders and judgments.\u201d <em>(In re Salvador M., supra, </em>133 Cal.App.4th at p. 1422.)

(Cf. <em>In re L. Y. L., supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at p. 956; <em>In re Diana G. </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1468, 1481 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 645].) A preliminary assessment includes a social history of all the adults in the proposed relative or foster care home, including screening for criminal records, prior referrals for child abuse and neglect, the capacity to meet the minor\u2019s needs and other requirements. (\u00a7\u00a7 366.21, subd. (i), 366.22, subd. (b).) Although the family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>had adopted in the past, the record shows that one of their sons entered the dependency system at age eight or nine and was now an adult; thus we cannot infer the earlier home study was a relatively recent evaluation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1161-9\"> At the time of the section 366.26 hearing, B.D. was nine years old. A.D. celebrated her seventh birthday less than three weeks later.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1162-9\"> In contrast with the evidence of adoptability presented at the section 366.26 hearing, the supplemental record shows that by June 2007, in addition to an approved adoptive family under consideration, the Agency had identified 10 other families eligible to adopt all five children. Several of the families had specifically requested the children.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
