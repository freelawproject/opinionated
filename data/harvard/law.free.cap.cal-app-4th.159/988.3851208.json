In this case, a jury found by special verdict that Collectors Universe, Inc. (Collectors), used the name of William W. Miller without his consent on 14,060 certificates opining to the authenticity of various collectible autographs and memorabilia. Each certificate corresponded to a separate and different collectible item. The parties disagree\u2014starkly\u2014on the consequence of the jury\u2019s finding. In Miller\u2019s view, the jury\u2019s special verdict entitles him to $10,545,000 in statutory damages, calculated by multiplying 14,060 by $750. Collectors, in contrast, insists Miller\u2019s statutory damages are limited to $750 for the single use of his name on all the certificates. The correct assessment of statutory damages turns on the interpretation of section 3344(a) and the application of that statute to the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">We hold that under the facts shown by the evidence in this case, Miller had but a single cause of action for wrongful appropriation of his name, thereby limiting his statutory damages to $750. Because the entire trial was premised upon a ruling in limine erroneously interpreting and applying section 3344(a), we reverse for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">Prior to July 2000, Miller and his brother-in-law, Darrell Talbert, co-founded and co-owned Odyssey Group and Odyssey Publications (collectively, Odyssey). Odyssey Publications published the Autograph Collector Magazine and other publications. Odyssey Group sold and auctioned celeb<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>rity autographs and memorabilia, specializing in entertainment and historical categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">In July 2000, Collectors purchased Odyssey from Miller and Talbert for a purchase price of $810,00o<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and employed both men as officers of the newly created Odyssey division of Collectors. Collectors engaged in auctioning and selling collectibles. In addition, various divisions of Collectors offered services grading and authenticating stamps, sports cards, coins, and autographs. The division of Collectors that authenticated autographs and autograph memorabilia was PSA/DNA Authentication Services (PSA/DNA). In 2003, PSA/DNA primarily authenticated sports autographs, but sought to expand into historical, political, and entertainment categories, and discussed these plans with Miller. The type of authentication services offered by PSA/DNA involved <em>third party </em>authentication, \u201cwhere a customer submits an autograph to [be authenticated] for a fee.\u201d Miller, in contrast, throughout his collectibles career had performed <em>first party authentication </em>for Odyssey, i.e., authenticating items he personally acquired for Odyssey for resale.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">PSA/DNA charged each third party customer a minimum authentication fee of $50; the fee varied depending on whether the customer requested a <em>certificate </em>of authenticity or a <em>letter </em>of authenticity. Each letter of authenticity cost more than $50 and consisted of a letter-size sheet of paper bearing a detailed description of the authenticated item and a corresponding serial number. A certificate of authenticity, in contrast, cost $50 and was a three-by-five-inch index card stating, \u201cThis item has been examined by PSA/DNA and it is our unwavering opinion that the item is genuine.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, a certificate did not identify or describe in writing the authenticated item. The index card certificates were distinguishable from one another only by an individualized serial number. Regardless of whether a certificate or letter documented an authentication, the authenticated item was marked with DNA ink visible only under a laser lamp. In their appellate briefs, both Miller and Collectors refer to certificates of authenticity <em>and </em>letters of authenticity collectively as \u201cCOA\u2019s.\u201d We adopt that terminology for collective reference to those documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">Between December 2003 and August 2004, Collectors printed approximately 50,000 certificates of authenticity, each bearing Miller\u2019s typed name <em>{not </em>his signature) with the typed names of five other individuals under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>heading \u201cExpert Committee.\u201d Upon a customer\u2019s request for a letter of authenticity in lieu of a certificate, PSA/DNA affixed a serial number to the letter and discarded the unused certificate of authenticity linked to that serial number, so that the total number of COA\u2019s sold during this period never exceeded 50,000. Each letter of authenticity was signed \u201c[o]n behalf of the PSA/DNA Authentication Team\u201d by one of the five experts <em>other than Miller, </em>and beneath this handwritten signature were imprinted the names and signatures of all six team members, including Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Collectors terminated Miller\u2019s employment in May 2004.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In a May 23, 2004 e-mail message, Miller angrily informed Collectors\u2019s chief executive officer, Michael Haynes, that he (Miller) had never been a PSA/DNA authenticator.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Haynes e-mailed back that he would \u201cimmediately make sure [Miller\u2019s] name [was] not associated with [PSA/DNA].\u201d Thereafter, Collectors sold no authentications represented by letters of authenticity bearing Miller\u2019s name. Collectors did, however, sell some authentications backed by certificates of authenticity bearing his name. The reason for Collectors\u2019s continued use of Miller\u2019s name on certificates of authenticity <em>after </em>his termination, according to PSA/DNA\u2019s president, was that PSA/DNA needed \u201ca couple of weeks to round up some of the authenticators who had been traveling at the time, and to also wait for some of the new preprinted certificates that did not have [Miller\u2019s] name on [them].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ultimately, PSA/DNA issued between \u201ca few thousand\u201d and 14,000 COA\u2019s after Miller\u2019s termination and possibly even after June 30, 2004, the date Miller\u2019s attorney demanded that PSA/DNA cease using Miller\u2019s name on COA\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">In August 2004, Miller sued Collectors for common law invasion of privacy and for violating section 3344(a). Collectors cross-complained for misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of contract, and conversion. In phase one of a bifurcated trial (prior to jury selection), Judge Sheila Fell heard argument on whether Miller was entitled under section 3344(a) to recover $750 in statutory damages <em>per </em>COA issued by Collectors without his consent. Judge Fell agreed with Miller\u2019s position that \u201c[$]750 can be applied for each violation,\u201d and clarified that her ruling was based \u201cmostly\u201d on \u201cthe legislative intent.\u201d The corresponding minute order reports the court ruled: <em>\u201cFor each prohibited authentication, </em>plaintiff is permitted to recover the statutory amount of: 1. Actual damages or $750.00 (whichever is greater); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>2. Profits realized by defendant\u2019s unauthorized use; 3. Punitive damages; and, 4. Attorneys fees and costs.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Phase two of the bifurcated trial was held before Judge Robert Monarch, apparently due to \u201cconflicts in Judge Fell\u2019s calendar.\u201d Before commencing his case-in-chief, Miller dismissed with prejudice his claims for common law invasion of privacy and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Judge Monarch instructed the jury with Judicial Council of California Civil Jury Instructions (2003-2004) CACI No. 1804 defining the elements of a section 3344 claim as follows: \u201cPlaintiff claims that defendant violated his right to privacy. To establish this claim, plaintiff must prove all of the following: [][] 1. Defendant knowingly used plaintiff\u2019s name on merchandise or to sell products or services; [&lt;J[] 2. Defendant did not have plaintiff\u2019s consent; [][] 3. Defendant\u2019s use of plaintiff\u2019s name was directly connected to defendant\u2019s commercial purpose; [f] 4. That plaintiff was harmed; and, [][] 5. That defendant\u2019s conduct was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff\u2019s harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">As to the potential damages under section 3344(a), the jury was instructed with a modified version of CACI No. 1821 (proposed by Miller) that, unlike the standard instruction, removed the assessment of damages other than profits from the jury\u2019s purview. The modified version given to the jury provided: \u201cIf you decide that plaintiff has proved his claim against defendant, the court will calculate and award damages, if any, for the certificates of authenticity defendant issued without plaintiff\u2019s consent. [][] In addition, plaintiff may recover any profits that defendant received from the use of plaintiff\u2019s name. To establish the amount of such profits, you must: [deduct defendant\u2019s expenses from the gross revenue from such use.]\u201d Under the standard CACI No. 1821, not given here, entitled \u201cDamages Under Civil Code Section 3344,\u201d the jury \u201cmust decide how much money will reasonably compensate [name of plaintiff] for the harm\u201d and award him or her $750 if the plaintiff fails to prove damages such as humiliation, embarrassment, mental distress, and harm to reputation, or proves \u201can amount of damages less than $750.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">The jury was given a modified special verdict form modeled on CACI Verdict Form No. VF-1804. Whereas the standard form asks the jury to compute the plaintiff\u2019s damages itemized as past economic loss, future economic loss, past noneconomic loss, and future noneconomic loss, the modified form omitted the question, but did ask the jury to determine \u201cthe amount of defendant\u2019s profits attributable to defendant\u2019s use of plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>name.\u201d The modified form also included questions <em>not </em>contained in the standard form, asking \u201c[o]n how many PSAZDNA COA\u2019s did defendant use plaintiff\u2019s name without consent,\u201d \u201c[o]n how many occasions was plaintiff harmed by defendant\u2019s use of his name,\u201d and \u201c[o]n how many occasions was the use of plaintiff\u2019s name by defendant a substantial factor in causing harm to plaintiff.\u201d The jury found that Collectors harmed Miller by knowingly using his name on 14,060 COA\u2019s without his consent and profited from such use in the amount of $14,060.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Unknown to the jury, the consequence of its finding 14,060 unauthorized COA\u2019s was that, pursuant to Judge Fell\u2019s phase one ruling that Miller could recover $750 in statutory damages for each prohibited authentication, Miller\u2019s statutory damages exceeded $10 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Before rendering judgment, Judge Monarch tentatively decided to declare \u201ca mistrial only with respect to the determination of\u2019 statutory damages under section 3344(a). Judge Monarch found \u201cthe damages that would result from complying with [Miller\u2019s] request ... are excessive and violate defendant\u2019s due process rights.\u201d He \u201csuggested that in the event of a retrial, ... the jury be allowed to quantify the damages and be given further guidance in connection to the statutory reference to \u2018unauthorized acts\u2019 and \u2018harm\u2019 as well as the several other factors that should be considered to aid it in arriving at a fair amount of damages with respect to the circumstances of this case.\u201d Rather than accepting Judge Monarch\u2019s suggestion of a mistrial, Miller and Collectors asked him to issue an order that could be immediately appealed. Citing <em>Norgart v. Upjohn Co. </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 383, 399-403 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 453, 981 P.2d 79], Judge Monarch therefore entered judgment in the amount of $0.00 \u201cupon the parties\u2019 stipulation intended solely to facilitate immediate review of that critical issue of law by the Court of Appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">On August 30, 2007, we filed our original opinion in this case. Miller petitioned for rehearing; we granted his petition by order dated September 25, 2007, and invited the parties to submit letter briefs on the applicability of the primary right theory of pleading to this case. Having reviewed each party\u2019s letter brief, we now issue our modified opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">Miller contends \u201cthe plain language and legislative history of section 3344 allow for the statutory minimum damage of $750 to be applied to <em>each </em>of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>Collectors\u2019 14,060 separate unauthorized uses of Miller\u2019s name and signature brought in a single lawsuit.\u201d He further argues that such damages would be \u201cpurely compensatory,\u201d and would \u201cnot amount to an unlawful penalty ... in violation of due process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Collectors contends Miller\u2019s interpretation of section 3344(a) \u201cis not supported by the law or common sense and would result in a windfall of unprecedented proportions,\u201d especially in light of Miller\u2019s election not to prove any actual damages. According to Collectors, \u201cthe plain language of the statute, rules of statutory construction, references to copyright and trademark statutory construction, as well as the case law on point, legislative history, and the California jury instruction related to section 3344(a) all point to the conclusion that [the statute] entitles plaintiffs in Miller\u2019s position to obtain a single award of $750, plus disgorged profits, punitive damages and attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d Alternatively, Collectors argues that if we interpret \u201csection 3344(a) to permit Miller to use the $750 minimum statutory damages provision as a multiplier, . . . such an application of the statute to this case would result in an unconstitutional award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">We address these contentions in the second part of this opinion, examining whether section 3344(a) entitles Miller to recover a single award of $750 for the misappropriation of his name, or instead, statutory damages of $10,545,000 calculated at $750 per unauthorized COA. But first, in the initial part of this opinion, we discuss the single-publication rule\u2014which under certain circumstances limits a plaintiff to a single tort cause of action for multiple copies of a harmful publication\u2014and the reason why the rule does not apply to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">\n<em>The Single-publication Rule Does Not Limit Miller to a Single Cause of Action Under the Facts of This Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">In its briefing, Collectors refers to the 14,060 certificates of authentication as \u201ccopies\u201d of one another, thus implying that the certificates are all exact duplicates. Miller suggests Collectors\u2019s phraseology adopts, sub silentio, the single-publication rule, under which a plaintiff has a single tort cause of action \u201cfounded upon any single publication . . . , such as any one issue of a newspaper or book or magazine . . . .\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3425.3.) Miller goes on to argue that the single-publication rule does not apply to the instant facts, principally because each COA had a different serial number and authenticated a separate item for a separate customer. Miller is tilting at a windmill, however, for Collectors <em>agrees </em>the single-publication rule is inapplicable here, but for a different reason: Collectors posits the single-publication rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>involves \u201cpublications\u201d whereas Miller\u2019s section 3344(a) claim involves \u201cinfringements.\u201d Because the parties agree the single-publication rule is not helpful here, and we agree with that conclusion, we could have moved on with our analysis without further discussion of the rule. But the rule has such an obvious <em>potential </em>application, we explain briefly why we conclude it is not applicable to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Prior to the adoption of the single-publication rule, \u201cthe principle that each communication of a defamatory remark to a new audience constitutes a separate \u2018publication,\u2019 giving rise to a separate cause of action, led to the conclusion that each sale or delivery of a copy of a newspaper or book containing a defamation also constitutes a separate publication of the defamation to a new audience, giving rise to a separate cause of action for defamation. [Citations.] This conclusion had the potential to subject the publishers of books and newspapers to lawsuits stating hundreds, thousands, or even millions of causes of action for a single issue of a periodical or edition of a book. This conclusion also had the potential to disturb the repose that the statute of limitations ordinarily would afford, because a new publication of the defamation could occur if a copy of the newspaper or book were preserved for many years and then came into the hands of a new reader who had not discovered it previously. The statute of limitations could be tolled indefinitely, perhaps forever, under this approach.\u201d <em>(Shively v. Bozanich </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1230, 1243-1244 [7 Cal.Rptr.3d 576, 80 P.3d 676] <em>(Shively).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">\u201cSeeking to avoid <em>both </em>the multiplicity <em>and </em>the staleness of claims . . . , courts fashioned what became known as the single-publication rule, holding that, for any single edition of a newspaper or book, there was but a single potential action for a defamatory statement contained in the newspaper or book, no matter how many copies of the newspaper or the book were distributed.\u201d <em>(Shively, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 1245.) \u201cThe single-publication rule largely has been codified in the Uniform Single Publication Act, which has been adopted in many states, including California.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1246.) The California statute provides; \u201cNo person shall have more than one cause of action for damages for libel or slander or invasion of privacy or any other tort founded upon any single publication or exhibition or utterance, such as any one issue of a newspaper or book or magazine or any one presentation to an audience or any one broadcast over radio or television or any one exhibition of a motion picture. Recovery in any action shall include all damages for any such tort suffered by the plaintiff in all jurisdictions.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3425.3.) Notwithstanding the single-publication rule, \u201ca <em>new edition </em>or new <em>issue </em>of a newspaper or book still constitutes a new publication, giving rise to a new and separate cause of action . . . .\u201d <em>(Shively, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 1245, fn. 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b944-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>The original purpose of the single-publication rule is apparent, both from its history and from the language of the California statute implementing it. The rule was originally directed at <em>mass </em>communications, such as communications in newspapers, books, magazines, radio and television broadcasts, and speeches to an audience. Where the offending language is read or heard by a large audience, the rule limits the plaintiff to a single cause of action for each mass communication. A separate cause of action for each member of the public audience is disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Despite the single-publication rule\u2019s original focus on mass communications, the California Supreme Court has recently held the rule \u201capplies to all publications, including those that receive only limited circulation.\u201d <em>(Hebrew Academy of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Goldman </em>(2007) 42 Cal.4th 883, 893 [70 Cal.Rptr.3d 178, 173 P.3d 1004].) Confusingly, it is not always immediately apparent whether each separate communication to an audience larger than one triggers a new cause of action. Although the rule is \u201cfounded upon any <em>single </em>publication or exhibition or utterance, such as any <em>one </em>issue of a newspaper or book or magazine or any <em>one </em>presentation to an audience or any <em>one </em>broadcast over radio or television or any <em>one </em>exhibition of a motion picture\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3425.3, italics added), in California it nevertheless has been held that six different editions of a newspaper, all dated on the same date but distributed over two days, constitute <em>one issue </em>of the newspaper for purposes of the single-publication rule. <em>(Belli v. Roberts Brothers Furs </em>(1966) 240 Cal.App.2d 284, 289-290 [49 Cal.Rptr. 625] [court relied on Legislature\u2019s choice of the word \u201cissue\u201d rather than the word \u201cedition,\u201d when adopting and modifying the Uniform Single Publication Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3425.1 et seq.), as evidencing legislative intent to create a distinction between the two words].) On the other hand, publication of a paperback edition of a book previously published as a hardback has been held to constitute a new cause of action under the single-publication rule. <em>(Kanarek </em>v. <em>Bugliosi </em>(1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 327, 333 [166 Cal.Rptr. 526].) But despite these nuances as to whether a republication triggers a new cause of action, the words \u201cfounded upon any single publication or exhibition or utterance\u201d must continue to mean the communication of the same words or images to more than one person, whether by writing, displaying, or speaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Here, the evidence showed Collectors distributed over 14,000 COA\u2019s authenticating separate items for different third parties over the course of three months. The evidence does not establish that any COA was issued or directed to more than one person. Instead, individual COA\u2019s were issued to separate individuals to authenticate separate items. Although the COA\u2019s were identical except for an individual serial number, the purchaser of the certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>cate could use that serial number to access a description of the corresponding authenticated article on Collectors\u2019s Web site. Because Collectors\u2019s conduct involved a series of separate transactions rather than the identical communication or display of identical content to multiple persons, we hold the single-publication rule does not apply to the series of separate transactions shown by the evidence and thus does not, by itself, limit Miller to a single cause of action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">\n<em>Interpretation of Section 3344(a)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">Having concluded the single-publication rule does not assist our resolution of this matter, we turn to the interpretation of section 3344(a) and the application of the statute to this case. We begin with a brief discussion of the appropriate standard of review and general principles of statutory construction. Where the relevant facts are undisputed, the interpretation and application of a statute presents a question of law subject to de novo review. <em>(International Engine Parts, Inc. v. Feddersen &amp; Co. </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 606, 611 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 150, 888 P.2d 1279]; <em>People ex rel. Lockyer </em>v. <em>Shamrock Foods Co. </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 415, 432 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 200, 11 P.3d 956].) In independently construing a statute, we strive to ascertain the lawmakers\u2019 intent \u201cso as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>(Day v. City of Fontana </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 268, 272 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 457, 19 P.3d 1196].) We look first to the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of the statute\u2019s words, and only if the language is ambiguous do we resort to extrinsic aids such as legislative history. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Our role is \u201cnot to insert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1858); therefore, we may add to or alter a statute\u2019s words only when necessary to accomplish a purpose apparent on the statute\u2019s face or from its legislative history. <em>(Burden </em>v. <em>Snowden </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 556, 562 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 531, 828 P.2d 672].) Where possible, we construe the statute \u201cso as to avoid absurd or unreasonable results\u201d <em>(Shephard v. Loyola Marymount Univ. </em>(2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 837, 846 [125 Cal.Rptr.2d 829]) and \u201cto preserve its constitutionality\u201d <em>(Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1387 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323]).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">With these precepts in mind, we recite the language of section 3344(a): \u201cAny person who knowingly uses another\u2019s name . . . , in any manner, on or in products, merchandise, or goods, or for purposes of . . . selling, or soliciting purchases of, products, merchandise, goods or services, without such person\u2019s prior consent. . . shall be liable for any damages sustained by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>the person . . . injured as a result thereof. In addition, <em>in any action brought under this </em>section, the person who violated the section shall be liable to the injured party ... in an amount equal to the greater of seven hundred fifty dollars ($750) or the actual damages suffered by him <em>... as a result of the unauthorized use, </em>and any profits from the unauthorized use .... Punitive damages may also be awarded to the injured party ....[][] The prevailing party in any action under this section shall also be entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Both Miller and Collectors reasonably contend the statute\u2019s language supports their respective interpretations. In the absence of proof of actual damage, the statute can be read to limit Miller to a $750 award (aside from disgorged profits, punitive damages and attorney fees and costs) in this single lawsuit or from the single unauthorized use of his name. But the statute can also be interpreted to entitle Miller to a $750 award for <em>each </em>unauthorized use of his name <em>on a product or for purposes of selling a product or service. </em>In other words, section 3344(a) is ambiguous in this respect. Although Collectors strenuously argues the statute\u2019s plain language does not support the use of the \u201c$750 minimum damage provision as a per-copy multiplier,\u201d its characterization of the COA\u2019s as \u201ccopies\u201d of one another inaccurately connotes <em>identical </em>copies. The COA\u2019s were not identical, as each represented a separate and distinct authenticated item, bore an individual serial number, and was issued to a distinct customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">Each party also argues that the opposition\u2019s interpretation would lead to unreasonable results. Miller asserts that to cap Collectors\u2019s liability at $750\u2014an insignificant \u201ccost of doing business\u201d\u2014is unreasonable, especially \u201cbecause Collectors violated the statute on an astronomical scale.\u201d (Italics omitted.) He further claims $750 in damages is tantamount to nominal damages or no damages at all. (See <em>Fairfield v. American Photocopy etc. Co. </em>(1955) 138 Cal.App.2d 82, 87-88 [291 P.2d 194] <em>(Fairfield) </em>[pre-section 3344 case involving common law misappropriation of name and stating nominal damages \u201cinvolve a trivial sum\u201d and are \u201cthe same as no damages at all\u201d].) Collectors, on the other hand, contends that if section 3344(a) entitled plaintiffs to statutory damages of $750 for each \u201ccopy,\u201d plaintiffs would never \u201cbother to prove . . . actual damages.\u201d Collectors points out that section 3344(a) does not limit plaintiffs to arguably nominal damages, since the statute provides for the recovery of actual damages, punitive damages, and the disgorgement of defendant\u2019s profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>The case law on this issue is limited. The parties refer us to two federal cases in which plaintiffs recovered statutory damages under section 3344(a). <em>(IO Group, Inc. v. Adkins </em>(N.D.Cal., June 23, 2005, No. C04-4819) 2005 WL 1492381 <em>(IO Group), Perfect 10, Inc. v. Talisman Communications, Inc. </em>(C.D.Cal., Mar. 27, 2000, No. CV99-10450) 2000 U.S.Dist. Lexis 4564 [2000 WL 364813] <em>(Perfect 10).) </em>But these cases are unhelpful, as each opinion was issued in support of a default judgment, i.e., without opposition.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Without an adversary process to sharpen the debate, these courts arrived at their conclusions with an incomplete recitation of facts and scant legal analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">In <em>IO Group, supra, </em>2005 WL 1492381, a number of models had assigned their right of publicity to the plaintiff. <em>(Id. </em>at p. *7.) A total of 101 photographs were appropriated by the defendant, but the opinion does not state whether photographs of 101 different models were appropriated or whether the defendant appropriated multiple photographs of fewer models. Nevertheless, without further explanation, and in addition to copyright infringement damages, the plaintiff assignee was awarded $750 for each of the 101 misappropriated photographs for a total of $75,750 in section 3344(a) statutory damages. <em>(IO Group, </em>at pp. *1, *7.) Without more, we cannot determine whether the publicity rights of 101 different persons were appropriated (101 causes of action) or whether the likenesses of fewer models were appropriated but the court adopted a \u201cper photograph\u201d analysis similar to that urged here by Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">In <em>Perfect 10, supra, </em>2000 WL 364813, the plaintiff was likewise the assignee of the publicity rights of four models. Six photographs of four models were misappropriated. In addition to copyright infringement damages, the plaintiff was awarded $750 for each of the four models (in six misappropriated photographs) for a total of $3,000 in section 3344(a) statutory damages; in other words, the plaintiff was <em>not </em>awarded $750 per photograph. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. *1, *4\u2014*5.) But the opinion does not tell us whether any of the photographs were duplicates, and the court does not engage in any legal analysis in support of its decision. Thus <em>IO Group </em>and <em>Perfect 10 </em>do not assist us in interpreting section 3344(a) to resolve the issue at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>We turn to the statute\u2019s legislative history. Both parties argue the 1984 amendments to section 3344(a)\u2014allowing a plaintiff to recover punitive damages and the defendant\u2019s disgorged profits\u2014support their respective positions. Collectors contends the Legislature, by making punitive damages available, \u201cremoved <em>any </em>plausible argument that the plaintiff could use the $750 minimum as a punitive multiplier.\u201d Miller, on the other hand, argues the Legislature, by raising the minimum recovery from $300 to $750 and authorizing punitive damages, profits, attorney fees and costs, intended \u201cto <em>further expand </em>protections for celebrity and non-celebrity plaintiffs alike.\u201d Again, both parties have a plausible argument, so we must search further for an answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">The statute\u2019s legislative history reveals section 3344(a) was intended to fill \u201ca gap which exist[ed] in the common law tort of invasion of privacy\u201d as applied to noncelebrity plaintiffs whose names lacked \u201ccommercial value on the open market.\u201d (Assemblymember Vasconcellos, letter to Governor Reagan, re Assem. Bill No. 826 (1971 Reg. Sess.) Nov. 10, 1971, p. 1.) Unlike an entertainment or sports star, noncelebrity plaintiffs often could not prove damages under the common law; therefore, section 3344(a) as originally enacted in 1971 \u201cestablished a concrete remedy for the little man with a minimum of $300 payment,\u201d \u201ca simple, civil remedy for the injured individual.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Letter to Gov. Reagan, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 1-2.) A legislative analysis of the bill quotes the following passage from <em>Fairfield, supra, </em>138 Cal.App.2d at pages 86-87: \u201cUnlike [an] action for defamation, \u2018The gist of the cause of action in a privacy case is not injury to the character or reputation, but a direct wrong of a personal character resulting in injury to the feelings without regard to any effect which the publication may have on the property, business, pecuniary interest, or the standing of the individual in the community. . . . The right of privacy concerns one\u2019s own peace of mind, while the right of freedom from defamation concerns primarily one\u2019s reputation. . . . The injury is mental and subjective. It impairs the mental peace and comfort of the person and may cause suffering much more acute than that caused by a bodily injury . . . .\u2019 \u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 826 (1971 Reg. Sess.) June 14, 1971, p. 1.) Thus, by enacting section 3344(a), the Legislature provided a practical remedy for a noncelebrity plaintiff whose damages are difficult to prove and who suffers primarily mental harm from the commercial misappropriation of his or her name.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">Miller relies heavily on this purpose, and as further support for his interpretation of section 3344(a), refers us to a 1977 Legislative Counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>opinion interpreting the statute to authorize statutory minimum damages for <em>each </em>prohibited use. Specifically, the opinion states the minimum recovery is \u201cauthorized per each use irrespective of whether the prohibited uses are established in separate actions or in a single action in which more than one cause of action is permissively joined or required by the court to be consolidated.\u201d (Ops. Cal. Legis. Counsel, No. 16283 (Nov. 8, 1977) Use of Another\u2019s Likeness, p. A-12 (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Opn.); see <em>California Assn.of Psychology Providers v. Rank </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 1, 17 [270 Cal.Rptr.796, 793 P.2d 2] [Opinions of Legislative Counsel may be considered when construing a statute].) The opinion\u2019s \u201c[a]nalysis\u201d states in pertinent part: \u201c[Assuming the existence of more than a single publication or exhibition or utterance constituting a prohibited use under Section 3344, a person injured by such use would be entitled to the $300 minimum as to each separate action filed in which a violation is proven, [f] Likewise, in our opinion the same result would obtain with respect to an action in which more than one cause of action is joined or consolidated pursuant to Section 427.10 or 1048 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Otherwise, to construe the term \u2018action\u2019 so as to authorize an award of $300, as a minimum, only as to separately filed causes of action would be to ignore the practical, and give meaning to the technical, sense of such term.\u201d (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Opn., <em>supra, </em>at p. A-13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">As foreshadowed by Legislative Counsel\u2019s use of the phrase \u201csingle publication or exhibition or utterance,\u201d the analysis also discusses the single-publication rule: \u201cFurther, Section 3344 would be construed in light of Section 3425.3 of the Civil Code, which prohibits the splitting of a cause of action founded upon a single publication or exhibition or utterance. Thus, a plaintiff suing under Section 3344 would have only one cause of action for damages founded upon any single publication, exhibition, utterance, such as one issue of a newspaper or magazine or any one presentation to an audience or any one broadcast over radio or television .... While Section 3344 subjects a person to liability for an unauthorized \u2018use,\u2019 and Section 3425.3 is phrased in terms of a \u2018publication or exhibition or utterance,\u2019 the terms are sufficiently similar as to have virtually identical meanings within the context of the question presented.\u201d (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Opn., <em>supra, </em>at p. A-13.) Thus, the opinion implicitly equates the word \u201cuse\u201d with \u201ccause of action,\u201d and recognizes that in the case of a communication to which the single-publication rule applies, only a single \u201cuse,\u201d i.e., a single cause of action, would arise out of a single distribution by publication, exhibition or utterance, no matter the size of the audience.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">While consideration of the 1977 Legislative Counsel\u2019s opinion is appropriate, we give it limited weight as an expression of legislative intent. The opinion was issued in 1977 in response to a question from Assemblymember <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>John Vasconcellos, the author of the bill enacting Civil Code section 3344. We have no evidence that the opinion, issued six years after Civil Code section 3344 was adopted, was ever considered by the Legislature as a whole in connection with any proposed legislation, and the statute was not amended again until 1984, seven years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Miller contends the Legislative Counsel\u2019s opinion should be accorded decisive weight, relying on <em>California Assn. of Psychology Providers v. Rank, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 1. But the Legislative Counsel\u2019s opinion in <em>California Assn. </em>was issued only one year after the relevant statute\u2019s enactment and one year before that statute\u2019s subsequent amendment, and was seconded by a subsequent Attorney General\u2019s opinion. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 16-17.) In addition, in <em>California Assn., </em>our Supreme Court found \u201cthe most significant source\u201d of legislative intent to be \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s own declaration of findings and purpose that accompanied the 1978 legislation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">Despite the limited weight we accord the 1977 Legislative Counsel\u2019s opinion as an expression of <em>legislative </em>intent, we believe the <em>reasoning </em>contained in the opinion is basically sound. Read in its entirety, the opinion interprets the statute as authorizing minimum damages of $750 for each cause of action arising from each prohibited use. Miller\u2019s embrace of the opinion reflects his misinterpretation of the opinion based upon an isolated sentence in the opinion, together with his (unwarranted) assumption that the issuance of each COA without his consent was a separate \u201cunauthorized use\u201d constituting a separate cause of action. Based on this assumption, Miller contends he could have brought 14,060 lawsuits, but that it would be absurd to interpret the statute to require such a wasteful enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">This brings us to the basic question of whether Miller could have stated 14,060 causes of action in this case. We conclude he could not, because to do so would constitute an impermissible splitting of a single cause of action. We reach this conclusion by turning to \u201cthe primary right theory utilized in California to determine whether causes of action are identical[; i.e., in this case, whether the issuance of each successive COA generated a separate cause of action]. \u2018California follows the primary right theory of Pomeroy; i.e., a cause of action consists of 1) a primary right possessed by the plaintiff, 2) a corresponding primary duty devolving upon the defendant, and 3) a delict or wrong done by the defendant which consists in a breach of such primary right and duty. [Citation.] Thus, <em>two actions constitute a single cause of action if they both affect the same primary right.\u2019 \u201d (Richard B. LeVine, Inc. </em>v. <em>Higashi </em>(2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 566, 575 [32 Cal.Rptr.3d 244].) We note the primary right theory \u201chas been criticized on the ground that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>the term \u2018primary right\u2019 is not of fixed meaning, but may be broadly or narrowly interpreted.\u201d (4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Pleading, \u00a7 25, p. 86.) Nonetheless, the idea that \u201c[t]he cause of action is based upon the <em>injury </em>to the plaintiff\u2019 <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 26, p. 88), provides parameters useful in determining whether a plaintiff has violated the rule against splitting a single cause of action. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 35, p. 95.) And, as Collectors points out, the primary right theory has been consistently recognized and followed by our Supreme Court in determining whether a party may plead more than one cause of action or bring more than one lawsuit arising from the same facts. <em>(Grisham </em>v. <em>Philip Morris U.S.A., Inc. </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 623, 641-643 [54 Cal.Rptr.3d 735, 151 P.3d 1151]; <em>Mycogen Corp. v. Monsanto Co. </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 888, 904 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 51 P.3d 297]; <em>Bay Cities Paving &amp; Grading, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lawyers\u2019 Mutual Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 854, 860 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 691, 855 P.2d 1263]; <em>Slater </em>v. <em>Blackwood </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 791, 795 [126 Cal.Rptr. 225, 543 P.2d 593]; <em>Busick v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 967, 975 [104 Cal.Rptr. 42, 500 P.2d 1386].) Miller criticizes the primary right theory as being inherently imprecise and \u201can ill-defined analytical tool,\u201d but acknowledges the theory does \u201chave its place\u201d \u201cto prohibit splitting causes of action in order to abate a later suit\u201d\u2014a \u201climited, less controversial application\u201d which Miller claims \u201cis not germane to the facts of this case.\u201d But as previously discussed, this case turns on the basic question of whether Miller was entitled to bring 14,060 lawsuits for Collectors\u2019s 14,060 uses of his name, i.e., whether Collectors\u2019s issuance of 14,060 COA\u2019s resulted in 14,060 causes of action under section 3344(a). Thus, we utilize the primary right theory for exactly the same \u201climited, less controversial application\u201d for which Miller acknowledges the theory has \u201cits place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Here, the harm Miller suffered, and which section 3344(a)\u2019s minimum statutory damages were intended to remedy, was the alleged injury to his mental feelings and peace of mind, as elucidated in <em>Fairfield, supra, </em>138 Cal.App.2d at pages 86-87. As further explained in <em>Dora </em>v. <em>Frontline Video, Inc. </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 536 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 790], misappropriation has two aspects: (1) the right of publicity protecting the commercial value of celebrities\u2019 names and likenesses, and (2) \u201cthe appropriation of the name and likeness that brings injury to the feelings, that concerns one\u2019s own peace of mind, and that is mental and subjective.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 541-542.) In making his case on appeal for recovering statutory damages, Miller discusses <em>Fairfield </em>at length and the difficulty of proving mental harm caused by name misappropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">He also asserts, however, that the two aspects of misappropriation (appropriation of commercial value as opposed to injury to feelings) are \u201cnot necessarily\u201d mutually exclusive. Thus, he also alleges he suffered commercial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>loss from the dilution of the value of his future authentications, and damage to his professional reputation because his name is forever tied to 14,060 items which may be \u201ctraded in the commercial marketplace over and over again\u201d and may be of questionable authenticity. He characterizes these losses as \u201cdifficult (if not impossible) to quantify and prove.\u201d But the legislative history of section 3344(a) reveals the statutory minimum damages were meant to compensate noncelebrity plaintiffs who suffer the <em>Fairfield </em>form of mental anguish yet no discernible commercial loss. To the extent Miller suffered commercial loss due to his status as an authenticator well-known and respected in \u201cthe close-knit autograph and collectibles industry,\u201d his recourse was to prove actual damages like any other plaintiff whose name has commercial value.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We conclude the primary right protected by section 3344(a)\u2019s provision for statutory minimum damages is the right to be free from the <em>Fairfield </em>form of mental anguish resulting from commercial misappropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">But we must still decide whether Miller suffered a new violation of his primary right with each new COA, i.e. \u201cseparate wrongs\u201d (4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Pleading, \u00a7 40, p. 100), such as to constitute 14,060 causes of action. Our decision is informed by those cases that have considered whether a series of related acts, having a common purpose or committed pursuant to a common plan or scheme, but resulting in the same injury or harm, give rise to a single cause or multiple causes of action. Although the cases we look to for guidance did not involve section 3344(a), the courts\u2019 analyses are nevertheless apt to the issue at hand\u2014whether a series of related acts causing the same injury or harm gives rise to more than one cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Thus, in <em>Conger v. White </em>(1945) 69 Cal.App.2d 28 [158 P.2d 415], the plaintiff alleged she was the victim of a conspiracy to defraud her in connection with the purchase and sale of three separate parcels of real property. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 30, 41.) \u201cAll of the acts of defendants were alleged to have been done in pursuance of this common purpose and design. The same representations were relied upon as a basis of the charges of fraud in each\u201d of three sales of real property. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 41.) Despite the fact the plaintiff had been defrauded in three separate property transactions, the court held that the \u201cseries of fraudulent acts committed in the execution of an entire scheme to divest plaintiff of [her] property states a single cause of action.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>In <em>Tooke v. Allen </em>(1948) 85 Cal.App.2d 230 [192 P.2d 804], the defendant landlord committed a series of wrongful acts against his tenant including failing \u201cto furnish adequate telephone, gas, water, and electric service,\u201d \u201ctaking and [detaining] plaintiff\u2019s clothing and other personal belongings,\u201d and \u201clocking plaintiff out and invading her apartment and committing . . . assaults.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 234.) The landlord asserted the plaintiff\u2019s complaint improperly joined multiple causes of action: \u201cunlawful detention of personal property,\u201d \u201cpersonal injuries,\u201d \u201cinjury to property,\u201d \u201ceviction,\u201d and \u201cnuisance.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>But the court held the tenant\u2019s right of peaceful possession was the primary right violated by the landlord\u2019s conduct. Noting the gravamen of the defendant\u2019s offense was \u201cthe <em>pursuit of a purpose </em>of unrelenting persecution by petty annoyances,\u201d the court held that despite the series of different acts, only a single cause of action was stated for the interference with the plaintiff\u2019s right of peaceful possession. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 236, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">Similarly, in <em>Oppenheimer v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1951) 104 Cal.App.2d 551 [232 P.2d 30], the plaintiff alleged he was wrongfully jailed, and while falsely imprisoned, his jailers assaulted and starved him. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 552.) The court held the allegations of assault were \u201c \u2018only an \u201caggravating fact\u201d or circumstance attending the defendant\u2019s commission of the one cause of action ... of false imprisonment,\u2019 \u201d and did not constitute a separate cause of action. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 553.)</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">In <em>Bay Cities Paving &amp; Grading, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lawyers\u2019 Mutual Ins. Co., supra, 5 </em>Cal.4th 854, the court construed the meaning of the word \u201cclaim\u201d in a legal malpractice insurance policy. Acknowledging the primary rights theory was not controlling, the high court nevertheless found it \u201cillustrative.\u201d Thus the high court began its analysis of the coverage issue by noting the plaintiff \u201cwas not asserting two causes of action. [The plaintiff] had a single injury and thus a single cause of action against its attorney.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 860.) The plaintiff\u2019s right to be free of negligence by its attorney was allegedly breached in <em>two </em>different ways, but nevertheless remained a <em>single </em>right constituting a single cause of action. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">Finally, in another fraud case, <em>Stoner </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 986 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 243], the defendant was charged with committing seven separate fraudulent acts. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 993-994.) In the context of determining whether the trial court erred in not requiring the jury \u201cto agree on the same fraudulent act provided at least nine jurors agreed that all of the elements of fraud were proved by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 990), the court held only a single cause of action was stated despite \u201cmultiple, alternative fraudulent acts . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1004.)</p>\n<p id=\"b954-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>Here, 14,060 COA\u2019s were issued to authenticate 14,060 separate items. But they were all issued for a common purpose pursuant to a common plan: to use Miller\u2019s name as a member of the panel of authentication experts. The separate COA\u2019s were related to each other by this common purpose and plan. The COA\u2019s were printed at the same time\u2014only the serial numbers were different\u2014and they were issued seriatim as authentication services were purchased by the customers. Miller\u2019s injury, the worry and uncertainty regarding his reputation and his potential liability for improperly authenticated items, occurred when Collectors knowingly issued its first COA without his prior consent. The number of COA\u2019s issued may be relevant to his actual damages, if any, and to punitive damages. But with regard to his statutory damages, the issuance of subsequent improper COA\u2019s did not give rise to new causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">In sum, Miller\u2019s claim against Collectors for the misappropriation of his name under section 3344(a) constitutes a single cause of action for which his statutory damages are $750. Since we have decided this case based on our interpretation and application of the statute that limits Miller to a single section 3344(a) cause of action for his actual damages or statutory damages of $750, whichever is greater, we do not address the parties\u2019 alternative contentions regarding whether an award of over 10 million dollars would constitute an unconstitutional penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">In phase one of the bifurcated trial, the court interpreted section 3344(a) to allow $750 in statutory damages for each unauthorized COA. With that ruling in hand, Miller proceeded to dismiss his common law invasion of privacy claim and his prayer for punitive damages, and to try this case without attempting to introduce evidence of actual damages. The award of disgorged profits in the amount of $14,060 has not been challenged on appeal. Likewise, the stipulation for judgment on the cross-complaint is not affected by our decision. Under these circumstances, we reverse the judgment and remand with conditional directions to the trial court. Miller may elect either (1) to have judgment on the complaint entered for the disgorged profits of $14,060 together with $750 for his section 3344(a) statutory damages, or (2) to have a new trial on the entire complaint. Miller shall file his election with the trial court within 60 days after this court\u2019s issuance of its remittitur.

Collectors shall recover its costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Rylaarsdam, Acting R J., and O\u2019Leary, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">The petition of appellant William W. Miller for review by the Supreme Court was denied April 23, 2008, S161716. George C.

These exhibits are illustrative examples of certificates of authenticity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b939-7\"> Pursuant to the employment contract, Collectors paid Miller a total of $750,000 in compensation for the five-year period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b939-8\"> At trial the PSA/DNA president testified Miller never authenticated any autographs on the company\u2019s behalf.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b939-9\"> In April, Collectors had ordered a printing of certificates of authenticity without Miller\u2019s name, but the certificates did not arrive before his termination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b941-9\"> In his closing statement, Miller\u2019s counsel asked the jury to award Miller $1 in profit for each COA issued by Collectors without his consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b941-10\"> The court also awarded Miller $14,060 for profits Collectors made from the unauthorized use of his name. Pursuant to a stipulation for judgment on the cross-complaint, the court awarded Collectors $4,812.50 under Miller\u2019s 2002 promissory note to Collectors, and $33,000 for money Collectors advanced to Miller in 2001. The court deferred naming the prevailing party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b945-8\"> We do not suggest the single-publication rule would never apply to a cause of action under Civil Code section 3344.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b946-6\"> We omit the statute\u2019s reference to the use of another\u2019s <em>signature </em>since the jury found only that Collectors used Miller\u2019s <em>name </em>without his consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b947-7\"> These federal decisions on matters of California law, \u201calthough entitled to respect and careful consideration, [are not] binding or conclusive on the courts of this state.\u201d <em>(Bank of Italy etc. Assn. v.

District Court </em>(1994) 110 Nev. 513 [874 P.2d 762] <em>(Hetter), </em>where a court interpreted a Nevada statute similar to section 3344(a) to limit a plastic surgery patient to recovery of $750 for the misappropriation in a brochure of \u201cher before-and-after pictures,\u201d rather than $750 for each person \u201cwho saw her picture\u201d in the brochure. (874 P.2d at pp. 763, 765.) Miller argues <em>Hetter </em>in effect applies the single-publication rule to limit the plaintiff\u2019s recovery, without using those express words, and we agree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b948-6\"> The 1984 amendment of Civil Code section 3344 increased the minimum damages from $300 to $750.
