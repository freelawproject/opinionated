Code, \u00a7 647, subd. (b)). In May, he was notified that the City of Los Angeles had initiated forfeiture proceedings under section 41.70 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code, which authorizes the seizure and forfeiture of vehicles used to solicit prostitution. Reinsdorf challenged the City\u2019s action, claiming the ordinance was preempted by state law and relying on <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>City of Stockton</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Cal.App.), in which the Third District held that a similar City of Stockton ordinance was preempted by state law. The trial court agreed, gave judgment to Reinsdorf against the City, and later granted Reinsdorf\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $49,735.90.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-8\">The City appealed, relying on <em>Horton v. City of Oakland </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 580 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 371] (disapproved by <em>O\u2019Connell v. City of Stockton </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 1061, 1072-1074 [63 Cal.Rptr.3d 67, 162 P.3d 583]) in which the First District had rejected a similar preemption challenge to a City of Oakland ordinance authorizing the civil forfeiture of vehicles involved in soliciting prostitution or acquiring drugs. By that time, the Supreme Court had granted review in <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>and on September 25, 2006, we rejected Reinsdorf\u2019s preemption argument, reversed, and remanded the matter to the trial court with directions to consider the merits of Reinsdorf\u2019s motion. <em>(City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>2000 Jeep Cherokee </em>(Sept. 25, 2006, B185673) [nonpub. opn.].) As we anticipated, the Supreme Court granted review in our case, held it pending the decision in <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>City of Stockton, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th 1061, then transferred our case back to us with directions to vacate our earlier decision and reconsider the cause in light of <em>O\u2019Connell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>Having done so, we conclude (and the City concedes) that <em>O\u2019Connell </em>compels affirmance of the judgment on the ground that the Los Angeles ordinance is preempted by state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-6\">Section 41.70 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code provides as relevant that \u201c[a]ny vehicle used to solicit or [otherwise] engage in an act of prostitution is declared a nuisance and the vehicle shall be enjoined and abated as provided in this section,\u201d and that \u201c[a]ll right, title and interest in any [such] vehicle . . . shall vest in the City upon commission of the act giving rise to the nuisance under this section.\u201d A \u201cvehicle subject to forfeiture under this section\u201d may be seized upon an order of court or without court order if the \u201cseizure is incident to an arrest or search under a search warrant\u201d or there is \u201cprobable cause to believe the vehicle was used in violation of this section.\u201d The ordinance requires an immediate investigation by the seizing agency, notice of the seizure to the vehicle\u2019s owner, and notice of a potential claimant\u2019s right to a postseizure hearing to determine the validity of the seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-8\">Under article XI, section 7 of the California Constitution, \u201c[a] county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local, police, sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations <em>not in conflict </em>with general [state] laws.\u201d (Italics added.) If otherwise valid local legislation <em>does </em>conflict with state law, it is preempted by such law and is void\u2014and such a conflict exists if the local legislation <em>duplicates, contradicts, </em>or enters an area <em>fully occupied </em>by general law, either expressly or by legislative implication. <em>(O\u2019Connell v. City of Stockton, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 1067.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-9\">A local ordinance <em>duplicates </em>state law when it is coextensive with state law; it <em>contradicts </em>state law when it is inimical to or cannot be reconciled with state law; and it <em>enters a field fully occupied </em>by state law either (1) when the Legislature <em>expressly manifests </em>its intent to occupy the legal area or (2) when the Legislature <em>impliedly </em>occupies the field. <em>(O\u2019Connell v. City of Stockton, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at pp. 1067-1068.) The Legislature has <em>impliedly </em>occupied an area of law when (1) the subject matter has been so fully and completely covered by general law as to clearly indicate that it has become exclusively a matter of state concern; (2) the subject matter has been partially covered by general law couched in such terms as to indicate clearly that a paramount state concern will not tolerate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>further or additional local action; or (3) the subject matter has been partially covered by general law and the subject is of such a nature that the adverse effect of a local ordinance on the transient citizens of the state outweighs the possible benefit to the locality. <em>(O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>City of Stockton, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 1068.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-5\">As noted above, the Los Angeles ordinance provides for the forfeiture of any vehicle used to solicit or engage in an act of prostitution. The ordinance at issue in <em>O\u2019Connell v. City of Stockton, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th 1061 had a substantively indistinguishable provision (and, unlike ours, also provided for the seizure of vehicles used for illegal drug activity). In <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>the Supreme Court first concluded that the state\u2019s comprehensive regulation of drug offenses as a whole <em>impliedly </em>preempted the City of Oakland\u2019s ordinance allowing forfeiture of vehicles used in acquiring controlled substances <em>{id. </em>at p. 1072), then turned to the other aspect of the Oakland forfeiture ordinance, \u201callowing for the forfeiture of any vehicle used to solicit prostitution\u201d <em>{id. </em>at p. 1073), and concluded that this part of the ordinance was <em>expressly </em>preempted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1199-6\">\u201cVehicle Code section 21 states: \u2018Except as otherwise expressly provided, the provisions of this code are applicable and uniform throughout the State and in all counties and municipalities therein, and <em>no local authority shall enact or enforce any ordinance on the matters covered by this code unless expressly authorized </em>herein.\u2019 (Italics added.) Thus, under section 21, local regulation of any \u2018matter[]\u2019 covered by this state\u2019s Vehicle Code is prohibited unless the Legislature has expressly allowed local regulation in that field. [Citations.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1199-7\">\u201cThe matter that is covered by the Vehicle Code and that is pertinent here is the authority of local government entities to declare a vehicle used in soliciting prostitution to be a public nuisance. That topic is addressed in the Vehicle Code by subdivision (a) of section 22659.5. That provision allows a city or a county to \u2018adopt an ordinance establishing a five-year pilot program that implements procedures for declaring <em>any motor vehicle a public nuisance\u2019 </em>when used in the commission of specified criminal conduct, including acts covered in Penal Code section 647, subdivision (b), which prohibits engaging in acts of prostitution as well as soliciting or agreeing to engage in such acts. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 22659.5, subd. (a), italics added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>\u201cSubdivision (b) of Vehicle Code section 22659.5 permits local ordinances adopted under the statutory scheme to \u2018include procedures to enjoin and abate the declared [vehicular] nuisance by ordering the defendant not to use the vehicle again,\u2019 and it allows for the forcible removal of vehicles. Under subdivision (c) of section 22659.5, any action taken to abate a public nuisance is limited to those \u2018specified in subdivision (b),\u2019 that is, an injunction against or abatement of a declared nuisance or the removal of a nuisance vehicle. Section 22659.5 contains no language, however, that would allow a local entity such as the City [of Oakland] to seize and forfeit a vehicle that, through its use in soliciting prostitution, has created a public nuisance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1200-4\">\u201cWe summarize: Vehicle Code section 21 precludes local regulation of \u2018matters covered\u2019 by the Vehicle Code, absent express legislative authorization. The use of vehicles in soliciting prostitution is a matter that the Vehicle Code covers in section 22659.5, which establishes a five-year pilot program under which cities and counties may treat as a public nuisance any vehicle used in soliciting prostitution, but that pilot program does not allow for forfeiture of the vehicle. There being no express legislative authorization for any other form of local regulation of the matter covered by Vehicle Code section 22659.5, Vehicle Code section 21 precludes an ordinance like [Oakland\u2019s], which seeks to regulate vehicle use in soliciting prostitution by requiring forfeiture of the vehicle. Under Vehicle Code section 21, therefore, the City\u2019s ordinance is <em>expressly preempted </em>by state law.\u201d <em>(O\u2019Connell v. City of Stockton, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at pp. 1073-1074.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1200-5\"><em>O\u2019Connell </em>disapproves <em>Horton v. City of Oakland, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th 580 <em>(O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>City of Stockton, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 1074), rejects the City of Oakland\u2019s effort to uphold its ordinance on the ground that it addressed conduct \u201cexclusively\u201d within the purview of state law <em>(id. </em>at p. 1075), and concludes that the \u201cillicit commercial activities\u2014prostitution and trafficking in controlled substances\u2014that are the focus of [Oakland\u2019s] vehicle forfeiture ordinance are matters of statewide concern that our Legislature has comprehensively addressed through various provisions of this state\u2019s Penal and Vehicle Codes, leaving no room for further regulation at the local level. One of the lesser harms associated with the crimes is the traffic congestion that may result when vehicles are used to solicit acts of prostitution or to buy or sell drugs illegally on city streets. Although traffic congestion is a local problem that cities ordinarily are authorized to address, they may not do so by means of an ordinance that, by allowing forfeiture of a vehicle used to commit a specific state law violation, impinges on an area fully occupied or exclusively covered by state law.\u201d <em>(O\u2019Connell v. City of Stockton, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 1076.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>Because the City of Los Angeles\u2019s ordinance is substantively indistinguishable from the Oakland ordinance, it follows ineluctably that our ordinance is also expressly preempted by state law and that the judgment in favor of Reinsdorf must be affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">This brings us to the issue of attorney\u2019s fees, which the trial court awarded to Reinsdorf in the amount of $49,735.90 on the ground that his litigation of the preemption issue resulted in the invalidation of the Los Angeles ordinance. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1021.5.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On its appeal from that order, the City contends the fee award did not establish an important right affecting the public interest, or confer any real benefit on anyone other than Reinsdorf, and that Reinsdorf\u2019s personal financial interest outweighed any public benefit. We reject these claims seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">We agree with the trial court that Reinsdorf\u2019s litigation of the preemption issue established an important right affecting the public interest, and reject the City\u2019s contention that the only right vindicated in this case was \u201cthe right to use a vehicle for prostitution without threat of forfeiture.\u201d <em>(Woodland Hills Residents Assn., Inc. v. City Council </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 917, 935-936 [154 Cal.Rptr. 503, 593 P.2d 200] [in determining the importance of the particular vindicated right, courts should realistically assess the signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>canee of that right in terms of its relationship to the achievement of fundamental legislative goals].) The City took vehicles under an ordinance preempted by state law, thereby depriving the drivers and owners of those vehicles of their use. Because Reinsdorf\u2019s lawsuit forced the City to abandon its ordinance and comply with state law, the public interest was served\u2014and no more was required. <em>(San Bernardino Valley Audubon Society, Inc. v. County of San Bernardino </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 738, 754 [202 Cal.Rptr. 423]; <em>State of California </em>v. <em>County of Santa Clara </em>(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 608, 614-615 [191 Cal.Rptr. 204]; cf. <em>American Financial Services Assn. v. City of Oakland </em>(2005) 34 Cal.4th 1239, 1258 [23 Cal.Rptr.3d 453, 104 P.3d 813]; <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Hannigan </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 587, 591 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 213]; <em>People ex rel. Renne </em>v. <em>Servantes </em>(2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1081, 1090-1091 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 870].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">We reject the City\u2019s contention that any benefit conferred by this litigation was speculative and undone by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>O\u2019Connell. </em>The trial court rejected the City\u2019s reliance on <em>Horton </em>and followed the Third District\u2019s opinion in <em>O\u2019Connell. </em>After the Supreme Court granted review in <em>O\u2019Connell </em>but before it rendered its decision in that case, we followed <em>Horton </em>and reversed the trial court\u2019s decision. The Supreme Court then affirmed <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>overruled <em>Horton, </em>and remanded this case to us for reconsideration in light of <em>O\u2019Connell. </em>As explained above, <em>O\u2019Connell </em>means the trial court was right and we were wrong. Given this sequence of events, it is clear that the trial court\u2019s decision was validated by the Supreme Court, not undone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-6\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-7\">We reject the City\u2019s contention that the trial court\u2019s ruling did not affect the general public or a large class of persons. Although the ordinance in question applied only to persons using a vehicle for prostitution or pandering, the fact that the ordinance was adopted proves the problem was sufficiently pervasive to warrant exercise of the City\u2019s legislative powers. Moreover, the record establishes that the ordinance affected not only those who were allegedly involved in prostitution and pandering, but also nondriving owners of the vehicles as well as lending institutions and lienholders when the vehicles were financed, plus car rental companies, employers and spouses. Leaving to one side any questions about Reinsdorf s guilt or innocence, a sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>significant number of nonoffending owners and others were affected by the City\u2019s enforcement of its preempted ordinance to satisfy section 1021.5. (See <em>Isaac v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 586, 592, 599-601 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 752].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-4\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">We agree with the trial court that the financial burden of this litigation outweighed Reinsdorf s personal financial interest in regaining his vehicle. In deciding that Reinsdorf\u2019s defense of this litigation transcended his personal interest in the return of his vehicle <em>(County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 82, 89 [144 Cal.Rptr. 71]), the court considered the facts that Reinsdorf had rejected the City\u2019s offer to settle the entire case for money, that he understood his pursuit of the preemption issue could delay indefinitely the time at which he might again see his vehicle and that, significantly, he argued against a finding of mootness when as part of a stipulation his car was returned to him before the trial court proceedings were resolved. As the court summed it up: \u201cThe limited financial exposure presented by forfeiture of a five year old vehicle, as contrasted with Reinsdorf\u2019s willingness to proceed with what he was warned would be an expensive, lengthy and complicated process, coupled with [his] willingness to address an issue which had been informally resolved in his favor, indicate . . . that [his] motivation and burden did transcend his own financial self-interest.\u201d The trial court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-6\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-7\">In his post <em>-O\u2019Connell </em>supplemental brief, Reinsdorf asks for an additional award of fees, claiming this <em>appeal </em>succeeded in enforcing an important right affecting the public benefit within the meaning of section 1021.5. We disagree. First, Reinsdorf was not the prevailing party on this appeal when it first came before us. Second, this case remained alive and Reinsdorf is the prevailing party today only because Kendra O\u2019Connell, the prevailing plaintiff in <em>O\u2019Connell v. City of Stockton, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th 1061, persuaded the Supreme Court to reject <em>Horton </em>and affirm the Third District\u2019s decision in <em>O\u2019Connell. </em>Put another way, Reinsdorf\u2019s appeal just happened to be in the pipeline when the Supreme Court granted review in <em>O\u2019Connell. </em>For these reasons, Reinsdorf is not entitled to an additional award of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-4\">The judgment is affirmed. Reinsdorf is entitled to his costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-5\">Mallano, Acting P. J., and Rothschild, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied February 14, 2008, and the petitions of both appellant and respondent for review by the Supreme Court were denied April 30, 2008, S161049.

For Supreme Court opinion, see 41 Cal.4th 1061.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1201-8\"> The Los Angeles ordinance was adopted after <em>Horton </em>approved the Oakland ordinance. In 2002, the Los Angeles City Council found: \u201cThe City of Oakland is one of many municipalities in California . . . that have enacted vehicular forfeiture statutes using local control. These laws have been shown to decrease nuisance prostitution activity when applied in areas of blatant streetwalking prostitution. The California Supreme Court [presumably by denying review in Horton] has ruled [on] the constitutionality of this type of approach, choosing to uphold the [Oakland] ordinance . . . .\u201d (See <em>Horton </em>v. <em>City of Oakland, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th 580, review den. Oct. 18, 2000.) The dissent in <em>O\u2019Connell </em>may provide solace to the Los Angeles City Council members who relied on <em>Horton. </em>(See <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>City of Stockton, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at pp. 1076-1081 (dis. opn. of Corrigan, J.).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1201-9\"> Subsequent section references are to the Code of Civil Procedure. An award of fees under section 1021.5 is appropriate when (1) the party prevails in an action involving the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest; (2) the action confers a significant benefit on the general public or a broad class of people; and (3) the financial burden of private enforcement transcends the party\u2019s personal interest in the controversy. <em>(Press v.
