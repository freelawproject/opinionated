Internet bulletin boards, or \u201cmessage boards,\u201d have the advantage of allowing users, or \u201cposters,\u201d to express themselves anonymously, by using \u201cscreen names\u201d traceable only through the hosts of the sites or their Internet service providers (ISP\u2019s). One popular fornm is the financial message board, which offers posters the opportunity to communicate with others concerning stock trading, corporate behavior, and other finance-related issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-10\">The conversation on one financial message board devolved into scathing verbal attacks on the corporate officers of a Florida company, prompting a lawsuit by one of those officers, plaintiff Lisa Krinsky. Plaintiff attempted to discover the identity of 10 of the pseudonymous posters by serving a subpoena on the message board host, Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo!). Defendant \u201cDoe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>6\u201d moved to quash the subpoena, but the trial court denied the motion. Doe 6 appeals, contending that he had a First Amendment right to speak anonymously on the Internet. Under the circumstances presented, we agree with Doe 6 that his identity should be protected and therefore reverse the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">\n<em>Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">Until December 31, 2005, plaintiff was the president, chair of the board, and chief operating officer of SFBC International, Inc., a publicly traded \u201cglobal development drug service company\u201d with offices in Florida. In January 2006 plaintiff sued 10 \u201cDoe\u201d defendants in a Florida court. In the action plaintiff alleged that defendants had made \u201cdefamatory remarks\u201d about her on Yahoo! message boards and other Web sites, using screen names to conceal their identities. During the litigation defendant Doe 6 was often referred to as \u201cSenor_Pinche_Wey,\u201d the screen name he had used in posting on the Yahoo! Finance message board.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">Seeking damages and an injunction, plaintiff asserted two causes of action in the Florida complaint. All 10 defendants were accused of intentional interference with a \u201ccontractual and/or business employment relationship\u201d between plaintiff and SFBC. Nine of the defendants were accused together of libel based on false and misleading Internet statements imputing dishonesty, fraud, improper professional conduct, and criminal activity to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-8\">The record contains copies of the alleged defamatory messages posted on the Yahoo! message board devoted to SFBC. Most of the posts derided another SFBC executive, \u201cJerry \u2018Lew\u2019 Seifer.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Doe 6 called Seifer a \u201cmega scum bag\u201d and a \u201ccockroach\u201d and suggested that there were more \u201ccockroach\u201d executives at the company after Seifer resigned. In one message, posted on December 18, 2005, Doe 6 purported to find it \u201cfunny and rather sad that the losers who post here are supporting a management consisting of boobs, losers and crooks. (Krinsky, Natan and Seifer) while criticizing a charitable and successful hedge fund manager, who, unlike his critics and the longs here, has done his homework.\u201d In a December 30, 2005 post, Doe 6 offered his so-called \u201cJerry \u2018Lew\u2019 Seifer\u2019s New Year\u2019s resolutions.\u201d The list included the following statement: \u201cI will reciprocate felatoin <em>[sic] </em>with Lisa even though she has fat thighs, a fake medical degree, \u2018queefs\u2019 and has poor feminine hygiene.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>In order to serve the proper defendants, Krinsky served a subpoena on the custodian of records at Yahoo! in Sunnyvale, California. Yahoo! notified Doe 6 that it would comply with the subpoena in 15 days unless a motion to quash or other legal objection was filed. Doe 6 then moved in superior court to quash the subpoena on the grounds that (1) plaintiff had failed to state a claim sufficient to overcome his First Amendment rights for either defamation or interference with a contractual or business relationship, and (2) plaintiff\u2019s request for injunctive relief was an invalid prior restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">At the April 28, 2006 hearing on the motion, the superior court suggested that Doe 6 was \u201ctrying to drive down the price of [plaintiff\u2019s] company to manipulate the stock price, sell it short and so forth.\u201d The court queried whether it was \u201cprotected speech to do that? To deliberately engage in tactics designed to circumvent securities laws to drive the price down to a publicly traded company?\u201d The court also expressed the view that \u201c[accusing a woman of unchastity\u201d and \u201ccalling somebody a crook . . . saying that they have a fake medical degree, accusing someone of a criminal act, accusing someone\u2014impinging [ire] their integrity to practice in their chosen profession historically have been libel per se.\u201d Counsel for Doe 6 maintained, however, that the reference to \u201ccrook\u201d was to Seifer, not plaintiff,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that the use of this term was, <em>in context, </em>mere opinion and therefore protected by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">On July 6, 2006, the court requested additional briefing on two questions: whether <em>O\u2019Grady </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 1423 [44 Cal.Rptr.3d 72] applied to this case; and whether there was \u201cany consideration of whether the actions of the defendants [had violated] any State or Federal securities laws.\u201d After receiving supplemental briefs from each party on these questions, the court denied the motion to quash. The court recognized the applicability of the First Amendment to speech on the Internet and summarized the holdings of several appellate courts addressing claims of free speech in the context of libel suits. The court did not decide, however, whether Doe 6\u2019s messages were protected speech. Instead, it looked to the issues it had posed to the parties and specifically found that Doe 6\u2019s conduct appeared to be similar to federal cases involving \u201c \u2018pump and dump\u2019 stock manipulation\u201d efforts. The court expressly adopted plaintiff\u2019s supplemental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>brief, concluding that \u201c[t]he issues raised by this Court\u201d and \u201cthe totality of the circumstances of this case justif[y] the relief Plaintiff is seeking [szc].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-7\">The parties do not concur on the applicable standard of review. Doe 6 submits that we must evaluate his motion de novo, as the matter \u201cinvolves the important constitutional right to speak anonymously.\u201d Plaintiff maintains that the order should be reviewed only for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-8\">This appeal arises from a discovery order, which normally is reviewed under the deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>(John B. v. Superior Court </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 1177, 1186 [45 Cal.Rptr.3d 316, 137 P.3d 153]; <em>Greyhound Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 355, 380 [15 Cal.Rptr. 90, 364 P.2d 266].) Accordingly, a reviewing court generally will not substitute its opinion for that of the trial court and will not set aside the trial court\u2019s decision unless \u201cthere was \u2018no legal justification\u2019 for the order granting or denying the discovery in question.\u201d <em>(Lipton v. Superior Court </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1612 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 341].) On the other hand, \u201cwhile the trial court has wide discretion in managing discovery issues, \u2018there can be no room for the exercise of such discretion if no ground exists upon which it might operate.\u2019 [Citation.] Where, as here, the relevant facts are undisputed, we review a trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion as a question of law. [Citation.] An appellate court may reverse a trial court decision for abuse of discretion where the exercise of that discretion is not based upon the applicable law. \u2018Action that transgresses the confines of the applicable principles of law is outside the scope of discretion and we call such action an \u201cabuse\u201d of discretion.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Toshiba America Electronic Components v. Superior Court </em>(2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 762, 768 [21 Cal.Rptr.3d 532].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-9\">Moreover, Doe 6 invokes the protection of the First Amendment in seeking reversal. We cannot ignore our highest court\u2019s admonition that when the appellate issue is whether a particular communication falls outside the protection of the First Amendment, independent review is called for, \u201cboth to be sure that the speech in question actually falls within the unprotected category and to confine the perimeters of any unprotected category within acceptably narrow limits in an effort to ensure that protected expression will not be inhibited.\u201d <em>(Bose Corp. </em>v. <em>Consumers Union of U.S., Inc. </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 485, 505 [80 L.Ed.2d 502, 104 S.Ct. 1949].) Thus, when called upon to draw \u201c \u2018the line between speech unconditionally guaranteed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>speech [that] may legitimately be regulated,\u2019 \u201d \u201cwe \u2018examine for ourselves the statements in issue and the circumstances under which they were made to see . . . whether they are of a character which the principles of the First Amendment, as adopted by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, protect.\u2019 \u201d <em>(New York Times Co. v. Sullivan </em>(1964) 376 U.S. 254, 285 [11 L.Ed.2d 686, 84 S.Ct. 710], quoting <em>Pennekamp v. Florida </em>(1946) 328 U.S. 331, 335 [90 L.Ed. 1295, 66 S.Ct. 1029]; see also <em>In re George T. </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 620, 632 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 61, 93 P.3d 1007] [independent review of plausible First Amendment defense in determining whether communication constitutes a criminal threat].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In all other respects, the abuse of discretion standard is appropriate. And to the limited extent that the court below resolved evidentiary disputes, made credibility determinations, or made findings of fact that are not relevant to the First Amendment issue, we uphold those rulings if they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>(In re George T., supra, </em>33 Cal.4th at p. 634.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">2. <em>The First Amendment and Speech on the Internet</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">As noted earlier, ordinary people with access to the Internet can express their views to a wide audience through the forum of the online message board. The poster\u2019s message not only is transmitted instantly to other subscribers to the message board, but potentially is passed on to an expanding network of recipients, as readers may copy, forward, or print those messages to distribute to others. The use of a pseudonymous screen name offers a safe outlet for the user to experiment with novel ideas, express unorthodox political views, or criticize corporate or individual behavior without fear of intimidation or reprisal. In addition, by concealing speakers\u2019 identities, the online forum allows individuals of any economic, political, or social status to be heard without suppression or other intervention by the media or more powerful figures in the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-6\">Yet no one is truly anonymous on the Internet, even with the use of a pseudonym. Yahoo! warns users of its message boards that their identities can be traced, and that it will reveal their identifying information when legally compelled to do so.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the relative anonymity afforded by the Internet forum promotes a looser, more relaxed communication style. Users <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>are able to engage freely in informal debate and criticism, leading many to substitute gossip for accurate reporting and often to adopt a provocative, even combative tone. As one commentator has observed, online discussions may look more like a vehicle for emotional catharsis than a forum for the rapid exchange of information and ideas: \u201cHyperbole and exaggeration are common, and \u2018venting\u2019 is at least as common as careful and considered argumentation. The fact that many Internet speakers employ online pseudonyms tends to heighten this sense that \u2018anything goes,\u2019 and some commentators have likened cyberspace to a frontier society free from the conventions and constraints that limit discourse in the real world.\u201d (Lidsky, <em>Silencing John Doe: Defamation &amp; Discourse in Cyberspace </em>(2000) 49 Duke L.J. 855, 863, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">It is this informal ability to \u201csound off,\u201d often in harsh and unbridled invective, that opens the door to libel and other tortious conduct. In the corporate and financial arena, the targets of such \u201ccybersmear\u201d may suffer damage to their business reputations and a concomitant decline in company value as disinformation and rumors propagate rapidly over the Internet. In addition, as the level of rational and civil discourse deteriorates, it becomes increasingly difficult to find meaningful contribution in these online conversations. (Lidsky, <em>Silencing John Doe: Defamation &amp; Discourse in Cyberspace, supra, </em>49 Duke L.J. at p. 903.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">Judicial recognition of the constitutional right to publish anonymously is a long-standing tradition. Most of the early decisions affirming this right concern political speech or artistic endeavors. \u201cAnonymous pamphlets, leaflets, brochures and even books have played an important role in the progress of mankind. Persecuted groups and sects from time to time throughout history have been able to criticize oppressive practices and laws either anonymously or not at all.\u201d <em>(Talley v. California </em>(1960) 362 U.S. 60, 64 [4 L.Ed.2d 559, 80 S.Ct. 536] [ruling unconstitutional ordinance barring without limitation distribution of handbills that lacked identification of persons preparing or sponsoring them].) \u201cThe decision in favor of anonymity may be motivated by fear of economic or official retaliation, by concern about social ostracism, or merely by a desire to preserve as much of one\u2019s privacy as possible. Whatever the motivation may be, at least in the field of literary endeavor, the interest in having anonymous works enter the marketplace of ideas unquestionably outweighs any public interest in requiring disclosure as a condition of entry. Accordingly, an author\u2019s decision to remain anonymous, like other decisions concerning omissions or additions to the content of a publication, is an aspect of the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number><em>(McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm\u2019n </em>(1995) 514 U.S. 334, 341-342 [131 L.Ed.2d 426, 115 S.Ct. 1511], fn. omitted; accord, <em>Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Soc. of N. Y., Inc. </em>v. <em>Village of Stratton </em>(2002) 536 U.S. 150, 166 [153 L.Ed.2d 205, 122 S.Ct. 2080].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">When vigorous criticism descends into defamation, however, constitutional protection is no longer available. \u201c[I]t is well understood that the right of free speech is not absolute at all times and under all circumstances. There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which has never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem. These include the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or \u2018fighting\u2019 words\u2014those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace. It has been well observed that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.\u201d <em>(Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire </em>(1942) 315 U.S. 568, 571-572 [86 L.Ed. 1031, 62 S.Ct. 766], fns. omitted; see also <em>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition </em>(2002) 535 U.S. 234, 245-246 [152 L.Ed.2d 403, 122 S.Ct. 1389] [freedom of speech \u201chas its limits; it does not embrace certain categories of speech, including defamation, incitement, obscenity, and pornography produced with real children . . .\u201d]; <em>Beauharnais v. Illinois </em>(1952) 343 U.S. 250, 266 [96 L.Ed. 919, 72 S.Ct. 725] [\u201c[l]ibelous utterances\u201d are not constitutionally protected speech].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">Speech on the Internet is also accorded First Amendment protection. \u201cThrough the use of chat rooms, any person with a phone line can become a town crier with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any soapbox. Through the use of Web pages, mail exploders, and newsgroups, the same individual can become a pamphleteer. . . . [Q]ur cases provide no basis for qualifying the level of First Amendment scrutiny that should be applied to this medium.\u201d <em>(Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union </em>(1997) 521 U.S. 844, 870 [138 L.Ed.2d 874, 117 S.Ct. 2329].) As noted earlier, however, criticism on the Internet is often so recklessly communicated that the harm to its targets, particularly in the financial arena, may extend far beyond what is covered by rules applicable to oral rhetoric and pamphleteering.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">Corporate and individual targets of these online aspersions may seek redress by filing suit against their unknown detractors. Once notified of a lawsuit by the Web site host or ISP, a defendant may then assert his or her First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>Amendment right to speak anonymously through an application for a protective order or, as here, a motion to quash the subpoena. The present action for defamation and interference with business relationships is but one example of such confrontations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">3. <em>The Applicable Balancing Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">The parties agree that the viability of the subpoena should be determined by weighing Doe 6\u2019s First Amendment right to speak anonymously against plaintiff\u2019s interest in discovering his identity in order to pursue her claim. They disagree, however, as to how that weighing process should be approached. Plaintiff urges application of three California decisions: <em>Mitchell v. Superior Court </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 268 [208 Cal.Rptr. 152, 690 P.2d 625], where the Supreme Court articulated five factors to consider in deciding whether a journalist may be compelled to disclose the identity of and information from confidential sources;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>O\u2019Grady v. Superior Court, supra, </em>139 Cal.App.4th 1423, which protected e-mail correspondence and its senders from disclosure in response to a civil subpoena; and <em>Rancho Publications v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 68 Cal.App.4th 1538 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 274], where the court applied a qualified constitutional privilege protecting anonymous authors of advertisements criticizing the plaintiff hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">None of these cases is helpful to our analysis. <em>Mitchell, </em>for example, concerned a libel action in which the defendants, a newsmagazine and its reporters, resisted disclosing their confidential sources based on the \u201cfreedom of the press.\u201d <em>(Mitchell v. Superior Court, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 274.) The Supreme Court held that the defendants had a qualified privilege to protect the identity of confidential sources. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 276.) Here we are not confronted with issues involving freedom of the press, the confidentiality of news sources, or the public confidence in media publications. The interrelated factors that define the scope of that privilege are of limited relevance here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-8\"><em>Rancho Publications </em>is likewise not helpful. There the appellate court balanced the relevance of the material sought and the plaintiff\u2019s need for disclosure against the magnitude of the invasion of the critics\u2019 privacy. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>court stressed the \u201cparticularized nature\u201d of the qualified privilege it was applying. <em>(Rancho Publications v. Superior Court, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.4th at p. 1550.) In an analysis that took into consideration the <em>Mitchell </em>factors, the court found that the newspaper that had published the critical advertisements had not itself been sued for defamation. Indeed, the hospital had supplied only \u201crank conjecture\u201d that the \u201cadvertorials\u201d were authored by the same source as the object of the preexisting defamation lawsuit. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1551.) Furthermore, the hospital had not shown that the statements were false or beyond description as opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\">In <em>O\u2019Grady </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>139 Cal.App.4th 1423, Apple Computer, Inc. (Apple), sued a number of \u201cDoe\u201d defendants for misappropriation of trade secrets after they communicated information about a new Apple product that had not yet been released. O\u2019Grady and another individual were the publishers of \u201conline news magazine\u201d Web sites on which they posted articles about the new product. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1432.) The trial court permitted Apple to serve subpoenas on the host of one publisher\u2019s e-mail account and the other\u2019s Web site to produce documents relating to the identities of the defendants who had provided the information from which the articles were derived. The subpoenas further required the e-mail service hosts to produce all communications relating to Apple\u2019s new product. The trial court denied the publishers\u2019 motion for a protective order, but this court overturned the order by granting their petition for a writ of mandate. We held that the Stored Communications Act (SCA) prohibited disclosure of the information, with no exception for civil discovery. We further explained that the SCA \u201cdoes not authorize the disclosure of the identity of the <em>author </em>of a stored message; it authorizes the disclosure of \u2018a record or other information pertaining to a <em>subscriber to or customer of such service </em>(not including the contents of communications) . . . .\u2019 (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703(c)(1), italics added.)\u201d <em>(O\u2019Grady, supra, </em>139 Cal.App.4th at p. 1448.) <em>O\u2019Grady </em>was not a case in which the subscriber himself had posted anonymous messages that were known; Apple sought the contents of private messages stored on the hosts\u2019 facilities. Such disclosure would have violated the SCA. Finally, we found that the petitioners were protected by article I, section 2, subdivision (b), of the California Constitution, the reporter\u2019s shield law (precluding judgments of contempt), and by the privilege enjoyed by a free press to safeguard the identity of confidential sources. Applying the <em>Mitchell </em>factors, we held that the circumstances favoring disclosure were outweighed by countervailing factors, particularly Apple\u2019s failure to exhaust alternative sources of the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">This case is of the kind we distinguished in <em>O\u2019Grady. </em>Plaintiff seeks only the identity of her detractor, not the content of a communication; and the protected interests asserted in the motion are not those of a third party host or news medium but those of the anonymous speaker himself. To reach a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>workable standard by which to balance the parties\u2019 competing interests we must look beyond the reporters\u2019 shield law and the constitutional protections enjoyed by the news media. The proper focus instead should be on providing an injured party a means of redress without compromising the legitimate right of the Internet user to communicate freely with others.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-4\">4. Dendrite, Cahill, <em>and Other Tests</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">Federal and state courts have made valiant efforts to devise a fair standard by which to balance the interests of the parties involved in disputes over Internet speech. The most deferential to plaintiffs are those applying a \u201cgood faith\u201d standard. (See, e.g., <em>In re Subpoena to America Online, Inc. </em>(2000) 52 Va. Cir. 26, 37 [ISP required to disclose Doe identities upon corporate plaintiff\u2019s \u201clegitimate, good faith basis\u201d for alleging actionable conduct and the necessity of the information to advance the claim].) Plaintiff does not urge us to adopt such a low threshold for disclosure, nor would we do so; it offers no practical, reliable way to determine the plaintiff\u2019s good faith and leaves the speaker with little protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-6\">Other courts have exercised greater scrutiny of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action before allowing the speaker to be identified. In <em>Dendrite Intern. v. Doe No. 3 </em>(2001) 342 N.J. Super. 134 [775 A.2d 756], for example, a corporation alleged defamation by multiple Doe defendants on a Yahoo! message board and then sought expedited discovery in order to learn their identities. The New Jersey appellate court set forth a four-part test to ensure that plaintiffs do not use discovery to \u201charass, intimidate or silence critics in the public forum opportunities presented by the Internet.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>775 A.2d at p. 771.) First, the plaintiff must make an effort to notify the anonymous poster that he or she is the subject of a subpoena or application for a disclosure order, giving a reasonable time for the poster to file opposition. The plaintiff must also set forth the specific statements that are alleged to be actionable. Third, the plaintiff must produce sufficient evidence to state a prima facie cause of action. If this showing is made, then the final step should be undertaken: to balance the strength of that prima facie case against the defendant\u2019s First Amendment right to speak anonymously. <em>(Id., </em>775 A.2d at pp. 760-761.) In <em>Dendrite, </em>the appellate court affinned the trial court\u2019s denial of the discovery application, as the corporate plaintiff had failed to produce evidence that any decline in its stock price had been caused by the offensive messages.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1090-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>The same court on the same day followed <em>Dendrite </em>to a different result in <em>Immunomedics, Inc. v. Doe </em>(2001) 342 N.J. Super. 160 [775 A.2d 773, 777]. There the plaintiff company established a prima facie cause of action for breach of a confidentiality agreement by an employee suspected of revealing proprietary information on a Yahoo! finance message board. On this occasion the court did not analyze the harm asserted by Immunomedics. It also emphasized that the defendant would not be permitted to present evidence to disprove the plaintiff\u2019s claims, as that would afford the anonymous poster an unfair defense advantage. <em>(Id., </em>775 A.2d at p. 778.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">The third and fourth ingredients of <em>the Dendrite </em>analysis were later applied in <em>Highfields Capital Management, L.P. v. Doe </em>(N.D.Cal. 2005) 385 F.Supp.2d 969 <em>(Highfields Capital). </em>There the hedge fund management firm, which was the controlling shareholder of Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI), alleged that the Doe defendant had engaged in defamation, commercial disparagement, and violation of trademark and unfair competition laws through its three postings on a Yahoo! message board devoted to SGI. The district court ruled that the magistrate had properly required the plaintiff to present a \u201c \u2018real evidentiary basis\u2019 \u201d for believing the defendant had engaged in wrongful conduct causing harm to the plaintiff\u2019s interests. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 970.) The court adopted the test employed by the magistrate: (1) the plaintiff must adduce competent evidence to support a finding of each fact essential to the cause of action; and (2) <em>if the </em>first requirement is satisfied, the court must compare the magnitude of the harm to each party\u2019s interests that would result from a ruling in favor of either. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 976.) The magistrate found, and the district court agreed, that the plaintiff had not met the first component of the test, and it was therefore unnecessary to reach the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">While Doe 6 urges us to follow <em>Highfields Capital, </em>plaintiff objects to that court\u2019s requirement of a prima facie showing of each element at the pleading stage. She nevertheless maintains that she met that test. Neither party advocates a third line of analysis set forth in <em>Doe v. Cahill </em>(Del. 2005) 884 A.2d 451, a case involving political speech about a public figure. In <em>Cahill </em>the Doe defendant was sued for defamation after criticizing a town councilman on an Internet blog. The trial court applied a \u201cgood faith\u201d standard for disclosure and denied the defendant\u2019s request for a protective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>order, but the Delaware Supreme Court reversed. The good faith standard, the high court held, was \u201ctoo easily satisfied\u201d to protect the First Amendment right to speak anonymously. (884 A.2d at p. 458.) Even a motion-to-dismiss standard was, in the court\u2019s view, too weak, because Delaware, as a notice-pleading state, required only \u201cwell-pleaded allegations\u201d for a complaint to survive a motion to dismiss. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Consequently, any allegation that put the opposing party on notice of the claim was sufficient in that jurisdiction, even if it was \u201c \u2018vague or lacking in detail.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">The <em>Dendrite </em>test, on the other hand, required too much. The <em>Cahill </em>court instead adopted a standard applicable to a plaintiff opposing summary judgment. Thus, the plaintiff \u201cmust support his defamation claim with facts sufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>(Doe v. Cahill, supra, </em>884 A.2d at p. 460.) The second <em>Dendrite </em>requirement, that the plaintiff set forth the exact statements alleged to be defamatory, was unnecessary because those statements must be quoted in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint to avoid summary judgment. The fourth <em>Dendrite </em>step, the balancing of the defendant\u2019s First Amendment rights against the strength of the plaintiff\u2019s case, was also unnecessary because \u201c[t]he summary judgment test is itself the balance. The fourth requirement adds no protection above and beyond that of the summary judgment test and needlessly complicates the analysis.\u201d (884 A.2d at p. 461.) The court did, however, endorse the first element of the <em>Dendrite </em>test, that the plaintiff make reasonable efforts to notify the anonymous poster about the subpoena or request for a disclosure order and give the defendant a reasonable opportunity to respond. The <em>Cahill </em>court even required the plaintiff to publish that notice on the same message board where the allegedly defamatory statement appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\"><em>Cahill </em>was followed by trial courts in various jurisdictions. (See, e.g., <em>Best Western Intern., Inc. </em>v. <em>Doe </em>(D. Ariz., July 25, 2006, No. CV-06-1537-PHX-DGC) 2006 WL 2091695 [agreeing with <em>Cahill </em>that a summary judgment standard should be satisfied]; <em>Reunion Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Doe 1 </em>(Pa.Com.Pl. 2007) 80 Pa. D. &amp; C.4th 449 [finding summary judgment standard \u201cappropriate\u201d]; but see <em>Klehr Harrison Harvey Branzburg &amp; Ellers, LLP v. JPA Development, Inc., supra, </em>2006 WL 37020 [agreeing with Vogel that existing procedural rules are sufficient without any new standards].) In <em>Lassa </em>v. <em>Rongstad </em>(2006) 2006 WI 105 [294 Wis.2d 187, 718 N.W.2d 673], however, the Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected the Delaware court\u2019s summary judgment standard in favor of a motion-to-dismiss standard. The \u201c \u2018silly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>or trivial libel claims\u2019 \u201d that would survive a motion to dismiss in a notice-pleading state such as Delaware would be adequately tested on a motion to dismiss in Wisconsin, where the statement constituting libel must be set forth in the complaint. <em>(Id., </em>718 N.W.2d at p. 687.) The majority opinion did not, however, explain how (or if) a motion to dismiss would incorporate a balancing of the parties\u2019 competing interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">Other courts have utilized a motion-to-dismiss standard in weighing the need of injured parties to discover the identity of libelous Doe defendants against the rights of those defendants to speak anonymously. In <em>Rocker Mgmt. LLC </em>v. <em>John Does I Through 20 </em>(N.D.Cal., May 29, 2003, No. MISC 03-003 3 CRB, 2003 U.S.Dist. Lexis 16277 [2003 WL 22149380]), on facts similar to those before us, the federal district court granted a motion to quash a subpoena on Yahoo!. The plaintiff could not satisfy the court that its complaint could withstand a motion to dismiss, as it could not show that any of the anonymous poster\u2019s statements constituted libel. In its ruling the district court relied on <em>Columbia Ins. Co. v. Seescandy.com </em>(N.D.Cal. 1999) 185 F.R.D. 573, 578-579, which articulated a four-part test, including a motion-to-dismiss evidentiary standard, for disclosure in an action for trademark infringement on the Internet.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">We find it unnecessary and potentially confusing to attach a procedural label, whether summary judgment or motion to dismiss, to the showing required of a plaintiff seeking the identity of an anonymous speaker on the Internet. California subpoenas in Internet libel cases may relate to actions filed in other jurisdictions, which may have different standards governing pleading and motions; consequently, it could generate more confusion to define an obligation by referring to a particular motion procedure.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The specific <em>Dendrite </em>criteria to defeat a protective order or motion to quash may likewise be dependent on the different pleading and motion procedures across the states. For example, if a complaint is filed in a notice-pleading state in which defamation claims are not excepted by statute or case law, the second <em>Dendrite </em>requirement (setting forth the statement with particularity) will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>essential, while in Wisconsin it will be superfluous, as the statement will already be set forth in the initial pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-4\">We agree with the Delaware Supreme Court that the first requirement, an attempt to notify the defendant, does not appear to be unduly burdensome. <em>(Doe v. Cahill, supra, </em>884 A.2d at p. 461.) We recognize, however, that an Internet Web site, chat room, or message board may no longer exist or be active by the time the plaintiff brings suit; consequently, it would be unrealistic and unprofitable to insist, as did the <em>Cahill </em>court, that a plaintiff \u201cpost a message notifying the anonymous defendant of the plaintiff\u2019s discovery request on the same message board where the allegedly defamatory statement was originally posted.\u201d <em>{Ibid..)</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Moreover, when ISP\u2019s and message board sponsors (such as Yahoo!) themselves notify the defendant that disclosure of his or her identity is sought, notification by the plaintiff should not be necessary. And in the procedural posture presented here, where the defendant is moving to quash the subpoena, the notification requirement benefits no one. Obviously Doe 6 has already learned of the subpoena or he would not be seeking protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">Common to most courts considering the issue is the necessity that the plaintiff make a prima facie showing that a case for defamation exists.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Requiring at least that much ensures that the plaintiff is not merely seeking to harass or embarrass the speaker or stifle legitimate criticism.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Even the decisions imposing a motion-to-dismiss obligation nonetheless require \u201c \u2018some showing\u2019 \u201d that the tort took place. (See, e.g., <em>Rocker Mgmt. LLC </em>v. <em>John Does I Through 20, supra, </em>2003 U.S.Dist. Lexis 16277 at p. *3, quoting <em>Columbia Ins. Co. v. Seescandy.com, supra, </em>185 F.R.D. at p. 580 [likening the showing to probable cause in criminal investigations].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">Plaintiff objects to the requirement of a prima facie showing. She contends that it infringes a party\u2019s due process right because it does not include a reasonable opportunity to obtain evidence a plaintiff would need to establish a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>prima facie case. She does not, however, explain why she would necessarily be deprived of such an opportunity in the context of a motion to quash. Nor does she complain that she actually was deprived of that opportunity; indeed, she maintains that she satisfied her burden to make a prima facie showing of libel. A plaintiff need produce evidence of only those material facts that are accessible to her. (See fn. 12, <em>ante.) </em>In an Internet libel case, that burden should not be insurmountable; here, for example, plaintiff knows the statement that was made and produced evidence of its falsity and the effect it had on her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">We therefore agree with those courts that have compelled the plaintiff to make a prima facie showing of the elements of libel in order to overcome a defendant\u2019s motion to quash a subpoena seeking his or her identity. Where it is clear to the court that discovery of the defendant\u2019s identity is necessary to pursue the plaintiff\u2019s claim, the court may refuse to quash a third party subpoena if the plaintiff succeeds in setting forth evidence that a libelous statement has been made.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> When there is a factual and legal basis for believing libel may have occurred, the writer\u2019s message will not be protected by the First Amendment. (Cf. <em>Beauhamais v. Illinois, supra, </em>343 U.S. at p. 266 [\u201c[l]ibelous utterances\u201d are not constitutionally protected speech]; see also <em>Gerawan Farming, Inc. v. Lyons </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 468, 485 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 470, 12 P.3d 720] [First Amendment right to freedom of speech is not absolute]; <em>Aguilar v. Avis Rent A Car System, Inc. </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 121, 134 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 132, 980 P.2d 846] [same].) Accordingly, a further balancing of interests should not be necessary to overcome the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to speak anonymously.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">In its order, the trial court in this case approached the question of plaintiff\u2019s prima facie showing of defamation, but it did not reach any clear conclusion on the matter.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Instead, after reviewing the law of defamation in the federal and Florida courts, the trial court presented the parties\u2019 arguments and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>queried whether the \u201ccrooks\u201d reference constituted libel. The court then suggested, \u201cOn the one hand, SenorJPincheJWey\u2019s other comments, calling Seifer a scum bag and cockroach, may reinforce the understanding that Senor_Pinche_Wey\u2019 s references to Plaintiff were hyperbole and insults rather than assertions of literal fact.\u201d The next sentence, however, which began, \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d pertained to an entirely different question: whether this case was similar enough to federal \u201cpump and dump\u201d stock manipulation cases to \u201cjustif[y] the relief Plaintiff is seeking.\u201d The trial court incorporated plaintiff\u2019s supplemental brief in its ruling, thereby basing its ruling not on any showing related to the libel claim, but on plaintiff\u2019s argument regarding stock manipulation. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint included only two causes of action: intentional interference with a \u201ccontractual and/or business/employment relationship with SFBC\u201d and defamation. In her supplemental brief she acknowledged that she had \u201cnot yet asserted claims relating to violations of State and/or Federal securities laws.\u201d We will refrain from ruling on the adequacy of a cause of action that was never pleaded.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">5. <em>Prima Facie Showing of Libel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">In examining the law of defamation, the court correctly determined that plaintiff\u2019s prima facie burden must be defined and satisfied according to Florida law. (Cf. <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc. </em>(1974) 418 U.S. 323, 347 [41 L.Ed.2d 789, 94 S.Ct. 2997] [within constitutional limits, states may define for themselves law of liability for defamation].)  In Florida, as in California, defamation consists of an \u201cunprivileged publication of false statements which naturally and proximately result in injury to another.\u201d <em>('Wolfson v. Kirk </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1973) 273 So.2d 774, 776.) \u201cIn other words, such a communication is \u2018defamatory\u2019 if it tends to harm the reputation of another as to lower him or her in estimation of community or deter third persons from associating or dealing with the defamed party.\u201d <em>(LRX, Inc. </em>v. <em>Horizon Assoc. Joint Venture </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 2003) 842 So.2d 881, 885.) A private plaintiff in a libel case must prove that the defendant published a false statement about the plaintiff to a third party and that the false statement caused injury to the plaintiff. <em>(Valencia v. Citibank Intern. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1999) 728 So.2d 330; <em>Razner </em>v. <em>Wellington Medical Center, Inc. </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 2002) 837 So.2d 437, 442.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">Plaintiff contends that she demonstrated that Doe 6\u2019s posts were libelous per se. A publication is libelous per se in Florida \u201cif, when considered alone without innuendo: (1) it charges that a person has committed an infamous crime; (2) it charges a person with having an infectious disease; (3) it tends to subject one to hatred, distrust, ridicule, contempt, or disgrace; or (4) it tends to injure one in his trade or profession. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Richard v. Gray </em>(Fla. 1953) 62 So.2d 597, 598.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Plaintiff maintains that Doe 6 implied that she was dishonest by calling her a \u201ccrook\u201d and asserted that she had a \u201cfake medical degree,\u201d thereby accusing plaintiff of being dishonest or at least of engaging in conduct incompatible with her employment. He also subjected her to ridicule and disgrace and damaged her reputation by stating that she had \u201cpoor feminine hygiene.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">In determining whether a publication is libelous per se, the language used \u201cwill be given neither a mild nor [a] harsh construction\u201d <em>(Adams v. News-Journal Corporation </em>(Fla. 1955) 84 So.2d 549, 551), but instead will be construed in the sense the speaker appears to have intended to convey it, and \u201cas the common mind would naturally understand it.\u201d <em>(Richard v. Gray, supra, </em>62 So.2d at p. 598.) In other words, the statement should be considered in its natural sense without a forced or strained construction. <em>(Byrd v. Hustler Magazine, Inc. </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1983) 433 So.2d 593, 595.) The determination necessarily depends on the facts of the individual case, and the context of the communication must be examined. <em>(Adams v. News-Journal Corporation, supra, </em>84 So.2d at p. 551; see also <em>Greenbelt Pub. Assn. </em>v. <em>Bresler </em>(1970) 398 U.S. 6, 13 [26 L.Ed.2d 6, 90 S.Ct. 1537] [\u201cblackmail,\u201d under the circumstances, was not slander when spoken or libel when reported]; <em>Seropian v. Forman </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1995) 652 So.2d 490, 496 [\u201cinfluence peddling,\u201d in context, was only rhetorical hyperbole].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">When a defamation action arises from debate or criticism that has become heated and caustic, as often occurs when speakers use Internet chat rooms or message boards, a key issue before the court is whether the statements constitute fact or opinion. In some cases, the communication may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>amount to \u201cmixed opinion.\u201d \u201cPure opinion occurs when the defendant makes a comment or opinion based on facts which are set forth in the [publication] or which are otherwise known or available to the reader or listener as a member of the public. Mixed expression of opinion occurs when an opinion or comment is made which is based upon facts regarding the plaintiff or his conduct that have not been stated in the article or assumed to exist by the parties to the communication.\u201d <em>(From </em>v. <em>Tallahassee Democrat, Inc. </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1981) 400 So.2d 52, 57; <em>Stembridge v. Mintz </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1995) 652 So.2d 444, 446.) \u201c \u2018Rather, the communicator implies that a concealed or undisclosed set of defamatory facts would confirm his opinion.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Della-Donna v. Yardley </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1987) 512 So.2d 294, 296; <em>Town of Sewall\u2019s Point v. Rhodes </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 2003) 852 So.2d 949, 951; see also <em>Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co. </em>(1990) 497 U.S. 1, 18 [111 L.Ed.2d 1, 110 S.Ct. 2695] [rejecting artificial dichotomy between opinion and fact and cautioning that expressions of opinion may often imply an assertion of objective fact].) Only the latter category of expression may subject the communicator to liability. <em>(Barnes v. Horan </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 2002) 841 So.2d 472, 476.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">\u201cIn determining whether the statement is one of pure or mixed opinion, the court must examine the statement in its totality and the context in which it was uttered or published. The court must consider all of the words used, not merely a particular phrase or sentence. In addition, the court must give weight to cautionary terms used by the person publishing the statement and consider all of the circumstances surrounding the statement, including the medium by which the statement is disseminated and the audience to which it is published.\u201d <em>(Hoch v. Rissman, Weisberg, Barrett </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1999) 742 So.2d 451, 460; see <em>Stembridge v. Mintz, supra, </em>652 So.2d at p. 447; <em>Rasmussen </em>v. <em>Collier County Pub. Co. </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 2006) 946 So.2d 567, 571.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-6\">In this case, Doe 6\u2019s messages, viewed <em>in context, </em>cannot be interpreted as asserting or implying objective facts. During November and December 2005 many messages were posted on the Yahoo! finance \u201cSFCC\u201d message board<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> regarding the management and value of SFBC. Heated discussion focused on plaintiff\u2019s credentials and \u201ccredibility.\u201d Other messages questioned the reputed personal relationship between her and Seifer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-7\">Those posts of Doe 6 that are alleged as libelous convey scorn and contempt. On December 15, 2005, Doe 6 called Seifer a \u201cmega scum bag.\u201d The next day, reacting to Seifer\u2019s departure from SFBC, Doe 6 said, \u201cShorts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>sing \u2018La Cucaracha, La Cucaracha\u2019 [ft] Where there is one cockroach, many more are there . . . Firing Seifer won\u2019t stop the meltdown.\u201d The sarcastic, derisive tone of these two derogatory posts is obvious, but neither one referred to plaintiff by name or by title. Likewise, a December 20 post titled \u201cSeifer..........OUT!\u201d said only, \u201cThat is one cockroach gone....how many left? [ft] Ole!\u201d Even if we assume that readers understood \u201cmany more are there\u201d and \u201chow many [are] left\u201d to target plaintiff, calling her a cockroach obviously cannot be interpreted as a statement of actual fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-6\">On December 18, 2005, in a post titled \u201cState of denial,\u201d Doe 6 criticized in crude, ungrammatical language the \u201cidiot longs\u201d who had supported the management of SFBC: \u201c[F]unny and rather sad that the losers who post here are supporting a management consisting of boobs, losers and crooks. (Krinsky, Natan and Seifer) while criticizing a charitable and successful hedge fund manager, who, unlike his critics and the longs here, has done his homework, [ft] How many of the idiot longs here did their work and said to themselves, T know Natan had been CFO of at least 3 bankrupt companies and I know Seifer filed for personal bankruptcy and roughed up some patients, shares a rolls royce and a bendy [szc] with the President and a $15mm <em>[sic] </em>mansion, but what the hey, the numbers look good and it has been a long time.\u2019 [ft] No, Loeb earned his $$$ and those of you who are whimpering on eachother\u2019s [sic] shoulders crying to be saved by Spizer, the SEC etc are a bunch of pathetic losers .... But we already knew that, you were long SFCC. [ft] Ole!\u201d A reasonable reader of this diatribe would not comprehend the harsh language and belligerent tone as anything more than an irrational, vituperative expression of contempt for the three officers of SFBC and their supporters. It appears to label each of the executives in the order named (with \u201cboobs\u201d referring to plaintiff); but even if each epithet refers to all three, this juvenile name-calling cannot reasonably be read as stating actual facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-7\">Finally, on December 30, 2005, Doe 6 posted the last of the messages plaintiff charged as defamatory. This one clearly was satirical in nature; it listed fictional \u201cJerry \u2018Lew\u2019 Seifer\u2019s New Year\u2019s resolutions\u201d which alluded to troubles Seifer had recently encountered as an officer at SFBC.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Of these so-called resolutions, the only statement pertaining to plaintiff was, \u201cI will reciprocate felatoin [szc] with Lisa even though she has fat thighs, a fake <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>medical degree, \u2018queefs\u2019 and has poor feminine hygiene.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The language is unquestionably vulgar and insulting, but nothing in this post suggested that the author was imparting knowledge of actual facts to the reader. The reference to a \u201cfake medical degree\u201d was only the latest entry in a protracted online debate about whether plaintiff\u2019s medical degree from Spartan Health Sciences University in the West Indies justified her use of the \u201cM.D.\u201d title in company documents. No reasonable reader would have taken this post seriously; it obviously was intended as a means of ridiculing Seifer and plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">The federal district court in <em>Highfields Capital, supra, </em>385 F.Supp.2d 969 confronted a similar scenario in granting a motion to quash. Examining the numerous posts on a Yahoo! message board, the magistrate had noted that \u201c[m]any of the messages are crude, indecent, or transparently laughable\u2014and many appear to have nothing whatsoever to do with SGI. Many of the postings include misspellings, grammatical errors, and/or incomplete thoughts and sentences. . . . Messages on this board reflect considerable venting, much tongue-in-cheek, little pretense at sophistication or thoughtfulness, and an ample and obvious sense of irreverence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 973, fn. omitted.) Thus, the magistrate found, \u201c[vjiewed in context (the only relevant way to view communications), defendant\u2019s postings consist of sardonic commentary on a public corporation; through irony and parody, these bulletin board postings express dissatisfaction with the performance of the stock and the way company executives choose to spend company resources.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 975.) The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff firm had \u201cfailed to demonstrate that a reasonable person perusing the message board at issue would understand the statements as having been made by plaintiff itself, which is plaintiff\u2019s theory in support of its defamation and commercial disparagement claims.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 971; see also <em>Rocker Mgmt. LLC v. John Does I Through 20, supra, </em>2003 U.S.Dist. Lexis 16277 at pp. *5-*6 [vulgar, hyperbolic chat room messages replete with grammar and spelling errors convey statements of opinion].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-6\">We likewise conclude that the language of Doe 6\u2019s posts, together with the surrounding circumstances\u2014including the recent public attention to SFBC\u2019s practices and the entire \u201cSFCC\u201d message board discussion over a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>two-month period\u2014compels the conclusion that the statements of which plaintiff complains are not actionable. Rather, they fall into the category of crude, satirical hyperbole which, while reflecting the immaturity of the speaker, constitute protected opinion under the First Amendment. It hardly need be said that this conclusion should not be interpreted to condone Doe 6\u2019s rude and childish posts; indeed, his intemperate, insulting, and often disgusting remarks understandably offended plaintiff and possibly many other readers. Nevertheless, \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe fact that society may find speech offensive is not a sufficient reason for suppressing it. Indeed, if it is the speaker\u2019s opinion that gives offense, that consequence is a reason for according it constitutional protection.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd. </em>(1991) 502 U.S. 105, 118 [116 L.Ed.2d 476, 112 S.Ct. 501].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">6. <em>Interference with Contractual/Business Relationships</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">The next question is whether the cause of action for intentional interference with a contractual or business relationship remains viable, thereby precluding an order quashing the subpoena. Establishing intentional interference with a business relationship in Florida requires proof of \u201c(1) the existence of a business relationship, not necessarily evidenced by an enforceable contract; (2) knowledge of the relationship on the part of the defendant; (3) an intentional and unjustified interference with the relationship by the defendant; and (4) damage to the plaintiff as a result of the breach of the relationship.\u201d <em>(Tamiami Trail Tours, Inc. v. Cotton </em>(Fla. 1985) 463 So.2d 1126, 1127; accord, <em>Telemundo Network Group v. Azteca Intern. </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 2007) 957 So.2d 705, 710.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">Doe 6 contends that the applicability of the First Amendment to his speech on the message board forecloses plaintiff\u2019s claim. We agree. Our Supreme Court, addressing both logical and pragmatic concerns, held that the limitations of the First Amendment \u201cmust be broadly applicable whenever the gravamen of the claim is injurious falsehood.\u201d <em>(Blatty v. New York Times Co. </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 1033, 1045 [232 Cal.Rptr. 542, 728 P.2d 1177].) Applying that conclusion to the plaintiff\u2019s claims of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, unfair competition, and related torts, the Supreme Court found that the plaintiff could not satisfy First Amendment requirements, and the trial court therefore had properly sustained the media defendant\u2019s demurrer. (See also <em>Isuzu Motors Ltd. v. Consumers Union of U.S., Inc. </em>(C.D.Cal. 1998) 12 F.Supp.2d 1035, 1045 [following Blatty]; <em>Paradise Hills Associates </em>v. <em>Procel </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1528, 1543-1544 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 514] <em>[Blatty </em>not limited to freedom of the press]; cf. <em>Hustler Magazine </em>v. <em>Falwell </em>(1988) 485 U.S. 46, 57 [99 L.Ed.2d 41, 108 S.Ct. 876] [intentional infliction of emotional distress fails when offending conduct protected by First Amendment].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>Here the complaint states background facts relating the specific \u201cdefamatory remarks\u201d made by each defendant. Count 1 incorporates those allegations and adds the following: (1) plaintiff had a \u201ccontractual and/or business employment relationship\u201d with SFBC; (2) defendants knew of the \u201ccontractual/business relationships\u201d between plaintiff and SFBC; (3) defendants intentionally and unjustifiably interfered with those relationships; (4) plaintiff had suffered damages proximately caused by defendants\u2019 interference. As to Doe 6, it is clear from the pleading that the business tort alleged in the interference cause of action is based entirely on the \u201cdefamatory remarks\u201d that were protected speech under the First Amendment. Casting the defamation claim in terms of interference with a business relationship does not save plaintiff\u2019s cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s reliance on several Florida decisions is misplaced. None addressed the question of whether an allegation of a business tort may withstand a demurrer or motion to quash when the underlying conduct is protected by the First Amendment. (See, e.g., <em>Linafelt v. Beverly Enterprises-Fl., Inc. </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1999) 745 So.2d 386, 389-390 [finding sufficient evidence of interference with advantageous business relationship notwithstanding failure of defamation claim due to truth of statement]; <em>Salit v.

(See <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, supra, </em>376 U.S. at pp. 279-280.) As we do not decide whether plaintiff was a public figure, the question of whether she was obligated to produce evidence of malice is academic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1092-6\"> For example, a motion to dismiss in federal court is functionally equivalent to a demurrer filed in California. (See <em>Laguna Village, Inc. v. Laborers\u2019 Intemat. Union of North America </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 174, 182 [197 Cal.Rptr. 99, 672 P.2d 882].) A demurrer in this state is sustained when the facts asserted in the complaint fail to state a cause of action; the order is not based on the production of evidence, as it is assumed that the facts asserted in the complaint are true.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-7\">Indeed, the burden described by past courts can be compared to the showing required for a preliminary injunction. In such a case, the plaintiff must convince the court of the likelihood of prevailing on the merits, and the court must weigh the relative interim harm to the parties from the issuance or nonissuance of the injunction. <em>(Butt v. State of California </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 668, 677-678 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 480, 842 P.2d 1240].)
