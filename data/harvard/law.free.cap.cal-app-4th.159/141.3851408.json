Williams was convicted by a jury of committing various assaults on a 71-year-old man. Over defendant\u2019s objection, the prosecution presented evidence that defendant had committed two previous attacks on older men. On appeal he challenges the constitutionality of Evidence Code section 1109, subdivision (a)(2),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which authorizes the admission of evidence of prior bad acts in this context. We reject that challenge and shall affirm defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">At trial there was substantial evidence of the following facts. The 71-year-old victim testified that on April 28, 2006, he was living in a hotel room in San Francisco. He awoke at approximately 8:30 p.m. and found defendant in his room, \u201cabsolutely nude.\u201d The victim had not invited defendant in and did not know he was there until he awoke. Defendant approached the victim and said he wanted to have sex with him. The victim said, \u201cI backed away toward my bed and he draped himself over me.\u201d At some point, defendant \u201cstarted licking [the victim\u2019s] shoulder.\u201d Defendant put his hand over the victim\u2019s mouth and the victim bit it. The victim threw a \u201cpiece from a brass bed\u201d at defendant, but believed that it missed. The victim testified that during the encounter defendant \u201cseemed to be wiping his genital with olive oil,\u201d and left a bottle of olive oil in the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">The next morning the victim was leaving his room when defendant \u201crushed his way in.\u201d He pushed the victim to the floor. Defendant was not wearing any clothing. Defendant again covered the victim\u2019s mouth so he could not yell. The victim reported both assaults to the hotel manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">The manager of the hotel testified that defendant also lived at the hotel at the time of the attack. On April 28 around 9:00 p.m., the victim came to the manager\u2019s door and \u201che was kind of pounding on my door. . . . And he said there was somebody in his room and trying to do something. [][].. .[][].. . [H]e was just trying to get rid of him because he was on top of him. He was just wrestling with him. [f] . . . [][] [The victim] was pretty well shaken up. He was really shaken up. He was kind of in hysterics.\u201d When the manager followed the victim to his room, he saw the back of a man walking down the hall away from the victim\u2019s room and saw that there was blood on the victim\u2019s sheets. The manager suggested calling the police but the victim \u201csaid he was really kind of too scared to do anything about it.\u201d The next morning, the victim came to the manager\u2019s door and said that the same person \u201cwas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>trying to get in again.\u201d The manager left his room and again saw the back of a man running away. The manager ran down the stairs and \u201cturned on the light . . . and I observed [defendant] down there.\u201d Defendant was wearing only a towel.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">W.M., who was 91 years of age at the time of the trial, testified that he had known defendant for 35 to 40 years. In December 2003, defendant was at W.M.\u2019s house and took some methamphetamine. They argued about defendant\u2019s use of the drugs and then W.M. went to bed while defendant was still at the house. Defendant \u201ccame into my bedroom and pinned my arms. I was asleep and he pinned my arms on his legs and beat the hell out of me.\u201d W.M. was bruised on his face and body. He reported the incident to the police and obtained a restraining order against defendant. Nevertheless, defendant returned to W.M.\u2019s house and attempted to enter. On March 13, 2004, defendant returned to W.M.\u2019s house and \u201cbeat me up in my chair in my living room.\u201d W.M. admitted that he cared about defendant and \u201cjust wish[ed] the best for him,\u201d but believed that his problems stemmed from the use of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">W.W., who was 76 years of age at the time of trial, testified that he met defendant five or six years earlier in a friendly encounter. A \u201ccouple years later\u201d defendant approached him on the street and indicated that he wanted to have sex with W.W. He accompanied W.W. to his home. They decided not to have sex and parted amicably. On July 11, 2004, defendant again came to W.W.\u2019s house. They were planning to have dinner and W.W. was making a salad. Defendant \u201cdisappeared. And then when I was about ready with dinner, I called him and he had apparently gone into my bedroom which I couldn\u2019t see from where I was. And he came out naked and wanted me to take my clothes off. [][]... [f] He kept insisting, demanding that I take my clothes off.\u201d W.W. refused and told defendant that \u201cwe had decided a long time ago there was nothing for us together and it was not going to work out. We were not compatible and I had too much to do, you know, to go through that again. And he insisted. And I said, \u2018Look, if you don\u2019t leave, I will have to call the police.\u2019 He said, \u2018No, you don\u2019t.\u2019 \u201d Defendant returned to the bedroom and W.W. \u201cthought he decided to get his clothes on and be reasonable.\u201d However, a few minutes later defendant came back and was still naked. Defendant was holding something which W.W. could not clearly see, but which he believed to be a knife. Defendant told W.W., \u201c \u2018You take your clothes off or I will jab with this and it is HIV contaminated.\u2019 [][]... [][] He was very emphatic about it.\u201d W.W. was scared and \u201cpretended that I was going to go along with it. And I went by him then towards the bedroom. But, instead of going into the bedroom I went out the door and next door and called the police.\u201d W.W. obtained a restraining order against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Defendant was charged by information with two counts of burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459); a crime against an elderly person (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.9, subd. (a)); two counts of inflicting injury likely to cause great bodily injury on an elder adult (Pen. Code, \u00a7 368, subd. (b)(1)); two counts of assault with intent to commit oral copulation and sodomy (Pen. Code, \u00a7 220); and two counts of false imprisonment (Pen. Code, \u00a7 236). Defendant pled not guilty to all charges. During trial, the district attorney amended the information to add \u201cby force, fear or threats\u201d to the burglary and assault with intent counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The jury found defendant not guilty of the charged offenses, but guilty of the lesser offenses of misdemeanor trespass against an elder person (Pen. Code, \u00a7 602.5, subd. (b)), misdemeanor elder abuse (Pen. Code, \u00a7 368, subd. (c)), misdemeanor assault (Pen. Code, \u00a7 240), and misdemeanor false imprisonment (Pen. Code, \u00a7 236).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Defendant was sentenced to one year in county jail on one count of false imprisonment and a consecutive one year on one count of misdemeanor trespass against an elder person. The court imposed but stayed a sentence of one year on the other count of misdemeanor trespass, six months for misdemeanor elder abuse, and six months for the other count of false imprisonment. Defendant was given custody credit for 186 days. Defendant timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">On appeal, defendant argues only that the admission of the evidence concerning the earlier attacks on W.M. and W.W. was in error. Although the admission of such evidence of prior acts of elder abuse is expressly sanctioned by section 1109, subdivision (a)(2), defendant argues that the admission of this evidence violated his right to due process because it permitted the jury to find guilt based on propensity rather than on evidence of the crimes with which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">\u201cAs a general rule, evidence that is otherwise admissible may be introduced to prove a person\u2019s character or character trait. (\u00a7 1100.) But, except for purposes of impeachment (see \u00a7 1101, subd. (c)), such evidence is inadmissible when offered by the opposing party to prove the defendant\u2019s conduct on a specified occasion (\u00a7 1101, subd. (a)), unless it involves commission of a crime, civil wrong or other act and is relevant to prove some fact (e.g., motive, intent, plan, identity) other than a disposition to commit such an act (\u00a7 1101, subd. (b)).\u201d <em>(People v. Falsetta </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 903, 911 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 847, 986 P.2d 182], italics omitted <em>(Falsetta).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">Section 1101, subdivision (a) provides that \u201cevidence of a person\u2019s character or a trait of his or her character (whether in the form of an opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>evidence of reputation, or evidence of specific instances of his or her conduct) is inadmissible when offered to prove his or her conduct on a specified occasion.\u201d With exceptions not relevant here, section 1109, subdivision (a)(2) provides a qualification to that general rule: \u201c[I]n a criminal action in which the defendant is accused of an offense involving abuse of an elder or dependent person, evidence of the defendant\u2019s commission of other abuse of an elder or dependent person is not made inadmissible by Section 1101 if the evidence is not inadmissible pursuant to Section 352.\u201d This section was added in 2000. (Stats. 2000, ch. 97, \u00a7 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">To establish that section 1109, subdivision (a)(2) violates due process, \u201cdefendant must carry a heavy burden. The courts will presume a statute is constitutional unless its unconstitutionality clearly, positively, and unmistakably appears; all presumptions and intendments favor its validity. [Citations.] In the due process context, defendant must show that section [1109] offends some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental. [Citations.]  The admission of relevant evidence will not offend due process unless the evidence is so prejudicial as to render the defendant\u2019s trial fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>(Falsetta, </em>supra, 21 Cal.4th at pp. 912-913.)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">In <em>Falsetta, </em>the Supreme Court addressed a due process challenge to section 1108, which analogously provides for the admission of evidence of prior sexual offenses where the defendant is charged with a sexual offense. In that case, the court agreed that exclusion of propensity evidence had long been the rule, but \u201ca long-standing practice does not necessarily reflect a <em>fundamental, </em>unalterable principle embodied in the Constitution.\u201d <em>(Falsetta, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 914.) The court considered \u201cit unclear whether the rule against \u2018propensity\u2019 evidence <em>in sex offense cases </em>should be deemed a fundamental historical principle of justice.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>The court determined that \u201cin light of the substantial protections afforded to defendants in all cases to which section 1108 applies, we see no undue unfairness in its limited exception to the historical rule against propensity evidence.\u201d <em>(Falsetta, supra, </em>at p. 915.) The court reasoned that because the evidence admitted under section 1108 is limited to a defendant\u2019s other <em>sex </em>crimes it does not impose an undue burden on the defendant to defend against \u201cfar-ranging attacks on the defendant\u2019s character.\u201d <em>(Falsetta, supra, </em>at p. 916.) It also noted that the trial court retains discretion under section 352 to limit the evidence of uncharged crimes, observing that undue prejudice would be precluded by the appropriate exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion to exclude unduly prejudicial evidence. \u201c[T]he trial court\u2019s discretion to exclude propensity evidence under section 352 saves section 1108 from defendant\u2019s due process challenge.\u201d <em>(Falsetta, supra, </em>at p. 917.) Thus, the court \u201cconclude[d], consistent with prior state and federal case law, that section 1108 is constitutionally valid.\u201d <em>(Falsetta, supra, </em>at p. 907.)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Although evidence of prior crimes against elderly persons has not been addressed by the appellate courts, section 1109, subdivision (a)(1), which permits the admission of evidence of prior acts of domestic violence, was recently upheld. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Cabrera </em>(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 695 [61 Cal.Rptr.3d 373], the court rejected the argument that admission of evidence of two prior incidents of domestic violence against two other victims violated due process. The court applied the reasoning of <em>Falsetta </em>that \u201c \u2018the trial court\u2019s discretion to exclude propensity evidence under . . . section 352 saves section [1109] from defendant\u2019s due process challenge.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Cabrera, supra, </em>at p. 703.)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Defendant argues that section 1109, subdivision (a)(2) is overly broad because it defines \u201cabuse of an elder\u201d in an \u201call-encompassing\u201d manner, as \u201c \u2018physical or sexual abuse, neglect, financial abuse, abandonment, isolation, abduction, or other treatment that results in physical harm, pain, or mental suffering, the deprivation of care by a caregiver, or other deprivation by a custodian or provider of goods or services that are necessary to avoid physical harm or mental suffering.\u2019 (\u00a7 1109, subd. (d)(1).)\u201d However, the procedural safeguards present in section 1108 are likewise present in section 1109. The evidence of uncharged acts admissible under subdivision (a)(2) are limited to those taken against elderly persons, and the trial court has the same discretion under section 352 to exclude evidence that is unduly prejudicial or time consuming, or likely to confuse or mislead the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The acts testified to by W.M. and W.W. were both physical assaults with a sexual tone committed on elderly men. They were very similar to the crimes charged in this case and tended to show a propensity to commit such acts. (See, e.g., <em>Falsetta, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 915 [\u201cAlthough defendant disputes the point, the case law clearly shows that evidence that he committed other sex offenses is at least circumstantially <em>relevant </em>to the issue of his disposition or propensity to commit these offenses. . . . \u2018Such evidence \u201cis [deemed] objectionable, not because it has no appreciable probative value, <em>but because it has too much.\u201d </em>\u2019 \u201d]; <em>People v. Karis </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 612, 636 [250 Cal.Rptr. 659, 758 P.2d 1189] [evidence of uncharged crimes is relevant \u201cto show that the defendant had a propensity to commit a crime, a propensity that is circumstantial evidence that he committed the charged offense\u201d].) They were no more inflammatory than the very acts with which defendant was charged. The court did not abuse its discretion in finding that this evidence was not unduly prejudicial. Its admission did not violate defendant\u2019s right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">As there was no error in the admission of the prior acts, we do not reach defendant\u2019s further argument that the asserted error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">McGuiness, P.
