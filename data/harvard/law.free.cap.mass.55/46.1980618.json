plaintiff and one Francis Tukey was defendant, in favor of the said Tubbs, for the sum of three hundred and four dollars and fifty-eight cents damages, and also unlawfully and maliciously intending to

data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-7\"><em>First, </em>because the publication set forth in the indictment does not contain any libellous or indictable matter;</summary>\n<summary

data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-9\"><em>Third, </em>because the indictment does not profess to set forth the very words or tenor of the alleged libel, but only the purport, effect, and substance thereof,- and,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-10\"><em>Fourth, </em>because the indictment is, in other respects, uncertain, informal, and insufficient in law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-11\">The presiding judge of the municipal court overruled this motion, and the defendant thereupon brought his case to this court by exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-12\">The case was argued, on the part of the defendant, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number><em>R. Hildreth, </em>as <em>to the </em>first and second grounds of the motion in arrest, and by <em>II. E. Smith, </em>as to the third.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-4\"><em>Hildreth. </em>The party alleged to be libelled was at the time serving as a juror, and the publication referred to him as such and not in his private character. The defendant was the publisher of a newspaper. There is nothing, therefore, in the case, which should induce the court to disregard technical objections. The prosecutor was <em>quasi </em>a public man; the defendant was in the performance of a duty to the public ; and, in this country, it is not held to be an aggravation of a libellous publication, that the subject of it is a public character. Newspapers are no longer considered as <em>nuisances; </em>but as a necessary article of life ; the daily bread of the public. Editors are often obliged to act upon slight evidence; to get up their publications with great haste ; and they are surrounded by exciting causes. In the performance of their duty to the public, they are therefore entitled to some indulgence ; and the law ought not to be so strict with reference to their publications, as in regard to those which have no public purpose in view. Prosecutions for libel against editors ought not to be encouraged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-5\">1. The publication complained of is not a libel. What is a libel ? It is something published, which tends to blacken or defame a man\u2019s character, and to make him an object of hatred or contempt; and, in order to do this, the publication must contain a serious and substantial charge, and not merely one of a light and frivolous description. There is nothing in this publication, which can by any possibility be deemed libellous, unless it be that part of it, which charges the prosecutor with entering into an agreement with one of his fellows, to decide upon their verdict by a game of chance. But, by the agreement, as stated, the two jurors only undertook to settle <em>the amount of damages, </em>and not <em>the verdict, </em>by means of a game of chance. If it had been the latter, the statement might have been libellous. The jury had agreed upon a verdict for the plaintiff, and the only point then before them was as to the amount of damages. They had to decide. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>whether they should agree upon the amount, or disagree and be discharged from giving a verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-5\">2. The publication was not what'it is set forth to be in the indictment. The latter alleges, that the defendant charged the prosecutor with acting corruptly. But the charge itself does not import any thing of a corrupt nature. The conduct of the prosecutor, as stated in the publication, might be improper or even unlawful, but it was not in any sense corrupt. If, then, the indictment allege a charge of corruption, and the publication, as stated, import no such charge, this is a repugnant and defective statement, and a sufficient ground for arresting the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-6\"><em>Smith. </em>The <em>third </em>ground of exception is, that the indictment does not profess to set forth the very words or tenor of the alleged libel, but only its purport, effect, and substance. The indictment professes to set out only a part of the libel, namely, the substance of it. The terms employed, \u2014 <em>\u201c </em>according to the purport and effect, and in substance, among other things, as follows, that is to say,\u201d \u2014indicate only that the substance of the libel is set out. The terms \u201c purport and effect \u201d do not add to, or mean any thing more than, the word \u201c substance,\u201d which is used in connection with them. <em>Purport </em>and <em>effect </em>import <em>substance. </em>1 Chitty C. L. 234; Archbold C. P. 44; Wharton Am. Grim. Law, 83, 84. We contend, 1st, that the indictment should set out the libel in the very words of which it is alleged to be composed ; 2, that it should profess to do so ; and, 3, that it should set out the whole of those words.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-7\">1. The language of a libel must be set out in the indictment in the very words of the publication. Archbold C. P. 42; Wharton Am. C. L. 83; <em>Zenobio </em>v. <em>Axtell, </em>6 T. R. 63 (as to the mode of setting out a libel published in a foreign language); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>Wright, (Ohio,) 73; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gustins, </em>2 Southard, 744; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sweeney, </em>10 S. &amp; R. 173; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Clements, </em>3 Barn. &amp; Ald. 503; <em>King v. Beer, </em>12 Mod. 219; <em>State </em>v. Parker, Il. Chipman, 298; Starkie on Slander, 323.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>2. The very words must not only be set out, but the indictment must profess to set them out. 1 Starkie on Slander, <em>323; </em>1 Chitty C. L. 234; Wharton Am. Grim. L. S3 ; 3 B. &amp; A. 506. For this purpose, certain forms of expression, indicating.that the words are so set out, must be used, as, for example, \u201cof the tenor following,\u201d \u2014 \u201cas follows,\u201d \u2014 \u201c containing,\u201d \u2014 \u201c in the words and figures following,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-5\">3. These rules ought to be applied with more strictness, where the indictment does not profess to set out the whole of the publication, but only that part of it, which the prosecuting officer considers as libellous. He is doubtless at liberty to select and set out in the indictment those portions which he charges as libellous, without inserting the residue of the publication. But, if, in addition to this, he were allowed to set out only a part, that is to say, the substance, of those portions, the defendant would be under great difficulty in knowing what he was charged with.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-6\">It is exceedingly clear, from the English authorities, and from cases decided in other states, that the indictment must profess to set out the alleged libellous matter, and must set it out in the very words. It was argued in the municipal court, that the words, \u201c according to the purport and effect, and, in substance, among other things,\u201d might be rejected as surplus-age, and then the indictment would profess to set out, and would in fact set out the very words. But this would be to make a new indictment. In <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Clements, </em>3 Barn. &amp; Ald. 503, Abbott, C. J., says, the words \u201c in substance \u201d give a different meaning.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-7\">It seemed to be admitted, on the argument in the court below, that the indictment was bad, according to the English authorities. But it was said, that a practice had become established, in this commonwealth, which was sanctioned by the forms in Davis\u2019s Precedents, 125, 154, to state a libel according to the substance and effect. Mr. Davis refers to East P. C. 975, as his authority; but the rule there laid down, which was with reference to indictments for forgery, is directly the other way. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Houghton </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>8 Mass. 107, Mr. Davis referred to his own practice as authority, but the court disregarded it; and in <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>6 Met. 243, the authority of one of his precedents was directly set aside.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-5\">The case of the <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parmenter, </em>5 Pick. 279, was a'so relied on as sanctioning the doctrine, contended for on the other side. In this case, the court say, that as the statement of the note alleged to be forged is according to the purport and effect, there is no material variance between <em>promised </em>and <em>promise. </em>But the point now presented was not raised, and that case therefore cannot be considered as decisive of the present.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-6\">Another point, which was taken in the court below, was, that marks of quotation performed the office of a recital, \u2014 upon what authority was not stated; but unless inverted commas perform a higher function than that of a recital, the argument is of no avail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-7\">It was argued, also, that the practice in this commonwealth, which had prevailed for a long time, to describe written instruments, according to their purport and effect and in substance, ought not now to be questioned. This argument is answered by the remarks of Chipman, C. J., in the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>1 D. Chipman, 298, which was an indictment for uttering and giving in payment a counterfeit bank note; the instrument was not set out in words and figures ; this being objected to, the form was admitted to be bad, according to the common law ; but it was attempted to be sustained on the ground, \u201c that indictments for forgery had been so drawn in Vermont, for more than thirty years, and that not one had been quashed, or held bad on demurrer for this exception; \u201d but the court, notwithstanding the long usage, which was admitted to have prevailed, though not universally, sustained the exception, and adjudged the indictment to be bad.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-8\">In order to sustain this indictment, the court must decide me of two things, namely: either that it is not necessary, in an indictment for a libel, to set out the words, but only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>the substance ; or that the terms <em>purport </em>and <em>effect </em>import that the very words are set out. If the latter, the court ought also, at the same (ime, to decide that the word <em>tend' </em>in a recital imports that the <em>substance </em>only is given ; otherwise, all distinctions will be confounded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-5\">In conclusion, we contend that it is clear, both upon reason and authority, that in an indictment for a libel the very words of the alleged libel must be set out, \u2014 that the indictment must profess to set them out, \u2014 and that certain technical words, which have acquired a settled meaning, must be used to signify whether the very words are set out, or whether their substance only is contained in the indictment. The contrary practice has not prevailed long enough, or been so extensive, as to have become the common law of this commonwealth.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b62-6\">S. <em>D. </em>Parker, (county attorney,) for the commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-7\">It is not true, as was urged by one of the counsel for the defendant, that prosecutions for libel ought to be discouraged. The reputation of the citizens is as much entitled to the protection of the law as their persons. The punishing of libels by law is no doubt the frequent cause of preventing bloodshed, which would be likely, here as well as elsewhere, to ensue, if the party injured by the publication of a libel had no means of redress by resorting to the law. It was lately argued by counsel in one of the inland counties,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> that, in this commonwealth, libels were not legally punishable; and so argued the defendant, in the present case, who had no counsel, on his trial in the municipal court. The decision in the case alluded to has not yet been pronounced, but there can be no reasonable ground for doubting what it will be. Libels are undoubtedly punishable by law in this commonwealth, and so are likely to remain; at least, until the law is changed by the legislature. Editors are not licensed slanderers; they as well as others are amenable to criminal prosecution, if Avhat they publish is injurious to the reputation of the citizens; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>and it is to be hoped, that they will become more sensible of the duties incumbent upon them, in this respect, than the counsel of the defendant seems to be. Instead of being less on their guard than others, as suggested by the counsel, editors should be much more so; inasmuch as newspapers have a wider circulation than libellous productions in any other form. Haste is no justification; and, if it were, there is no pretence for it in the present case; the article complained of was the last of a series, and was the result of deliberation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-5\">In the argument for the defendant, the authority of the late solicitor-general Davis, a most eminent lawyer, and an extremely able and successful prosecuting oificer, was called in question. His Precedents, however, are exceedingly valuable ; they give the law as it existed when they were compiled ; and, if the law has since changed, it is not his fault. The revision of the statutes introduced many changes in the criminal law, and some corresponding alterations became necessary in the forms of indictments. But two cases, however, have been referred to, in which Mr. Davis\u2019s forms have been found to be defective and overruled; one of which is the case of <em>Moore </em>v. Commonwealth, 6 Met. 243, which \u2022was an indictment for adultery; and the other that of the <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Houghton, </em>8 Mass. 107, which was an indictment against the defendant for having counterfeit bills in his possession, with intent to pass the same as genuine. The indictment, in the present case, was copied from No. 220. If the objection taken is valid this precedent must also be overruled. The ground, upon which the form of pleading objected to was adopted by Mr. Davis, is stated by him, in a note to his first precedent for forgery, (p. 125, n. 1,) in which the forged instrument is described as \u201c of the purport and effect following; \u201d and, in a note appended to this passage, he says: \u201c This is the most proper allegation, as to the mode of descrming the forged instrument. It is neither necessary nor advisable to allege it in the \u2018 tenor following.\u2019 See 2 East P. 0. 975, ^ 53, 54.\u201d The passage referred to in East is as follows: \u201c It is essentially necessary, to an indictment for forgery, that the instrument alleged to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>forged should be set forth in words and figures ; though there be no technical form of words, for expressing that it is so set forth.\u201d In a note to the same words in another indictment, also for forgery, Mr. Davis remarks : \u201c This mode of alleging the purport of the instrument is equally valid, and more advisable than to allege it in the \u2018 tenor,\u2019 in which case, the slightest mistake is fatal.\u201d He probably thought that the minute verbal accuracy required in the proof, where the word \u201ctenor\u201d was used, was not equally necessary where the statement was introduced by the words \u201c purport and effect,\u201d or other equivalent words; although it was necessary, that the alleged forged instrument should be set forth in words and figures; and, that, on the authority of the doctrine stated by East, the risk attending the use of the word \u201c tenor\u201d might be avoided; because, although the instrument must indeed be set out in words and figures, yet no technical words were necessary to convey the idea that it was so set forth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-5\">The <em>first </em>objection, urged by the defendant\u2019s counsel, is matter of substance ; the <em>second </em>relates to a supposed variance ; the <em>third </em>is a question of mere form.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-6\">1. It is first said, that the publication is not libellous. But it is clear, from the language, that it imports a charge of corruption in the prosecutor, in deciding the case before him, as a juror, upon or by reason of an unworthy motive; and such a charge is clearly libellous, according to the most approved definitions of the offence of libel. That given by Mr. Hamilton, in his argument in the case of <em>The People </em>v. <em>Croswell, </em>3 Johns. C. 354, is the briefest and most comprehensive : \u201c A libel is a censorious or ridiculing writing, picture, or sign, made with a mischievous and malicious intent towards government, magistrates, or individuals.\u201d In <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Binney, </em>2 Pick. 113, Lincoln, J., in stating the opinion of the court, refers with strong approbation to the definition of libel given by Parsons, C. J., in the case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Clapp, 4 Mass. 168: \u201c It is a malicious publication expressed either in printing or writing, or by signs, or pictures, tending either to blacken the memory of one dead, or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>reputation of one who is alive, and expose him to public hatred, contempt, or ridicule.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-4\"><em>2. </em>The second objection is, that there is a variance between the publication, and the averments in the indictment; that the publication itself is innocent, though the averments make it criminal. Q-uestions of variance are mixed questions of law and fact, to be decided by the jury under the instruction of the court. The motion now is, not to set aside the verdict, but to arrest the judgment. The jury have found the facts as set out by means of the innuendoes; and no question of variance can arise, but upon a motion for a new trial, on the ground of a misdirection. No question is made but upon the record alone. The answer to this second objection is, that the publication is as libellous, as the averments in the indict-, ment make it; but, if it were otherwise, the jury in the court below have already passed upon it, under the instruction of the court, and there is no motion to set aside the verdict, on the ground of misdirection. The publication must now be taken to be what the indictment says it is.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-5\">3. The third objection is one of mere form. The exception declares that the indictment is bad, because it does more than it professes to do; and the judgment is asked to be arrested, because the indictment does not profess to do what it in fact does.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Is the indictment defective in point of form ? The motion is, that the judgment be arrested, because the indictment only professes to set out the substance of the libel. The indictment does, in fact, set out the libel in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>words of the publication. But this is not the exception. The defect complained of is, that the indictment does not profess to set out the words. It does, however, profess to set out the very words. That this is the case, is apparent, <em>first, </em>from the marks of quotation; <em>second, </em>from the innuendoes ; and, <em>third, </em>from the use of the word \u201c purport.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-5\">I. The marks of quotation show, that the publication is set out in the very words. All writings conform to certain rules; and the words, figures, and marks, of which they are composed, are read by the eye. Punctuation is a part of language, if any thing which does not consist of words can be so, because it affects, and, indeed, sometimes fixes, the meaning of a sentence. Thus, for example, in this phrase, .\u2014 <em>the Lord is gracious never willing the destruction of men, </em>\u2022\u2014 the sense is one way, if the comma is placed before, and quite different, if placed after, the word <em>never. </em>All the marks of punctuation thus are or may be signs of ideas, and consequently are a part of the written language. Whatever indicates meaning conveys ideas to the mind. Marks of quotation, which are among the signs used in punctuation, and therefore indicative of ideas, denote that the words thus distinguished are quoted, that is, that the language <em>professes, </em>which is all that is wanted in this case, to be taken from some other source. They profess to mark language, which is transferred, <em>ipsissimis verbis, </em>from something else. <em>Purport </em>is that which is apparent to every eye. When it is said, that such is the purport of a thing, we understand that so it appears to every eye to be. In like manner, inverted commas indicate to every eye that what they contain is quoted. In the case of <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Clements, </em>3 Barn. &amp; Ald. 503, decided in 1820, and in that of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sweeny, </em>10 Serg. &amp; R. 173, decided in 1823, which are the principal authorities relied on by the defendant, the word <em>substance </em>only is used. But, in the present, the word <em>purport </em>also is employed ; and there is a distinction between substance and purport. The latter addresses itself partly to the sight; the former to the mind only. Purport denotes what is apparent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>every eye. Marks of quotation are apparent to every eye, and indicate that the words so distinguished are taken from some other source. When, therefore, the statement of the libel is introduced by the word purport, and accompanied with marks of quotation, if it be true, as laid down by East, that no technical form of words is necessary to show that the instrument is set out in words and figures, \u2014 how can it be said, that this indictment does not profess to set out the very words of the libel ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-5\">II. The innuendoes, quoting the words of the publication, and then explaining them, show that the very words are given; and that the language and not the substance is intended to be given. This is the very purpose of an innuendo ; the language being inserted, as it exists, and then explained by the innuendo in its legal sense.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-6\">III. The word <em>purport </em>shows, that the indictment under \u2022 takes to set out the very words. But it is said, that <em>tenor </em>is the necessary word ; and if that were only in the indictment, it would be sufficient. The earliest case, which is referred to as authority for this nicety in the use of language, is that of <em>The King </em>v. <em>Beare, </em>1 Ld. Raym. 414; reported also in Carthew, 407; Holt, 422; and 3 Salkeld, 226. In that case, it was held, that tenor imports an exact copy, on the authority, in part, of the Register of Writs, 169 (a); in which, 169 (b), the word <em>tenor </em>is used as synonymous with <em>transcriptum. </em>The position, taken on the part of the commonwealth, is, hat tenor and purport mean the same thing. There are three sources, from which the meaning of words and phrases, in legal terminology, may be ascertained, \u2014 lexicographers, text writers, and judicial decisions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-7\">Among lexicographers, it will be sufficient to refer to two only. The word <em>tenor </em>is both Latin and English. In the former language., it is thus defined by Facciolati:\u2014\u201caccent, \u2014 tone; \u2014 among jurisconsults, <em>tenor legis </em>is the meaning or purport of a law.\u201d Webster defines it as \u2014 \u201c sense contained ; purport; substance; general course or drift.\u201d From the lexicographers, therefore, it appears, that tenor and purport are equivalent terms.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Among the text writers, Chitty defines purport to be \u201c the substance of an instrument, as it appears to every eye.\u201d 1 Chitty C. L. 214. If this be true, purport means the same as tenor. Archbold says, that purport is that which appears on the face. Archbold C. P. 20. The same definition is given in 2 East P. C. 980. Can tenor mean any thing more ? From the text writers, therefore, as well as the lexicographers, it is clear, that purport is as effectual as' tenor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-5\">Judicial decisions may also be resorted to for the use and meaning of words. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parmenter, </em>5 Pick. 279, which was an indictment for forgery of a promissory note, described as of \u201cthe purport and effect following,\u201d the court held, that, as the note was set out according to its purport and effect, and not according to its tenor, the variance between <em>promised </em>and <em>promise </em>was not material. If the word tenor was not material in this case, it cannot be so in the case at bar. In <em>Nye </em>v. <em>Otis, </em>8 Mass. 122, which was an action of slander, setting out the substance was held sufficient. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>2 Pick. 47, which was an indictment for .uttering a counterfeit bank note, the instrument was described as of the \u201c following purport and effect; \u201d in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>2 Mass. 397, the defendant was indicted for forging and uttering a promissory note, \u201c purporting \u201d to be the note of one J. E. ; and in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boynton, </em>2 Mass. 77, the indictment was for uttering, &amp;c., as true, &amp;c., \u201c in substance and of the purport and effect following; \u201d and, in none of these cases, was any objection made that the word tenor was not used, or that the statement of the instrument was insufficient. In <em>Downing </em>v. <em>State of Missouri, </em>4 Miss. 573, it was held, that, when an indictment undertakes to describe an instrument according to its purport, it must describe it in the words of which it is composed, that is, as it exists, and not merely according to its legal effect. In that case, which was an indictment for circulating a note contrary to law, the note was described as payable to the <em>holder; </em>the note offered in evidence was payable to <em>bearer; </em>the court considered this as a fatal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>variance, although it was admitted that the legal effect of the note, as it was set out, and as it was proved, was the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-5\">Upon these grounds, it seems clear-, that the word purport is sufficient, and that the word tenor is not necessary. Some duties must be supposed to have been discharged by the court, before which the trial took place; and if there had been a variance, it would have been seen and pointed out, and would have been fatal. Something also may properly be presumed after a verdict. In <em>2 </em>Dane\u2019s Abridgment, <em>587, </em>it is said, that \u201c there are two ways of describing a libel, one by the words, and the other by the sense.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-6\"><em>Hildreth, </em>in reply. The attorney for the commonwealth has not taken any notice of the distinction between deciding <em>a verdict, </em>and deciding the <em>amount of damages </em>merely, by a game of chance or skill. What was said by the defendant does not charge corruption; it imports an indecorum, perhaps, but nothing immoral.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-7\">The second ground of exception is treated by the attorney as a variance ; but it is not of that character; it is an incongruity apparent on the record. As to the third ground of exception, the only case cited for the commonwealth, in opposition to the numerotis English and American cases, relied upon by the defendant, is that of <em>Downing </em>v. <em>State of Missouri, </em>4 Miss. 575; upon the authority of which, .the court will hardly be inclined to set aside the former. Marks of quotation do not always indicate the very words. There are many passages in Bancroft\u2019s History, for example, in which, although distinguished by marks of quotation, many of the words of the authors referred to are omitted. The only case cited from the reports of this court, which is at all applicable, is that of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parmenter, </em>5 Pick. 279. But in that case, the point now in issue was not made. Besides, there is a distinction between forgery and libel. In the latter, the offence consists in the very words; which, consequently, the defendant is entitled to have set out to him.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b62-8\"> Allusion is here made to the case of the <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chapman </em>(13 Met.), in Franklin, decided at Northampton, September term, 1848.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b65-6\"> Before proceeding to consider this objection, Mr. Parker observed, that he had drawn all the indictments, amounting to several thousands in number, which had been returned by the grand juries for the county of Suffolk, since he had been appointed to office, with the single exception of the indictment in this case. The complaint, in this instance, was made to the grand jury, just at the close of their business for the term, and the indictment was prepared by the prosecutor\u2019s counsel, an eminent member of the bar in this county Being drawn according to the precedent in Davis\u2019s Precedents, No. 220, p. 161, which had been before followed by him in very many important cases, without being objected to, he had adopted the indictment, and presented it to thf grand jury as his own.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Forbes, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Al\">The first objection is, that the indictment on which the defendant is convicted, does not contain any libellous, or indictable matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">We think that this objection cannot be sustained. The matter contained in this publication is, clearly, libellous. The tendency of the publication was to degrade the prosecutor in the esteem and opinion of the world <em>; </em>it impeached his integrity as a juror, and must, if the charge which it contains were true, make him an object of distrust and contempt among men. It was open to the defendant, in justification, to prove the truth of the charge, and that it was published with good motives, and for justifiable ends. But assuming, as we must do, at this stage of the case, that the publication was false and malicious, the record discloses, not merely an indictable offence, but an offence which the peace and well-being of society require to be repressed by exem plary punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">It was, however, contended in the argument for the de Cendant, that as the transaction set forth in the publication took place after the jury had agreed to return a verdict for the plaintiff, and as it related merely to the manner of assessing the damages, the publication ought not to be held to be libellous. The counsel for the defendant seemed to concede that to charge a juror with having returned a verdict in the manner stated in the publication would be libellous, but he insisted upon a distinction between a charge which related to the finding of a verdict, and a charge which related to the manner of assessing the damages. We do not perceive that any such distinction can exist. There was but one issue, it is true, and perhaps the amount of damages is not technically a part of the issue, but an agreement to return a verdict for the plaintiff was not a discharge of their whole duty by the jury. Their duty was twofold; they were first to find the issue, and then to assess the damages. The oath of a juror is designed to protect all those interests upon which it is competent for a jury to decide The obligation of the oath is not divisible ; it cannot be restricted to a particular subject of inquiry, in the manner supposed by this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Another objection to the indictment is, that it does not profess to set forth the very words or tenor of the alleged libel, but only the purport, effect, and substance thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">It is a general rule of pleading, in civil as well as in criminal cases, that when a charge is brought against a defendant arising out of the publication of a written instrument, the instrument itself must be set out in the writ or indictment. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Clements, </em>3 Barn. &amp; Ald. 508. The court are of opinion that this rule is applicable to the present case, and that it is essential to the validity of the indictment, that it should set forth the words of the libel. The correctness and applicability of the rule were not denied on the part of the government, but it was insisted that in drawing this indictment, the rule had been substantially complied with. Upon this part of the case, two questions were discussed at the bar; first, whether it is necessary that the indictment should profess to set out the very words of the publication; secondly, whether the word <em>purport </em>and the marks of quotation used in the indictment do import that the very words of the publication are set forth therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The objection was said to be merely technical, and the court were invited to disregard it, especially as it was admitted that the words of the publication are recited correctly in this indictment. But whatever the character of the rule may be, if well established, it is clearly the duty of the court to enforce it, and the defendant may as effectually avail himself of this, as of a more meritorious defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The strictness required in criminal pleading has be\u00e9n occasionally the subject of criticism and complaint; with this the court have nothing to do : they are bound to administer the law as they find it. If this strictness has a tendency to impede or to thwart the course of justice in criminal proceedings, it is the province of the legislature, and not of the court, to amend the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Upon a comparison of the authorities cited at the argument, the court are satisfied, that (with one or two exceptions having no relation to the present case) the indictment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>must not only contain, but it must also profess to set out, a transcript of that part of the libel upon which the pleader relies. The authorities' upon this point are somewhat numerous : the English and some of the American cases are referred to 1 Chitty C. L. 238, and note.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">The counsel for the government contended, that for a series of years the practice in this commonwealth had been different, and that this practice is warranted by the authority of the late solicitor-general Davis (Precedents of Indictments, 125, n. 1,) and the case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Parmenter, 5 Pick. 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The note in Davis\u2019s Precedents does not appear to be supported by the authority to which he refers; and the case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parmenter </em>was evidently decided without much consideration; the correctness of the practice, it is true, seems to have been taken for granted, but the precise question here raised does not appear to have been suggested to the court, and the verdict in that case could not have been sustained for other reasons, which were assigned and relied upon by the court, in setting the verdict aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Under these circumstances, we think that that case ought not to control the uniform current of the English decisions, supported by respectable American authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">It was further contended, that it did sufficiently appear on the face of this indictment, that the words of the libel were set forth, inasmuch as they were included between marks of quotation. We have not thought it material to ascertain whether or not this is so in the original indictment; in the copy which has been furnished to the court, the marks of quotation include both the wrords of the innuendoes and the words of the publication. In manuscripts as well as in printed books, it is undoubtedly a * common practice to indicate the language borrowed from another,- by the use of inverted commas; but we are far from being certain, that these marks are generally understood to import a perfect accuracy of quotation. A writer, anxious to escape the charge of plagiarism, would be likely to use these marks, although he appropriated nothing more than the sentiment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>and substantially the language of his author, without aiming at verbal accuracy. Besides, if these marks should be held sufficient to sustain an indictment, they must also be held sufficient to defeat it, whenever a slight mistake is made in the use of them ; and the accidental omission to include a single word of the libel in inverted commas, or the including within them of a word which was not in the libel, would be a fatal variance. It sometimes happens that the change of a single comma will give an entirely different meaning to a sentence: suppose a pleader to have occasion to set out a sentence of this description, would the misplacing or the omission of a comma, thereby leaving the meaning equivocal, be fatal to the indictment ? Had we the power to do it, we should doubt the expediency of introducing a new rule in pleading, the probable effect of which would be, \u2022 to throw additional embarrassments in the way of the pleader, and to increase the chance of escape, by means of merely clerical mistakes or technical errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The practice in arraignments is to read the indictment to the prisoner, and then to receive his plea. His knowledge of the charge against him is derived, ordinarily, from hearing the indictment read, and not from the inspection of it. But these indications of the meaning of the pleader are addressed to the eye : they are not perceptible by the ear; and if the rule of construction contended for be correct, this well established practice is clearly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">It was also contended that the word <em>\u201c </em>purport,\u201d used in the indictment, is equivalent to tenor, and imports a strict recital of the words of the libel. But in our view this is not. necessarily, the import of the term. The purport of a message or communication may be, and indeed generally is, stated, without the use of the identical words in which it is conceived. It is equivalent to substance, and such was its construction, by the court, in the case of the <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parmenter, </em>before cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">\u201c The word <em>tenor </em>imports an exact copy, \u2014 that it is set forth in the words and figures, \u2014 whereas the word <em>purport </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>means only the substance or general import of the instrument.\u201d 2 Gabbett Cr. Law, 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The court are of opinion that this indictment is defective, and that judgment must be arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Note. Mr. Davis's Precedents being a book of practice in very general use, it seems desirable to point out those forms in it, which are affected by the decision in this case. The following contain the objectionable words: Nos. 99, and 100, under the head of <em>Challenging to Fight, </em>(which are adopted with modifications from 3 Chitty C. L. 848, 852); Nos. 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 170, 171, 172, 173, under the head of <em>Forgery and Counterfeiting, </em>all of which were drawn by Mr. Davis, and No. 169, under the same head, which was taken bom the Crown C. C. (6th Ed.) 360; Nos. 209, (3 Chitty C. L. 889,) 212, (3 Chitty, 887,) 214, (3 Chitty, 911,) 215, (3 Chitty, 914,) 217, (Crown Cir. Ass. 73,) 218, (3 Chitty, 889,) 219, (Archbold, C. P. 501; 2 Chitty 14,) 220, under the head of <em>Libel. </em>In several of the many forms, which appear to have been adopted by the author from English precedents, the usual and apt words, such as \u201c tenor,\u201d &amp;c., are struck out, and the words \u201cpurport,\u201d \u201ceffect,\u201d \u201csubstance,\u201d inserted. This is the case in Nos. 169, 209, 212, 214, 215, 217, 218, 219, 220, which have been examined. It is remarkable, however, that the forms of indictment, for challenging, Nos. 104 and 107, and for libel, Nos. 210 and 211, in which the alteration seems equally proper, retain the apt and technical words of recital.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
