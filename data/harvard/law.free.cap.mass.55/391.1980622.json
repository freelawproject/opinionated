One of the witnesses, who testified on the direct examination to acts of familiarity committed at or about the time set forth in the indictment, testified, on the cross examination, to circumstances tending to show that there was some uncertainty as to the time, and that these acts might have occurred a year before the alleged act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-9\">\u201c Abby Dow, called as a witness by the defendant, admitted the truth of every charge proved against the defendant, and swore that she never had any criminal connection with him.

Nor in the courts of this commonwealth, previous to the statutes of 1840, c. 84, and 1841. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>c. 20. <em>Comm'th </em>v. <em>Norcross, </em>9 Mass. 492; <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>11 Mass. 92; <em>Comm'th </em>v. <em>Littlejohn, 15 </em>Mass. 163; <em>Ham's </em>Case, 2 Fairf. 391; <em>Wedgwood's Case, </em>8 Greenl. <em>75.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-5\">By the statutes above mentioned, it is enacted, that, in all cases, in which it shall be necessary to prove the fact of marriage, evidence of the admission of the fact by the party against whom the process is instituted, or of general repute, or of cohabitation as married persons, or any other circumstantial or presumptive evidence, from which the fact may be inferred, shall be received as competent evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-6\">But the paper in question cannot be admitted, under this statute, as circumstantial or presumptive evidence. It is not in itself evidence of any description ; nor could jt become so in any other manner than by being derived from the custody of the party to be affected by it. 1 Greenl.

If it had come from the possession of the defendant, it might have been evidence against him ; but coming from the possession of the wife, it could only affect her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-7\">To the second point of the exceptions, the counsel cited 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 52; 2 Same, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 47; <em>Stante </em>v. <em>Pricket, </em>1 Camp. 473; and contended, that, on the testimony, the judge should have directed the jury to disregard the whole evidence of the witness.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b401-8\"><em>S.

The certificate, purporting to be the official act of the person by whom it was signed, was admissible under the statutes, as in itself a piece of circumstantial evidence; but, at all events, it was so, within the rule above stated, a paper coming from the custody of the wife, which, in contemplation of law, no divorce having taken place between the parties, was the possession of the husband.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-10\">2. If the.evidence of the witness, as to acts of familiarity between the defendant and Abby Dow, was somewhat qualified as to time, on the cross examination, it still had some tendency to prove the commission of the offence, and, consequently, could not properly have been excluded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>3. The credibility of Abby Dow was fairly left to the jury.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b402-5\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"A2\">This was an indictment for adultery. After conviction several exceptions were taken to the directions of the judge who tried the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">1. One arises in this way. The prosecution offered evidence of familiarities of the defendant with Abby Dow, (with whom the adultery was alleged to have been committed), at or about the time of the offence charged. On cross examination, the witness left it doubtful as to the time, so that the acts referred to might have occurred a year before. It is objected, that this evidence ought not to have been received. It certainly could not have been rejected, as incompetent, when it was offered, for it was offered to prove acts about the time ; and the nearness of time is only a circumstance affecting its effect, and not its competency. If the time be brought into doubt by the cross examination, it was for the jury to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">2. It was objected, upon the evidence, that the defendant ought to have been acquitted. This is not a motion to set aside a verdict, as against evidence, nor is the evidence reported with that view ; such a question cannot be raised on a bill of exceptions. The bill states, that Abby Dow, called as a witness by the defendant, admitted the truth of the charges proved against the defendant, but denied the criminal intercourse. Her testimony was not directly impeached, but her credit was left to the jury, with directions to acquit the defendant, if they believed her. This instruction was certainly favorable to the defendant, and he cannot object. It is difficult to perceive how her admissions of familiarities of the defendant with her entitled her to any increased credit, or how the jury could have acquitted him upon her testimony, if they did not believe her.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">3. One other exception is, that a certificate, purporting to be a marriage certificate made by a clergyman of another state, was offered by the prosecution, to prove the defendant\u2019s marriage, and was objected to, but admitted. We are of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>opinion, that this paper, wholly unauthenticated, was not competent evidence, and ought not to have been admitted. And it received no additional weight by coming from the custody of the woman alleged to be his wife. She could not be a witness against her husband, and her production of the paper, not verified or proved, did not malee it evidence against him. It was said, that it was used only as a circumstance, in connection with other proof. If the other proof were sufficient without it, the certificate was unnecessary and immaterial ; if not, then it had weight as judicial proof, when it should have had none, and, in the minds of the jury, might have turned the scale.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\n<em>Verdict set aside, and case remanded to the municipal court, for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
