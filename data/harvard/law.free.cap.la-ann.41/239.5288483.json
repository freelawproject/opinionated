It was agreed between the parties that the goods seized under the several writs of attachment and sequestration should be sold under an order obtained in one of the suits and that the proceeds of the sale should remain in the hands of the sheriff, \u201c subject to the claims, rights and liens of the various alleged creditors,\u201d and that all parties having obtained orders <em>for </em>separate appraisements and sale <em>of </em>merchandise should be considered as having obtained orders in the case.
