Grumble &amp; Co. And in the further sum of $69 43. These different items aggregate the capital sum demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">It is perfectly apparent that no judgment could be rendered by this Court in favor of Bargas, in the latter suit, in excess of $1676 42. It is likewise apparent that if judgment should he rendered against Bargas for the full amount demanded in the former suit, tliere would remain only a balance in his favor in the consolidated suits of $1276 42. Hence, in no event, could wo render judgment for or against either party for a sum exceeding $1676 42, and this Court is without jurisdiction <em>ratione material.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">It is therefore ordered and decreed that this apx&gt;eal be dismissed at the cost of appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
