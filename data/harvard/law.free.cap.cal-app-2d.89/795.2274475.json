The record reveals that the victim was robbed by \u201ctwo persons as he was locking up his gas station at 72nd and Avalon Boulevard for the night.\u201d The defendant testified, as recited in appellant\u2019s brief, that, \u201che was employed by the \u2018East Side Taxi Cab Company.\u2019 That on January 6, 1948, he went near a service station at 7\u20182nd and Avalon Boulevard in Los Angeles and that time he was employed in the capacity of a taxi cab driver and that he had certain fares with him at that time. That he picked up the fares at 1035 East Jefferson Boulevard and they asked him to take them in the general direction of Watts. That they had him stop at 72nd and Avalon on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>street between Avalon and Central and they got out of the car without paying anything to him, and told him to wait for them. He waited about ten minutes and they came back and told him to drive them back to the Avenue for which they paid him about $5.00. They did not tell him where they had been and he did not know where they had been.\u201d Officer Bradley, however, testified in substance, as recited in appellant\u2019s brief, that, \u201cHe had a conversation with Appellant, Thompson, on January 19, 1948, at the Newton Street Detective Bureau. He asked Thompson to tell him what part he played in the robbery of the gas station at 72nd and Avalon, on or about the 6th day of January. He said that he, Cliff McClutchen, Abe Lincoln, Earl Patrick were riding around in Earl Patrick\u2019s automobile the night it happened, and the night was very foggy as they drove by the gas station at 72nd and Avalon, and someone said, \u2018That fellow is just closing up, let\u2019s rob him.\u2019 That he pulled the car around the corner from the gas station that Patrick and Lincoln got out of the car and went in the direction of the gas station. In a. few moments they came back and told him that they had held the man up and gave him approximately $12.00. He then drove off at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">It is contended on appeal that the evidence is insufficient \u201cto justify the judgment.\u201d In that connection it is argued that, \u201cthe evidence fails to establish any fact that appellant robbed the place or that he aided and ab&amp;etted in its commission. \u2019\u2019 It is also argued that, \u201cIt is not contended by the prosecution that Appellant participated in the robbery. Therefore, the only way that Appellant can be charged is that he intentionally aided and abetted in the commission of the crime. There is no evidence that a conspiracy existed to rob any place or that the robbery had been planned or plotted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">It is evident from a review of the record, and in particular the testimony of the officer above referred to, that appellant\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">The evidence is sufficient. The judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">York, P. J., and White, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
