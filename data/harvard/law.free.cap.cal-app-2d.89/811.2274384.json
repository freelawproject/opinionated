Defendants\u2019 demurrer to plaintiff\u2019s fifth amended complaint was sustained without leave to amend. Thereafter plaintiff appealed from \u201cthe order\u201d sustaining said demurrer but not from the judgment which was subsequently entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-13\">An appeal being wholly dependent upon and governed by the statutory (or constitutional) enactments relative thereto (2 Cal.Jur. p. 111, \u00a7 4) the exercise of the right so conferred must be strictly followed.  Hence, where, as in the present case, a purported appeal is taken from an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend, which is not an appealable order, this court is without jurisdiction to act thereon <em>(Madsen </em>v. <em>Turlock Irrigation Dist., </em>56 Cal.App.2d 742 [133 P.2d 416]), and such an appeal must be dismissed. It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-14\">Adams, P. J., and Thompson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-15\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied March 24, 1949. Carter, J., voted for a hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
