Nathan who died August 24, 1946.  There is no dispute as to the facts and the only question presented is the construction of clause third, paragraph (a) of decedent\u2019s will, reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-13\">\u201c (a) To Fanny Heitman, now serving as a maid in my home in Los Angeles, the sum of Five Thousand Dollars ($5000.00) in the event she shall have been in my employ <em>during </em>the five years following the date of this Will and living 'at the time of my death, making this bequest for the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>of providing her with funds for the purchase of a home.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Following this provision the will contained bequests to Louis Nathan, decedent\u2019s brother, and created a trust in favor of said brother and the United Hebrew Congregation, of Fort Smith, Arkansas. The will was executed February 6, 1945; there was a codicil dated April 4, 1946, rel\u00e1ting to the trust provisions but in no manner affecting the bequest to Fanny Heitman.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">It appears from the stipulation of facts that appellant was alive and in the employ of decedent at the time of the latter\u2019s death on August 24, 1946; \u201cthat if present and sworn appellant would testify (a) that she commenced employment with the decedent as a maid in his home on January 8, 1942, and worked for him continuously as such until the date of death; (b) that she was ready, able and willing to continue in the employ of the decedent for the perod of five years following the date of the will (February 6, 1945) and that she did not have any notice or knowledge that the legacy . . . was subject to any conditions until after the death of the decedent.\u201d It was also stipulated that the appraised value of the estate was $322,816.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">The executors petitioned the probate court for instructions with respect to appellant\u2019s legacy, taking the position that the legatee was entitled to nothing under the will for the reason that appellant\u2019s employment had continued only for a period of one year, six months and eighteen days from the date of the will to the time of decedent\u2019s death. The trial court found appellant was not \u201centitled to the full, or any, amount of said legacy\u201d; and concluded as a matter of law \u201cThat the Will sets up the happening of an event as a contingent condition precedent, (employment of decedent during the five years following the date of the will), which event did not happen and such condition precedent constituted the sole motive for making the bequest.\u201d Other than the stipulated facts hereinbefore referred to, no evidence was before the trial court. Appellant\u2019s brief avers that \u201cThese findings or conclusions were based solely on a construction of the language of the will, there being no extrinsic evidence that the testator\u2019s motive and intention were as so found or concluded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">It is appellant\u2019s position that \u201cThe facts being admitted and established without conflict, the construction of the will, the determination of the testator\u2019s motive in making the bequest to appellant, and the question of substantial perform<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>anee of the conditions of such bequest, are legal question and open to review on appeal unhampered by the alleged findings of the trial court.\u201d Appellant contends that the bequest of $5,000 \u201cin the event she shall have been in my employ <em>during </em>the five years following the date of this Will,\u201d (italics added), does not, either directly or by reasonable implication, require a full five years\u2019 service before testator\u2019s death; that such five years\u2019 service was obviously not the testator\u2019s sole motive in making the bequest; that there was substantial performance of the condition, and that completion of the full five years\u2019 service after the date of the will was rendered impossible by reason of the testator\u2019s death and without fault on appellant\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The appellant\u2019s argument is based upon the provisions of section 142 of the Probate Code, reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-7\">\u201cA condition precedent in a will is one which is required to be fulfilled before a particular disposition takes effect. <em>It is, to be deemed performed when the testator\u2019s intention has been substantially, though not literally, complied with. </em>Nothing vests until such condition is fulfilled, <em>except where fulfillment \u25a0is impossible, </em>in which case <em>the disposition vests, </em>unless (1) the condition was the sole motive thereof, <em>and </em>(2) the impossibility was unknown to the testator or arose from an unavoidable event subsequent to the execution of the will.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s italics.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">In this connection it is suggested that 1 \u2018 obviously appellant could not be in the employ of a dead man, \u2019 \u2019 and that testator had \u201creceived the benefit of her services as long as it was possible for him to do so,\u201d namely until the end of life. Testator\u2019s unexpected death less than five years after execution of the will is termed \u201can unavoidable event\u201d within the meaning of section 142 quoted above, entitling appellant to take under the bequest.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">It is further contended that the five-year condition cannot reasonably be deemed the \u201csole motive\u201d for the bequest, as specified in section 142, for several reasons. Since appellant had already been in testator\u2019s employ for more than three years when the will was made, and thereafter such employment continued for an additional period of one year, six months and eighteen days until testator\u2019s death, testator\u2019s motive was presumably the usual one of rewarding a faithful employee. Moreover, testator\u2019s \u201cmotive,\u201d that is, the reason or purpose as distinguished from \u201cintent,\u201d is said to have been made clear in the latter part of the bequest stating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>it is \u201cfor the purpose of providing her with funds for the purchase of a home,\u201d should appellant survive the testator. It is further' suggested that \u201cIf the fulfillment of such a condition had been his sole motive, it seems reasonable and probable that he would have informed her of the condition,\u201d which apparently testator did not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Respondent\u2019s brief answers these contentions with the argument that section 142 of the Probate Code should be construed in conformity with the common law, and that where an event \" may or may not happen, it will be presumed that the expectation of its taking place was the sole motive; that such pre-', sumption is sufficient to support the findings of the trial court which were adverse to appellant\u2019s contentions. No decisions have been cited which involve facts at all similar to those of the present controversy. It is also argued that in any event there has been no substantial compliance with the testator\u2019s intention; and that the bequest \u201cdoes not admit of the construction that the five-year period was to be cut down if testator\u2019s death occurred within that period. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Determination of the present appeal involves, among other things, a reasonable interpretation of the word \u201cduring\u201d as used in the bequest of $5,000 to appellant, \u201cin the event she\u2019 shall have been in my employ <em>during </em>the five years following the date of this Will and living at the time of my death, making this bequest for the purpose of providing her with funds for the purchase of a home.\u201d (Italics added.) As noted in appellant\u2019s brief, there was no express requirement that' appellant \u201cshall have been in his employ <em>\u2018throughout\u2019' </em>or \u2018for\u2019 the five years following the date of his will, but rather used the word \u2018during.\u2019 \u201d And, the brief continues, \u201cif one says, \u2018it rained <em>during </em>the night\u2019 it usually means that it rained <em>\u2018some portion </em>of the night\u2019 and not \u2018throughout the night. \u2019 \u201d Obviously, if this interpretation be placed on the language here used, appellant was in decedent\u2019s employ \u201cduring\u201d the five years following execution of the will; the relation being only terminated by an event outside the control of either appellant or the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">That a liberal and reasonable interpretation is to be striven' for rather than a narrow and technical one, is evident both from the prbvisions of section 142 previously referred to,' and from the other sections of the Probate Code relating to the construction of wills. This view is likewise reflected in the various decisions. The true rule is well stated in <em>Estate of Puett, </em>1 Cal.2d 131,133 [33 P.2d 825], where the court says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>\u201cIt is generally recognized that a testamentary instrument is to be examined with a view to discovering the decedent\u2019s testamentary scheme or general intention, and that the apparent meaning of particular words, phrases and provisions is to be subordinated to this scheme, plan or dominant purpose. \u2019 \u2019 The question here to be determined, then, is what shall be deemed a reasonable and liberal interpretation, bearing in mind the situation and relation of the parties, and the testator\u2019s general testamentary scheme and purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">In <em>Estate of Fletcher, </em>36 Cal.App.2d 567, 572 [97 P.2d 1039], it was said: \u201cThe uniform attitude of the courts of various jurisdictions displayed in the foregoing decisions, are all favorable to the employee.\u201d In that case it was held proper to order distribution where a legacy was to be paid if the legatee was in decedent\u2019s employ at the time of the latter\u2019s death, where there was evidence from which the jury could have found that a purport* d discharge of the employee was unauthorized and was intended by the testator to effect merely a temporary cessation of services and not a complete discharge. Among other cases cited in the Fletcher opinion is <em>Estate of Cowell, </em>170 Cal. 364 [149 P. 809], where in construing a bequest to employees \u201cnow working for said firm,\u201d it was likewise held that certain employees who had been temporarily suspended from a particular work, were still within the employ of the company, within meaning of bequest. The respondent has \u201cno quarrel with tho decision . . . in <em>Eslate of Cowell,\u201d </em>but denies that this decision and that in <em>Estate of Fletcher, </em>constitute authority for appellant\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">The matter of bequests made to employees has thus received judicial consideration and notwithstanding the factual differences, these cases and others plainly indicate that, in the language of appellant\u2019s brief, \u201cthe provisions of a will are to be liberally construed in favor of a beneficiary and that this is particularly true when the beneficiary is an employee of testator. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">In the instant case the testator\u2019s \u201cgeneral intention,\u201d reasonably construed, was to reward an employee who by reason of meritorious service during a period of more than three years prior to the date of the will, deserved more than the ordinary employment stipend. It is also evident that the employment relation was so satisfactory that the testator hoped and expected that it would continue for at least five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>years and that decedent would live to benefit therefrom. To find that the expression <em>\u201cdurvng </em>the five years following the date of this will,\u201d indicates that the testator\u2019s \u201csole motive\u201d for the bequest was a completion of such five-year period, can hardly be deemed a \u201cliberal\u201d interpretation. Nor, in view of the provisions of section 142 of the Probate Code and the circumstances here involved, can it be considered a reasonable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">The provisions of section 142 were obviously designed to prevent that failure of a bequest which might otherwise easily result from a too strict and literal interpretation of the words used. The present case affords a legitimate opportunity for its application. When it is considered that appellant\u2019s long-service was interrupted only by the testator\u2019s untimely death which rendered further fulfillment impossible, a reasonable and liberal interpretation compels the conclusion that the five-year condition \u201cis to be deemed performed when the testator\u2019s intention has been substantially, though not literally complied with,\u201d within the meaning of section- 142. And consistent with this view is the fact that the testator made use of the term \u201cduring,\u201d rather than \u201cthroughout\u201d or \u201cfor\u201d a five-year period following execution of the. will. Any other conclusion must of necessity ignore the evident purpose of section 142, and run contrary to the expressed judicial tendency toward liberal rather than strict construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The order denying distribution to appellant is reversed with directions to enter an order distributing to Fanny Heitman the full amount of the legacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">York, P.
