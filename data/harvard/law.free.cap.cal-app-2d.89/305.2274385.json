In one the defendant pleaded guilty to the information alleging the offense of burglary. In the other the defendant was charged in two counts with \u201cgrand theft from the person\u201d and, following a trial by the court was adjudged guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Following the plea of guilty to burglary a request to file an application for probation was granted; such permission was also granted after defendant\u2019s conviction in the grand theft action. Time for the hearing thereon and the pronounceing of judgment was set for May 25 as to both cases. On said date a motion to substitute attorneys for defendant was granted and a motion to withdraw the plea of guilty to the burglary information was denied. Application for probation was denied and judgment pronounced.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">The appeal is from the judgments, the order denying the application for change of plea, the order denying a motion for a new trial, and the orders denying the application for probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">The contention on appeal is \u201cThat the judgment of the court is contrary to the law and evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">Each of the grand theft offenses was committed in an automobile at night. The act amounted to what is generally referred to as \u201cpickpocket.\u201d Appellant\u2019s argument is in substance to the effect that the evidence of identification is insufficient. The defendant is a Negro and one of the victims testified, \u201cWell, I thought she was Spanish; she was speaking with a Spanish dialect.\u201d The other victim testified, \u201cShe was rattling off, and she impressed me as a Spanish person when she started talking. \u201d It is upon this testimony together with descriptions as to height that appellant bases the argument that evidence of identify is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">Without going into details, it is sufficient to note that the witnesses\u2019 testimony as to the identity of defendant was sufficient; the evidence supports the judgment and there are no errors in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">The judgments and orders are affirmed; the attempted appeals from the orders made before judgment are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-13\">York, P. J., and White, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
