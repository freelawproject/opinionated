It is provided therein that said premises were to be used \u2018for business or hotel purposes,\u2019 or \u2018any other lawful business or for different lawful businesses and purposes\u2019. The first and last two installments of rent were paid . . . amounting to $1,050.00. As part of the consideration for the lease plaintiff agreed in writing to make certain rehabilitations and improvements, which he proceeded to do at a cost of $3,230.91. Defendant entered into possession upon execution of said lease and proceeded to operate the premises as a rooming house, serving meals, and not as a hotel. Shortly thereafter plaintiff learned for the first time that under the previous owner, the property had been registered with the O. P. A. at $100.00 per month for use as housing accommodation, and that such ceiling was attached to the premises at the time plaintiff purchased.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">On May 8, 1947, plaintiff, on advice of an attorney, registered the property with the O. P. A. and on May 27, 1947, a maximum rental of $135 per month was fixed. Thereafter, on June 4, 1947, plaintiff served on defendant a notice of rescisson of the lease contract, based upon alleged mistake and failure of consideration. The complaint subsequently filed, demanded possession of the premises with reasonable rental of $350 per month, and alleged mistake of fact, mutual mistake of law, failure of consideration, and illegality of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>The trial court found that there was no proof of any of the grounds of rescission, and that plaintiff\u2019s ignorance of <em>* </em>the registered rental status of the property \u201cwas due to his inexcusable neglect of a legal duty. He did not attempt to ascertain the house\u2019s rental status either before he bought it or before he executed the lease.\u201d It was further found that the defendant cross-complainant was entitled to recover from plaintiff a total rental overcharge of $130, together with attorney fees of $200. The present appeal is from the judgment denying plaintiff any relief and in favor of defendant as aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">It is appellant\u2019s contention that \u201cThe evidence, without conflict, conclusively shows that the consent of the plaintiff to the execution of the lease was given under mistakes of fact,\u201d and that both parties were then acting \u201cunder mutual mistakes of law.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s testimony was to the effect that the agreed rental of $350 per month was believed to be within the law, and that since the property was leased as an entirety, it did not come within O. P. A. control. In this connection plaintiff stated: \u201cAt the time I signed the lease, I did not know that a (rent) registration had previously been entered by the O. P. A.\u201d; and \u201cI would not have given my consent to the execution of the lease or paid out the sum of over $3000.00 in fixing up the premises if I had known that the leasing would come under the O. P. A.\u201d There is like testimony by the defendant lessee that, \u201cI didn\u2019t know at that time, that the O. P. A. regulations covered the leasing of those housing accommodations.\u201d However, the defendant \u201cwould have signed it just the same, \u2019 \u2019 even with knowledge that it was in violation of regulations; \u201cI wanted a house and I would have taken it. \u2019 \u2019 Maxine Shaw, a broker who brought the parties together, also testified: \u201cAt the time we entered into this lease for business purposes I didn\u2019t know that the O. P. A. had anything to do with leasing a hotel or rooming house, or for any business purpose, when the entire building was let.\u201d Mrs. Shaw also remarked: \u201cWell, to tell the truth, since this O. P. A. entered my life, I am not really sure of anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Also urged as ground for reversal is \u201cThe Court\u2019s failure to give full effect to plaintiff\u2019s claim of failure and illegality of consideration.\u201d In reference to this claim the trial court found that \u201cas the alleged failure of consideration is shown to be the result of a lawful act of the O. P. A. under rent regulations reducing the contract rent, it cannot constitute ground for rescission.\u201d Appellant\u2019s claim of illegality is based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>section 206(a) of the \u201cHousing and Rent Act of 1947,\u201d [61 Stats. 193, 50 U.S.C.A.App. \u00a7 1881 et seq.], mating it unlawful \u201cto offer, solicit, accept, or receive any rent ... in excess of the maximum rent prescribed. \u201d It is to be noted, however, that Regulation, section 1(c), \"issued on July 1, 1947, provides that \u201cThe provisions of any lease . . . shall remain in force . . . except insofar as those provisions are inconsistent with this regulation.\u201d The trial court found no illegality of contract or of consideration. The court further found that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cacts of overcharge and collection of overcharge were not wilful and he did not fail to take practicable precautions against the occurrence of the violation,\u201d but that \u201cHis broker and agent, upon whom he relied, failed to make proper inquiries and report to the plaintiff the fact of the prior rental registration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The present situation is not unlike that in <em>Hannah </em>v. <em>Steinman, </em>159 Cal. 142, 146 [112 P. 1094], where the court said: \u201cWe deem it unimportant whether the alleged mistake in this case be held to be a mistake of fact or one of law. The mistake was the belief of both parties that the lot was not within the limits fixed by ordinance wherein it was unlawful ... to construct a wooden building. . . . Unconscious ignorance of a fact material to a contract or belief in the present existence of a thing material to the contract constitutes a mistake of fact (Civ. Code, sec. 1577), and misapprehension of the law by all parties, all supposing that they know and understand it, and all making substantially the same mistake as to the law, constitutes a mistake of law. (Civ. Code, sec. 1578.) Upon the facts of this case there was a mutual mistake either of fact or of law.\u201d Under Civil Code, section 1689, a party to a contract may rescind the same, \u201cIf the consent of the party rescinding . . . was given by mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">That the lease here under consideration was likewise executed under a mistaken belief that the transaction was legal and not covered by O. P. A. rental regulations, cannot be doubted. \u201cMy understanding,\u201d plaintiff testified, was \u201cthat it was all right.\u201d The defendant, Mrs. Heinsch, stated: \u201cI didn\u2019t know at that time, that the O. P. A. regulations covered the leasing of those housing accommodations.\u201d There is, indeed, no substantial evidence to the contrary. That the matter of rent and O. P. A. control was a vitally material matter is certain. Nor is there room for doubt that had the true facts been known, the lease in its present form would not have been consented to by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>The trial court\u2019s finding that appellant\u2019s disagreeable situation \u201cwas due to his inexcusable neglect of a legal duty\u201d in not ascertaining the exact rental status of the property before executing the lease, is justified neither by way of fact nor of law. And to deny rescission would inequitably enrich the defendant and unwarrantably penalize the plaintiff for a mistake which, in the language of appellant\u2019s brief, \u201ccould readily be made by anyone. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Both parties to the lease were apparently proceeding upon the assumption that since the leasing did not come within the so-called \u201cHotel and Rooming House Regulations,\u201d this meant that the matter of rental for the property leased as an entirety, was entirely outside any O. P. A. control. This, of course, was not true, for, while the matter was admittedly outside the purview of the hotel and rooming house part of the voluminous regulations, it was nevertheless governed by the more general11 Housing Regulations. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">That the situation was at least highly complicated if not baffling to both lay and legal minds is evidenced by the trial court\u2019s remarks: \u201cThis is just an illustration, visited upon me, of the very persistent and consistent methods of the O.P.A. resulting in utter confusion.\u201d At another point in the trial the judge said: \u201cI am not surprised at all that these witnesses should take the stand, and say they didn\u2019t know that this property would come under the O. P. A. at all.\u201d As stated in appellant\u2019s brief, it did not enter anyone\u2019s mind \u201cthat there was in existence a wholly different set of conflicting regulations which would bring the operation of the premises finder the jurisdiction of the 0. P. A.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The statement made in the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision, that \u201ca rescission herein would be of no benefit to the plaintiff. He could in no event lease the premises for more than $135.00,\u201d is manifestly incorrect. This assumption, as appellant\u2019s brief points out, overlooks other effects of a rescission which might be highly beneficial to the plaintiff. For example, \u201cwith the property freed from the obligations of a 5 year lease, the plaintiff could immediately sell the same, and thus recover the money he paid out on his investment.\u201d And, as hereinbefore indicated, to deny a rescission in the face of the record showing an innocent misunderstanding of a highly complicated legal matter and a mutually unknown factual situation, amounts to a violation of fundamental equitable principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>As appellant\u2019s brief avers, there is nothing in the rent control regulations which prevents or attempts to prevent the state courts from adjudging a rescission of a lease contract on the ground of mistake, whether one of fact or of law. That such a rescission is here required, seems plain. In view of the decision reached it becomes unnecessary to discuss appellant\u2019s other contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The judgment is reversed with directions to enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff, rescinding the lease in question; and denying the defendant the relief prayed for in the cross-complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">York, P. J., and White, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied February 21, 1949. Traynor, J., voted for a hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
