(Stats. 1911, pp. 1496-7, art. III, \u00a7\u00a7 4,11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">\u201c.. . the city of Modesto shall have the right and power . . . To lease to corporations or individuals, for the purpose of maintenance and operation of any public utility owned by the city, and to provide for the lease of any lands now or hereafter owned by the city, except lands donated, purchased, acquired, or used for public parks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The prayer of the complaint sought a declaratory judgment with respect to the validity of the agreement and a writ of mandamus compelling the defendant city to grant plaintiff permission to use the park when it is not scheduled for use by other persons or organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>The defendants interposed a general demurrer to the foregoing complaint and in addition demurred specifically on various grounds. The judgment which was entered after the order of the trial court sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend did not specify on what ground the demurrer was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">The rule is well established that on appeal from a judgment on demurrer it must be assumed that all the facts are as alleged since the effect of the demurrer is to admit all allegations well pleaded. <em>(Abroms </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co., </em>53 Cal.App.2d 764 [128 P.2d 391]; <em>Hitson </em>v. <em>Dwyer, </em>61 Cal.App.2d 803 [143 P.2d 952]; <em>Morris Plan Co. </em>v. <em>State of California, </em>73 Cal.App.2d 415 [166 P.2d 627].)  It is equally well established that when a complaint is good against a general demurrer, it is error to sustain a special demurrer without leave to amend. <em>(Columbia Pictures Corp. </em>v. <em>DeToth, </em>26 Cal.2d 753 [161 P.2d 217, 162 A.L.R. 747]; <em>Zakaessian </em>v. <em>Zakaessian, </em>70 Cal.App.2d 721 [161 P.2d 677].)</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">Applying these rules to the present case it is readily apparent that since the defendants\u2019 demurrer admits the leasing of a public park by the defendant city to the defendants Green and Herman, which is prohibited by said charter as set forth in the complaint, a cause of action has been stated. Therefore as the complaint is good against a general demurrer, necessitating its remand on that ground, it becomes unnecessary to consider the merits of the grounds of the special demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the trial court with instructions to enter its order overruling the demurrer of the defendants to the complaint as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">Adams, P. J., and Thompson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied March 2, 1949.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
