(Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1179.)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">In October 1978, Los Caballeros Racquet &amp; Sports Club, Ltd. (Los Cab) as lessor and American National Volleyball Association (ANVA) as lessee entered into a written 20-year lease. All improvements became the property of Los Cab, subject only to the lease. No assignment could be made without prior written consent of Los Cab and no lien or claim was to attach to the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">In late 1979 and early 1980, Pacific loaned ANVA $190,000 and in March of 1980, Pacific recorded a deed of trust on ANVA\u2019s leasehold interest. No written consent was requested of or given by Los Cab.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">In the fall of 1980 Pacific became aware of ANVA\u2019s financial difficulties. In an attempt to preserve its security interest in the leasehold, Pacific discussed the matter with Los Cab, offering to bring ANVA\u2019s delinquencies current. Los Cab invoiced Pacific for the amounts due and owing from ANVA. Although a check in that amount was drawn, Pacific then received notice of filing of a voluntary petition in bankruptcy (chapter 7) by ANVA on January 13, 1981, and did not remit the check to Los Cab. ANVA\u2019s lease was automatically rejected 60 days later pursuant to 11 United States Code section 365(d)(1). In May, Los Cab commenced adversary proceedings against ANVA and its trustee in the bankruptcy court. Judgment was rendered on June 4, giving Los Cab immediate possession of the property and improvements and terminating any interest of ANVA in the lease. Pacific was unaware of and not a party to the action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">Pacific then sought relief in the bankruptcy court under Code of Civil Procedure section 1179. Pacific filed its petition in Orange County Superior Court after the bankruptcy court declined to hear the matter. Hearing was held January 4, 1982, and the court took the matter under submission. By minute order of January 14, the petition was denied, and the instant appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>was filed March 21.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We denied a motion to dismiss the appeal without prejudice to the right to raise the issue in the briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Timeliness of Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">We address the following issues in determining commencement of Pacific\u2019s time to appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">1) Was the clerk\u2019s mailing of a copy of the judgment \u201cpursuant to order of the court\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 664.5) and was it in proper form, thus triggering the time period? Or, if ineffective,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">2) Was Los Cab\u2019s filing notice of entry of final order and proof of service-effective within the context of the first or second sentence of California Rules of Court, rule 2(a)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The relevant actions taken and respective dates are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">January 4\u2014Hearing on Pacific\u2019s petition for relief from forfeiture, taken under submission;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-10\">January 14\u2014Court\u2019s order entered<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in minutes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-11\">January 14\u2014Clerk mailed copy of minute order to parties and filed certificate of mailing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-12\">February 8\u2014Los Cab mailed and filed notice of entry of final order and proof of service;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-13\">March 21\u2014Pacific filed appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-14\">California Rules of Court, rule 2(a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> prescribes initiation of the time periods for filing an appeal.  Pacific, relying on the first sentence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>rule 2(a), claims the time for appeal began on February 8, when Los Cab filed its proof of service. Pacific is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Rule 2(a) and Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provide the clerk\u2019s notice of a superior court judgment commences the period for appeal if pursuant to order of the court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The transcript of the January 4 hearing indicates the court intended to provide notice to the parties: \u201cThe matter\u2019s submitted. I\u2019ll notify the parties within ten days.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We find this sufficient to constitute \u201corder of the court\u201d under section 664.5. Although there is no formal order to that effect, the only logical construction to be given to the judge\u2019s comment is he intended to provide notice and his clerk would perform that act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Los Cab\u2019s notice of entry of final order did not effectively commence the time period because the trial court had already entered its own order in the permanent minutes on January 14. The notice given by Los Cab could serve to begin the time for appeal only if there had been no prior notice by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>clerk. <em>(Bunion </em>v. <em>Arizona Pacific Tanklines </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 210 [190 Cal.Rptr. 295].)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">We next address the sufficiency of the form of the notice of entry of judgment given by the clerk. The first clause of section 664.5 requires <em>a party </em>submitting an order or judgment for entry \u201cprepare and mail a copy of the notice of entry of judgment (and) file with the court the original notice . . . together with the proof of service by mail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The second clause of section 664.5, subdivision (a) and subdivisions (b) and (c), however, govern the form of the notice of entry when done by the clerk. Those sections merely require <em>mailing </em>notice, of entry. The only additional document placed in the court\u2019s file, in the case of municipal and justice courts, is the clerk\u2019s certificate of mailing. We find this language contemplates \u201cnotice of entry of judgment\u201d by the clerk may be in a different form than that of a party submitting an order for entry. \u201c \u2018Notice [of entry of judgment] must be in writing. [Citations.] But no particular form is required; \u201cany notice in writing which will convey to a losing party that the judgment has been entered is sufficient in California.\u201d <em>(Bank of America </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1931) 115 C.A. 454, 457 ....)\u2019 \u201d <em>(Tri-County Elevator Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 271, 276 [185 Cal.Rptr. 208], quoting from 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Judgment, \u00a7 58, p. 3221.) In <em>Mossman </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 22 Cal.App.3d 706 [99 Cal.Rptr. 638], \u201cNotice of Entry of Judgment\u201d was promptly served on the attorney in accordance with the mandate of Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5. The court noted: \u201cFor the purpose of a contempt proceeding we observe no substantial distinction between service on counsel of \u2018Notice of Entry of Judgment\u2019 and service of a copy of the judgment. \u201d (Id., at p. 712, fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">In other words, where a final order is entered in the permanent minutes, constituting \u201centry\u201d within rule 2(b)(2), notice of that entry, when ordered by the court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5, subdivisions (a) or (c), may be accomplished by the clerk mailing a copy of the minute order.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Pacific was given written notice, in substance and effect, of entry of the judgment. The appeal time commenced on January 14; the appeal filed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>March 21 was untimely.  Compliance with the time for filing the notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>(Vibert </em>v. <em>Berger </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 65, 67 [48 Cal.Rptr. 886, 410 P.2d 390].) Pacific\u2019s appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Trotter, P. J., and Crosby, L, concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b197-11\">Pacific did not request special notice of any proceedings or take any action prior to the automatic rejection date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b198-15\">As we determine the appeal untimely filed, we do not reach the substantive issues raised by the petition. However, it appears the trial court\u2019s action was correct. There were three occasions for Pacific to protect its interests: 1) At the time of the loan application by obtaining the landlord\u2019s consent; 2) at the time of its conference with Los Cab by bringing the lease current; and 3) after ANVA entered bankruptcy by offering to purchase the lease from the trustee or, at the least, requesting special notice should any action be taken on the lease.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b198-16\">\u201cThe date of entry of an appealable order which is entered in the minutes shall be the date of its entry in the permanent minutes ....\u2019\u2019 (Cal.

Rules of Court) places an affirmative duty on the clerk to notify the parties of the court\u2019s order, following a matter taken under submission, by mailing a copy of the order to the parties and \u201cit shall constitute service of notice only if the clerk is required to give notice pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5.\u201d Had the court merely taken the matter under submission, and absent the court\u2019s intent to provide notice, performance of the clerk\u2019s statutory duty under rule 204 would not \u201cconstitute service of notice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Treatment of a municipal court judgment during the applicable time period buttresses this finding. If the prevailing party submitted an order for entry, the appeal period began upon filing of the proof of service of notice of entry. However, under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5, subdivision (b) the clerk was still required to mail notice of entry, presumably not a duplication of the separate document prepared by the prevailing party.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
