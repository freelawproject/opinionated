As a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>result of the accident, Kathy and Richard Field, occupants of the other car, sued Laura, her father and her mother, Mary Eva Klinger (Klinger) for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\">Klinger\u2019s automobile liability insurance carrier, Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club of Southern California (Interinsurance) sought declaratory relief contending Klinger\u2019s policy did not provide coverage for Laura because the pickup truck was a \u201cnonowned\u201d automobile available for Laura\u2019s regular use and therefore excluded under the terms of the policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After an evidentiary hearing the trial court concluded the truck was available for Laura\u2019s regular use and the Klinger policy expressly excluded the pickup as an \u201cadditional assured automobile.\u201d The Smiths and Klinger appeal, contending (1) the exclusionary language is ambiguous, and (2) no substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Laura lived- with her divorced mother but maintained close contact with her father, Smith. Beginning about six weeks before the day of the accident, Laura and Smith shared the truck in this general arrangement: When Smith was not using the truck for his part-time pool maintenance business, he would park it in front of Klinger\u2019s house.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Smith worked in both the mornings and afternoons and he used the Datsun at varying times. It was parked in front of Laura\u2019s house about 50 percent of the time. Smith owned the single set of keys; when parked at Klinger\u2019s house the keys were usually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>left under the floorboard mat, in the mailbox, or in Klinger\u2019s house. Laura was normally able to drive the truck when Smith was not working, yet she customarily checked with her father to obtain permission before she drove it because of the restrictions on her use and the priority of the father\u2019s need for the truck in his business. Once Laura received permission and was sitting behind the wheel, she was expected to comply with these restrictions: Laura was not permitted to drive out of the county without her father\u2019s permission. She could only drive it for functional, not pleasure, purposes\u2014 no \u201ccruising.\u201d At the time of the accident, Laura was driving home from her doctor\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">Interinsurance points to this most fundamental rule of appellate review: this court must \u201cview the evidence in the light most favorable to the respondent . . . .\u201d <em>(State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Elkins </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 534, 538 [125 Cal.Rptr. 139].) In addition, where the question is one of fact \u201cany reasonable construction by the lower court must be upheld under the general rules applicable to conflicting evidence.\u201d <em>(Cal-Farm Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Boisseranc </em>(1957) 151 Cal.App.2d 775, 780 [312 P.2d 401].) The court stated in <em>Pacific Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1943) 56 Cal.App.2d 597, 601 [132 P.2d 846], in discussing appellate review of a \u201cregular use\u201d finding: \u201cA question of fact is presented which calls for an interpretation of the language of the policies relating to the facts involved. That language may be reasonably interpreted as intending to provide for a regular use at the time and place in question, and not for such an exceptional and single use by special permission as here appears. The court having adopted this construction, and this being a reasonable one, it cannot be overthrown even if it should appear that another construction would have been equally tenable.\u201d Interinsurance asks this court to analyze the appeal in light of the foregoing rules and find that substantial evidence supports the trial court conclusion the Datsun was \u201cavailable for regular use\u201d by Laura.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">The foregoing rules apply where extrinsic evidence has been admitted on the interpretation of a provision of the insurance contract which requires some explanation <em>\u201cdehors </em>the contract\u201d <em>(Cal-Farm Ins. Co., supra, </em>151 Cal.App.2d at p. 780) or where the evidence as to a \u201cregular use\u201d is in factual dispute. Neither specie of dispute is present here. The question of what constitutes \u201cregular use\u201d within the meaning of an automobile liability policy clause providing nonowned automobile coverage only for vehicles not owned by or furnished for regular use of named insured or any relative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>is one which must be determined according to facts and circumstances of each case. However, the problem in this case is not disputed facts but the legal definition, the meaning to be ascribed to the phrase \u201cavailable for regular use\u201d and whether the conceded facts fit the legal definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">The term \u201cregular use\u201d is not vague, undefined or ambiguous. <em>(Highlands Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>(1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 171, 175 [154 Cal.Rptr. 683].) No extrinsic evidence is necessary to determine the meaning of these words. In the eight California cases which have ruled on the meaning of \u201cregular use\u201d the appeal courts have not hesitated to define and apply the concept. <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. 3.) More than 40 years ago, the California Supreme Court interpreted and gave substance to the words \u201cregular use\u201d in <em>Kindred </em>v. <em>Pacific Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1938) 10 Cal.2d 463, 465 [75 P.2d 69]. The controversy in <em>Kindred </em>revolved around the interpretation of an insurance policy provision limiting coverage to the regular and frequent use of a truck within a 50-mile radius of the \u201cplace of principal garaging\u201d of the vehicle. Since no regular or frequent trips were insured beyond the 50-mile radius and the accident occurred outside this area, liability turned upon the meaning of \u201cregular and frequent use.\u201d Recognizing the truck was \u201cused principally and frequently\u201d beyond the designated area, the Supreme Court determined the truck was uninsured. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In reaching this conclusion, the court constructed the first major litmus test: \u201cthe phrase \u2018regular and frequent use\u2019 . . . means the <em>principal use, </em>as distinguished from a casual or incidental use . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.-, </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">In <em>Pacific Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lewis, supra, </em>56 Cal.App.2d 597, \u201cregular use\u201d by a car salesman was at issue; the <em>Kindred </em>concept of \u201cprincipal use\u201d was further explicated. Because the salesman did not own a demonstrator, his employer provided a \u201chouse demonstrator\u201d for use subject to the employer\u2019s validation. The salesman commonly drove the demonstrator \u201cfor his personal use during the daytime and some half dozen nights a month . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 599.) Although the employer never encouraged this practice, he endured it, believing the privilege fostered \u201chappy\u201d and \u201cbetter\u201d salesmen. On the evening before the accident, the salesman requested permission to drive one of the cars on a personal mission and was advised to use the \u201chouse demonstrator.\u201d Enroute, the salesman was involved in a collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Determining the car was not furnished for the salesman\u2019s \u201cregular use,\u201d the court augmented <em>Kindred, </em>suggesting \u201cprinciple use\u201d may be \u201cregular use,\u201d irrespective of its <em>exclusiveness. (Pacific Auto, </em>at p. 600.) Thus, had the personal trip constituted \u201cprincipal use,\u201d the use would have been deemed \u201cregular,\u201d regardless of whether other salesmen had earlier used the demonstrator. Additionally, the court narrowed the interpretative con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>fines of \u201cregular use,\u201d providing \u201cregular use may reasonably depend upon the time, place and purpose for which [the vehicle] is to be used.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Crucial was the uncommon purpose of the trip, the extensive distance traveled, and the special permission accorded the salesman. \u201cIt cannot be said,\" concluded the court, \u201cas a matter of law, that such a use on a particular occasion, which is a departure from the customary use for which the car is furnished, is a regular use . . . .\u201d (Id., at p. 601.)</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">The disputed \u201cregular use\u201d in <em>Comunale </em>v. <em>Traders &amp; General Ins. Co. </em>(1953) 116 Cal.App.2d 198 [253 P.2d 495], emanated from an accident involving a truck borrowed by one brother from another. The brothers entered an agreement allowing the first brother to use the second brother\u2019s truck as long as it was not being employed by the latter. Consenting to pay the second brother the equivalent cost for public transportation, the first brother drove the truck to and from work for a period of 10 days. On the only day the first brother used the truck for a social visit, he collided with pedestrians who were attempting to cross the street. The court, applying <em>Pacific Auto., supra, </em>56 Cal.App.2d 597, resolved the truck was not furnished for the first brother\u2019s regular use. The purpose of the use was pivotal to the court\u2019s consideration: The truck had been used \u201csolely for the purpose of driving to and from his work and not for other purposes, and the only occasion on which he had used the truck other than for this purpose was on the night of the accident.\u201d <em>(Comunale </em>v. <em>Traders &amp; General Ins. Co., supra, </em>116 Cal.App.2d at p. 202.)</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">In <em>Juzefski </em>v. <em>Western Cas. &amp; Surety Co. </em>(1959) 173 Cal.App.2d 118 [342 P.2d 928], a son used his own car to drive to school and work and, in general, to social gatherings. He also used his father\u2019s car if a particular evening warranted special chivalry. The appeal court determined no substantial evidence supported the trial court\u2019s finding of regular use; the court first observed no standing arrangement existed between father and son regarding the use of the car; \u201c \u2018there was no set time or no set principle involved in the use of the car.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 122.) Moreover, the court found it was necessary for the son to obtain parental permission each time he desired to use the car. Although permission was granted unless either parent had made previous commitments, the necessity of complying with the requirement was not compromised. In concluding the father\u2019s car was not furnished for his son\u2019s regular use, the court observed, the son\u2019s use was a \u201ccasual and occasional use for which special permission had to be secured each time the car was driven. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">Similar to the business uses addressed in <em>Pacific Auto, </em>and <em>Comunale, </em>the use in <em>Safeco Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 204 [52 Cal.Rptr. 910], involved an Internal Revenue Service agent and his government car. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>After completing all business matters in the early evening and dining with a number of peers, the agent motored to his overnight destination. After checking into his motel, the agent set out for a drink. As he was driving back to town, the agent collided with another motorist. The court found the agent\u2019s use of the government car failed to constitute \u201cregular use.\u201d His use was uncontestably for personal and not business purposes. The court subscribed to the views established in <em>Pacific Auto, </em>and <em>Comunale, </em>emphasizing \u201cthe \u2018regular use\u2019 exception involved herein does not apply to an isolated, incidental or casual <em>personal </em>use by the named insured of a motor vehicle regularly furnished to him by the owner thereof for <em>business </em>purposes.\u201d <em>(Safeco, </em>at p. 207.)</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">In <em>Truck Ins. Exch. </em>v. <em>Wilshire Ins. Co. </em>(1970) 8 Cal.App.3d 553 [87 Cal.Rptr. 604], the controverted use concerned an interested buyer and a used Rambler. The prospective buyer called upon the used car dealer who furnished the Rambler for a trial period. After several weeks, the buyer decided to buy the car, but before the documents were signed the buyer was involved in an accident. Relying on <em>Pacific Auto., </em>the court concluded the Rambler was not furnished for the buyer\u2019s regular use. Applying the terms \u201ctime,\u201d \u201cplace,\u201d and \u201cpurpose\u201d to the trial period during which the car was used, the court recognized, \u201cthe use was for a limited period of time, restricted to a reasonable geographical area, and for a limited purpose. And, although [the buyer] used the car for several weeks, this fact alone does not change the nature of the use as a matter of law.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 561.)</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">As noted above, a \u201cregular use\u201d was found in <em>Kindred </em>where use of the truck was deemed principal and not casual or incidental. Only two other California cases have found facts giving effect to a \u201cregular use\u201d exclusion. They are: <em>Northwest Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Legg, </em>91 Cal.App.2d 19, and <em>Highlands Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co., supra, 92 </em>Cal.App.3d 171. In <em>Northwest Casualty Co., supra, </em>91 Cal.App.2d 19, the daughter used her mother\u2019s car in this fashion: After the mother had a stroke, the daughter sold her own car and began driving her mother\u2019s. She used the car for \u201cher mother, for herself, for her family, or for business. She had the <em>keys </em>and used it <em>whenever she wanted </em>to and for <em>all purposes </em>and occasions.\u201d (Nor<em>thwest Casualty Co., </em>at p. 22; italics added.) Since the daughter \u201chad control of the car and used it whenever she wanted\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>the court, citing <em>Pacific Auto., </em>concluded the car was furnished for her regular use. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">In <em>Highlands Ins. Co., supra, 92 </em>Cal.App.3d 171, the most recent of the eight decisions, the use in question was similar to the use at issue in <em>Truck </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number><em>Ins. Exch. </em>However, unlike <em>Truck Ins. Exch., </em>the court in <em>Highlands Ins. Co. </em>determined the car was furnished for the driver\u2019s regular use. The driver in <em>Highlands Ins. Co. </em>agreed to purchase the car but deferred payment until he received specially ordered tires. He used his car for nearly six weeks and was awaiting arrival of his tires when the accident occurred. <em>Truck Ins. Co. </em>was distinguished as \u201c \u2018the use was for a limited period of time, restricted to a reasonable geographical area, and for a limited purpose.\u2019\u201d (Hig<em>hlands Ins. Co., </em>at p. 176.) The <em>Highlands Ins. Co. </em>court stated the use at hand involved \u201cno limitations of any kind . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Since no limitations existed, the court concluded the car was furnished for \u201c \u2018all purposes and at all times and places . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, unlimited use was equated with \u201cregular use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Upon analysis of the foregoing authorities, it appears <em>Juzefski </em>v. <em>Western Cas. &amp; Surety Co., supra, </em>173 Cal.App.2d 118, is factually and legally most compelling. The <em>Juzefski </em>court concluded there was \u201c \u2018no set time or no set principle\u2019 \u201d involved in the son\u2019s use of his father\u2019s car. There was no \u201cstanding arrangement\u201d for the son\u2019s use of the car. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 122.) Additionally, the court found the son obtained permission each time he hoped to use the car. Similarly, in the case at bench, there was \u201cno set time or no set principal\u201d involved in Laura\u2019s use of the pickup truck, i.e., the car was not furnished for the \u201cregular use\u201d of Laura. Moreover, Smith\u2019s use varied with his work obligations. As in <em>Juzefski, </em>Laura normally had to first obtain permission before she drove the pickup truck. Her father\u2019s use had priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">In <em>Truck Ins. Exch. </em>v. <em>Wilshire Ins. Co., supra, </em>8 Cal.App.3d 553, 561, the court determined the Rambler was not furnished for the buyer\u2019s regular use because the car was restricted \u201cto a reasonable geographical area and for a limited purpose.\u201d Similarly, Laura\u2019s use was so restricted. She was permitted to drive only on short trips within the county unless special permission was obtained. Her driving was for a limited purpose as well. The truck was provided for functional uses only and not for entertainment. In contrast, in <em>Highlands Ins. Co., </em>where a \u201cregular use\u201d was found, there were <em>\u201cno limitations of any kind. </em>\u201d Regular use was also found in <em>Northwest Casualty Co. </em>because the daughter possessed her own set of keys and used the car \u201cwhenever she wanted to and for all purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">The facts here are undisputed. The truck was not generally available for Laura\u2019s use. Hers was not the dominant or controlling or priority use of the truck. The father\u2019s use had priority, Laura\u2019s use was limited to specific purposes, limited in time and limited in area. Consent and keys had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>to be obtained before any use. These facts and all eight California cases (as well as persuasive out-of-state and federal authorities, cited <em>infra.) </em>compel the conclusion as a matter of law the uncontradicted evidence does not support the trial court\u2019s conclusion Laura\u2019s use of the Datsun truck was a \u201cregular use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">The foregoing eight cases involved the phrase <em>\u201cfurnished for regular use.\u201d </em>In contrast, in the case at bench the phrase <em>\u201cavailable for regular use\u201d </em>is at issue.  The terms \u201cavailable\u201d and \u201cfurnished\u201d are not synonymous. This word difference is not without some legal significance in the factual context of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">\u201cThe connotation of the term \u2018furnish\u2019 suggests that it refers to instances when the automobile was actually utilized by defendant. . . . [\u2018Available\u2019 requires] that the potential use of the automobile be to a substantial degree under the control of the insured.\u201d <em>(Waggoner </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1972) 31 Colo.App. 518 [507 P.2d 482, 485]; <em>Farm Bureau Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Marr </em>(D.N.J. 1955) 128 F.Supp. 67.) The court in <em>Waggoner </em>reasoned (p. 485): \u201cA car is not \u2018available\u2019 where, as here, the keys and specific permission must be obtained each time use of the car is desired. [Citation.]\u201d and concluded: \u201cas a matter of law, that the use shown by the evidence is not sufficient to establish that the car was \u2018furnished or available for the frequent or regular use of the insured.\u2019\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>And in <em>Ky. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Cook </em>(Ky.App. 1978) 590 S.W.2d 885, the term \u201cavailable for regular use\u201d was interpreted to mean that the automobile could usually and regularly be had or be used whenever it was wanted, needed or desired and that such use could be made without seeking permission of the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">The use of the Datsun truck was not under Laura\u2019s control. The track was not available whenever she \u201cwanted, needed or desired\u201d it. Her use was entirely dependent upon Smith\u2019s work schedule and his consent. Laura did not possess the set of keys. The truck should not as a matter of law be considered \u201cavailable\u201d when \u201ckeys and specific permission must be obtained each time use of the [vehicle] is desired.\u201d <em>(Waggoner </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra, </em>507 P.2d at p. 485.) In light of these broad, specific limitations on use, the truck was not <em>available </em>for Laura\u2019s regular use.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">Finally, the purpose of this exclusion clause is a significant factor in determining its applicability to the facts of this case.  The \u201cadditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>insured automobile\u201d provision in the auto liability policy was intended to provide coverage for occasional use of other cars without requiring payment of additional premiums. For obvious reasons, coverage was not intended to include the <em>regular </em>use of other cars because insurance companies would necessarily bear an increased risk without receiving a related increase in premiums. Specifically, the exclusion serves to prevent a situation in which the members of one family or household may have two or more automobiles actually or potentially used interchangeably but with only one particular automobile insured. <em>(Highlands Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co., Inc., supra, </em>92 Cal.App.3d 171, 176; <em>Aler </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. </em>(D.Md. 1950) 92 F.Supp. 620, 623; see Annot. 86 A.L.R.2d 937, 940 (1962).)</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">Such factual situation does not exist here. The pickup truck was neither actually nor potentially used interchangeably with any other family car. Laura\u2019s use was on a \u201cnecessity\u201d basis. As a general rule Smith used his truck solely for his pool maintenance business. Laura used it occasionally for limited purposes, subject to the father\u2019s priority and \u201cher mother\u2019s discretion.\u201d On the day of the accident, the father had planned to use the truck in his work but it was raining. The father had the keys, but when he learned Laura needed to go to the doctor, he dropped off the keys. To enforce this exclusion in a factual setting where the sole purpose for the exclusion is not present is to violate the cardinal rules of construction of exclusionary clauses in insurance contracts. <em>(Continental Cas.

He had other vehicles in addition to the truck. In December 1979 he made arrangements to sell his pool service business. At that time he had insurance on the truck. However, he cancelled it because he did not feel he would need to use the truck since he had sold his business.
