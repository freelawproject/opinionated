The applicant and his employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier disagreed on whether Adame actually sustained an industrial injury and the nature and extent of his injuries. Before any evidence was taken at the hearing, the parties submitted a handwritten form compromise and release to the workers\u2019 compensation judge for approval. The parties agreed \u201c[a] serious and good faith issue exists [on the issue of industrial injury] which if decided against the applicant would defeat all his rights to benefits . . .,\u201d but did not detail any facts to support this conclusion. The proposed settlement included applicant\u2019s release of the employer\u2019s liability for rehabilitation benefits. Applicant has never disavowed the stipulation and supported the employer\u2019s carrier\u2019s position at oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">Without hearing, the workers\u2019 compensation judge approved the compromise and release, but not the proposed settlement of rehabilitation benefits. State Compensation Insurance Fund, the employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier, petitioned the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB) for reconsideration. In denying the petition, the WCAB simply adopted and incorporated the \u201cOpinion and Recommendation of Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge on Petition for Reconsideration,\u201d which concluded the workers\u2019 compensation carrier failed to show \u201ca bona fide issue of injury\u201d existed, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>in any event he was precluded by Labor Code section 5100.6<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from approving a settlement of rehabilitation benefits. For the reasons discussed below, this order must be annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">First, despite Labor Code section 5100.6, the employer\u2019s mandatory duty to provide rehabilitation benefits (Lab. Code, \u00a7 139.5, subd. (c)) may be compromised and released where \u201ca serious and good faith issue exists ... as to the validity of the claim which if resolved against the applicants would result in a denial of all benefits.\u201d <em>(Thomas </em>v. <em>Sports Chalet, Inc. </em>(1977) 42 Cal.Comp.Cases 625, 633.) The WCAB\u2019s authority under <em>Thomas </em>to release the employer from future liability for rehabilitation benefits was later codified in California Administrative Code, title 8, section 10870<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and recently affirmed in <em>Burbank Studios </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. (Yount) </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 929 [184 Cal.Rptr. 879]. The WCAB\u2019s authority is limited, however; it may not rewrite the parties\u2019 agreement by striking the proposed settlement of rehabilitation benefits and approving the balance of the compromise and release.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(Burbank Studios, supra, </em>at p. 937.)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Second, whether the WCAB approves or disapproves the proposed compromise and release, <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Burbank Studios </em>require the WCAB to examine the record in order to make an express finding on the issue of the claim\u2019s validity and to specify reasons for the decision. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5908.5)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If the workers\u2019 compensation judge issues a recommendation satisfying these requisites, the WCAB may adopt and incorporate the recommendation of the workers\u2019 compensation judge as its own when denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>a petition for reconsideration. <em>(Gaiera </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 248 [76 Cal.Rptr. 656].)</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Here, however, the recommendation of the workers\u2019 compensation judge was made without a hearing or submission of any evidence, apart from the stipulation, and was contrary to the parties\u2019 stipulation of a bona fide issue of injury. The recommendation did not comport with the requirement that the WCAB \u201cdetail the reasons why it does not believe there is a legitimate and good faith issue which could potentially bar the applicant\u2019s right to all benefits under <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Sports Chalet, Inc., supra.\u201d (Burbank Studios, supra, </em>at pp. 936-937.) Thus, the WCAB\u2019s order, which simply adopted the recommendation in toto, failed to adequately justify the decision (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5908.5) and precludes our meaningful review.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The error is compounded because the settlement was before trial, creating a significant factual distinction from <em>Burbank Studios, supra, </em>134 Cal.App.3d at pp. 931, 937. There, the WCAB failed to specify reasons for disapproval of a <em>posttrial </em>compromise and release. Here, the WCAB did not generate a record in order to support its disapproval of the settlement of rehabilitation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">We conclude an applicant and the employer or its compensation carrier may include settlement of vocational rehabilitation benefits in a pretrial compromise and release, provided the record is sufficiently detailed to permit an informed and precise finding on the issue of a bona fide industrial injury and the WCAB explains the reason for its decision and specifies the evidence relied upon. In most cases this can be accomplished with a factual, nonconclusory stipulation; in others the presentation of evidence may be necessary. Here the workers\u2019 compensation judge should have simply returned the entire compromise and release to the parties for the necessary factual information before decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Accordingly, the WCAB order denying reconsideration is annulled. The matter is remanded to the WCAB for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">Trotter, P. J., and Wallin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Labor Code section 5100.6 provides, \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of Section 5100, the appeals board shall not permit the commutation or settlement of compensation or indemnity payments or other benefits to which the employee is entitled under rehabilitation. \u201d The constitutionality of the statute is not questioned in this proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Title 8, California Administrative Code, section 10870 states, \u201cAgreements which provide for the payment of less than the full amount of compensation due or to become due and which undertake to release the employer from all future liability will be approved only where it appears that a reasonable doubt exists as to the rights of the parties or that approval is in the best interest of the parties. <em>No agreement shall relieve an employer of liability for vocational rehabilitation benefits unless the Workers \u2019 Compensation Appeals Board makes a finding that there is a good faith issue which, if resolved against the injured employee, would defeat the employee\u2019s right to all workers\u2019 compensation benefits. \u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b516-9\">We agree \u201csome form of conditional action . . .
