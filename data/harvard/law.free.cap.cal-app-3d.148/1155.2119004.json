Code, \u00a7 10851), two counts of receiving stolen property (Pen. Code, \u00a7 496), one count of possession of a concealable firearm by an ex-felon (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12021, subd. (a)), one count of embezzlement (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 504, 487), one count of insurance fraud (Ins. Code, \u00a7 556), and one count of attempted subornation of perjury (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664, 127).</p>\n<p id=\"pA_c\">\n<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>We address appellant\u2019s contention that his conviction of attempted subornation of perjury was error. The pertinent facts may be briefly summarized as follows: Subsequent to his arrest, appellant solicited one Killaine to procure two favorable defense witnesses at trial, and stated his willingness to pay $2,000 to each witness. Killaine contacted the police and a meeting was arranged between appellant and two undercover officers posing as potential witnesses. After the meeting, appellant and the officers went to appellant\u2019s bank where the latter tendered an initial $500 to the \u201cwitnesses.\u201d Appellant was thereupon rearrested on a charge of subornation of perjury. At the close of the People\u2019s case-in-chief, the prosecution\u2019s motion to amend the charge to attempted subornation of perjury was granted. Upon conviction on this count, appellant was sentenced to an 18 month term, such period to be served concurrently with the 6 years imposed on the remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Our discussion of this issue begins with the relevant statutes. Penal Code section 127 provides that: \u201cEvery person who willfully procures another person to commit perjury is guilty of subornation of perjury, and is punishable in the same manner as he would be if personally guilty of the perjury so procured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">Penal Code section 664 provides in pertinent part that: \u201cEvery person who attempts to commit any crime, but fails, or is prevented or intercepted in the perpetration thereof, is punishable, where no provision is made by law for the punishment of such attempts, as follows: [f] 1. If the offense so attempted is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison, the person guilty of such attempt is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for one-half the term of imprisonment prescribed upon a conviction of the offense so attempted; provided, however, that if the crime attempted is one in which the maximum sentence is life imprisonment or death the person guilty of such attempt shall be punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for a term of five, seven, or nine years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">Since an essential element of subornation of perjury is the actual commission of perjury by the witness<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ross </em>(1894) 103 Cal. 425 [37 P. 379]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 200 [62 Cal.Rptr. 304]; 2 Witkin, Cal. Crimes, \u00a7 833, p. 783), it would appear that, as respondent contends, any intentional undertaking to procure false testimony, accompanied by a direct, unequivocal act toward that end which fell short of the actual commission of perjury by the witness would be punishable as an attempt under Penal Code section 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>California case law in this area is unclear. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1883) 63 Cal. 482, 483, upon which appellant principally relies, the defendant was accused of attempting to suborn perjury. In a per curiam opinion our Supreme Court held that a demurrer to the information should have been sustained, observing that \u201c \u2018[attempting to suborn perjury\u2019 is not the generic name of any class of offenses.\u201d This sweeping declaration, however, is immediately followed and arguably vitiated by a catalogue of the particular deficiencies in the information under scrutiny: \u201cThere is nothing stated to indicate that the act of defendant would have resulted in a subornation of a witness if it had not been frustrated by extraneous circumstances [citation]; or that the testimony which defendant tried to have given was material to the issue; or that he did not believe it to be true, or, indeed, what was the testimony he asked any person to give.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 482-483.) We believe this language should be strictly interpreted as meaning that where, as in the facts of that particular case, the information alleges <em>nothing more </em>than an \u201cattempt to suborn perjury,\u201d such an information would be insufficient.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">On the other hand, in a later high court opinion we find the suggestion that such a crime is indeed cognizable under California law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coffey </em>(1911) 161 Cal. 433, 442 [119 P. 901].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And one appellate court decision has come to our attention which upheld a conviction for attempted subornation of perjury. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gray </em>(1942) 52 Cal.App.2d 620, 655, 656 [127 P.2d 72].)</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">A respected authority, while acknowledging that the case law is murky, has commented that there is \u201csome indication of a recognition\u201d of the crime of attempted subornation of perjury. (2 Witkin, Cal. Crimes, \u00a7 835, p. 785.)</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">We think this represents the better view. Certainly the People of this state have a compelling interest both in preventing corrupt interference with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>administration of justice and protecting themselves from exposure to such inducements to interfere with the solemn process of law.  And it cannot be doubted that the purpose of the law of attempt is both to penalize conduct which would have been harmful if not fortuitously prevented, and to permit intervention by law enforcement personnel before the harm has occurred, (lb) We conclude, therefore, that the general attempt statute, Penal Code section 664, is a viable and legitimate tool for the protection of the People of this state from subornation of perjury in its inchoate stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">It then remains only to determine whether, on the facts here presented and under the general concepts and principles of the law of \u201cattempts\u201d embodied in Penal Code section 664, appellant\u2019s acts had sufficiently advanced past the stage of \u201cmere preparation\u201d to the point of \u201cperpetration.\u201d We believe they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">While mere ineffectual solicitation of another to commit a crime does not of itself constitute an attempt to commit the crime <em>(Ex Parte Floyd </em>(1908) 7 Cal.App. 588 [95 P. 175]), solicitation in connection with other acts may suffice. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lanzit </em>(1925) 70 Cal.App. 498 [233 P. 816].)  Here, appellant not only solicited the attempted false testimony, but proceeded to meet the prospective perjurers at his bank and then withdrew funds as a \u201cdownpayment\u201d on the perjury. Such conduct in our view goes far beyond \u201cmere preparation,\u201d and so justifies his conviction of attempted subornation of perjury. Indeed, it is difficult to conceive of a situation, short of the actual commission of perjury itself, in which subornation of perjury could arrive closer to the point of consummation.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">Elkington, Acting P. J., and Holmdahl, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied January 26, 1984. Reynoso, J., did not participate therein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b946-14\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1155.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b947-8\">While not free from ambiguity, the definition of \u201csuborn\u201d given in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d ed. unabridged) implies consummation of the connected perjury, i.e., \u201cTo procure (another) to commit perjury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b948-7\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>63 Cal. 482, in the 100 years subsequent to its publication, has not once been cited in a California case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b948-8\">There, in a learned and lengthy discussion by Justice Henshaw on the nature of accomplice culpability, the following language appears as part of a hypothetical discussion of Penal Code section 654: \u201cAnd as specific illustrations, subornation of perjury is declared a crime punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for not less than one nor more than fourteen years.
