Despite finding the regulation invalid the trial court denied any relief to the six organizations\u2019 motions for class certification and for summary judgment. The trial court reasoned the Department would appeal and thereby obtain an appellate court decision which, if adverse, would be voluntarily extended by the Department to the entire class.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">The Legislative Scheme</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">In 1973 the Legislature enacted the In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program to enable aged, blind or disabled poor to avoid institutionalization by remaining in their homes with proper supportive services. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 12300, and as amended, Stats. 1981, ch. 69, \u00a7 16.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>To be eligible for IHSS services, a person must be poor and either over 62, blind or disabled, and unable to perform the routine daily tasks of caring for himself </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>(\u00a7 12500.) IHSS programs must enable the recipient to remain in his own home or abode of his choosing. (\u00a7 12300.)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">The Department and its director are responsible for administering the IHSS program in compliance with state and federal laws.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (\u00a7\u00a7 10600, 10553, 12301, 12301.1, 12302.) The Department promulgates regulations to implement the statutes (\u00a7\u00a7 10553, subd. (c), 10604, subd. (b), 12301.1) while the county welfare departments administer the program under the state\u2019s general supervision. The county departments process applications for IHSS assistance (MPP \u00a7\u00a7 30-009, 30-455, 30-459), determine the individual\u2019s needs and authorize services. (MPP \u00a7 30-463.1.) The county either obtains and pays the provider or pays the recipient who hires one. (MPP \u00a7\u00a7 30-464, 30-467.) Determinations are reviewable at a fair hearing before the state Department at the recipient\u2019s or provider\u2019s request. (\u00a7 10950.)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The Legislature authorized a broad range of support services to eligible persons. Section 12300 provides: \u201c[DJomestic services and services related to domestic services, heavy cleaning, nonmedical personal services, accompaniment by a provider when needed during necessary travel to health related appointments or to alternative resource sites and other essential transportation as determined by the director, yard hazard abatement, <em>protective, supervision, </em>teaching and demonstration directed at reducing the need for other supportive services, paramedical services, and other services as determined by the director <em>which make it possible for the recipient to live in comfort and safety under an independent living </em>arrangement. \u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The type and amount of service are determined on an individual basis. (MPP \u00a7 30-475.3.) The total cost for services authorized to any individual is limited by a monthly <em>maximum </em>benefit. For severely impaired persons, the sum is $838 (\u00a7 12304); $581 for others (\u00a7 12303.5.).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Until 1981 recipients were entitled to <em>all </em>services authorized by section 12300. However, the 1981 amendments provided (for the first time) a funding cap on state appropriations furnished in order to obtain federal funding for the program.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (\u00a7 12306, as amended, Stats. 1981, ch. 69, \u00a7 21.) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>amendment provided if state appropriations were insufficient to cover all authorized services, <em>specific types of services for particular groups of otherwise eligible persons should be cut before others. </em>(\u00a7 12301, as amended, Stats. 1981, ch. 69, \u00a7 17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Recipients needing more than 20 hours per week of IHSS services have an absolute right to choose their providers. (\u00a7 12304, subd. (b).) All other recipients are entitled to have their preferences followed by the county welfare department if possible. (\u00a7 12304.1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">\u201cProtective supervision\u201d services authorized by section 12300 are \u201cfor monitoring the behavior of nonself-directing, confused, mentally impaired, or mentally ill persons . . . .\u201d (MPP \u00a7 30-457.71.) Such services consist \u201cof observing recipient behavior in order to safeguard the recipient against injury, hazard, or accident.\u201d (MPP \u00a7 30-457.7.) To be eligible for such services, an individual must show \u201cthat twenty-four hour need exists . . . and that the recipient can live at home safely if protective supervision is provided.\u201d (MPP \u00a7 30-457.721.)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Some recipients are old, suffering degenerative diseases. Others are young but retarded, epileptic, blind, brain damaged or schizophrenic. The recipients cannot protect themselves from injury. Some are self-destructive. For example, one autistic, blind and brain-damaged child lapses \u201cinto seizures and temper tantrums . . . venting his frustrations by banging his head against a wall.\u201d Others cannot control normal but potentially hazardous activities such as cooking or smoking a cigarette. <em>Each person denied IHSS assistance solely under MPP sections 30.463.233c concededly needs the services by the terms of MPP sections 30-457.7 and 30.457.71.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">The \u201cproviders\u201d (termed a \u201chousemate\u201d in the glossary of the regulations (MPP \u00a7 30-453)) who live with such a totally disabled person are usually relatives. None is legally responsible to support the recipient. These relatives often offer to provide care \u201cnot voluntarily\u201d but because they cannot find anyone else who will do it as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">The Department stopped payments to housemates for IHSS in April 1979<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> if the challenged MPP section 30-463.233c conditions and exceptions were not satisfied. Under the regulation an otherwise eligible recipient, who <em>in fact needs protective supervision, is deemed not legally in need </em>if he has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>housemate at home capable of providing supervision. The regulation exempts five groups of housemates: (1) another IHSS recipient unable to provide protective supervision; (2) a person physically or mentally unable to provide supervision; (3) a child under 14 (MPP \u00a7 30-463.235(b)); (4) a landlord or tenant of the recipient; or (5) a parent who left full-time employment, or cannot obtain it, to care for his minor child and cannot find anyone else to provide supervision. (MPP \u00a7 30-463.245.)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">The state and county welfare departments have enforced MPP section 30-463.233c by terminating or denying IHSS assistance for protective supervision to thousands of totally disabled persons. Enforcement of the regulation has exacerbated the hardship of providing care at minimal pay. Some providers have given up jobs to provide care. This reduction in income\u2014 by denying payment for protective supervision\u2014has placed even greater stress on the housemate\u2019s ability to care for the recipient.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The regulation poses Hobson\u2019s dilemma. Recipients needing 24-hour protective supervision\u2014and other services\u2014are more likely to receive better continuous care from relatives living with them whose care is more than contractual. This regulation forces housemate providers to render services for less compensation than other providers by denying them payment for protective supervision. These relatives, unless they have independent funds, must subsist on the reduced IHSS grant. If the housemate is required to work outside the home as a result of the reduced grant, the aged or disabled relative may have to be institutionalized.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Pleadings and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">Plaintiffs in both lawsuits charge the regulation conflicts with state statutory provisions governing the IHSS program, with section 504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 794) and with the equal protection guarantees of the state and federal Constitutions. Plaintiffs framed their complaint in four causes of action, seeking different remedies but all based upon the invalidity of the regulation. The first three causes of action sought relief for any person harmed by its enforcement. The first cause of action, by the organizations, was for a writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. The second cause of action was a taxpayers\u2019 action for declaratory and injunctive relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 526, subdivision (a), based upon common law principles. The third cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>action, for declaratory and injunctive relief, was a class action by the organizations and an individual whose application for IHSS assistance had been denied pursuant to the regulation. The fourth cause of action, by individuals whose IHSS had been reduced under the regulation, was for a writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and Welfare and Institutions Code section 10962. Individual, not class, relief was sought in the last cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">After discovery was completed plaintiffs filed motions for class certification and for summary judgment on all four causes of action. The Department opposed the summary judgment on the grounds the regulation was valid. The Department also opposed class certification contending the organizations were not adequate representatives. Finally, the Department sought the appointment of someone to represent persons whose grants might be reduced as a result of the lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The trial court denied class certification stating three reasons: First, it was unnecessary to obtain relief for the class since an appeal in the individual case resulting in a published appellate court decision would provide relief to the class. Second, class certification would further delay consideration of the merits because prejudgment notice to prospective class members was required. Third, the only apparent purpose of the certification might be to obtain attorney fees.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">The trial court then denied the motion for summary judgment because it refused to decide the issue of the regulation\u2019s validity in any way other than by the individual\u2019s writ of mandate. The court suggested plaintiffs, as individuals, file motions for individual peremptory writs. The court reasoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>this procedure would insure a speedy binding ruling on the issue of the validity of the regulation since the loser could appeal and obtain an appellate decision. Plaintiffs appeal these adverse rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">The individual plaintiffs followed the court\u2019s advice and filed a writ virtually identical to the summary judgment motion. The Department\u2019s defenses were similar. The superior court ruled the challenged regulation was invalid under both state and federal law and granted the peremptory writ in each case but remanded the causes back to the Department to determine the plaintiff\u2019s entitlement to prospective and retroactive IHSS payments without regard to the regulation. The court awarded attorney fees. The Department appeals this award.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Class Certification</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The trial court\u2019s rule denying class certification rests upon a totally novel proposition: class action certification can be denied based upon the hope or expectation the Department will voluntarily grant class relief after an adverse appellate decision in an individual\u2019s case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We cannot find any lawful authority to support this rationale. Class members are not parties to an individual decree. They cannot enforce such decision by contempt or supplemental decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">While a trial court has broad discretion in determining class certification, its ruling will be reversed if it applies improper legal standards to deny the motion. (See <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Dart Industries, Inc., supra, 29 </em>Cal.3d 462, 470; <em>Gonzales </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 978, 984 [171 Cal.Rptr. 567].) The trial court here did not dispute plaintiffs\u2019 contention they met both the ascertainability of class and the common question requirements for class certification nor did it adopt any of the Department\u2019s reasons for denying class certification. We conclude: None of the reasons proffered by the trial court are lawful grounds for denying class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">To determine the specifics of class certification standards, we look first to Code of Civil Procedure section 382: \u201c[W]hen the question is one of a common or general interest, or many persons, or when the parties are numerous, and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court, one or more may sue or defend for the benefit of all.\u201d  Section 382 has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>construed to require an ascertainable class and well-defined community of interest in questions of law and fact. <em>(Daar </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co. </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 706 [63 Cal.Rptr. 724, 433 P.2d 732].) Trial courts should \u201cincorporate procedures from outside sources in determining whether to allow the maintenance of a particular class suit.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>(City of San Jose </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 447, 453 [115 Cal.Rptr. 797, 525 P.2d 701, 76 A.L.R.3d 1223].)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The trial court must determine whether the class is ascertainable by examining (1) the class definition, (2) the size of the class and (3) the means of identifying class members. <em>(Vasquez </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 800, 821-822 [94 Cal.Rptr. 796, 484 P.2d 964, 53 A.L.R3d 513].) Plaintiffs\u2019 class was defined as \u201call applicants, recipients and providers of IHSS in California who have been or will be disqualified from receiving or providing protective supervision based solely on MPP \u00a7 30-463.233c.\u201d This class is precisely defined, numerous, statewide and easily identifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">A class action is proper when the parties are numerous and it- is impracticable to bring them all before the court. This requirement has been satisfied where the class numbers were as few as 200 (see <em>Vasquez </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at pp. 821-822; Fed. Rules of Civ. Proc., rule 23(a)(1)), or as many as several thousand (see <em>Daar </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co., supra, </em>67 Cal.2d 695) if the members are scattered throughout the state. (See <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>order re class certification (1980) <em>approved, </em>87 F.R.D. 372 (S.D.Cal. 1980).) <em>The Department\u2019s own data showed more than 5,000 disabled persons were either terminated from or denied protective supervision under the challenged regulation from its enactment in April 1971 until April 1980. </em>Providers\u2019 housemates were equal in number.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Members of each group, providers and disabled, are scattered throughout California. The location and identity of these class members could be readily obtained from the Department\u2019s records because each IHSS applicant or recipient fills out an application for benefits and identifies his or her provider. This identification procedure has been followed in other welfare class actions. (See <em>Hypolite </em>v. <em>Carleson </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 566, 578 [125 Cal.Rptr. 221]; <em>Lowry </em>v. <em>Obledo </em>(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 14, 25 [169 Cal.Rptr. 732].)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">The second statutory requirement, a \u201ccommunity of interest\u201d turns on whether common questions of law and fact are sufficiently pervasive to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>permit adjudication in a class action rather than in a multiplicity of suits. <em>(Vasquez </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at p. 801.) This requirement is satisfied if (1) there are predominate questions of law or fact common to the class, (2) the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are typical of those of the class, and (3) the plaintiff is an adequate representative. (See <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Dart Industries, Inc., supra, </em>29 Cal.3d at p. 470; Fed. Rules of Civ. Proc., rule 23(a)(2), (3) and (4).)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The common question requirement is patently satisfied. The Department\u2019s action enforcing the challenged regulation similarly affects a large group of people. It is challenged on the identical legal grounds in each case. (See <em>Hypolite </em>v. <em>Carleson, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.3d 566, pp. 579-581.) The legal claims arise out of a common set of factual circumstances. Since 1974 housemates were paid to provide IHSS protective supervision and the IHSS recipients in need of these services were eligible to receive them notwithstanding the fact they had a housemate provider. In April 1979 the defendants promulgated and enforced MPP section 30-463.233c to deny protective supervision to otherwise eligible IHSS recipients. As a result from April 1979 to date many individuals have been terminated from and denied protective supervision services. Thus the individual plaintiffs\u2019 claims are no different in specie from those of the class.  These individuals have either been personally injured or are organizations that represent those who have been personally injured by the enforcement of the challenged regulation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The common goal of the entire class is to invalidate this regulation and to prevent its enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The persons constituting the \u201cclass\u201d in this action are similar to welfare recipients whose cases have been certified as a class action in both state and federal courts. <em>(See Lowry </em>v. <em>Obledo, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.3d 14, 20; <em>Hypolite </em>v. <em>Carleson, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.3d 566, 581; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Obledo, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d 126; and <em>Griffeth </em>v. <em>Detrich </em>(S.D.Cal. 1978) 448 F.Supp. 1137 (remanded (9th Cir. 1979) 603 F.2d 118.)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">In order for the representative to adequately represent the class, the representative\u2019s attorney must be qualified, experienced and generally able to conduct the proposed litigation. (See <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Dart Industries, supra, 29 </em>Cal.3d at p. 470.) Here plaintiffs\u2019 counsel have been recognized as experienced in class actions and government benefit litigation in many cases. (See, e.g., <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>87 F.R.D. 372; <em>Calloway </em>v. <em>Ma</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number><em>thews, </em>Unempl. Ins. Rptr. (CCH) 1 14,879, 2499-387, 2499-388 (S.D.Cal. 1976) (J.A. 72-74); <em>Griffeth </em>v. <em>Detrich, supra, </em>448 F.Supp. 1137; <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Butz </em>(N.D.Ill. 1975) 397 F.Supp. 1015, 1017.) The class is, without question, represented by counsel, qualified and experienced in welfare class actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The trial court stated, as one of its reasons for denying certification, prejudgment notice was required. This is not a requirement in welfare class actions where declaratory or injunctive relief are the primary objective. (See <em>Lowry </em>v. <em>Obledo, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.3d 14, 21, 23; <em>Gonzales </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.3d 978, 985-987; Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., rule 23(b)(2).) California decisions follow the analysis of the federal courts; prejudgment notice \u201cserves no apparent purposes\u201d in welfare class actions where there are no factual disputes and the class is adequately represented by counsel. (See <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Weinberger </em>(9th Cir. 1977) 564 F.2d 1219, 1229; Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., rule 23(b)(2).) Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief and incidental individual retroactive benefits, based solely on the invalidity of the Department\u2019s regulation. Notice to other class members is not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Finally, the trial court\u2019s observation the only purpose of certifying the class was to enable plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to recover attorney fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 is not factually supported. Even if true, this would not defeat certification if otherwise warranted. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel would be entitled to fees for each individual suit\u2014as the superior court has here ruled. Recovery of statutory attorney fees is not relevant to the issue of the adequacy of class counsel or the issue of class certification. The very purpose of the statutory attorney fees provisions is to enable counsel to take cases on behalf of persons who might not otherwise have access to lawyers or the judicial system. Whether by class action or by individual suit, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel would be entitled to fees if the suit were successful. (\u00a7 10962; <em>Burch </em>v. <em>Prod </em>(1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 987, 992 [153 Cal.Rptr. 751].)</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">In denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the first three causes of action, the trial court refused to hear or to consider the challenge to MPP section 30-463.233c made by the organization plaintiffs. In consigning the first three causes of action to legal limbo, the trial court said the relief sought was unnecessary, given the presence of the individual writs of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. As determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>above this is not a lawful basis for denying the summary judgment. California courts have uniformly recognized the rights of <em>organizations </em>to challenge the validity of state welfare Department regulations when inconsistent with state and federal law<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and to seek declaratory/injunctive relief.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">The trial court\u2019s refusal to determine the issues tendered by the organizations was error. <em>(International Aerial Tramway Corp. </em>v. <em>Konrad Doppelmayr &amp; Sohn </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 400, 404 [74 Cal.Rptr. 908, 450 P.2d 284]; <em>Loma Portal Civic Club </em>v. <em>American Airlines, Inc. </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 582, 588 [39 Cal.Rptr. 708, 394 P.2d 548].) There is no factual dispute and no triable issue of fact precluding summary judgment, therefore this court may determine that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">MPP section 30-463.233c denies IHSS financial assistance for protective supervision services whenever <em>a nonexempt housemate </em>for the recipient provides those services. Such denial appears as a matter of law to be inconsistent with (a) statutory provisions governing the IHSS program, (b) specifically delineated relative responsibility laws, (c) recipient\u2019s right-to-choose-provider provisions, and (d) carefully defined statutory priorities for limiting services when there are insufficient funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">It is a fundamental rule of law and public policy that administrative regulations \u201cmust conform to the legislative will if we are to preserve an orderly system of government.\u201d <em>(Morris </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 733, 737 [63 Cal.Rptr. 689, 433 P.2d 697].) The specific standards for testing the validity of an agency\u2019s regulation were succinctly summarized in <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 668, 679 [170 Cal.Rptr. 484, 620 P.2d 1032]: \u201cWhere a statute empowers an administrative agency to adopt regulations, such regulations \u2018must be consistent, not in conflict with the statute, and reasonably necessary to effectuate its purpose.\u2019 [Citation.] The task of the reviewing court in such a case \u2018\u201cis to decide whether the [agency] reasonably interpreted the legislative mandate.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 . . . <em>[T\\here is no agency discretion to promulgate a regulation which is inconsistent with the governing statute.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 11342.2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">In construing state statutes vis-a-vis administrative regulations, a court should look first to the language <em>(California Mfrs. Assn. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Com. </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 836, 844 [157 Cal.Rptr. 676, 598 P.2d 836]), then to the legislative history <em>(Cooper </em>v. <em>Swoap </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>856, 863-864 [115 Cal.Rptr. 1, 524 P.2d 97]) and finally to the general principles and policies underlying the statutory scheme. <em>(Id., </em>pp. 866-867.) Within the ambit of these broad principles, courts have struck down welfare regulations inconsistent with the governing statutory scheme. (See <em>Green </em>v. <em>Obledo, supra, 29 </em>Cal.3d 126, at pp. 134-140; <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Swoap, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 856, 863.)</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The regulation here under scrutiny (MPP \u00a7 30-463.233c) imposes the responsibility on all nonexempt housemates to provide uncompensated protective supervision services for eligible recipients. This blanket prohibition of payment is totally inconsistent with the specific incremental changes made by the Legislature in modifying the statutory provisions concerning the responsibility of relatives for such services.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">In 1975 the Legislature added section 12350 prohibiting any relative of a recipient from being \u201cheld legally liable to support or to contribute to the support of any applicant for or recipient of aid under this chapter.\u201d In 1979 the Legislature enacted the first of two modifications of the general no-relative-responsibility rule set out in section 12350. Section 12300 was amended to prohibit IHSS assistance to a parent of a minor child unless the parent has given up work or could not get full-time work because there was no other suitable provider. In 1981 the Legislature placed limited responsibility on one spouse to care for another by amending 12301 to read: \u201cAn able spouse who is available to assist the recipient shall be deemed willing to provide at no cost any services under this article except non-medical personal services and paramedical services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">These two amendments indicate a legislative intent to volunteer only the services of a <em>parent </em>of minor children or a spouse.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Both these classes of persons have a legal duty to support under Civil Code section 242 which had not been applied to the IHSS program under section 12350. Thus the legislative intent plainly limits the class of persons responsible for providing such services to these two specifically defined groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">The Department without hint of legal authority has extended this legislatively limited class of volunteers. The regulation rests upon the unfounded presumption that any person residing with a recipient will provide aid. This may be a convenient method of cutting costs but where such methods are inconsistent with statutory provisions, they must be invalidated as beyond the agency\u2019s power to promulgate. <em>(Cooper </em>v. <em>Swoap, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 856, 868.) For example, in <em>Waits </em>v. <em>Swoap </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 887 [115 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 21, 524 P.2d 117], the California Supreme Court struck down welfare regulations reducing grants to children who shared housing with nonneedy relatives. The rationale is in point and most persuasive here. \u201cThe objective of the challenged regulation is apparently to reduce state expenditures for AFDC children at the expense of relatives who willingly take such children into their homes. In promulgating this unauthorized measure, the department is in reality gambling that close relatives acting as caretakers will feel a moral obligation to keep an AFDC child even though the child can no longer contribute the AFDC grant which the Legislature guaranteed. If the department \u2018wins\u2019 its gamble, the state will save money but only at the expense of depriving children of essential need items and subjecting their generous relatives to unwarranted hardships. If the department loses its gamble, as is all too possible, the children will lose the close family environment sought to be achieved by the act and the state will have to pay the higher cost of foster care.\u201d <em>(Waits </em>v. <em>Swoap, supra, </em>at pp. 895-896; fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Although aimed at economy, the regulation undermines the recipient\u2019s right to choose his provider and may force recipients to accept a stranger or enter an institution. The enforcement of MPP section 30-463.233c threatens the basic policy of the IHSS program which seeks to prevent institutionalization by enabling recipients to remain at home, \u201cto live . . . under an independent living arrangement.\u201d (\u00a7 12300.) This Pyrrhic result is directly contrary to the express provision of section 12304, subdivision (b), which grants to individual recipients who need more than 20 hours per week of assistance the absolute right of \u201chiring and paying his own provider of in-home supportive services.\u201d Since 1979 section 12304.1 has required the county welfare department to give \u201cpreference\u201d to any qualified individual provider who is chosen by the recipient. The legislative purpose is to insure the least intrusion upon the recipient\u2019s privacy because the services provided involve a most intimate and personal aspect of an individual\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The regulation also conflicts with specific statutes allocating services when state funds are insufficient to cover all the authorized services under the IHSS program. The Department justifies the regulation as necessary cost cutting.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The argument fails. First, it is based on a misreading of the 1981 amendments which place a cap on state appropriations. Before 1981 the Legislature uniformly made an open-ended appropriation for the IHSS program. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>(See \u00a7 12306.1.) In 1981 a funding cap was placed in section 12306 in these words: \u201cThe obligation of the state\u2019s General Fund under this article is limited to the amount appropriated in the annual Budget Act.\u201d To deal with the \u201cpossibility\u201d the annual appropriation would not meet all the services authorized by the IHSS program the Legislature by the 1981 funding cap (\u00a7 12301 as amended) provided <em>for a reduction in services </em>following these broad priorities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">\u201c(a) Reduction in the frequency with which non-essential services are provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">\u201c(b) Elimination of non-essential service categories.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">\u201c(c) Termination or denial of eligibility to persons requiring only domestic services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">\u201c(d) Termination or denial of eligibility to persons who, in the absence of services, would not require placement in a medical out-of-home care facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-9\">\u201c(e) Per capita reduction in the cost of services authorized.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">Exceptions to these broad categories must be made on a case-by-case basis for anyone who would require out-of-home medical care or lose his employment or who is placed in a \u201clife-threatening\u201d situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">Furthermore, each county is required under section 12302 as amended to show how it would reduce services to eligible recipients in that county if expenses exceeded its budget. The Department is required to insure the county\u2019s plans \u201care in compliance with provisions of this article, including . . . Section 12301.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">These provisions make it patently clear: <em>before any reductions are authorized for services to the totally disabled, the statutory procedures must be followed. </em>The statutory priorities for service reduction must precede funding cuts. The funding cut here occurs solely because the provider lives with the recipient. This is totally out of harmony with the statutory plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-13\">Nor can the regulation be justified by the Department\u2019s general assertion it is a means of preventing fraud. In the first place there are no statutory provisions denying protective supervision because there is a possibility of fraud in the home of the recipient. Secondly, there is no factual basis in this record for singling out housemates where the same regulation authorizes payment to live-in employees hired for the sole purpose of providing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>same services. Similar fraud arguments were rejected in <em>Lowry </em>v. <em>Obledo, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.3d 14, when the Department sought to justify regulation denying child care deductions from a welfare recipient\u2019s income when the care was provided by the household. The Department\u2019s argument was: \u201c[T]o strike the regulation at issue will leave the state defenseless against fraud and collusion between the applicant and members of the applicant\u2019s household. This argument is overstated. The record reflects that the county visits each child care provider to certify the services as adequate. Such procedures do not leave the state defenseless against fraud and collusion; to the contrary, they are some protection against this ever-present possibility. \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The fraud argument should also be rejected here. Such generalized charge is no legal justification for a regulation contrary to the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Federal Law</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Finally, if the foregoing composition of law and logic is insufficient to doom the regulation, then clearly under section 504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 794) and its implementing regulations the regulation must be invalidated. It violates federal law because it denies benefits and services to a group of handicapped persons in a manner that defeats the purpose of the IHSS program. The act prohibits discrimination against qualified handicapped individuals in any program receiving federal financial assistance. Section 504 applies to the IHSS program. The program receives federal funding and all recipients needing protective supervision are \u201chandicapped\u201d under section 706(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">Enforcement of the challenged regulation denies concededly handicapped individuals necessary assistance while granting it to others who do not have providers living with them. This violates 45 Code of Federal Regulations section 84.4(b)(1) (1982).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Further they are denied the right to choose a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>provider and may be subjected to a stranger-provider or institutionalization; either defeats the basic goals of the IHSS program and the federal regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Finally the challenged regulation violates the equal protection clause of article I, section 7 of the California Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In effect the regulation creates two classes of recipients and providers. It grants to one protective supervision and denies it to the other solely because an adult lives in the same house with the recipient. Both classes of recipients need the same assistance; both classes of providers give the same care. The basis for such discrimination, does not in right reason bear any substantial relationship to the purpose of the IHSS program. The Department has shown no correspondence between the classification made by this regulation and the goals of the IHSS program.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">The matter is reversed with directions to certify the class action and to grant summary judgment as to counts one, two and three. The summary judgment granted as to the individual plaintiffs (count four) is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Brown (Gerald), P.
