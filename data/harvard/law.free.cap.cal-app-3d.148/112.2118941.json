(Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170, subd. (d).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that limitation is jurisdictional, and thus the lower court lacked authority to resentence the defendant, Raymond D. Roe, nine months after originally pronouncing sentence. Rather than dismiss Roe\u2019s attempted appeal from the judgment purportedly entered upon resentencing, we treat that appeal as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Thus reaching the merits we conclude Roe\u2019s original sentence was authorized and properly imposed and must now be completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\n<em>Factual and Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">During the course of his abortive nocturnal effort to burglarize Michele Reynolds\u2019 home, Roe severely beat Reynolds about her face and eyes. The injuries he inflicted required 22 stitches. When he committed the offense Roe was on parole from the California Rehabilitation Center where he had received treatment for drug addiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Roe pleaded guilty to first degree burglary (\u00a7 459, former \u00a7 460, subd. (1) and inflicting great bodily injury (\u00a7 12022.7) and agreed to a <em>Harvey </em>waiver <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harvey </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 754, 757-759 [159 Cal.Rptr. 696, 602 P.2d 396]) in exchange for the dismissal of three prior felony conviction allegations and a second count charging assault (former \u00a7 245, subd. (a)) and inflicting great bodily injury. (\u00a7 12022.7.) The district attorney also agreed to a maximum seven-year sentence and dismissed a two-count information (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11352) in an unrelated case arising out of Roe\u2019s participation in two cocaine transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">On October 7, 1981, the court sentenced Roe to serve seven years, consisting of a four-year middle term for the burglary conviction (\u00a7461, subd. (1) plus the three-year enhancement. (\u00a7 12022.7.) Judgment was entered the same day committing Roe to prison. At the October 7 hearing the court said it was sentencing Roe \u201c. . . pursuant to 1170(d) of the Penal Code which does allow a modification if the Department of Corrections or if I decide to change the term upon the recommendation.\u201d On March 31, 1982, at an ex parte hearing the court issued an order to produce Roe for resentencing at a hearing to be held in May. Counsel for both the prosecution and defense attended the March 31 hearing. On April 23 the Department of Corrections filed a diagnostic study and evaluation of Roe as requested by the court. The unanimous recommendation of the department\u2019s study team was that no change be made in Roe\u2019s sentence and commitment. At a hearing on June 11 with Roe and both counsel in attendance the court set a \u201cmodification hearing\u201d for July 8, 1982, and ordered the preparation of a supple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>mental probation report. In accordance with that report\u2019s recommendation, the court resentenced Roe on July 8 to a seven-year term identical to that originally imposed. Roe filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment entered on July 8. Although the record does not clearly reflect when the court recalled Roe\u2019s sentence and commitment, it appears the court took those steps at the March 31 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">As a general rule, when a defendant is committed and execution of his sentence begins the trial court loses jurisdiction to reconsider a denial of probation <em>(Holder </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 779, 783 [83 Cal.Rptr. 353, 463 P.2d 705]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Calhoun </em>(1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 494, 497 [140 Cal.Rptr. 225]) or to vacate or modify the sentence imposed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McAllister </em>(1940) 15 Cal.2d 519, 526-527 [102 P.2d 1072], disapproved on another ground in <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 521, 534 [342 P.2d 889]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clinton </em>(1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 284, 288 [52 Cal.Rptr. 221].)  There are, however, some exceptions to the rule. Trial courts, for instance, have the authority to correct clerical errors in recording sentences and judgments <em>(In re Candelario </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 702, 705 [91 Cal.Rptr. 497, 477 P.2d 729]) and the obligation to correct the imposition of a sentence unauthorized by law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Massengale </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 689, 693 [89 Cal.Rptr. 237].)</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Section 1170, subdivision (d) represents a limited statutory exception to the general rule. That section provides in pertinent part: \u201c(d) When a defendant subject to this section or subdivision (b) of Section 1168 has been sentenced to be imprisoned in the state prison and has been committed to the custody of the Director of Corrections, <em>the court may, within 120 days of the date of commitment on its own motion, </em>or at any time upon the recommendation of the Director of Corrections or the Board of Prison Terms, recall the sentence and commitment previously ordered and resentence the defendant in the same manner as if he had not previously been sentenced, provided the new sentence, if any, is no greater than the initial sentence. ...\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">The predecessor to section 1170, subdivision (d) was former section 1168. (Stats. 1969, ch. 990, \u00a7 1, pp. 1959-1960; see generally <em>People </em>v. <em>Gainer </em>(1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 636, 639-640, fn. 3 [184 Cal.Rptr. 120].) That section also authorized the trial court, under certain circumstances, to recall a sentence and commitment and to resentence a defendant on its own motion within 120 days of commitment. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The 120-day limitation on the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>ception allowed by former section 1168 was jurisdictional and could not be circumvented by successive invocations of that section\u2019s recall and resentencing authority. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Calhoun, supra, </em>72 Cal.App.3d at p. 497.) The trial court could exercise such authority only within the first 120 days of the original commitment. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">We think <em>Calhoun's </em>strict jurisdictional interpretation of former section 1168\u2019s 120-day limitation should apply to the corresponding limitation of section 1170, subdivision (d). The statutory language on its face indicates the trial court\u2019s authority to recall and resentence may only be exercised within the first 120 days of the original commitment. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Laue </em>(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 1055, 1060 [182 Cal.Rptr. 99] (dictum).) Such an interpretation is consistent with legislative intent. <em>Calhoun </em>was decided shortly after the Legislature amended section 1170 to conform the language of subdivision (d)\u2019s 120-day limitation to the corresponding language of former section 1168. (Compare Stats. 1977, ch. 165, \u00a7 15, p. 648 with Stats. 1969, ch. 990, \u00a7 1, p. 1960.) On five occasions after <em>Calhoun's </em>publication the Legislature amended section 1170 without changing the language of subdivision (d)\u2019s 120-day limitation. (Stats. 1978, ch. 579, \u00a7 29, p. 1989; Stats. 1979, ch. 255, \u00a7 8, p. 550; Stats. 1980, ch. 676, \u00a7 251, p. 1985; Stats. 1980, ch. 1117, \u00a7 7, p. 3596; Stats. 1981, ch. 1111, \u00a7 1, p. 4336.) The Legislature\u2019s repeated reenactment of that language without change indicates it intended <em>Calhoun\u2019s </em>strict jurisdictional interpretation would apply to section 1170, subdivision (d). <em>(People </em>v. <em>St. Martin </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 524, 535 [83 Cal.Rptr. 166, 463 P.2d 390]; <em>Property Research Financial Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 413, 421-422 [100 Cal.Rptr. 233].) Any other interpretation allowing the trial court open-ended authority to vacate or modify a valid sentence would infringe on the power of the Legislature to establish a determinate sentencing system providing statutorily fixed terms for given crimes to be imposed by courts with limited discretion to vary those terms. (See \u00a7 1170, subd. (a)(1); <em>People </em>v. <em>Tanner </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 514, 519, fn. 3 [156 Cal.Rptr. 450, 596 P.2d 328].)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Here, the Department of Corrections recommended no change be made in Roe\u2019s sentence and commitment, and the trial court\u2019s purported recall and resentencing occurred more than 120 days after Roe\u2019s original commitment. Consequently, the trial court was without jurisdiction to resentence Roe on July 8, 1982. Roe argues the People waived this jurisdictional defect by failing to raise it at the hearings held on March 31, June 11 and July 8, 1982. This argument overlooks the fact the court was without subject matter as well as personal jurisdiction once the first 120 days passed. (See <em>In re Black </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 881, 888-891 [59 Cal.Rptr. 429, 428 P.2d 293]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Helton </em>(1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 987, 991 [154 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>482].)  Subject matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred on the court by the consent of the parties. <em>(In re Griffin </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 343, 346-347 [62 Cal.Rptr. 1, 431 P.2d 625]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(1961) 198 Cal.App.2d 460, 464-465 [18 Cal.Rptr. 164].)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Having concluded the 120-day limitation of section 1170, subdivision (d) is jurisdictional, we must now determine the proper manner for disposing Roe\u2019s appeal. Had the trial court resentenced Roe within the 120-day period, Roe could have appealed his new sentence by timely filing a notice of appeal. (\u00a7 1237, subd. (1); <em>People </em>v. <em>Flores </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 85, 93, fn. 6 [115 Cal.Rptr. 225, 524 P.2d 353].) However, because the court acted after the 120 days had passed and thus lacked jurisdiction to resentence Roe, the judgment the court purportedly entered on July 8, 1982, is of no effect and cannot be appealed. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Behrmann </em>(1949) 34 Cal.2d 459, 462 [211 P.2d 575].) Appellate courts routinely dismiss attempted appeals from nonappealable judgments and orders. (See, e.g., <em>id.., </em>at pp. 462, 464; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clinton, supra, </em>243 Cal.App.2d at p. 288.)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">In light of the procedural history of this case, a routine dismissal of Roe\u2019s appeal would be manifestly unjust. Because the trial court invoked section 1170, subdivision (d) at his original sentencing, Roe reasonably waited to file a notice of appeal until after the court resentenced him. To dismiss Roe\u2019s appeal now would, in effect, deprive him of his right to appeal.  (See \u00a7 1237, subd. (I).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Roe should not be foreclosed from challenging the validity of His sentence where he reasonably relied on the lower court\u2019s misunderstanding of its jurisdictional authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Rather than dismiss, we shall treat Roe\u2019s appeal as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.  Such petitions may be brought to challenge judicial acts in excess of jurisdiction. (\u00a7 1487, subd. (1); <em>In re Brown </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 612, 624-625 [108 Cal.Rptr. 465, 510 P.2d 1017].)  Trial court probation and sentencing decisions must be grounded on a proper exercise of judicial discretion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Russel </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 187, 194-195 [70 Cal.Rptr. 210, 443 P.2d 794]; see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Bolton </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 208, 216-218 [152 Cal.Rptr. 141, 589 P.2d 396]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Giminez </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 68, 71-73 [120 Cal.Rptr. 577, 534 P.2d 65].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>When based on an abuse of discretion, as Roe contends was the case here (see part III, <em>post), </em>such decisions are acts in excess of jurisdiction. (See <em>Neal </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1960) 55 Cal.2d 11, 16-17 [9 Cal.Rptr. 607, 357 P.2d 839], cert, den., 365 U.S. 823 [5 L.Ed.2d 700, 81 S.Ct. 708]; <em>Abelleira </em>v. <em>District Court of Appeal </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 280, 287-291 [109 P.2d 942, 132 A.L.R. 715]; see also Witkin, Cal. Criminal Procedure (1963 &amp; 1983 supp., pt. 1) Habeas Corpus and Other Extraordinary Writs, \u00a7\u00a7 805, 808.)  Treatment, therefore, of Roe\u2019s appeal as a habeas corpus petition is appropriate in this case. (Compare <em>People </em>v. <em>Olken </em>(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 1064, 1067-1068 [178 Cal.Rptr. 497].)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\n<em>Ill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Turning to the merits, Roe argues the lower court abused its discretion when it denied him probation. Alternatively, Roe argues the court abused its discretion by failing either to strike the additional punishment for the great bodily injury enhancement (\u00a7 1170.1, subd. (h) (former subd. (g)); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 445)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or to impose the lower rather than the middle term for his burglary conviction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (\u00a7 1170, subd. <em>(b); </em>rule 439(b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">A sentencing court must state adequate reasons for denying probation and imposing the middle term. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Salazar </em>(1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 992, 1000 [167 Cal.Rptr. 38]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Mobley </em>(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 320, 324 [188 Cal.Rptr. 583].) In denying probation here the court acknowledged Roe\u2019s remorse (rule 414(d)(9)) but noted the seriousness of his <em>offense </em>(rule 414(c)(1)), the vulnerability of his victim (rule 414(c)(2)), the injuries he inflicted (rule 414(c)(4)), his prior record of criminal convictions (rule 414(d)(1)) and his parole status when he committed the oifense. (Rule 414(d)(2).) The court further found the circumstances in aggravation and mitigation were equal.  Sentencing courts have wide discretion in weighing aggravating and mitigating factors <em>(People </em>v. <em>Evans </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 1019, 1022 [190 Cal.Rptr. 633]), and may balance them against each other in qualitative as well as quantitative terms. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lambeth </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 495, 501 [169 Cal.Rptr. 193].) The record shows the court fully considered the many factors argued by both the prosecution and the defense, and then reached a reasonable assessment of their relative weight. On that basis the court did not abuse its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>discretion by denying probation<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and imposing the middle term. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Evans, supra, </em>141 Cal.App.3d at p. 1022.) Absent circumstances in mitigation of the additional punishment (\u00a7 1170.1, subd. (h); rule 445), the court also did not abuse its discretion by failing to strike the three-year term for the great bodily injury enhancement. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hughes </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 452, 463-464 [169 Cal.Rptr. 364].) Roe\u2019s October 7, 1981, sentence was authorized (\u00a7\u00a7 461, subd. (1), 12022.7) and properly imposed (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Peace </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 996, 1001-1002 [166 Cal.Rptr. 202]) and must now be completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Writ denied; defendant to complete service of sentence originally imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Brown (Gerald), P.

(\u00a7 1237.5; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 31(d).) Challenging the validity of a sentence or a sentencing procedure after entry of the plea is one such circumstance. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Holland </em>(1978) 23 Cal.3d 77, 83, fn. 5 [151 Cal.Rptr. 625, 588 P.2d 765]; see also Witkin, Cal. Criminal Procedure (1983 supp., pt. 1) Appeal, \u00a7 639E, subds.

That sentence, of course, cannot be appealed. (See part II, <em>ante.) </em>However, because Roe\u2019s two sentences were identical, we treat his arguments as being addressed to the sentence imposed on October 7, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b118-7\">From the time Roe entered his guilty plea to the time the court purportedly resentenced him, everyone in the system\u2014the court, the probation officer, the Department of Corrections, the prosecution, defense counsel and various defense experts\u2014has assumed Roe\u2019s eligibility for probation. Apart from brief references in passing to rule 416(b) in defense counsel\u2019s statement in mitigation and argument at resentencing, the first instance where anyone squarely addresses the possibility Roe might be ineligible for probation unless his is an unusual case (\u00a7\u00a7 462, subd. (a), 1203, subds. (e)(3) and (e)(4)) appears in Roe\u2019s opening brief on appeal. Discussion of the possibility Roe might be absolutely ineligible for probation (\u00a7 1203.075, subd. (a)(6)) appears nowhere at all. Because the record amply supports the lower court\u2019s decision on the merits to deny probation, we will not at this late stage consider either of the above possibilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
