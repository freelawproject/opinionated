City appeals from a judgment declaring that a property tax override levied by resolution of the Oakland City Council (Council) designated \u201c1981 Pension Liability Fund\u201d is void and unconstitutional as contravening article XIII A of the California Constitution, and also from a subsequent order awarding Valentine attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The issue presented here is whether the tax levy falls within the tax limitation exemption provided in section 1, subdivision (b), of that article for \u201ctaxes or special assessments to pay the interest and redemption charges on any indebtedness approved by the voters\u201d prior to the effective date of the section. We hold that the tax levy was authorized and hence constitutional under the above mentioned section and subdivision to the extent that such levy applied to fund two of the three pension systems designated to receive the revenues generated by the resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">In a special municipal election held on December 21, 1926, Oakland voters approved an amendment to the city charter by which the Oakland Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS) was established for aged and disabled city employees. On November 5, 1968, the voters adopted a new city charter, section 809 of which authorized the City to \u201ccontinue as a contracting agency\u201d in any existing retirement or pension systems.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>In 1951, two preexisting pension funds were combined to form the Police and Fire Retirement System (PAFRS). With adoption of the new city charter on November 5, 1968, PAFRS became part of article XXVI of that charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">On September 1, 1970, City, through the action of the Council, passed Ordinance No. 8202 CMS, which authorized and approved a contract between the City and the Board of Administration of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (PERS). Action on the contract was delayed by a preliminary injunction issued in the case of Van Fleet et al. v. City of Oakland et al., Alameda Superior Court Action No. 403056, until after judgment in the case on June 1, 1972, quashing the preliminary injunction and upholding the contract as authorized by section 809 of the charter (see fn. 2, <em>ante). </em>The Council thereafter amended the contract several times by resolution and ordinance. Then, on May 11, 1976, the Council passed a resolution of intention to approve a contract amendment which, among other things, removed the contract\u2019s prior exclusion of local fire and police employees as to such of those employees hired for the first time on or after July 1, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">On June 8, 1976, city voters approved \u201cMeasure R,\u201d a charter amendment affecting sections of article XXVI of the charter dealing with PAFRS. Among other things, the measure amended the definition of \u201cmembers\u201d under the system to exclude those fire and police employees hired on or after July 1, 1976.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Various newspaper articles appeared prior to the election, describing the effect of the measure as forcing uniformed police and fire personnel hired in the future into the state retirement system.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">In the statewide primary election of June 1978, the voters adopted Proposition 13, a property tax reform initiative, which added article XIII A to the California Constitution. Section 1 of the article provides, in part: \u201c(a) The maximum amount of any ad valorem tax on real property shall not exceed one percent (1%) of the full cash value of such property. . . . [f] (b) The limitation provided for in subdivision (a) shall not apply to ad valorem taxes or special assessments to pay the interest and redemption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>charges on any indebtedness approved by the voters prior to the time this section becomes effective.\u201d Section' 1 became effective on July 1, 1978. (Cal. Const., art. XIIIA, \u00a7 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">On August 4, 1981, the Council passed Resolution No. 59916 CMS, which in part fixed and levied a tax of 0.1566 percent on taxable real and personal property within the City. Of that amount, the figure 0.1530 percent was designated in the resolution for a \u201c1981 Pension Liability Fund.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By another resolution, passed on March 2, 1982 (after the instant action was filed), the Council created a fund so denominated. City\u2019s 1981-1982 Budget Summary showed an expected $8.3 million from the 0.1530 percent override.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Valentine filed a petition for declaratory relief (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 4808) on January 8, 1982, challenging the constitutionality of Resolution No. 59916 CMS insofar as it levied a tax override of 0.1530 percent for the \u201c1981 Pension Liability Fund\u201d (hereinafter sometimes pension fund). An alternative writ of mandate issued on February 25th. On April 9, 1982, following a hearing, the trial court entered its order and judgment, declaring the 0.1530 percent pension fund tax override levied by the resolution void and unconstitutional as contravening article XIII A of the state Constitution. On May 13, 1982, upon motion of Valentine brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, the court awarded Valentine attorney fees of $9,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">On May 10, 1982, our Supreme Court filed its opinion in <em>Carman </em>v. <em>Alvord </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 318 [182 Cal.Rptr. 506, 644 P.2d 192], Thereafter, <em>on </em>May 13th, City noticed motions to set aside the order and judgment of April 9, 1982, and to vacate or set aside the May 13th order allowing attorney fees, based on the <em>Carman </em>decision. By an order filed on May 27, 1982, the trial court denied both motions on grounds that the court lacked jurisdiction to set aside the April 9th judgment, since it was not a void judgment (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 473), and that the attorney fee award premised on that judgment was therefore not incorrect or erroneous (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 663, subd. 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Timely appeal was taken by City on June 8, 1982, from the April 9th judgment and from the May 13th order awarding attorney fees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We granted the City\u2019s motion to advance the case on calendar.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The central question posed is whether the pension fund tax override is authorized, and hence valid, under section 1, subdivision (b) of article XIII A of the California Constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> City takes the position that (1) the decision in <em>Carman </em>v. <em>Alvord, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d 318, is dispositive of the tax\u2019s validity, and (2) if not, then application of the section 1, subdivision (a) tax limitation to invalidate the override would constitute an impairment of the obligation of contract in violation of the federal Constitution. Respondent counters that the <em>Carman </em>decision does not require validation of the override and that the contract clause of the federal Constitution would not be offended by invalidation of the tax. Respondent further urges that the tax, while designated for the \u201c1981 Pension Liability Fund,\u201d is in reality \u201cnothing more than a subterfuge for a general unrestricted levy,\u201d and he asks for additional attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\"><em>The City\u2019s Pension Obligations Are </em>\u201cIndebtedness\u201d <em>Under the Constitution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">We first examine article XIII A. Subdivision (b) of section 1 provides that the 1 -percent-of-full-cash-value limitation (subd. (a)) \u201cshall not apply to ad valorem taxes or special assessments to pay the interest and redemption charges on any indebtedness approved by the voters prior to [July 1, 1978].\u201d Thus the ad valorem tax levied by the City was authorized if the revenue it generates will go to pay (1) the \u201cinterest and redemption charges\u201d on (2) \u201cany indebtedness approved by the voters\u201d prior to July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>1, 1978. We are compelled by the Supreme Court\u2019s construction of that language in <em>Carman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The court in <em>Carman </em>held that an ad valorem tax levied by the City of San Gabriel in order to meet the city\u2019s obligations to PERS came within the voter-approved prior indebtedness exemption of article XIII A. The local electors had in 1948 (long before Prop. 13) approved a ballot measure authorizing the city to join the State Employees\u2019 Retirement System (now PERS) and also to \u201clevy and collect annually ... a special tax sufficient to raise the amount estimated by [the city council] to be required to provide sufficient revenues to meet the obligations of [the city]\u201d to PERS. (31 Cal.3d 318, 322 &amp; fn. 2.) Exercising that authority, the city contracted with PERS and collected annual taxes to fund its contributions. At issue in <em>Car-man </em>was a tax levied for 1978-1979 (after the effective date of Prop. 13) to defray the city\u2019s PERS obligations. (Pp. 322-323.)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Rejecting arguments that the term \u201cany indebtedness\u201d as used in the tax limit exemption (\u00a7 1, subd. (b)) was limited to bonded or secured indebtedness, and that the phrase \u201cinterest and redemption charges\u201d did not include pension fund obligations, the court in <em>Carman </em>held that \u201cindebtedness as traditionally understood covers obligations arising under City\u2019s pension plan\u201d (pp. 326-327) and concluded that \u201c \u2018interest and redemption charges\u2019 denotes no more or less than the sums from time to time necessary to avoid default on obligations to pay money, including those for pensions.\u201d (P. 328, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">In the instant case, City\u2019s three pension systems and the nature of its obligations to those systems appear not to differ in any material respect from the pension and obligations considered in <em>Carman. </em>Valentine makes no attempt to distinguish that aspect of <em>Carman </em>and thus apparently concedes the point.  We therefore conclude that, for purposes of the subdivision (b) exemption, the City\u2019s obligations arising under OMERS, PAFRS and PERS constitute \u201cindebtedness\u201d and that sums paid by the City to avoid defaulting on those obligations constitute the payment of \u201cinterest and redemption charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\"><em>One of the Pension Systems\u2014PERS\u2014Was Never </em>\u201c <em>Approved by the </em>Voters\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">The next issue is voter approval. The exemption applies only to taxes levied to pay obligations on indebtedness \u201capproved by the voters\u201d prior to July 1978. There is no dispute as to two of the systems. Both OMERS and PAFRS were at some point submitted to the electorate for approval\u2014 OMERS in a 1926 special municipal election charter amendment, and PAFRS by adoption of the new city charter in 1968. (See fn. 2, <em>ante.) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Although the record does not contain either the 1926 OMERS charter amendment or evidence of any voter approval of PAFRS prior to its authorized <em>continuation </em>in the 1968 charter, Valentine does not challenge the approval of those systems. He does, however, argue that PERS was never voter-approved. The City responds that PERS was \u201cinferentially approved\u201d by the voters\u2019 adoption of the 1976 charter amendment, Measure R.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">As far as the record and arguments of counsel reveal, the PERS system was never directly submitted to City voters. From the initial approval and authorization of the contract in 1970 to the effective date of Proposition 13, all action on PERS was taken by the Council, acting without voter approval, pursuant to its authority under section 809 of the charter to join retirement or pension systems. (See fn. 2, <em>ante.) </em>City does not argue that the general authority granted by section 809 is enough to render PERS voter-approved.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rather, it maintains that voter approval of Measure R in 1976 (before Prop. 13), amending the charter to exclude future uniformed fire and police hirees from PAFRS, was inferentially an approval of PERS because the consequence of excluding such hirees from PAFRS was to channel them into PERS. The Council preordained that consequence when, prior to and in anticipation of Measure R passing, the Council (without voter approval) amended the City\u2019s PERS contract to lift its prior exclusion of uniformed police and fire personnel from the system. Nothing in the election materials presented to the voters\u2014the full text of Measure R, the ballot summary (fn. 3, <em>ante), </em>printed arguments for and against, or analyses by the city attorney and city auditor\u2014directly indicates that future hirees would enter PERS or any other system.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">We conclude that the City has failed to demonstrate prior voter approval of PERS. The voters never had the opportunity to accept or reject the system. It was never directly submitted for voter approval, and the implication of approval from Measure R\u2019s passage is too attenuated. To say that the voters, in passing Measure R, knew that they were effectively shifting future hirees from PAFRS into some other system begs the question. Into what other system would they go? The voters had never approved PERS and many may not even have known of it. The City argues that contemporary accounts in newspaper articles informed voters of the inevitable PAFRS-to-PERS shift. But that argument depends on speculative assumptions we are unwilling to make regarding voter reading habits; moreover, the newspaper accounts relied on by the City only briefly, and for the most part obliquely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>mention the PAFRS-PERS impact.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Also, the packaging of Measure R, if anything, underplayed the measure\u2019s impact on other retirement systems. The measure was described as a tax saving reform in printed arguments, the city attorney\u2019s legal analysis, the city auditor\u2019s financial analysis, and in the newspaper articles. Savings to PAFRS was emphasized without explanation that some of that savings would be offset by increased obligations under another system. It would be unfair under these circumstances to infer voter approval of PERS from a \u201cyes\u201d vote on Measure R.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Since we hold that there was not the required voter approval of PERS, there remains a question expressly left open in <em>Carman. </em>The Supreme Court, in that case, declined to \u201cdecide how pension taxes authorized only by the governing body of a local agency might be treated.\u201d (31 Cal.3d 318, 333.) However, the court in <em>Carman </em>did observe: \u201cSubdivision (b)\u2019s focus on voter approval implies a concern that irrevocable, long-term obligations, <em>solemnly approved by local electorates </em>and entered on faith in taxing powers then available, not be frustrated by a revolutionary tax limitation imposed from outside the community. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 327-328; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Whatever imprecision and ambiguity may exist elsewhere in the language of article XIII A <em>(Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 208, 245 [149 Cal.Rptr. 239, 583 P.2d 1281]), the language of section 1, subdivision (b) requiring voter approval is clear and in no need of construction. The Constitution requires voter approval for any exception to the maximum amount of any ad valorem tax on real property. Therefore, we hold that the City\u2019s obligations under PERS do not constitute indebtedness \u201capproved by the voters\u201d for purposes of subdivision (b) exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\"><em>The Subdivision (b) Exemption Does Not Require Voter Approval of the Specific Tax Levy, Voter Approval of the </em>\u201cIndebtedness\u201d <em>Is Sufficient</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Respondent urges that it is necessary for purposes of the subdivision (b) exemption that the voters previously approve not only the \u201cindebtedness\u201d but also the specific tax levied to fund that indebtedness from year to year. There is no question but that the voters did not approve the specific override levied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">A reading of the exemption language lends no support to Valentine\u2019s position. \u201cThe limitation provided for in subdivision (a) shall not apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>ad valorem taxes or special assessments to pay the interest and redemption charges on any indebtedness approved by the voters . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1, subd. (b).) The meaning is clear: Once the indebtedness is found to have had the voters\u2019 prior approval, ad valorem taxes etc. to pay the obligations arising thereunder are exempt, and there is no express requirement that such taxes need also be voter approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">However, Valentine finds support for his argument that both the indebtedness and the tax need prior voter approval, not in the language of the Constitution, but in words of amplification by our Supreme Court in <em>Car-man. </em>He also relies on the fact that in cases cited by the court in <em>Carman, </em>the voters of the local agency had obtained the approval of the voters as to the specific tax levy in question prior to the effective date of Proposition 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">In <em>Carman, </em>the voters had approved a ballot proposition prior to July 1978 empowering the city not only to participate in the retirement system (PERS) but also to <em>levy and collect annually </em>a special tax sufficient to meet the city\u2019s obligations to the system. (31 Cal.3d 318, 322 &amp; fn. 2.) Valentine cites to several places in the <em>Carman </em>opinion where the court\u2019s language suggests that a second voter approval\u2014of the specific tax levy\u2014is required. In particular, he relies on the following conclusions reached by the court on page 333: \u201cWe conclude that subdivision (b) exempts from the article XIII A tax limitation the <em>voter-approved tax </em>to fund City\u2019s pension commitments. [f] . . . Here we conclude . . . that section 1, subdivision (b) of article XIII A exempts from the tax limit those pensions <em>and corresponding tax levies approved by the voters </em>before the limitation became effective. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">We reject the notion that the Supreme Court, by the above quoted language, was engrafting upon the exemption a second voter approval requirement. The issue of whether a second approval is necessary was not before the court. Thus, for example, where the opinion states, \u201cHere, we conclude only that [subdivision (b)] exempts from the tax those pensions and corresponding tax levies approved by the voters . . .\u201d (31 Cal.3d 318, 333; italics added), the court appears to be simply tailoring its holding to the particular facts before it.  \u201cLanguage used in any opinion is of course to be understood in the light of the facts and the issue then before the court, and an opinion is not authority for a proposition not therein considered. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ginns </em>v. <em>Savage </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 520, 524, fn. 2 [39 Cal.Rptr. 377, 393 P.2d 689].)</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">For the same reason, we are persuaded that cases relied on in <em>Carman </em>are of little value on the question of second voter approval. In <em>County of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number><em>Shasta </em>v. <em>County of Trinity </em>(1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 30 [165 Cal.Rptr. 18], voters approved a proposal to create a joint community college district <em>and, </em>while not assuming the prior district\u2019s bonded indebtedness, to pay an annual use charge for its property \u201cin an amount equal to the amount necessary for the interest and redemption of the old district\u2019s bonds.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 35, 38.) In <em>Kern County Water Agency </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 874 [158 Cal.Rptr. 430], county voters approved a contract between the Department of Water Resources and the Kern County Water Agency (Agency) <em>plus </em>an ad valorem property tax levy for any year in which the Agency could not raise sufficient funds by other means to pay its obligations as they came due. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 877-878.) Therefore, neither <em>County of Shasta </em>nor <em>Kern County Water </em>posed the question of whether a second voter approval is required, and hence neither case is instructive on the issue. A post <em>-Carman </em>case to have considered the issue of prior voter approval, <em>City of Watsonville </em>v. <em>Merrill </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 185 [136 Cal.Rptr. 857], is similarly not helpful because there the voters approved, by charter amendment, a retirement system (PERS) <em>along with </em>a provision enabling the city to levy and collect additional taxes as needed to meet all liabilities due or to become due in the ensuing fiscal year. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 189-190.)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">While the particular holding in <em>Carman </em>regarding prior voter approval is, as we have explained, not directly helpful because of the distinguishable facts presented therein, the court\u2019s observation regarding subdivision (b)\u2019s implied \u201cconcern that irrevocable, long-term obligations, solemnly approved by local electorates and entered on faith in taxing powers then available, not be frustrated by a revolutionary tax limitation from outside the community\u201d (31 Cal.3d 318, 327-328) supports the view of the City\u2014that second voter approval is not required unless, of course, the local agency otherwise lacks authority to levy the specific tax from year to year. That view is also consistent with the plain language of the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">It is undisputed that appellant City, as a charter city exercising powers conferred by the home rule provision of the California Constitution (art. XI, \u00a7 5, subd. (a); see <em>Weekes </em>v. <em>City of Oakland </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 386, 390 [146 Cal.Rptr. 558, 579 P.2d 449]), had authority to levy the tax override here at issue, provided its actions were constitutional under article XIII A. (See <em>Weekes </em>v. <em>City of Oakland, supra, </em>at p. 400 (cone. opn. of Richardson, J.); <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>City of Fresno </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 132, 135 [98 Cal.Rptr. 281, 490 P.2d 793]; <em>Bellas </em>v. <em>City of Eureka </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 336, 345-346 [71 Cal.Rptr. 135, 444 P.2d 711].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>\n                   We therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>hold the City was not required by section 1, subdivision (b), of article XIII A to obtain prior voter approval for the tax levy insofar as the levy was apportioned to pay the City\u2019s obligations under PAFRS and OMERS, both of which systems constitute voter-approved prior indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\n<em>Application of the Subdivision (a) Tax Limitation in This Case Would Not Result in a Demonstrated Unconstitutional Impairment of the Obligation of Contract</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">If the tax levy as it pertains to PERS is invalid as not exempt from the 1 -percent-of-full-cash-value limitation of article XIII A, would such a declaration of invalidity unconstitutionally impair the City\u2019s obligation under the PERS contract? (U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Our Supreme Court has twice noted this potential constitutional problem of which the City complains and has declined both times to reach the question. In <em>Carman, </em>the city, as here, argued \u201cthat article XIII A, if construed to repeal City\u2019s special pension tax, might so impair pension rights as to violate the federal contract clause,\u201d and the court observed that \u201c[substantial issues of that nature\u201d were present, reasoning as follows; \u201cCases have held that when a municipality was authorized to contract and to levy a corresponding tax, the tax power could not be revoked until the contract was fulfilled. [Citations.] This court has said that \u2018[t]he pension provisions of a city charter or ordinance form an integral part of the employment contract.\u2019 Where feasible they should be construed as providing adequate funds to meet employees\u2019 reasonable expectations. [Citation.]\u201d (31 Cal.3d 318, 332, quoting from <em>Bellus </em>v. <em>City of Eureka, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d 336, 351.) Resolution of the case in the city\u2019s favor, however, rendered the question unnecessary to decide in <em>Carman. </em>In <em>Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>22 Cal. 3d 208, the court had earlier considered the potential contract clause problem inherent in article XIII A but ultimately found the issue to be prematurely raised and raised by a party with doubtful standing. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 238-242.)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">We find the following comment of the court in <em>Amador </em>equally applicable here. \u201c[Ajrticle XIII A on its face neither directly repudiates any express covenant with municipal obligees nor immediately impairs any contract right. . . . [T]he federal contract clause (art. I, \u00a7 10) applies only to a \u2018substantial impairment of a contractual relationship. \u2019 [Citation.] In the absence of a factual record disclosing any <em>present, specific and substantial impair-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number><em>merit </em>of contract attributable to the adoption of article XIII A, we must reject petitioners\u2019 impairment of contract challenge because it is premature. \u201d (Italics added.) <em>(Amador, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 208, 241, quoting from <em>Allied Structural Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Spannaus </em>(1978) 438 U.S. 234, 244 [57 L.Ed.2d 727, 736, 98 S.Ct. 2716]; see also <em>Energy Reserves Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kansas Power &amp; Light Co. </em>(1983) 459 U.S. 400, 411-412 [74 L.Ed.2d 569, 580-581, 103 S.Ct. 697, 704-705]; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Board of Administration </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 114, 119 [192 Cal.Rptr. 762, 665 P.2d 534].) Although <em>Amador </em>was decided just shortly after the effective date of article XIII A, when the article\u2019s effects could not be definitely determined, we face a similar problem here because, upon this record, we are unable to perceive any \u201cpresent, specific and substantial impairment\u201d of the City\u2019s obligations under PERS resulting from partial invalidation of the tax levy.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">The City points out that Oakland, along with other local governments throughout the state, is feeling the pressure of the constitutional tax limitation, \u201cbail-out\u201d funds are no longer available, extensive cutbacks in services have been made and additional sources of revenue are gradually being exhausted. However, nothing in the record or briefs suggests an impending inability to meet PERS obligations without resort to property tax overrides.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">First, the record is silent as to how much of the $8.3 million expected from the override was destined for PERS funding. For all that appears, perhaps none of it was specifically earmarked for that system. Indeed, the City describes the levy in its opening brief as \u201can additional property tax which would raise the approximate sum of $8,300,000 to pay a portion of the City\u2019s required contribution to PAFRS.\u201d That characterization may, however, merely reflect the City\u2019s paramount concern for PAFRS, its greatest liability at present in light of its commitment through the Measure R charter amendment to fully fund that system\u2014a $400 million commitment\u2014 by the year 2016. (See fn. 3, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">That raises the second point of uncertainty here should the tax limitation be allowed to invalidate PERS funding through the override. The City relies in large part upon the declaration of its retirement systems manager, which declaration limits analysis to uniformed police and fire personnel in PERS, even though the record discloses that nonuniformed personnel also come within PERS. City contributions for such uniformed personnel, according to the declaration, total $25,761,417 for fiscal year 1981-1982, of which only $1,179,471 is required for PERS. It is apparent that the total $8.3 million at stake in the override\u2014of which an undisclosed portion is destined for PERS\u2014is roughly only one-third of the City\u2019s total obligation, and that total is for uniformed personnel alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Third and finally, the record does not show dependence on a property tax override to meet PERS funding obligations prior to the 1981-1982 attempted levy. In its opening brief, the City states that \u201cit was not until the 1981-82 fiscal year that the Council concluded . . . that the additional property tax for retirement fund purposes should be levied rather than further substantial cuts in service being made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">Upon this record, the City\u2019s contract clause claim must fail for lack of a demonstrable impairment. (See <em>Kern County Water Agency </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>96 Cal.App.3d 874, 880 [contract clause claim based on article XIII A rejected where record did not establish that obligation could not be met without the use of ad valorem taxes or assessments].)</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\n<em>The Motives of the Council in Levying the Override Were Presumptively Proper</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">As a further contention, Valentine suggests that the City\u2019s resolution levying the override for a \u201c1981 Pension Liability Fund\u201d is in fact an unrestricted general tax levy designed to overcome the then recent defeat of Measure A, submitted to the electors on April 21, 1981, as the \u201cOakland Anti-Crime Act of 1981.\u201d The measure, proposed as a \u201cspecial tax\u201d under section 4 of article XIII A, failed to get the requisite two-thirds vote of the electors.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If passed, it would have generated anticipated net revenues of $37,240,000 over a four-year period ending in June 1985 with which to increase the number of Oakland Police Department personnel, maintain the existing level of police services and administer the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">An analogous contention was raised and rejected in <em>National Independent Business Alliance </em>v. <em>City of Beverly Hills </em>(1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 13 [180 Cal.Rptr. 59]. There, on the eve of Proposition 13\u2019s effective date, the city council passed an urgency ordinance to become effective that same day, and the appellant therein argued that the ordinance should not take effect until 30 days after its adoption because it was not truly an urgency ordinance but rather an avowed attempt to avoid recourse to the two-thirds vote requirement of article XIII A for special taxes. (See fn. 11, <em>ante.) </em>The appellate court stated: \u201c[E]ven if that had been the council\u2019s secret intent rather than its express intent, it would be irrelevant if the council had the power to enact at the time that it did. \u2018The motives of a city\u2019s legislative body in passing an ordinance will not ordinarily be considered in determining its validity, in the absence of a showing of fraud, at least where nothing on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>face of the ordinance shows that it was passed for improper motives, or where its passage for improper motives is not inferable from its operation or effect under circumstances of which judicial notice may be taken. There is a presumption that the legislative body acted from proper motives.\u2019 (45 Cal.Jur.3d, Municipalities, \u00a7 202, pp. 320-321.)\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 22.) The court in <em>National Independent </em>concluded that it could not properly take judicial notice of what \u201cunusual and current\u201d expenses might justify the urgency of the ordinance. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">In the instant case, we have concluded that the City had authority to levy the tax override for OMERS and PAFRS by resolution of its Council. Certainly nothing on the face of the resolution shows an improper motive, and no such motive appears inferentially through its operation or effect. The defeated Measure A did not purport to provide pension system funding as did the later resolution. Thus, there is no appearance of subterfuge in the adopting of the resolution. The presumptive propriety of the Council\u2019s motives has not been overcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">We similarly find no improper purpose behind the City\u2019s decision to show the \u201c1981 Pension Liability Fund\u201d in the police department budget for fiscal year 1981-1982. Which accounting method is chosen for budgetary purposes seems of little relevance; certainly the City\u2019s obligations to PAFRS (for fire and police personnel) make the police department budget a logical choice. If respondent objects to what he anticipates will be an unauthorized use of pension fund tax revenues, his concern is premature, as is any remedy at this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Respondent asks that in the event the judgment is affirmed, we remand for consideration of an award of attorney fees on appeal for services rendered in securing a substantial constitutional benefit upon City taxpayers. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1021.5; <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Priest </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49-50 [141 Cal.Rptr. 315, 569 P.2d 1303].) As we will modify and affirm the judgment, remand for such consideration is appropriate. (See <em>Parrott </em>v. <em>Rogers </em>(1980) 103 Cal.App.3d 377, 383 [163 Cal.Rptr. 75].)</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">We conclude that the 0.1530 percent tax levied by the City through Resolution No. 59916 CMS is valid as exempt under section 1, subdivision (b), of article XIII A of the California Constitution from the property tax limitation of section 1, subdivision (a), to the extent that such tax will go to fund the City\u2019s 1981-1982 fiscal year obligations to OMERS and PAFRS, systems which were approved by the voters prior to the effective date of article XIII A. Because we further conclude that PERS was not voter-ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>proved within the meaning of the subdivision (b) exemption, the tax levy is invalid insofar as it funds obligations arising under PERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Accordingly, the first sentence of paragraph three of the judgment of April 9, 1982, is modified in part to read as follows: \u201c. . . City of Oakland Resolution No. 59916 CMS and the tax levied thereby in the amount of 0.1530% for the 1981 Pension Liability Fund are declared void and unconstitutional as in contravention of article XIIIA of the California Constitution to the extent that they allow tax revenues generated thereby to be used to fund obligations of the City of Oakland to the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System.\u201d As so modified, the judgment is affirmed, and the cause is remanded to the superior court to fix and award reasonable attorney fees, if any, to respondent Valentine for services rendered on this appeal (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1021.5). The order of May 13, 1982, awarding attorney fees' and costs is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Kline, P.
