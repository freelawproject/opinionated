They had been married throughout his active military career. Relying upon the authority of <em>McCarty </em>v. <em>McCarty </em>(1981) 453 U.S. 210 [69 L.Ed.2d 589, 101 S.Ct. 2728], <em>passim, </em>the superior court had adjudged Donald\u2019s military pension to be his <em>separate property. </em>Jean has appealed from the interlocutory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">Pending the appeal, Congress enacted (effective Feb. 1, 1983) the Uniformed Services Former Spouses\u2019 Protection Act, title 10 of the United States Code section 1408, hereafter the Act. \u201cThe [Act] overrules <em>McCarty, </em>stating \u2018a court may treat disposable retired or retainer pay payable to a [retired military] member for pay periods beginning after June 25, 1981, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>either as property solely of the member or as property of the member and his spouse in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction of such court.\u2019 . . . California law treating military retirement pensions as community property is no longer preempted. The act\u2019s legislative history clearly indicates Congress\u2019 intent to abrogate all applications of the <em>McCarty </em>decision. ...\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Buikema </em>(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 689, 691 [188 Cal.Rptr. 856].)</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Donald argues that the Act does not, as to him, operate retroactively. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The judgment here under appeal is not final. In the clearest of language, the Act (subd. (c)(1)) provides that a state\u2019s courts \u201cmay treat disposable retired or retainer pay payable to a member for pay periods beginning after June 25, 1981, either as property solely of the member or as property of the member and his spouse in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction of such court.\u201d The manifest intent is that the Act shall apply to all retirement or retainer pay for periods beginning after June 25, 1981. Such a legislative intent that a law operate retroactively must be respected by the courts. <em>(Mannheim </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 678, 686 [91 Cal.Rptr. 585, 478 P.2d 17]; <em>San Diego White Truck Co. </em>v. <em>Swift </em>(1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 88, 92 [157 Cal.Rptr. 745].)</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">We accordingly hold that the Act operates retroactively as to retirement or retention \u201cpay periods beginning after June 25, 1981.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Nor is merit seen in Donald\u2019s contention that the Act does not apply to a retired military member\u2019s \u201cretainer\u201d pay, i.e., for being subject to recall to active duty \u201cat any time.\u201d As will be noted, the Act, subdivision (c)(1), expressly covers \u201cretired or <em>retainer </em>pay.\u201d (Our italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">The judgment is reversed as to the superior court\u2019s determination in respect of respondent Donald Lockstrom\u2019s military retired or retainer pay; in all other respects it is affirmed. The superior court will take further proceedings according to the Act and existent law. Appellant will recover her costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">Racanelli, P. J., and Newsom, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied January 5, 1984.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
