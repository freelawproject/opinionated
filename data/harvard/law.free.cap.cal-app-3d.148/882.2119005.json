B, as amend. 9/13/82 by Ord. 0-15810 N.S.)</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">By demurrer in municipal court, Strand challenged the ordinance for violating the First Amendment and for unconstitutionally establishing a monopoly for existing businesses. The municipal court overruled Strand\u2019s demurrer. Strand then brought a motion to dismiss which was denied as being without statutory basis. Following these denials, Strand sought a writ of prohibition in superior court. The superior court denied the writ and Strand appeals.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Strand contends the ordinance is unconstitutional because its restrictions impose a substantial and significant burden on the exercise of a First Amendment right without furthering a sufficiently significant city interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">In <em>Young </em>v. <em>American Mini Theatres </em>(1976) 427 U.S. 50 [49 L.Ed.2d 310, 96 S.Ct. 2440], the United States Supreme Court upheld a Detroit ordinance very similar to the one at bar. The Supreme Court held such a dispersal regulation was justified by an interest in preserving the character of its neighborhoods. Under <em>American Mini Theatres, </em>a dispersal of adult entertainment establishments is constitutional if not motivated by an improper distaste for the speech involved, does not act to severely restrict First Amendment rights and is supported by a sufficient factual basis. (See <em>Developments in the Law\u2014Zoning </em>(1978) 91 Harv.L.Rev. 1427, 1557-1559.)</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">The stated purpose of the San Diego City Ordinance is provided in Code section 101.1800, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-8\">\u201cIt is the purpose of this Division to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the continued concentration of adult entertainment establishments, as defined herein, within The City of San Diego.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-9\">\u201cIt is the intent of this Division that the regulations be utilized to prevent problems of blight and deterioration which accompany and are brought about by the concentration of adult entertainment establishments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>The ordinance, by its language, thus does not appear to be motivated by a distaste for the speech- itself, but by a desire to preserve neighborhoods, a goal upheld by the United States Supreme Court in <em>American Mini Theatres, supra, 421 </em>U.S. 50, at pages 71 to 72 [49 L.Ed.2d at page 327], While the city did not set forth any factual basis for the ordinance, the factual basis supporting zoning laws requiring dispersal or deconcentration has been developed by testimony in other cases. Lawmakers in one locale should not be denied the benefit of the wisdom and experience of lawmakers in another community (see <em>County of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 448, 455 [187 Cal.Rptr. 154]). Accordingly, contrary to Strand\u2019s contention, it was not necessary for the City of San Diego to independently establish a factual basis to support the ordinance as applied to local conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">Strand asserts the ordinance severely restricts First Amendment rights because its effect is to limit the availability of sites to establish new adult motion picture theaters to less than one percent of the land within the city and that a significant percentage of those sites are not suitable for adult motion picture theaters.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">In <em>Young </em>v. <em>American Mini Theatres, supra, </em>427 U.S. 50, the plurality noted the Detroit dispersal ordinance was only a slight burden on the First Amendment because \u201c[t]here are myriad locations in the City of Detroit which must be over 1000 feet from existing regulated establishments.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 71-72, fn. 35 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 327], quoting from the district court opinion, 373 F.Supp. 363, 370 (E.D.Mich. 1974).) However, the plurality also pointed out \u201c[t]he situation would be quite different if the ordinance had the effect of suppressing, or greatly restricting access to, lawful speech.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 72, fn. 35 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 327].)</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Since <em>American Mini Theatres, </em>a number of courts have invalidated zoning regulations which have acted to severely restrict or eliminate access to adult entertainment. Strand cites these cases as showing the trial court erred in overruling the demurrer. Procedurally, however, all of these cases are distinguishable since none involved the review of a demurrer to a criminal complaint.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n                   A demurrer lies only to correct defects appearing on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>face of the complaint (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1004; Witkin, Cal. Crim. Procedure, \u00a7 236, p. 220).  Moreover, here there is no properly admitted evidence in the record on which to consider Strand\u2019s factual assertions. Thus, our review is limited to determining whether the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face, not whether it is unconstitutional as applied.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Strand also attacks the ordinance as being unconstitutionally restrictive in its definition of an adult motion picture theater, especially when considered in conjunction with the definition of a general motion picture theater.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">An adult motion picture theater is defined as \u201can establishment ... in which a <em>substantial portion of the total presentation time </em>is devoted to the showing of material which is distinguished or characterized by an emphasis upon the depiction or description of \u2018specified sexual activities\u2019 or \u2018specified anatomical areas\u2019 for observation by patrons.\u201d (Code \u00a7 101.1801.4; italics added.) A \u201cgeneral motion picture theater\u201d is defined, in pertinent part, as \u201c[a] building or part of a building intended to be used for the specific purposes of presenting entertainment as defined herein, . . . provided, however, that <em>any such presentations </em>are not distinguished or characterized by an emphasis on the depiction or description of \u2018specified sexual activities\u2019 or \u2018specified anatomical areas\u2019 in that any such depiction or description is only incidental to the plot or story line.\u201d (Code \u00a7 101.1801.15; italics added.) Strand argues these two definitions provide the exhibition of one \u201cadult\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> film could make the theater an \u201cadult motion picture theater\u201d subject to the ordinance. This, of course, would be unconstitutional since a zoning regulation based upon a single isolated presentation of an adult film would fail to further the city\u2019s asserted interest in preserving the character of its neighborhoods <em>(Pringle </em>v. <em>City of Covina </em>(1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 151, 161-162 [171 Cal.Rptr. 251]).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>In the municipal court, Strand asserted the ordinance was void for vagueness and in response, the municipal court exercised its power to subject the ordinance to a narrowing construction (see <em>American Mini Theatres, supra, </em>427 U.S. 50, 61 [49 L.Ed.2d 310, 320-321]). Making this construction, the municipal court ruled the phrase \u201csubstantial portion of the total presentation time\u201d referred to both an individual film and all the films presented, and concluded that both must be over 50 percent. The municipal court went on to rule that percentage of adult to nonadult films should be measured over a month-long period.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">We believe the only interpretation necessary is to construe the phrase \u201csubstantial portion of the total presentation time\u201d in Code section 101.1801.4 to mean a preponderance of the total number of the films exhibited are adult films. In <em>Kuhns </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 369, at page 376 [181 Cal.Rptr. 1], we held \u201csubstantial and significant portion\u201d lacks clarity, but if over half of the adult bookstores\u2019 stock is adult, then the adult portion is both substantial and significant; and if the board of supervisors intended a different standard, it should have said so. While the language of this ordinance does not require a finding of significant as well as substantial, we can apply the same rule of interpretation at this stage of the proceedings where we are not presented a factual setting (see <em>Pringle </em>v. <em>City of Covina, supra, </em>115 Cal.App.3d 151, 160-161). Additionally, as determined by <em>Pringle </em>which examined an ordinance using essentially the same language as we consider here,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cadult films under the ordinance include only films whose dominant or predominant character and theme is the depiction of the enumerated sexual activities or anatomical areas\u201d (115 Cal.App.3d 151, 160). Thus, to fall within the definition of an adult motion picture theater under the ordinance then applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>ble, a preponderance of the films shown must have as their dominant or predominant character and theme the depiction of the \u201cspecified sexual activities\u201d or \u201cspecified anatomical areas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Code section 101.1801.15, defining a general motion picture theater which Strand argues would make a theater subject to regulation for the showing of a single adult film, is also subject to a constitutional interpretation. It is apparent that in section 101.1801.15 the city intended to exclude from the definition of a general motion picture theater those theaters exhibiting films, etc., which would otherwise categorize the theater as an adult motion picture theater. This is shown by section 101.1801.15\u2019s use of language to describe adult films which is parallel to language used in section 101.1801.4. Strand contends the use of the phrase \u201cany such presentations,\u201d used in the general motion picture theater definition, means any one presentation of an adult film would make the theater an adult motion picture theater. Such an interpretation, however, ignores the city\u2019s use of the plural (presentations) and the obvious intent of the ordinance to apply only to adult motion picture theaters. \u201cAny such presentations\u201d may reasonably be construed to refer to section 101.1801.4\u2019s \u201csubstantial portion of the total presentation time\u201d and thus act to exclude from the definition of a general motion picture theater those theaters which qualify as adult theaters. Under this construction, the ordinance is not unduly restrictive.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Strand\u2019s argument that less drastic means are available to accomplish the ordinance\u2019s objectives is similarly meritless. This case fits within the characterization of <em>Young </em>v. <em>American Mini Theatres, supra, </em>427 U.S. 50, by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Schad </em>v. <em>Mount Ephraim, supra, </em>452 U.S. 61, at page 76 [68 L.Ed.2d 671 at page 685], as one which does \u201cnot purport to approve the total exclusion from the city of theatres showing adult, but not obscene, materials. ... the number of regulated establishments [is] not limited and . . . \u2018the situation would be quite different if the ordinance had the effect of suppressing, or greatly restricting access to, lawful speech.\u2019 427 U.S., at 71, n. 35.\u201d The ordinance is sufficiently narrowly drawn, and fits within the holding of <em>American Mini Theatres, supra, </em>427 U.S. 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The purported appeal is dismissed and the writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Brown (Gerald), P.

However, under the amended section this court has discretion to review such an order upon petition for an extraordinary writ. In light of the timing of the notice of appeal in this case, 62 days after the amended statute\u2019s effective date, we choose to treat the appeal as a writ petition (see <em>Andrus </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 1041, 1049 [192 Cal.Rptr. 341]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b737-7\">In its offer of proof, Strand would present maps showing areas available for adult motion picture theaters to be substantially limited to unsuitable locations.
