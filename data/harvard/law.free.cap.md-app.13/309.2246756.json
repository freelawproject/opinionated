Burch, Attorney General, Milton B. Allen, State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City, </em>and <em>Thom,as Howard, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City, </em>on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b332-12\">Gilbert, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aq7Q\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">In August of 1970, Mrs. Dorothy Jones [Mrs. Jones], the mother of the appellant, Jether Maryland Jones, III, [appellant], went to the Northern District Police Station and requested that appellant be arrested for violation of the narcotic laws. A warrant was obtained for appellant\u2019s arrest and Mrs. Jones, the lessee of the house in which she, appellant, age 20, and her two daughters resided, gave permission to the police to search her home. The appellant slept in the small bedroom on the second floor front of the house. He paid neither room nor board. Mrs. Jones stated that she would go into her son\u2019s room \u201cto wake him up or something like that, but not to stay in.\u201d She did not clean his room. When Officer Charles Tinker, Officer Weber and another policeman went to Mrs. Jones\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>home, accompanied by her, she opened the door. The appellant was in the living room of the house. He was informed of the warrant for his arrest for possession of narcotic paraphernalia and placed under arrest. The police officers then commenced a search of the house. Appellant offered no objection to the search. In the bedroom used by appellant, \u201c* * * on top of the bed was some of this paraphernalia right in plain view as you go down the hallway.\u201d Officer Tinker observed a can of lactose, which he testified is used \u201cto mix with heroin.\u201d In the room the police recovered the lactose, \u201c312 glassine bags, nylons, one strainer, two pieces of nylons, and two playing cards and eight brown bags.\u201d The appellant, testifying in his own behalf, said that, \u201cI did have them in my possession, a bag, but its contents, I didn\u2019t, you know, because I didn\u2019t go into the bag. I was holding the bag for a friend of mine.\u201d He identified the friend to the court. \u201cWhen they [the police officers] was telling me about the other paraphernalia, I had no idea what he was talking about until he mentioned the bag, and then I got to thinking back to the bag * * Appellant said the bag just \u201cset\u201d in the foyer and later in the basement. \u201c* * * two or three days prior to my arrest, I move the bag * * * and just put it on my top bunk bed.\u201d The room that appellant occupied was equipped with bunk beds. He acknowledged he was a user of drugs and stated he applied for assistance from the Maryland Drug Abuse Authority shortly before his arrest. He was, however, arrested before he was able to avail himself of the Authority\u2019s services. He acknowledged that he had had the bag in his possession, containing all the paraphernalia, for seven or eight months, but he said he never looked inside it.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Following his conviction in the Criminal Court of Baltimore before Judge Charles D. Harris, in a bench trial, on a charge of possession of narcotic paraphernalia, appellant received a four year sentence. Later the term was reduced to three years, eight months, so as to reflect credit for the time spent in confinement prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Appellant mounts a three-pronged attack on the judgment of the Criminal Court of Baltimore. He says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">1. The warrantless search of his room was unconstitutional; hence the fruits obtained from that search are inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">2. There was no legally sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">3. The statute under which he was convicted [Article 27, \u00a7 287 (d)] is unconstitutionally ambiguous in prohibiting the possession of certain common articles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">The appellant argues firstly that the search of his room was unconstitutional. Of course, if the search fails on constitutional grounds, the evidence derived from that search would likewise fail. Appellant states, \u201cThe officers in this case having made their arrest then proceeded to search, not only the area in which the appellant was arrested, but the entire house.\u201d This act, he says, violates the doctrine set forth in <em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 U. S. 752, 89 S. Ct. 2034, 23 L. Ed. 685 (1969). <em>Chimel </em>provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-10\">\u201cArrest does not justify routinely searching any rooms other than that in which the arrest occurs, or searching through desk drawers or other closed or concealed areas in the room itself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">Additionally, he relies upon <em>Reeves v. Warden, The Maryland Penitentiary, </em>346 F. 2d 915 (1965). Neither is controlling here. In <em>Chimel, </em>there was an objection to the police officers \u201clooking around,\u201d and in <em>Reeves </em>permission to search the premises rented by the sister of Reeves was given by Reeves\u2019 mother who was, like Reeves, a guest in the sister\u2019s home. <em>Here, Mrs. Jones, the lessee of the entire house, gave permission to the officers to search her home. </em>She testified that she gave the permission and it is not disputed that she did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States does not prohibit all searches. Its protec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>tion is afforded against \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures\u201d and a search and seizure is not unreasonable if grounded upon valid consent. However, when as here, a consensual search is effected, the courts must look to the circumstances surrounding the search in order to ascertain the validity <em>vel non </em>of the consent. The reasonableness of any search depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case. <em>Maxwell v. Stephens, </em>229 F. Supp. 205, 210 (1964) ; <em>United States v. Rabinowitz, </em>339 U. S. 56, 70 S. Ct. 430, 94 L. Ed. 653.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">\u201cThe search of the petitioner\u2019s room by the police officers was conducted without a warrant of any kind, and it therefore \u2018can survive constitutional inhibition only upon a showing that the surrounding facts brought it within one of the exceptions to the rule that a search must rest upon a search warrant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stoner v. California, </em>376 U. S. 483, 84 S. Ct. 889, 11 L. Ed. 2d 856 (1964).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">It is argued that appellant\u2019s mother could not validly authorize the search of her son\u2019s room. However, there is authority that a parent may consent to a search of a child\u2019s living quarters if the child is living at home. <em>Maxwell v. Stephens, supra; McCray v. State, </em>236 Md. 9, 202 A. 2d 320 (1964) ; <em>Rees v. Peyton, </em>341 F. 2d 859 (1965); <em>Commonwealth v. McKenna, </em>202 Pa. Super. 360, 195 A. 2d 817 (1963) ; <em>United States ex rel. McKenna v. Myers, </em>232 F. Supp. 65 (1964). See also the cases collected in 31 A.L.R.2d 1081-1083.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">In <em>United States ex rel. Puntari v. Maroney, </em>220 F. Supp. 801, 806 (1963), it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">\u201cThe immunity from unreasonable searches and seizures being personal, an accused cannot obj ect to the searching of another\u2019s premises, particularly that of his parents, if the latter consent to the search.\u201d 31 A.L.R.2d 1081.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">Cases holding contrary to the general rule usually turn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>on a factual finding that there was no real consent because of the parents\u2019 ignorance of their constitutional protection, or because they were coerced into allowing the search, <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>179 F. Supp. 478 (1959),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or the person authorizing a search has lacked the authority to do so. <em>Reeves v. Warden, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">There is no contention in the instant case that the consent of Mrs. Jones was other than freely, intelligently, specifically and unequivocally given.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">In <em>McCray v. State, supra, </em>McCray\u2019s father, after being informed of the purpose for the police officers\u2019 visit to his home, granted permission to the officers to search the premises. He explained to the police that his son only stayed there occasionally and \u201cconducted them to the sun parlor where the son slept when he was there.\u201d In response to a challenge to the search, the Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">\u201cAs an owner and co-occupant of the house, the father was entitled to give such consent and to bind his son in so doing. * * * It appears that what the police did was not unlawful since a search by permission is one of the exceptions to the general rule that reasonable searches must be made under a valid search warrant. $ $ $ \u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">The Supreme Court of Minnesota in <em>State v. Kindernan, </em>271 Minn. 405, 136 N.W.2d 577 (1965) had before it a case wherein a father who owned a house gave consent to a search of the bedroom used by his 22 year old son. In response to an attack on the search, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-10\">\u201cBut in this case the consent was given by the father who did not wish to have property on his premises which did not belong there, and who joined with law enforcement officers in de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>termining if such a fact were true. We can agree that the father\u2019s \u2018house\u2019 may also be that of the child, but if a man\u2019s house is still his castle in which his rights are superior to the state, those rights should also be superior to the rights of children who live in his house. We cannot agree that a child, whether he be dependent or emancipated, (defendant was 22 years of age at the time of his arrest) has the same constitutional rights of privacy in the family home which he might have in a rented hotel room. In considering the reasonableness of a search of a home when the search is consented to by the father, the protection afforded to the child must be viewed in light of the father\u2019s right to waive it.\u201d Certiorari denied. 384 U. S. 909, 86 S. Ct. 1349, 16 L. Ed. 2d 361.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Appellant\u2019s mother had the sole control, power and superior right to exclude others, including the appellant, from her home, and also from the very bedroom that the appellant used. It was her free and voluntary choice to allow the police to search her house. <em>Maxwell v. Stephens, supra, State v. Kinderman, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Under the circumstances of this case \u2014 a minor child living at home, not paying room and board, and interposing no objection to his mother\u2019s authorization of a search of the bedroom utilized by him \u2014 we hold the search was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Since no objection was offered by appellant to the search, we do not in this opinion reach the question as to the validity <em>vel non </em>of the search had he interposed an objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Judge Harris properly denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">Secondly, appellant argues that the evidence was legally insufficient to convict. He contends that his explanation of possession, coupled with his cavalier method of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>storing the paraphernalia, should create a reasonable doubt as to his intentions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">\u201cThe test of the sufficiency of the evidence in a case tried before the court without a jury is whether the evidence, if believed, either shows directly or supports a rational inference of the facts to be proved, from which the court could fairly be convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offense charged.\u201d <em>Coward v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 127 (1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The judgment of the lower court in a non-jury case will not be set aside on the evidence unless clearly erroneous. Rule 1086. An examination of the record fails to reveal that Judge Harris was erroneous at all, much less clearly erroneous. He was not required to believe the appellant\u2019s explanations. See <em>Rice v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 552 (1970) ; <em>Munger v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 710 (1969) ; <em>Wilson v. State, 7 </em>Md. App. 41 (1969), and <em>Ball v. State, 7 </em>Md. App. 219 (1969). The evidence was legally sufficient to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Lastly, the appellant contends that the statute under which he was convicted [Art. 27, \u00a7 287 (d)] is unconstitutionally vague. This question of the possible ambiguity of the statute was not raised or decided below, and is not properly before us. Maryland Rule 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"AUB\">In <em>Vuitch v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 389, 398 (1970), we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-10\">\u201cOf course, nothing is better settled than the rule that a question as to the constitutionality of a statute will not be considered on appeal when not properly raised and decided by the lower court. <em>Luthardt v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 251; <em>Iozzi v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 415; <em>Woodell v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 433.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-11\">. There it was held that the record was devoid of \u201cclear and positive testimony\u201d showing \u201ca consent that is \u2018unequivocal and specific\u2019, \u2018freely and intelligently given.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
