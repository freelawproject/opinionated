Murphy presiding, of murder in the first degree, without capital punishment, and attempted robbery with a deadly weapon. Under the murder conviction, the appellant was sentenced to serve the balance of his natural life under the jurisdiction of the Department of Correctional Services. The appellant was also sentenced to a concurrent term of fifteen (15) years for the conviction of attempted robbery with a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">On this appeal, the appellant contends that the trial court erred in permitting a witness to refresh his recollection from a memorandum without first requiring the State to lay a foundation for the use of the memorandum. At trial the evidence produced by the State showed that on June 2, 1970, just after midnight, Bernard Wesley Mitchell was shot and killed with a shotgun in the 3400 block of Walbrook Avenue in Baltimore. Several coins of United States currency were found near the body. Through a witness, Joseph A. Johnson, the State attempted to show that the appellant had made an admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>sion to Johnson that he had shot Mitchell while attempting to rob the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The pertinent part of Mr. Johnson\u2019s testimony is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-6\">BY MRS.

So I asked him did he mean the man in the junction, and he said, \u2018yeah\u2019, and then after that I just changed the conversation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-25\">BY MRS. O\u2019CONNOR:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-26\">\u201cQ. Now, what was his condition when he was talking to you?

When you got into the bedroom, what, if any, conversation did you have in there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-10\">A.

O\u2019CONNOR:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-16\">\u201cQ. What was he saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-17\">A. He was just showing me the shotgun and just showed it to me and I told him, why didn\u2019t he take it and put it up because there were children in the house and he might forget it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-18\">\u201cQ. What else did he say to you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-19\">A. That was it. He just walked out of the room and that was the last time I saw him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-20\">After Johnson testified as to the conversation between himself and the appellant in the bathroom, the State then asked the witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>\u201cQ. Mr. Johnson, did you give a statement to the police on June the 2nd, 1970?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">MR. McALLISTER: I object to this, your Honor, unless she intends to impeach her own witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">THE COURT: I\u2019ll sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">MRS.

O\u2019CONNOR: Your Honor, I intend to give the statement to the witness to refresh his memory as to what he told the police on that day. I would quote the <em>Holiday </em>case as being on point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-13\">THE COURT: What is the Holiday case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-14\">MRS. O\u2019CONNOR: I don\u2019t have the citation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-15\">THE COURT: Very well. Please return to your tables . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-16\">(Whereupon the attorneys returned to their respective trial tables.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-18\">THE COURT: We are going to take about a five-minute recess. The jury may retire to the jury room. I have to admonish you, please do not discuss this case among yourselves until you are finally given the case for your consideration. You may retire to the jury room. It\u2019s only going to take about five minutes or so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-20\">(Whereupon the jury was excused.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-21\">THE COURT: Mr. Johnson, you are under oath, so please do not discuss anything <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>during the recess, do you understand ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">(Whereupon a five-minute recess was taken.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">(Whereupon Court resumed.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-9\">(Whereupon the jury returned to the courtroom.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-10\">THE COURT: Mr. McAllister, I\u2019ll overrule your objection to the last question. Will you ask the question again, Mrs. O\u2019Connor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-11\">BY MRS. O\u2019CONNOR:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-12\">\u201cQ.

This was given in the Homicide office and taken by Detective Herman Ingram and Detective Walter Sheppard, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-15\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-16\">\u201cQ. And the statement was given approximately four days after the shooting at Walbrook Junction, is that correct, the 6th of June?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-17\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-18\">\u201cQ. And would your memory be better then as to the events of June the 2nd or today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-19\">MR. McALLISTER: Of course, I object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-20\">THE COURT: I\u2019ll sustain the objection to that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-21\">BY MRS. O\u2019CONNOR:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-22\">\u201cQ. Mr. Johnson, I\u2019m going to show you a five page typewritten statement and ask you if on the fifth page if that is your signature ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-23\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>\u201cQ. Now, I\u2019ll ask you please to read these five pages a\u00a7 initialed by you on each and every page as you are sitting there now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">A. (Witness so complied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">\u201cQ. Now, Mr. Johnson, would you please tell the jury what, if any, conversation you and Mr. Askins had in the bathroom on the morning of June the 2nd?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">MR. McALLISTER: Objection. The question has been asked and answered, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-9\">THE COURT: Are you referring to the bathroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-10\">MRS. O\u2019CONNOR: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-11\">THE COURT: I\u2019ll overrule the objection. Did you have any further conversation besides that which you have already testified to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-12\">THE WITNESS: What I told in that statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-13\">THE COURT: Has the statement refreshed your recollection concerning the conversation ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-14\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-15\">THE COURT: All right, then, ask the question, Mrs. O\u2019Connor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-16\">BY MRS. O\u2019CONNOR:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-17\">\u201cQ. Mr. Johnson, what other conversations did you and Mr. Askins have on the morning of June 2nd?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-18\">A. You want me to start at first?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-19\">\u201cQ. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-20\">A. He said that. He said that he had to kill the man, and I said, \u2018Do you mean the one up in the Junction?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yeah\u2019, and then \u2014 and then he said that Sylvia Dorsey went to the bar and picked him up and.brought him around to the apartment building and him and Gene Morris <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>was supposed to rob him and then the man put \u2014 when the man got mad at him, he put his hand in his pocket. When Frank pointed the gun at him the man put his hand in his pocket and threw some change on the ground and told him, \u201cIf you want it, there it is\u2019, and then he put his hand back in his pocket and he said, \u2018You better hope your gun is loaded because mine is\u2019, and Frank said that\u2019s when he shot him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\">\u201cQ. Did you see Mr. Askins after that morning of June the 2nd?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-7\">A. Not until the 1st of July.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-8\">\u201cQ. When you left Goldie Jackson\u2019s that night, do you know where Mr. Askins was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-9\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-10\">\u201cQ. What time, if you remember, did Mr. Askins leave Goldie\u2019s house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-11\">A. I don\u2019t know. He took the gun out of the bedroom and went downstairs and then that\u2019s when I got the other two girls and we just walked on out the front door I didn\u2019t see him any more.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">The standards for the admission of a memorandum into evidence as past recollection recorded and those for the use of a memorandum to revive present recollection differ. The former is an exception to the hearsay rule where the memorandum is actually admitted into evidence as substantive evidence. Unfortunately, some courts have tended to lump the two together under the heading of \u201crefreshing recollection\u201d and have applied the same standards to both. However, the foundation necessary to use a memorandum to revive present recollection differs from that for the use of past recollection recorded. Past recollection recorded is where \u201ca witness, who is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>either devoid of a present recollection or possessed of an imperfect present recollection, desires to use a past recollection. This he proposes to do by employing some record of his past recollection.\u201d <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>(3rd Ed.), Sec. 734. The authorities are in general agreement, as to past recollection recorded, that to introduce the memorandum into evidence there must be a showing that the witness identifies the memorandum as made immediately after or contemporaneously with the event and that the memorandum is a correct statement of those facts which the witness recorded. <em>Wigmore, supra, </em>Secs. 734-747; <em>Hall v. State, </em>223 Md. 158, 176; 125 A.L.R. 3; 82 A.L.R.2d 465. Stated succinctly, in order to introduce past recollection recorded, the general rule is that it is necessary to adduce from the witness \u201c(a) that he at one time had personal knowledge of the facts, (b) that the writing was, when made, an accurate record of the event, and (c) that after seeing the writing, he has not sufficient present independent recollection of the facts to testify accurately in regard thereto.\u201d <em>Kinsey v. Arizona, </em>49 Ariz. 201, 65 P. 2d 1141 at 1148, cited with approval in <em>Hall v. State, supra, </em>at 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Present recollection revived, on the other hand, is the use by a witness of some writing or other object to refresh his recollection so that he may testify about past events from present recollection. <em>Wigmore, supra, </em>Sec. 758; <em>McCormick on Evidence, </em>Sec. 9. In the instant case, it is clear we are dealing with present recollection revived. Mr. Johnson, after reading the statement, testified as to what he presently remembered about past events. Further, the statement was never introduced into evidence. Generally, the authorities agree that none of the limiting rules for past recollection recorded have any bearing on present recollection revived and that any writing whatever is eligible for use. On the other hand, the authorities are in agreement that in certain circumstances the expedients for stimulating recollection may be so misused that the witness may put before the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>that which purports to be, but is not in fact, his recollection and knowledge and that, therefore, any writing whatever, in the circumstances, may become improper. <em>Wigmore, supra, </em>Sec. 758. <em>McCormick, supra, </em>Sec. 9. Although no hard and fast rule can be laid down for invariable application, the predominant view today seems to be that within the sound discretion of the trial judge any memorandum or other object may be used as a stimulus to present memory, without restriction by rule as to authorship, guarantee of correctness, or time of making. <em>Kramer v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>389 F. 2d 236, 238 (1968) ; <em>McCormick, supra, </em>Sec. 9 at 16 and 17. There have been numerous Maryland decisions in which the writings were held to be properly used under the circumstances. See, e.g., <em>Miller v. State, </em>251 Md. 362; <em>Scott v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 481; <em>Hubbard v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">We cannot find that the trial judge abused the wide discretion he has in the conduct of a trial in which he presides by permitting the witness to refresh his memory from the memorandum in question. <em>Stewart v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 565; <em>Gerstein v. State, </em>10 Md App. 322.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b733-11\">. <em>Meyerson v.
