Windsor, employee (appellee), the State of Maryland, Maryland State Police, employer, the State Accident Fund, insurer (appellants) for benefits under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act was barred by limitations. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission decided that it was not. The Circuit Court for Baltimore County at Law on appeal to it confirmed the decision of the Commission. The question is now before us on appeal from the judgment of the Circuit Court. Code, Art. 101, \u00a7 56 (a). But we do not now entertain a final order affirming, reversing or modifying the judgment. Rather, invoking Maryland Rule 1071, we remand the case to the lower court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The determination of the question as presented involves three provisions of Code, Art. 101 entitled \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation.\u201d Section 39 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201c* * * failure of an employee to file a claim for compensation within two years from the date of the accident shall constitute a complete bar to any claim under this article.\u201d However there are statutory provisions for the tolling of this limitation. Section 38 (c) prescribes: \u201cWhere the employer has been given notice, or the employer, or his designated representative in the place where the injury occurred, has knowledge of any injury or death of an employee, and the employer fails, neglects or refuses to file a report thereof, as required by the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the limitations prescribed by this article shall not begin to run against the claimant or any person entitled to compensation until such report shall have been furnished as required by subsection (b) of this section.\u201d Section 39 (c) states: \u201cWhen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>it shall be established that failure to file claim by an injured employee or his dependents was induced or occasioned by fraud, or by facts and circumstances amounting to an estoppel, claim shall be filed within one year from the time of the discovery of the fraud or within one year from the time when the facts and circumstances amounting to an estoppel cease to operate and not after-wards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">It is not disputed that the date of Windsor\u2019s accident was 7 April 1967 and that his claim was filed on 23 October 1969. It is also apparent that the employer filed his first report of injury, but the question is when it was received by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The case was presented to the Circuit Court on the record from the Commission.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It was certified to be truly taken from the records and proceedings of the Commission, and we set out in some detail the contents of the record. It consists of a number of documents, most of which are photostated copies. The first fourteen documents have the numbers (1) through (14) respectively written on them and they appear in that numerical sequence in the transcript of record from the Commission'. The ones relevant to our inquiry are described.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">(1) Copy of a completed \u201cEmployee\u2019s Claim\u201d by Windsor. It is dated 14 October 1969. It stated the date of the accident to have been 7 April 1957 but subsequently this was shown, as is obvious from the form itself, to be a typographical error, the correct year being 1967. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>the form is written \u201c10/23/69 \u2014 SAF advised aec 4/7/ 67.\u201d At the upper right hand side of the form is a space not to be filled in by the claimant. It contains information, apparently written by Commission personnel. It gives the claim number, the insurance company and code number and the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">We have Employer\u2019s Report</p>\n<p id=\"AJEL\">Doctor\u2019s Report</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"273\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\" width=\"466\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The form is stamped as received by the Commission \u201cOct 10:26 A.M. \u201969.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">(2) Copy of a \u201cStandard Form for Employer\u2019s First Report of Injury\u201d completed by the Maryland State Police on Windsor\u2019s injury.

Hughes and the certification of the Secretary of the Commission dated 22 July 1970 that the foregoing was truly taken from the records and proceedings of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">At the Commission hearing it was stipulated that the claim form was received 23 October 1969. Windsor testified he was injured on 7 April 1967 and a first operation to remove two disks was performed on 10 April 1967. He stayed in the hospital about 10 days. \u201cThen I returned home, after I returned home I had been home approximately a day, Mr. Fountain, for the State Accident Fund contacted me and ascertained full information as to what happened. I advised him that I had slipped on the, off the curbing at Pocomoke and removing luggage. And, he stated that at this time that it looked like it was, would be covered by the State Accident Fund due to the fact that it was an accident and for me not to worry about anything. That they would take care of all details.\u201d As far as can be determined from Windsor\u2019s testimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>he later had a second operation to fuse the lower back. \u201cMr. Fountain again contacted me and wanted to know how I felt and I advised him that it was still sore. He asked me to try to bend over. I bent over. He stated that it looked like I would have anywheres from seven, from five to seven per cent disability. And, that the State would take care of me. I asked him if there were any information I had to submit. He advised me again that he would take care of anything that needed doing. If not, he would contact me. I later talked with the supervisor at Salisbury Barracks. [First Sergeant Dobson]. * * * I know he had been through a similar incident. * * * I knew it would have to be a form submitted. But, when he told me it would be, I rested assured because the State, whenever they tell us anything they stand behind what they tell us. And, I took him at his word.\u201d He was asked why he had not filed a form before 23 October 1969. He replied: \u201cBecause I was advised that \u2014 informed that they would take care of it. And I was of the opinion that they had it taken care of, the form.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">The Commissioner asked when the employer\u2019s first report was filed. The transcript of the hearing before the Commission reads, pp. 17 and 18:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">\u201cMR. RUSSELL (Counsel for Employer and Insurer) : Yes, sir. I think I can \u2014 employer\u2019s first report of injury was April 13th, 1967.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">THE COMMISSION: When was it filed with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission\u201d That\u2019s the key to the thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">MR. RUSSELL. It\u2019s received by \u2014 excuse me. This is all I have, Your Honor. I can\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">MR. SIMPKINS (Counsel for claimant) : You have a thermafax copy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-10\">THE COMMISSION: What are you doing with the original? It\u2019s the obligation of any employer to forward it to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-11\">MR. RUSSELL: Sorry about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>MR. SIMPKINS: I have one here received\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-4\">MR. RUSSELL: That\u2019s not the same thing. That\u2019s a different one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\">THE COMMISSION: The SF2 from the doctor was received in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission, from Dr. Kaufman, was received April 18th, 1967. And, from Dr. Clinton Harrison was received May the 31st, 1967.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">MR. RUSSELL: You don\u2019t have a copy of this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">THE COMMISSION: Oh, yes, I have a copy of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">MR. RUSSELL: But, you should have gotten the original.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-9\">THE COMMISSION: I\u2019m not concerned whether it\u2019s the original or a copy. The point involved is when it\u2019s filed with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">MR. RUSSELL: Right. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-11\">THE COMMISSION: Under the section as applicable to estoppel\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-12\">MR. SIMPKINS: 38.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-13\">MR. RUSSELL: 39.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-14\">THE COMMISSION: \u2014 that is to be filed when there is more than three days lost time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-15\">MR. RUSSELL: I see. Well, but there was never any more than three days lost time because he was always paid by sick leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-16\">THE COMMISSION: The Statute doesn\u2019t say about how much he\u2019s paid, does it? Says lost time as a result of the accident. Is that a fair statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-17\">MR. RUSSELL: I suppose. Would you like to have this original and give me\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-18\">THE COMMISSION: Doesn\u2019t make any difference to me. I have a copy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-19\">As noted the case on appeal, heard on 5 November 1970, was submitted to the Circuit Court on the record from the Commission. Arguments of counsel to the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>were not transcribed. Apparently, however, the question of estoppel was raised because in rendering its decision the court said: \u201cGentlemen, it seems clear to me that I need not go to the question of Mr. Fountain\u2019s authority to bind the Fund\u201d, patently relating to Windsor\u2019s testimony to the effect that Fountain said he would take care of everything that needed doing. There was no need in the court\u2019s view to go into that question because it found \u201cmanifest from the record that the Employer\u2019s report of the happening of an accidental injury, although prepared, and apparently signed on April 13, 1967, was never filed with the Commission until the date of the hearing before Commissioner Hughes on January 29, 1970; it is perfectly clear to me that that is so.\u201d Continuing, however, the court found \u201cit is absolutely inescapable\u201d that the employer\u2019s report was filed sometime during October 1969. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-4\">\u201cEvery paper in this file addressed to the Commission shows the date of receipt. And from my experience over the years, in compensation cases it is the invariable practice of the Fund to stamp the date of receipt. Now, wait a minute ; maybe I\u2019m wrong \u2014 no, I\u2019m not wrong. The papers do not show the date of receipt by the Commission, no stamp \u2014 yes, there is, I beg your pardon \u2014 the first paper, and it is marked number 1, it\u2019s stamped by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission October \u2014 I can\u2019t read it\u2014 but, in any event, it is some date in October, 10:26 a.m., \u201969; that is marked in this case as paper number 1, which is employee\u2019s claim. Paper number 2, which is the employer\u2019s first report of injury, is not stamped as to when it was received, but it is marked as paper number 2, which to me carries the inevitable inference that it was filed after paper number 1, and therefore must have been filed some time during or after October 1969. Paper number 3 is stamped Octo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>ber 29, 9:44 a.m., \u201969. I can find no indication of when paper number 2 was received; it is true that it is dated April 13th, 1967, and signed William J. Amberly. But taking the position of this particular paper in the file as being paper number 2, filed after paper number 1, which was filed in October 1969, couple that with Commissioner Hughes\u2019inquiries and remarks on pages 17 through 18 [see <em>supra], </em>put those two together \u2014 although Commissioner Hughes did not state his reasons for finding that this matter was not barred by limitations \u2014 put them all together, and it is absolutely inescapable that the Employer\u2019s report was filed some time during October 1969.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Applying the provisions of \u00a7 38 (c) the court affirmed the order of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The next day, 6 November, appellants filed a motion for a new trial. They gave as reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">\u201c1) That said judgment was against the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">2) That said judgment was against the weight of the evidence, in that Employer\u2019s First Report of Injury was in fact filed with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission on April 14, 1967, as per the attached certificate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-9\">3) That there was no evidence legally sufficient to support the verdict of the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-10\">4) That the Court gratuitously drew inferences not supported by the evidence in that the numeral <em>\u20182\u2019 </em>written on the said Employer\u2019s Report of Injury had no relation to the sequence or order of filing papers with the Commission as assumed by the Court, as per the attached Affidavit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-11\">5) That the Employer and Insurer have newly discovered evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">The certificates referred to and attached to the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>were by Daniel T. Doherty, Chairman of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission. Each was dated 6 November 1970, signed by Doherty and attested by the Secretary of the Commission with the Commission\u2019s Seal affixed. The first read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-4\">\u201cI HEREBY CERTIFY that I am the Chairman of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission of Maryland and am competent to testify to the facts herein set forth, namely that the numeral \u20182\u2019 hand written and encircled in the lower left hand corner of the Employer\u2019s First Report of Injury in the above captioned case has no relation to the sequence or order in which the said Report was filed, but rather said numeral is an interoffice notation relating only to the number of papers to be photocopied for the purpose of making a copy of the record for the court on appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The second read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">\u201cI HEREBY CERTIFY that the attached is a true copy of the workmen\u2019s compensation Employer\u2019s First Report of Injury form filed by the Maryland State Police with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission of Maryland in re: the claim of Thomas Aaron Windsor, and further,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">I HEREBY CERTIFY that said Employer\u2019s Report form was filed with the said Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission of Maryland at 10:16 a.m. o\u2019clock on the 14th day of April nineteen hundred and 67. As witness my hand and seal of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission of Maryland this 6th day of November 1970.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Attached was a copy of the same document appearing as number (2) in the record of the Commission before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>A hearing on the motion was held on 19 November. The court stated that it had known Mr. Doherty \u201cfor many, many years, and I know he would not consciously mislead the Court, and I cannot accept as being correct the certification as to the numbering and sequence of the document.\u201d After argument the court said: \u201cBut without belaboring the thing, it is absolutely inevitable these things [the numbers on the documents] mean they were numbered in that order. * * * It is absolutely clear to me, in spite of Mr. Doherty\u2019s certification, that these things are filed as indicated---.\u201d After more argument it seemed that the court discovered the date of receipt appearing on documents (8) and (9). It said: \u201cWell, I take it back, I obviously am wrong about the meaning of the figures on those papers, I rescind my conclusion in that regard, because on page number 9 there is a stamp, May 31st, 10:35 a.m. \u201967, surgeon\u2019s report * * * and there is another surgeon\u2019s report, it looks to me like it\u2019s April something, 1967, I can\u2019t make out the date.\u201d But the court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">\u201cBut that still doesn\u2019t get the Fund around the records of the Commission itself; to wit, that when the Employee\u2019s claim was filed on October something, 1969, the Commission did not have, according to its own notation, did not have an Employer\u2019s report. So, gentlemen, that is the clincher, and the motion for a new trial will be overruled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">This conclusion completely disregards the certification of the Chairman of the Commission that the Employer\u2019s Report in question was filed with the Commission at 10:16 A.M. on 14 April 1967. And we observe that the \u201cclincher\u201d was at best suspect. There was also on document (1) in the same space containing the notation that the Commission did not have the employer\u2019s report, a notation that it did not have the doctor\u2019s report. This latter notation was patently incorrect as the prior re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>ceipt of the doctors\u2019 reports was shown on the face of those reports \u2014 documents (8) and (9). At least some inquiry was advisable on the accuracy of the notation with respect to the receipt of the employer\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">In the light of this record it clearly appears to this Court that the substantial merits of the case will not be determined by affirming, reversing or modifying the judgment from which this appeal was taken but that the purposes of justice will be advanced by permitting further proceedings in the cause. We therefore remand the case to the lower court for further proceedings and through the introduction of additional evidence or otherwise as may be necessary, the court shall determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">(1) whether the employer\u2019s report was filed as required by Code, Art. 101, \u00a7 38 (b); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">(2) if the employer\u2019s report was so filed, whether Windsor\u2019s claim for compensation was filed within two years from 7 April 1967, the date of the accident; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">(3) if the employer\u2019s report was not so filed, the date it was filed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-8\">(4) whether Windsor\u2019s claim for compensation was filed within two years from the date the employer\u2019s report was filed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-9\">(5) in any event if Windsor\u2019s claim for compensation was not filed within the two year period under either (2) or (4) whether the failure to so file it was induced or occasioned by fraud or facts and circumstances amounting to an estoppel; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-10\">(6) if so whether the claim was filed within one year from the discovery of the fraud or within one year from the time the facts and circumstances amounting to an estoppel ceased to operate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">Then, as if no appeal had been taken and the judgment from which the appeal was taken had not been entered, the lower court shall determine upon its merits whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>or not Windsor\u2019s claim was barred by limitations. Rule 1071.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\n<em>Case remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion; costs to be paid by appellants.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-8\">. In the Circuit Court appellants moved for a summary judgment. Appellee elected to have the case tried by a jury. Code, Art. 101, \u00a7 56 (a) provides that upon proper motion the court shall \u201csubmit to a jury any question of fact involved.\u201d Appellee also filed a motion <em>ne recipiatur </em>with respect to the motion for a summary judgment claiming that the review of the action of the Commission was governed by subtitle B of the Maryland Rules of Procedure, \u201cAdministrative Agencies \u2014 Appeal Prom\u201d and that summary judgment, see Maryland Rule 610, was not applicable. But at the hearing on the motion <em>ne recipiatur </em>appellee withdrew his motion for a jury trial and his motion <em>ne recipiatur. </em>Appellants _ withdrew their motion for a summary judgment. Thus no question concerning appellants\u2019 motion for a summary judgment is before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
