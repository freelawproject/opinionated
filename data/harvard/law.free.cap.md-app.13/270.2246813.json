Flores was killed in a motor vehicle collision in Montgomery County, Maryland. Flores left surviving him a widow, Natividad A. Flores; an infant son, Gustavo U. Flores; an infant daughter, Minerva G. Flores, and an infant stepdaughter, Leticia Armenta Flores.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-14\">Appellees timely filed general issue pleas to all counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>of appellants\u2019 declaration, except \u201cCount IV.\u201d To that count they demurred and assigned as reasons therefor that the count, brought on behalf of the stepdaughter for the wrongful death of her stepfather, did not, as a matter of law, entitle the stepdaughter to assert a claim under the circumstances alleged in the suit. The trial judge agreed with appellees and sustained their demurrer to the count, without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Appellants then filed an appeal to this Court. We shall dismiss the appeal <em>sua. sponte. </em>Rule 1035. The order appealed from is not final. An appeal in an action at law is allowed only from a final judgment or determination. Maryland Code, Art. 5, \u00a7 1. Maryland Rule 605 a. provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">\u201cWhere more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, whether as an original claim, counter-claim, cross-claim, or third party claim, the court may direct the entry of a final judgment upon one or more but less than all of the claims <em>only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment. In the absence of such determination and direction, </em>any order or other form of decision, however designated, <em>which adjudicates less than all the claims shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims, </em>and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The trial judge was. not asked to make an express determination that there was no reason for delay, nor was he requested to make an express direction for the entry of judgment. Absent such express determination and direction, the appeal is premature.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">\u201cThe purpose of this rule * * * was to prevent piecemeal appeals as far as possible, and therefore avoid the confusion, delay and expense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>which would be caused by having two or more appeals in the same suit.\u201d <em>Picking v. State Finance Co., </em>257 Md. 554, 557, 263 A. 2d 572 (1970) ; <em>Knight v. Tolson, </em>10 Md. App. 311, 313-314 (1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Disposition of this case is controlled by a consistent series of opinions by the Court of Appeals. <em>Durling v. Kennedy, </em>210 Md. 549, 123 A. 2d 878 (1956) ; <em>Harkins v. August, </em>251 Md. 108, 246 A. 2d 268 (1968) ; <em>Silverman v. National Life Ins. Co., </em>255 Md. 148, 257 A. 2d 156 (1969) ; <em>Fletcher v. National Brewing Co., </em>255 Md. 580, 258 A. 2d 410 (1969) ; <em>Schafer v. Bernstein, </em>256 Md. 218, 260 A. 2d 57 (1969) ; <em>Harlow v. Blocher, </em>257 Md. 1, 262 A. 2d 58 (1970) ; <em>Picking v. State Finance Co., supra; </em>See also <em>Knight v. Tolson, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">In the interest of preventing costly future litigation by the parties to this action we shall comment upon the merits of the case which would be raised by a proper appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Article 67, \u00a7 4, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">\u201c(a) Every such action shall be for the benefit of the wife, husband, parent and child of the person whose death shall have been so caused or if there be no such person or persons entitled then any person related to the deceased by blood or marriage, who, as a matter of fact, was wholly dependent upon the person whose death shall have been so caused. \u2018Parent\u2019 shall include the mother of an illegitimate child whose death shall have been so caused; \u2018child\u2019 shall include an illegitimate child whenever the person whose death is so caused is the mother of such child; \u2756 <em>99</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">Appellants argue that the stepdaughter was completely dependent upon the decedent for her support and could have reasonably expected to continue to receive support had not the decedent met his unfortunate death. We are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>urged to judicially interpret the noun \u201cchild\u201d as used in the statute so as to include \u201cdependent stepchild.\u201d We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The negligence causing death statute is in derogation of the common law, and, therefore, should be strictly construed. <em>McKeon v. State, Use of Conrad, </em>211 Md. 437, 443 (1956) ; <em>Demczuk v. Jenifer, </em>138 Md. 488 (1921) ; <em>Dunnigan v. Cobourn, </em>171 Md. 23 (1936). The statute indicates that either of two classes of persons may be entitled to recover in a wrongful death action, and establishes their priority. It is, therefore, disjunctive and not conjunctive in nature. The primary class is the \u201cwife, husband, parent and child\u201d of the person whose death has been caused by a wrongful act, neglect or default. The secondary or alternate class consists of any person or persons who may be \u201crelated to the deceased by blood or marriage,\u201d who were \u201cwholly dependent upon\u201d the decedent. However, in order for the secondary or alternate class to maintain an action, there must be no person or persons within the primary class entitled to recover for the wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Inasmuch as members of the primary class do exist and have asserted a claim against appellees, in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, to recover under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act for the negligent death of their husband or father, as the case may be, the stepdaughter, even though she may have been totally dependent upon her deceased stepfather, is precluded as a matter of law from asserting a claim for her stepfather\u2019s untimely demise.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">It is suggested by appellants that the legislative intent was to include within the scope of the statute a \u201cdependent stepchild.\u201d This intent, appellants say, may be garnered from the definition utilized by the General Assembly in defining \u201cparent\u201d and \u201cchild.\u201d The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">\u201c \u2018Parent\u2019 shall include the mother of an illegitimate child * * *; \u2018child\u2019 shall include an ille<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>gitimate child whenever the person whose death is so caused is the mother of such child; * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Appellants state that the definitions quoted, <em>supra, </em>represent \u201clegislative intent to support cause [s] of action where there is dependency and reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefits or advantage from a continuance of life of deceased.\u201d We disagree. We think that had the legislature intended the word \u201cchild\u201d to include \u201cstepchild\u201d it would have said so.</p>\n<p id=\"Amf\">Appellants next argue that Lord Campbell\u2019s Act and the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (Article 101) are in <em>pari materia. </em>They are, but only under certain circumstances. See <em>McKeon v. State, Use of Conrad, supra; Storrs et al. v. Mech et al., </em>166 Md. 124, 133 (1934) and <em>Clough &amp; Molloy v. Shilling, </em>149 Md. 189 (1925). We do not subscribe to the appellants\u2019 view that the enactment of \u00a7 58 of Article 101 of the Annotated Code of Maryland brings the decedent\u2019s stepdaughter within the primary class of persons entitled to recover under Article 67, \u00a7 4. Section 58 of Article 101 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">\u201cWhere injury or death for which compensation is payable under this article was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person other than the employer to pay damages in respect thereof, the employee, or in the case of death, his personal representative or dependents as hereinbefore defined, may proceed either by law against that other person to recover damages or against the employer for compensation under this article, or in case of joint tortfeasors, against both * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">\u201cDependent\u201d is defined by Article 101, \u00a7 36, as one who is receiving in whole or in part the reasonable necessities of life from a workman at the time of the accident resulting in the death of the workman. <em>Mullan Construction Co. v. Day, </em>218 Md. 581 (1959) ; <em>C. W. Wright Construction Co. v. Brannan, </em>217 Md. 397 (1958) ; <em>Mario </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number><em>Anello &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Dunn, </em>217 Md. 177 (1958) ; <em>Johnson v. Cole, </em>245 Md. 515 (1967). Appellees conceded for the purpose of the demurrer that the stepdaughter was wholly dependent upon the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Appellants cite <em>Taylor v. State, Use of Mears, </em>233 Md. 406 (1964). We think appellants misinterpret <em>Taylor. </em>There, the court held that illegitimate children of a deceased father were entitled to maintain an action under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act where they were dependents under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, notwithstanding the fact that legitimate children of the decedent were in <em>esse. </em>The Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\">\u201cWe do not mean to qualify in any way the holding in <em>State, Use of Holt v. Try, Inc., </em>220 Md. 270, discussed above. It may be that an anomalous situation is presented. Thus, <em>if these illegitimate',children in this appeal had not been entitled to sue as dependents under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, but had proceeded solely under the wrongful death statute, they would have had no standing to sue, </em>as the appellees candidly admitted at the oral argument. Whatever doubts may exist concerning such a legal incongruity we feel bound by our prior decisions in <em>Clough &amp; Molloy v. Shilling, supra; </em>[149 Md. 189]| and <em>Storrs v. Mech, supra </em>[166 Md. 124].\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">It is patent that Article 101, \u00a7 58 <em>supra, </em>does not enlarge Article 67, \u00a7 4, <em>unless the injury or death was caused under </em>circumstances\u25a0 <em>creating a liability in someone other than the </em>employer, <em>and where Workmen\u2019s Compensation is payable. Taylot v. State, Use of Mears, supra. </em>Compensation would be payable under Article 101 where there is an accidental injury or death arising out of and in the course of decedent\u2019s employment. No allegation regarding Workmen\u2019s Compensation benefits is made in the instant case, nor was the death work-connected. Absent such a claim, the stepdaughter is not en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>titled to maintain a suit under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act. We think it clear that Judge Moorman was correct, under the factual situation here presented, in sustaining the appellees\u2019 demurrer without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by the appellants.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-15\">.
