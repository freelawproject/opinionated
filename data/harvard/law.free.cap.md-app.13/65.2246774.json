The petition alleged that on December 3, 1964, the husband had been granted a divorce <em>a vinculo matrimonii </em>from the wife on the ground of voluntary separation (Md. Code, Art. 16, \u00a7 24) ; that he had been awarded custody of their minor child; and that the divorce decree incorporated a provision of the separation agreement executed by the parties prior to the divorce that he would pay to the wife the sum of $260 per month for her separate maintenance and support which was to continue for the joint lives of the parties or until the wife should remarry.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-14\">The husband\u2019s petition further alleged that his former wife \u201cwas living with a certain male person at 1803 Aberdeen Road, Loch Raven Village Apartments, Baltimore, Maryland, without benefit of clergy and your petitioner believes and therefore avers that said relationship is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>being legalized by marriage for the reason, among others, that to legalize said relationship would defeat the defendant\u2019s right to receive additional alimony under the said agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">In her answer to the petition, the wife entered a general denial of this latter allegation and the case came on for hearing before Judge John N. Maguire.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The husband testified that he had no personal knowledge of the wife\u2019s alleged conduct except that on the door of the apartment in which she lived, he had seen her name and that of John Van Woodson, \u201cnot Mr. and Mrs. The two names are on the door.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">He had, however, retained a private detective to follow his wife and the detective testified that on July 8, 1969, he began a surveillance of the apartment. Upon arrival, he observed the wife\u2019s Valiant automobile and a Chrysler automobile which he determined to be owned by John Van Woodson. He observed their separate names on the door of the apartment and at 7:40 p.m., observed the wife and Woodson leave the apartment in Woodson\u2019s car, drive to several shopping areas where they made purchases and return to the apartment at 9:43 p.m. He testified that all lights in the apartment were turned off at 1:20 a.m. and he discontinued the surveillance shortly thereafter. He returned at 6 a.m. on July 9, 1969, heard the wife and Woodson conversing at 11:30 a.m. and observed the wife come out of the apartment and empty a garbage can at 12:20 p.m. According to the detective, at 1:05 p.m. the wife and Woodson again left the apartment in Woodson\u2019s car and this completed the detective\u2019s surveillance of the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">The 20 year old daughter of the parties was called by the husband and testified that although she was now living alone, she had lived with her father immediately after the divorce. She stated that late in 1968 she went to live for one month in her mother\u2019s apartment during which time her mother was away a week or two. While her mother was in the apartment, Woodson visited from time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>to time and spent one night there. According to the daughter, the apartment was a studio type consisting of one large room with kitchenette, a small dressing room (which had no bed) and a bathroom. On the occasion that Woodson spent the night in the apartment, \u201cthere was a sofa bed that was pulled out and the three of us slept on the sofa bed.\u201d She further testified that when her mother was away from the apartment, she would go to Pennsylvania and stay in an \u201coffice trailer\u201d, owned by Wood-son, situated in a trailer camp. She had visited her mother there a number of times and on two occasions Woodson was there and spent the night. \u201cThe first time my mother and I slept in the living room on the fold-out sofa, and the second time I slept in a small room and they slept in a room in the back.\u201d When asked to describe her mother\u2019s relationship with Woodson, she replied: \u201cThey were living together most of the time.\u201d When asked if she had talked with her mother about marrying Woodson, she replied: \u201cOne time she said she liked the relationship they had at the present time, the fact that they were not married, and then she, contradicted herself at other times and thought of marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">There was also evidence developed at the hearing below to show that the wife and Woodson had joint bank accounts in their respective names and that the telephone in the apartment was listed under Woodson\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Several depositions of witnesses who lived in the Pennsylvania trailer camp were introduced and these witnesses stated that they were not under the impression that the wife and Woodson were husband and wife but that the trailer was used as his business office and their relationship was that of employer and secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">The wife called no witnesses and did not herself testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">The appellant-husband contends that the evidence adduced by him established that the wife and Woodson \u201cwere living together as a man and wife would and that they were doing this openly and notoriously\u201d and asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>that by such conduct, the wife has forfeited her right to \u201ccontinue to receive the alimony called for in the court\u2019s decree.\u201d He concedes that \u201con the precise point, Maryland law is silent\u201d but suggests that \u201cthe Court of Appeals has touched upon the issue in <em>Courson v. Courson, </em>213 Md. 183.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">In <em>Courson </em>the wife had been divorced <em>a mensa et thoro </em>from the husband and awarded permanent alimony of $25 per week. Thereafter she committed adultery and the husband petitioned for and was granted a suspension of the alimony payments. Judge Prescott, speaking for a divided Court, stated at 187-188:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">\u201cThere is a long line of decisions and authorities that hold where there is no absolute divorce, adultery by the wife is a defense to her suit for separate maintenance and support, or it will justify a modification or revocation of a decree for alimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">\u201cIn this State, a limited divorce is one from bed and board. It grants unto the injured spouse the right to live separate and apart from the one at fault. However, the parties remain <em>man </em>and <em>wife, </em>and there is no severance of the marital bonds. Alimony stems from the common law duty of a man to support his wife, and, in Maryland, has always been considered as outlined above. We hold the proper rule, supported by reason and authority, is that when a wife, who is living separate and apart from her husband due to his fault and who has obtained no more than a limited divorce from him, commits adultery, she forfeits her right to her husband\u2019s support and the future payments of alimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-9\">\u201cIt will be noted, we have not been required in this suit to pass upon the right of a wife, who has been granted an absolute divorce and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>alimony and who thereafter commits adultery, to continue to receive support from the former husband, and express no opinion thereon at this time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">On the other hand, Judge Henderson in his dissent, concurred in by Judge Hammond, the present Chief Judge, stated at 190-191:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">\u201cThis is a case of first impression in this State, and on principle and authority I think the decision is unsound. A right to support may survive a dissolution of the marriage, which would free her from a duty of chastity. * * * It is generally held that adultery of a wife committed after an absolute decree is not a bar to its enforcement. <em>Cole v. Cole, </em>31 N. E. 109 (Ill.). Cf. <em>Rang v. Rang, </em>211 Ill. App. 385; <em>Christiano v. Christiano, </em>41 A. 2d 779 (Conn.) ; <em>Suozzo v. Suozzo, </em>1 A. 2d 930 (N. J.); <em>Hayes v. Hayes, </em>115 N. E. 1040 (N. Y.). See also <em>Browne, Divorce and Alimony </em>(1890), pp. 16, 296. Other cases are collected in a note, 6 A. L. R. 2d 859. * * * In some states it is held that the courts may exercise discretion in modifying or rescinding an award after an absolute divorce, in cases of flagrant misconduct, such as living with a paramour or in prostitution. <em>Lind-bloom v. Lindbloom, </em>230 N. W. 117 (Minn.) ; <em>Haritos v. Haritos, </em>202 N. W. 181 (Wis.). In a few states the existence of such resources is merely viewed as bearing upon the need for support, not upon the question of liability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">Judge Henderson concluded at 194:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-11\">\u201cThe question whether an award might be terminated under circumstances shocking to the conscience of the court and outraging public morals may be left open.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Thus, as a result of the three to two decision in <em>Courson, </em>it would appear that under our existing case law the adultery of a wife, prior to an absolute divorce, constitutes a ground for revoking a prior award to her of permanent alimony. But in the case before us, we are confronted with an absolute divorce and the rationale of the majority view in <em>Courson, </em>which was confined to an <em>a mensa </em>divorce, does not necessarily extend, as the majority of the Court was at pains to assert, to acts of misconduct committed by a wife after the marriage has been totally dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">From a review of the cases throughout the country and the text authorities, it is apparent that the effect of a wife\u2019s \u201cmisconduct\u201d after an <em>a vinculo </em>divorce is not firmly settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">In <em>Schouler, Divorce Manual, </em>(1944) at 423, it is said: \u201cUnder some circumstances the husband may be relieved of the requirement that he pay alimony to his wife by reason of her subsequent misconduct. This rule, however, does not seem to have been generally applied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">In <em>Nelson on Divorce, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 17, 19, page 92, it is stated: \u201cConduct of an ex-wife which would be unbecoming were she still bound by marital ties is not ground for modification of alimony or support provisions of a decree which has severed those ties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">On the other hand, in an Annotation in 6 A.L.R.2d 859, it is stated: \u201cThere is a marked conflict of authority on the question whether the fact that a divorced wife is guilty of immoral conduct after the divorce is a ground for reducing or terminating alimony payments. Perhaps a majority of the courts state that such conduct is a ground for modification, although some of the decisions are mere dicta.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">The appellant\u2019s principal argument is premised upon his assertion that the evidence established that the wife and Woodson were openly and notoriously living together as husband and wife and that their proved relationship amount to \u201cflagrant misconduct.\u201d His premise, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>was not subscribed to by the Chancellor below nor supported by the Chancellor\u2019s factual findings. In the course of reaching his decision to dismiss the husband\u2019s petition, Judge Maguire concluded that on the evidence before him it could be inferred that sexual relations occurred on July 8, 1969, when the wife and Woodson were in the apartment alone, and again when they shared the same bed in the trailer in Pennsylvania. He did not find any evidence that the wife was guilty of \u201cflagrant misconduct\u201d such as \u201cprostitution\u201d, nor did he find \u201ca continuous holding out in the community by her and him as man and wife [which] would be some indication [of flagrant misconduct] but that is not before me.\u201d As Judge Maguire described the situation, \u201can isolated incident of being together and staying together and having sexual relations, to this Court, is not flagrant misconduct on her part because of her status of being single. It may be on her own conscience and her own problem. That is not before me; that is not my problem. I do not see in this particular case that she is continually living with anyone and that there is on her part flagrant misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Flagrant misconduct has been described as living in prostitution, <em>Courson, supra; </em>living together as husband and wife when unmarried, <em>Grant v. Grant, </em>126 P.2d 180 (Cal. 1942) ; living openly and notoriously with a paramour, <em>Lindbloom v. Lindbloom, </em>180 Minn. 33, 230 N.W. 117 (1930), <em>Weber v. Weber, </em>153 Wis. 132, 140 N.W. 1052 (1913) ; or gambling or squandering alimony payments, <em>Daniels v. Daniels, </em>351 P.2d 236 (Idaho, 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Here, the Chancellor found as a fact, and we cannot say his finding was clearly erroneous, that the evidence adduced by the husband did not support the factual allegation of his petition that the wife was \u201cliving with\u201d Woodson or support the husband\u2019s argument that \u201cthey are living together as a man and wife would * * * openly and notoriously.\u201d Thus, the case does not reach this Court in a factual posture which would compel us to find that the Chancellor was clearly erroneous in his finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>the wife\u2019s conduct did not measure up to the traditional, legal definition of flagrant misconduct. Accordingly, we have no occasion to determine whether the so-called flagrant misconduct, <em>vel non, </em>of a former wife may serve as a basis for revoking or modifying a prior award of alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">Under the circumstances and on the state of the record before us, we cannot find that the Chancellor below erred in denying the husband\u2019s petition to be relieved of his obligation to make the monthly payments to the wife called for by the original divorce decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">\n<em>Appellant to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
