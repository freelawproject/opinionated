He was found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>guilty of two offenses, the common law crime of forcible entry and a statutory crime proscribed by Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 577B.

He appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">\n<em>FORCIBLE ENTRY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\"><em>\u201cA </em>forcible entry * * * is an entry on real property peaceably in the possession of another, against his will, without authority of law, by actual force, or with such an array of force and apparent intent to employ it for the purpose of overcoming resistance that the occupant in yielding and permitting possession to be taken from him must be regarded as acting from a well-founded apprehension that his resistance would be perilous or unavailing.\u201d 35 Am. Jur. 2d, \u00a7 <em>\u00cd, </em>p. 891.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See 2 Wharton, <em>Criminal Law and Procedure </em>(1957), \u00a7\u00a7 867-877, pp. 734-740; Perkins, <em>Criminal Lato </em>(2d ed.), pp. 410-411; Hochheimer, <em>Criminal Lain </em>(2d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 327-329, pp. 360-362; 4 Blackstone, <em>Commentaries, </em>148.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Maryland has long recognized that proceedings in cases of forcible entry form a part of our criminal jurisprudence. <em>Isaac v. Clarke, </em>9 G. &amp; J. 107, 114 (1837). The offense was included in our inheritance of the English common law and statutes. Art. 5, Declaration of Bights, Constitution of Maryland. See <em>State v. Magliano, </em>7 Md. App. 286, 292-294. Blackstone, listing it in his Commentaries in \u201cBook the Fourth \u2014 Of Public Wrongs\u201d at 148 as an \u201coffense against the public peace\u201d described it as \u201ccommitted by violently taking or keeping possession of lands and tenements, with menaces, force, and arms, and without authority of law.\u201d He gave an apergu of its history:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-8\">\u201cThis was formerly allowable to every person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>disseised, or turned out of possession, unless his entry was taken away or barred by his own neglect, or other circumstances; which were explained more at large in the third volume of these Commentaries. But this being found very prejudicial to the public peace, it was thought necessary by several statutes to restrain all persons from the use of such violent methods, even of doing themselves justice; and much more if they have no justice in their claim. So that the entry now allowed by law is a peaceable one; that forbidden is such as is carried on and maintained with force, with violence, and unusual weapons.\u201d Ibid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">All forcible entries were punishable with imprisonment and ransom at the king\u2019s will by 5 Rich.II, st.l, c 8, enacted at Westminster in 1381. It provided that \u201cnone from thenceforth shall make an entry into any lands and tenements but in cases where entry is given by law; and in such cases not with strong hand nor with multitude of people, but only in peaceable and easy manner, and if any man from henceforth shall do to the contrary, and thereof be duly convicted, he shall be punished by imprisonment of his body.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Kilty held the statute \u201capplicable to the province\u201d and \u201cproper to be incorporated\u201d on his finding. \u201cThis statute, and others on the same subject, which will hereafter be noticed, have always been practised under the province and in the state.\u201d <em>Report of English Stahites </em>(1811), 222. See also Alexander\u2019s <em>British Statutes </em>184.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Manning v. Brown, </em>47 Md. 506, 511 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>recognized forcible entry as \u201can offense against the public peace.\u201d After discussing the right of entry under the early common law prior to the statutes to restrain forcible entries,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it set out the declarations of Sta.5, Rich.II, ch.8. cf. <em>Krauss v. State, </em>216 Md. 369, 372; <em>Bouie v. Columbia, </em>378 U. S. 347, 358 and note 6. See also Stephen\u2019s <em>Commentaries in the Law of England, </em>vol.III, p.356 and vol.IV, p.342.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The misdemeanor of forcible entry requires an actual entry upon land or tenements as contrasted with an attempt to enter. It is the force with which the entry is made that distinguishes it from an ordinary trespass.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The force may be actual or there may be a show of force which has the effect of preventing resistance. It must be such as to create a reasonable apprehension that it must be yielded to or a breach of the peace will be committed. 2 Wharton\u2019s <em>Criminal Laiu </em>(1957), \u00a7 869, p. 736. Hochheimer put it thusly: \u201c[T]he violence may consist of actual force applied to the person, of breaking open a house, of an array of numbers, of anything tending to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>cause apprehension of bodily hurt or breach of the peace in the event of resistance.\u201d \u00a7 327 at 360. So \u201c[a]n entry is forcible when effected or accompanied by such force or threats of personal violence, either actual or implied from the actions of the defendant, as are likely to intimidate the possessor of the land or his family and to deter them from defending their possession, or to provoke a breach of the peace.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Wharton, supra, </em>\u00a7 869, p. 736. An entry by an open window, or by opening the door with a key or by mere trick or artifice is not deemed a forcible entry, id., \u00a7 870, p. 737. But the force employed need not put those in possession actually in fear. 35 Am. Jur. 2d \u00a7 58, pp. 929-930. It is sufficient at the common law that the entry be against a person in possession of the land and tenements, that is that he had actually entered on and peaceably occupied the premises. \u201c[I]t is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>not necessary to show that his possession was held under title in any sense other than that of being peaceably held and enj oyed by him at the time the forcible act was done by the defendant.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Ibid. Thus \u201c[t]he ownership or right to possession of the land is not in issue in a prosecution for forcible entry and detainer. The defendant can neither attack the victim\u2019s title to the property nor attempt to establish his own.\u201d <em>Wharton, supra, </em>\u00a7 874, p. 739. And it is not necessary that the possessor have been personally present on the premises at. the time of the forcible entry, if in actual exercise of authority and control over them. 35 Am. Jur. 2d \u00a7 58. As to criminal agency, \u201ca person who is present at the time of and cooperating with another in making a forcible entry is guilty of the offense, whether or not he actually comes on the land.\u201d Id., \u00a7 59.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AI3b\">\n<em>The Indictment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Dean claims that the indictment failed to charge the offense of forcible entry.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Rule 712 a provides: \u201cAn indictment shall contain a plain, concise and definite statement of the essential facts constituting the specific offense with which the defendant is charged. It need not contain any other matter not necessary to such statement, * * *. An unnecessary allegation may be disregarded as surplusage * * Count 1 of the indictment here presented that Dean \u201cdid unlawfully and forcibly enter into and upon the Administration Building of the University of Maryland then and there in possession of the Board of Regents of the University of Maryland and did thereupon occupy the said premises with and by such array of force as did cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>apprehension on the part of agents of the Board of Regents of the University of Maryland of breach of the peace in the event that said agents resist such forcible entry in violation of the common law of Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">We said in <em>Ward v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 583, 587-588:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">\u201cThe rule which seems to be generally recognized draws a line of demarcation between an indictment or information which completely fails to state an offense and one which alleges all the elements of the offense intended to be charged and apprises the accused of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, even though it is defective in its allegations or is so inartfully drawn that it would be open to attack in the trial court. <em>Putnam v. State, </em>234 Md. 537; <em>Baker v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 148.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">We followed and applied the rule in <em>Rosenberg v. State, </em>12 Md. App. 20, 24. We have no difficulty in determining that the count here challenged gave a plain, concise and definite statement of the essential facts constituting the common law offense of forcible entry as discussed <em>supra. </em>We find that count 1 properly charged forcible entry.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Dean also alleges that count 1 was lacking in specificity. We do not agree. It charged the offense and we do not think that it was fatally defective in failing to allege such other facts as would enable Dean to prepare his defense in the constitutional sense. <em>Seidman v. State, </em>230 Md. 305. Dean complains that the indictment did not \u201cstate the hour of entry\u201d, whether or not \u201cthe building was closed\u201d, the \u201carray of force used\u201d, what precise acts he did \u201cto cause apprehension on the part of the agents of the Board of Regents\u201d, who the agents were, the source of their authority. Such of these points as may have been relevant and material were matters of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>proof; they were not essential to the sufficiency of the indictment. The count as drawn served its purpose of apprising Dean of the crime charged within the contemplation of Art. 21 of the Declaration of Rights of the Maryland Constitution. See <em>Presley v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 419, 430; <em>Lynch v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 546; <em>Dortch and Garnett v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">We hold that the lower court did not err in denying the motion to dismiss count 1 of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">\n<em>The Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">There was evidence adduced from which the jury could properly find that about 8:00 p.m. on 14 May 1970 a group of persons gained entry to the Administration Building of the University of Maryland through the northwest entrance. The top of the door had been splintered and the door forced open. A college policeman requested the 10 or 15 people who had entered to leave and they did so. He tried to secure the door but he could not close it against the force of those attempting to gain entrance. About 40 or 50 persons entered the lobby. Reinforcements called by the policeman arrived and in about 20 minutes the lobby had been cleared. During that time, howrever, requests to leave were not immediately complied with. Persons milled around the lobby and several changed the lettering on the directory board to such slogans as \u201cPower to the People\u201d, \u201cFree Food for Dining Room Whores\u201d, and \u201cFuck Elkins\u201d. There were judicial identifications of Dean as one of those in the building changing the lettering on the directory board and that he kept on doing so when requested to leave. He and a companion put the sign in the center of the lobby and asked a lieutenant of the campus police department if he were going to destroy it.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Dean concedes that the evidence showed that he was \u201cpart of a group that entered the administration building.\u201d But he argues that there was no proof <em>he </em>broke the doors to gain entry, or that <em>he </em>was the first to enter the building after it had been secured. He further urges that the evidence did not establish that the entry was \u201cof such nature that it engendered a fear or apprehension on the part of those in possession that they would suffer some bodily harm\u201d, and points out that he did leave the building, not remaining after all the others had left. He did not dispute that the Administration Building was in the peaceable possession of the Board of Regents.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">We find that the evidence was sufficient in law to establish that the Administration Building of the University of Maryland was peaceably in the possession of the Board of Regents, that Dean entered thereon against the will of the possessors, without authority of law and by actual force. We point out that it w-as at least a rational inference that he was present at the time of entry and cooperating with others in making the forcible entry; this was enough to show his criminal agency. And since actual force was used, it seems that the apprehension of bodily hurt or that the peace would be breached in event of resistance was not an essential element. In any event, it is only required that the show of force be such as is likely to intimidate the possessor, not that he was actually put in fear, or such as is likely to result in a breach of the peace. We believe that the jury could have properly concluded on the evidence before it that one of these was the likely result. We note that it was no defense to the crime of forcible entry that Dean may have had the right to enter the building under normal circumstances; it is no defense that a defendant had the legal title to and have the right of immediate possession of the real estate in question. <em>Perkins, supra, </em>at 410. In the words of <em>Perkins, </em>ibid: \u201cThe social interest in the peace and quiet of the community requires that no peaceful possession of real estate should be disturbed by such violent means.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>We hold that the lower court did not err in denying the motion for judgment of acquittal as to the first count of the indictment. <em>Williams v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\"><em>CODE, ART. 27, </em>\u00a7 <em>577B</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">\n<em>Constitutionality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Attacking his conviction of the statutory offense Dean asks us, as we were asked in <em>Kirstel v. State, </em>13 Md. App. 482, to declare \u00a7 577B unconstitutional. He bases his request on two grounds: the statute is vague in violation of due process, and it is discriminatory in violation of equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Dean is entitled to a determination of the constitutionality only of those provisions of the statute under which he was convicted. He was not affected by other provisions of the statute, whether or not they are constitutional, as the Act has a severability clause. Acts 1969, ch. 627, \u00a7 2. We found in <em>Kirstel </em>that the statute has two aspects which we styled the \u201cdenial of access aspect\u201d and the \u201ccriminal offenses aspect.\u201d Dean, as was Kirstel, was convicted of a misdemeanor created under the second aspect, namely that he refused or failed to leave the building or grounds of a public educational institution' after being requested to do so by an authorized employee of the institution. We said in <em>Kirstel </em>that the employee must have standards to follow in making the request and we found that it was the legislative intent that the standards be that the person requested to leave had no lawful business to pursue at the institution or that he was acting in a manner disruptive or disturbing to the normal educational functions of the institution, the test being that it would so appear to a reasonable man.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">In considering whether the Act was unconstitutionally vague in <em>Kirstel </em>we applied the general rule that \u201call that is required is that the language \u2018conveys sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Petrillo, </em>332 U. S. 1, 8. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-10\">\u201cWe believe the provisions of the Act here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>considered meet the test of the rule on vagueness. Certainly the language of the Act that a person who refuses or fails to leave after being requested to do so is guilty of a misdemeanor conveys sufficiently definite warning as to what conduct is proscribed when measured by common understanding and practices. The act forbidden \u2014 not leaving after being requested \u2014 is precise, clearly expressed and delineated. No speculation is required as to the meaning of that provision; men of common intelligence need not necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application. Nor do we find vague the standard required for the request. We construe \u2018lawful business\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 577B as we construed it in our consideration of \u00a7 577A in <em>Anderson v. State, </em>12 Md. App. 186. We find it means any constitutionally protected activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">We adopt the conclusion we reached in <em>Anderson, </em>at 192:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">\u201c[T]he range of uncertainty inherent in the language is not such as would \u2018broadly stifle fundamental personal liberties when the end can be more narrowly achieved.\u2019 <em>Aptheker v. Secretary of State, </em>378 U. S. 500, 508, quoting <em>Shelton v. Tucker, </em>364 U. S. 479, 488. We do not believe that the phrase \u2018lawful business\u2019 is so unprecise and has so uncertain a meaning that it fails to inform a defendant of the charge against him. We find that the statute does not offend the Due Process Clause of the Constitution because of it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">Unlike <em>Kirstel </em>we also have before us in the instant case the \u201cdisruptive acts\u201d standard. It too is reasonably compatible with a constitutional interpretation, that is that only non-constitutionally protected disruptive activities are prohibited. We accept that interpretation and shall apply the standard accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>We hold, in the light of the construction to be given the provisions affecting Dean, that they are not unconstitutionally vague as to the standards imposed or unconstitutionally broad as applying to constitutionally protected conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">We do not believe that the provisions deny equal protection. Dean concedes that the buildings and grounds are public facilities subject to restriction of their use by the State in a reasonable and nondiscriminatory manner. <em>Brown v. Louisiana, </em>383 U. S. 131, 143; <em>Dunkel v. Elkins, </em>325 F. Supp. 1235, 1243 (U.S.D.C.D. Md. 1971). But he urges that \u00a7 577B discriminates \u201cas between persons or groups of persons in the incidence of the law,\u201d citing <em>Goesaert v. Cleary, </em>335 U. S. 464, 466. We see no classifications with respect to the provisions here pertinent. The criminal offenses aspect applies to all persons whether or not they are students, staff or faculty.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cWhoever\u201d refuses or fails to leave after being requested by an authorized employee commits the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>scribed offense. The construction we have placed on this provision answers Dean\u2019s contention that \u201cWhat standards an entrant must conform to are left to the vagaries of the highest officials or governing body of the University of Maryland or the administration personnel and staff.\u201d We see no discrimination \u201cas between persons or groups of persons in the incidence of the law.\u201d We conclude the pertinent provisions do not deny equal protection. We hold that they are constitutional on their face.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">\n<em>The Indictment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Dean claims that the 3rd count of the indictment failed to charge an offense and lacked specificity. It reads that Dean \u201c* * * did unlawfully refuse and fail to leave and vacate the Administration Building of the University of Maryland after being requested to do so by authorized employees of the institution, contrary to the form of the Act of the Assembly in such cases made and provided * * We think that the count as drawn was so in the words of that part of Art. 27, \u00a7 577B here material as fully to meet the test as discussed in <em>Baker v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 148, 155-157. We find that the 3rd count was as fully descriptive of the offense alleged as is the language of the statute.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Dean argues that the count omits any mention of whether or not he was a bona fide, currently registered student at the institution, but we have seen that all persons, including such students are within the ambit of the offense in any event. He points out that it did not state that he had no lawful business to pursue or that he was committing disruptive acts or how the authority of the employee making the request was derived, but these were matters of proof. Nor do we agree that the count must fall for lack of specificity. We do not feel that it was fatally defective in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>a constitutional failure to allege such facts as would enable Dean to prepare his defense. Urging that it was not specific he asks what time the alleged violation was committed, what specific conduct constituted the proscribed refusal to leave, who were the requesting employees and from what source did they derive their authority, what were the disruptive acts, what did he do to disturb the normal functions of the University.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> These again were matters of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">We hold that the lower court did not err in denying the motion to dismiss count 3 of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">\n<em>The Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Dean gives as reasons why the evidence was insufficient that it did not show that he had no lawful business to pursue or that he was acting in a manner disruptive or disturbing to the normal educational functions of the institution, and that he refused to leave the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">We think the jury could have properly found, at least by a rational inference from the evidence, that Dean had no lawful business to pursue in the Administration Building at the time he was there. Certainly we cannot say that breaking down doors of the Building to effect entrance, milling around the lobby, removing the directory board, placing it in the middle of the lobby and rearranging the lettering thereon to form the slogans as testified, were constitutionally protected activities. And it would seem that the jury could have fairly found that they were acts disruptive or disturbing to the normal educational functions of the institution. There was direct evidence that Dean refused to leave when requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>and he does not dispute that the request was made by an \u201cauthorized employee.\u201d That he eventually left is not the point; there was evidence that he refused to leave until \u201cI get through with what I am doing right now,\u201d and continued to rearrange the lettering on the directory. Dean conceded in oral argument before us that the question of what he was doing in the Building was one of credibility. As such it was for the jury. <em>Berlin v. State, </em>12 Md. App. 48. The reasons advanced by Dean in urging that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the conviction under the 3rd count do not lead to the conclusion that the lower court erred in denying the motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">We hold that the lower court did not err in denying the motion for judgment of acquittal as to the 3rd count of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Dean points out in the \u201cConclusion\u201d section of his brief that he \u201cwas only one of many involved in the activity complained of by the State, yet he was singled out as part of a small group, by the University to be charged with these criminal violations.\u201d His conduct may be neither excused nor justified because others may have acted unlawfully. Nor did he obtain sanctuary because others were not apprehended, or prosecuted or punished. He was responsible for his conduct, found by a jury of his peers to have been unlawful. We have determined that the convictions were come by properly. He is fairly held accountable. See <em>Drews v. State, </em>236 Md. 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed; costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b679-9\">. \u201cForcible detainer, on the other hand, is controlled by circumstances existing after entry, whether forcible or not, and may, and usually does, consist of the unlawful holding or detention of real property by force or by threats or menaces after a peaceable entry.\u201d Ibid. \u201cForcible entry and forcible detainer are two distinct offenses. * * * Force is an ingredient of each.\u201d <em>Roth v.

The Act gave no civil remedy and applied only to forcible entry. 15 Rich.II ch.2 extended the remedy to forcible detainer after an unlawful entry. 8 Henry VI ch.9 dealt with peaceable entry and forcible holding and afforded to the aggrieved party a remedy by \u201cAssise of Novel Disseisin or a Writ of Trespass against such Disseisor.\u201d Other statutes, on the subject, for example, 31 Eliz. ch. 11 and 21 James I. ch. 15 were subsequently passed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b680-7\">.

I Reeve\u2019s Hist. E.L. 322; 3 lb. 202; Co. Litt. 257, a note (1) by Butler. The exercise of this right frequently gave rise to tumult and breaches of the peace, and to restrain such disorders, the Stat. 5, Rich.

Forcible entry \u201cdiffers from trespass quare clausum fregit, first of all, in the degree and kind of force with which the entry is made, manu forti, with unusual weapons, or with menace to life or limb. The words \u2018manu forti\u2019 are understood to impart something criminal in its nature, something more than is meant by the words \u2018vi et armis\u2019, and distinguish this kind of entry from an ordinary trespass by entering into another\u2019s land, which is not so violent as a forcible entry. 35 Am.Jur.2d, \u00a7 4 at 893.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b682-5\">. \u201cThere is a split of authority as to what constitutes a breach of the peace. Some decisions tend to broaden the definition by including any violation of order or decorum, and hold that fighting or rioting or a show or threat of violence is not an essential element; * * * but we think the better rule is that of the common law which required evidence of an affray, actual violence, or conduct tending to or provocative of violence by others.\u201d <em>Wanzer v. State, </em>202 Md. 601, 609. (citations omitted). In <em>Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co. v.

App. 251, 260; <em>Lynch v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 546, 557. Black\u2019s <em>Law Dictionary </em>(Rev. 4th ed.) defines breach of the peace as \u201ca violation or disturbance of the public tranquility and order.\u201d p. 236. It describes the term as generic. Blackstone lists offenses against the public peace, \u201cthe conservation of which is entrusted to the sovereign and his officers * * 4 Blackstone\u2019s Comm. 142. Four of them are felonious: the riotous assembling of twelve persons or more and not dispersing upon proclamation; riotous demolition of buildings and machinery; threatening letters; and pulling down or destroying any lock, sluice or floodgate on navigable rivers. The remaining were misdemeanors of which forcible entry was \u201ca ninth.\u201d Others were malicious destruction of turnpike gates and toll bars; malicious destruction of works of art; affrays; riots and unlawful assemblies; tumultuous petitioning; going armed with weapons; spreading false news; false prophesying; challenges to fight; libels. It may be that there were \u201capprehended\u201d breaches of the peace as distinguished from \u201cconstructive\u201d breaches of the peace, which Black defines as an unlawful act which, \u201cthough wanting the elements of actual violence or injury to any person, is yet inconsistent with the peaceable and orderly conduct of society.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b683-7\">. This is in accord with Hochheimer, <em>supra, </em>who stated that forcible entry is punishable as a crime \u201cif the person dispossessed had mere peaceable possession, the matter of title being immaterial.\u201d \u00a7 327.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b683-8\">.

Dean filed a pretrial motion to dismiss the indictment for the reasons that it failed to charge an offense and was vague and indefinite. The motion was denied upon hearing.

See the ordinary form of charging forcible entry set out in <em>Hochheimer, supra, </em>\u00a7 329, pp. 362-363.

After the building had been cleared the second time about 35 or 40 students returned^ prevented the doors from being nailed shut and re-entered the building.

The denial of access aspect, however, exempts bona fide, currently registered students, staff and faculty.

Dean demanded particulars. He asked the court to order the State\u2019s Attorney to file a Bill of Particulars (1) describing with specificity the alleged acts which constituted forcible entry, the alleged detainer, the alleged failure to leave the Administration Building and the alleged disorderly conduct; (2) stating the names and addresses of the agents of the Board of Regents described in the indictment. The State answered that the indictment was specific and afforded a fair and reasonable opportunity for Dean to defend himself (names of witnesses were supplied in answer to a motion for discovery). Dean does not now present any question regarding the answer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
