Specifically, we consider whether the trial court properly allowed litigation of a claim by new parties who intervened in a pending case. Rule 2:15, as pertinent here, provides: \u201cA new party may by petition filed by leave of court assert any claim or defense germane to the subject matter of the suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">In 1978, numerous owners of residential property fronting on the north side of Lauderdale Avenue in Virginia Beach became concerned that development would occur directly across the street within a ten-foot strip of vacant land lying between Lauderdale and the edge of a lake located south of the street. One of the property owners, appellant B. Frank Williamson, asked an adjacent owner, appellant Garland M. Layton, an attorney-at-law, to advise interested neighbors how the strip could be kept in its natural state. Upon investigation, Layton concluded that the strip had been owned by a dissolved corporation, Chesapeake Seashore Corporation, and that the property had not been disposed of at the time of dissolution in 1913. He recommended that Williamson acquire title to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">In July 1978, Layton, as attorney for Williamson, filed a petition in the court below for appointment of a receiver for Chesapeake Seashore Corporation. Following report of a commissioner in chancery, the court appointed Layton receiver for the corporation and, in an October 1978 order, authorized Layton to convey the property to Williamson. Williamson, an employee of the City of Virginia Beach, planned to interest the City in purchasing the property as well as the lake. To avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, Williamson, upon Layton\u2019s advice, conveyed the property, except the portion directly in front of Williamson\u2019s residence, to appellant John Koren, Layton\u2019s son-in-law and legal assistant.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">Subsequently, the suit giving rise to the present controversy was initiated below. In December 1979, appellee Seawall Enterprises, Inc. filed a bill of complaint against Layton, individually, Williamson, and Koren. Seawall claimed title to the property in ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>tion through a series of conveyances originating with the defunct Chesapeake Seashore Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Seawall alleged that, when the prior suit was filed, Layton knew, or should have known, that the subject property previously had been conveyed lawfully to others and that Layton \u201cdid commit what was tantamount to fraud upon . . . Williamson . . . and the Court in causing the appointment of a receiver\u201d for the defunct corporation. Asserting that its title to the property had been \u201cplaced in doubt\u201d by the actions stemming from the receivership, Seawall asked the court: to decree that it had fee simple title to the property in question; to declare the deed of the receiver to Williamson and the deed from Williamson to Koren \u201cnull and void and of no effect;\u201d and to \u201center such other and further decrees which may be necessary to clear title to the property in question\u201d to Seawall. The bill also included a prayer for general relief, \u201csuch other and further relief as the nature of its case may' require or to equity shall seem meet.\u201d See Rule 2:2.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Following an August 1980 ore tenus hearing, the chancellor issued a memorandum opinion dated November 19, 1980. Stating that the \u201cissue in this case\u201d was the meaning of certain language in a 1913 deed from Chesapeake Seashore Corporation, the court decided that Seawall had not acquired title to the subject property through the chain of title upon which it had relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Commenting further, the chancellor stated that \u201cthis conclusion does not completely resolve the disposition of this matter.\u201d The judge noted the request that the two deeds be declared null and void because of the alleged fraud upon Williamson and the court. After recounting the events in the receivership and noting Lay-ton\u2019s participation in the proceeding which affected property owned by Layton individually, the chancellor said: \u201cLayton\u2019s acts may have violated his duty as an officer of the Court, and the deed may, therefore, be voidable.\u201d The court also said that \u201cno allegation of Layton\u2019s breach of a duty to the Court was expressly stated in the plaintiffs Bill of Complaint and has not been fully addressed in argument.\u201d Thus, the court said, it \u201cmay be necessary\u201d for the bill to be amended and for \u201cfurther proceedings\u201d to be had \u201cbefore this issue can be properly decided.\u201d No order has been entered upon the chancellor\u2019s ruling that Seawall failed to establish title to the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Within two weeks, appellees Clifton W. Golden and Erma Alice Golden lodged with the clerk in December 1980 a Notice of Peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>tion to Intervene in the pending Seawall suit. By order entered in October 1981, over the objection of Layton, the trial court granted leave to the Goldens, as interveners, to file their petition and to add appellant Layton, in his representative capacity as Receiver for Chesapeake Seashore Corporation, as a party defendant in the pending suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">In their petition, the interveners asserted they owned property in a different subdivision block but near the land of Layton and Williamson in the vicinity of the lake and ten-foot strip. They alleged their property \u201cwas the subject\u201d of the pending Seawall suit and apparently claimed that Williamson\u2019s title was a cloud upon their title. In addition, the interveners alleged, referring to the trial court\u2019s memorandum opinion, that because of the \u201cinterest\u201d of the receiver, the deeds to Williamson and to Koren should be declared null and void. The interveners asked the court to: confirm the ruling that Seawall did not acquire the strip, which actually surrounds the lake; set aside the deeds to Williamson and Koren; and decree that the defunct corporation has no title to the strip. The Goldens also included a prayer for general relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">After overruling demurrers and motions to strike the intervening petition, the chancellor held another ore tenus hearing in June 1982. This hearing focused upon the propriety of Layton\u2019s conduct as receiver in view of his position as an interested property owner. The petitioners did not rely on allegations that Layton was guilty of \u201cfraud and deceit.\u201d It will be remembered that, in the original bill, Seawall alleged Layton\u2019s conduct \u201cwas tantamount to fraud.\u201d Rather, the inquiry was directed to Layton\u2019s alleged conflict of interest or violation of fiduciary duty. Only Layton, Williamson, and Koren testified. No evidence was presented in support of the Goldens\u2019 assertion of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Following the hearing, the chancellor ruled from the bench that the receivership proceedings were intended, in part, to benefit Layton individually and that his acts as receiver \u201crepresented a breach of his fiduciary obligation.\u201d The court ruled that Layton be removed as receiver, that the deeds to Williamson and to Koren (as well as a third, unrecorded deed of the property from Koren back to Williamson) be declared void, and that a new receiver be appointed. We granted this appeal from the June 1982 decree entered upon those rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">We agree with the contention made on appeal, as in the trial court, by counsel for the receiver that the court below abused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>its discretion by permitting the intervening petition to be filed, by ordering a new party to be added to the pending suit, and by allowing litigation in the pending suit of the issues raised in the intervening petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Even though leave to amend should be granted liberally by the trial court in furtherance of the ends of justice, Rule 1:8, a new party may not intervene and assert a claim in a pending suit unless the claim is \u201cgermane to the subject matter of the suit.\u201d Rule 2.15. In order for a stranger to become a party by intervention, he must <em>\u201cassert some right involved in the suit.\" </em>Lile\u2019s Equity Pleading and Practice at 91 (3rd ed. 1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">We hold that the claim asserted by the interveners was not \u201cgermane\u201d to the subject matter of the Seawall suit, within the meaning of Rule 2:15. Stated differently, we conclude that the interveners did not \u201cassert some right\u201d that was involved in the pending suit. The gravamen of Seawall\u2019s suit was a claim of title to the subject property. In the 1980 hearing, the chancellor focused on that claim by undertaking to interpret language in a 1913 deed. Once the court determined as a matter of fact from the evidence that Seawall had not established title to the property, that suit should have been terminated. Resolution of the question whether the deeds to Williamson and Koren constituted a cloud upon Seawall\u2019s title was rendered unnecessary, irrelevant, and moot when it was determined that Seawall did not have a valid claim of title to the property in the first place. Decision of an irrelevant, unnecessary, and moot issue is not proper even though the bill of complaint includes a prayer for general relief. <em>See Woolfolk </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>113 Va. 182, 196, 69 S.E. 1039, 1044-45 (1911) (under prayer for general relief, relief granted must be consistent with the specific relief sought).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Nevertheless, taking cue from the chancellor\u2019s invitation issued in the memorandum opinion for amendment and \u201cfurther proceedings\u201d to investigate the receiver\u2019s conduct, the interveners sought to assert title to separate property that merely was located in the same general area as the property claimed by Seawall. These strangers to the pending litigation claimed a link to the Seawall suit by relying on the court\u2019s intimation of its views on the validity of the Williamson and Koren deeds, an issue, as we have said, that turned out to be beyond the scope of the main suit. Thus, while recognizing that rules of equity practice are more elastic than rules at law, we nonetheless are of opinion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>connection between the subject matter of the main case and the intervening petition was too attenuated and indirect for the latter to be germane to the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">Accordingly, we will reverse the June 1982 decree, dismiss the intervening petition, and remand the case to the trial court with direction that a final decree be entered dismissing the original bill of complaint based on the failure of Seawall to establish title to the subject property, as decided in the trial court\u2019s November 1980 memorandum opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
