Mr. Pace died without issue at the age of 81 on May 20, 1981. His estate was valued at more than $190,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-14\">By will dated April 5, 1968, he named two nephews, Hamilton and Montie Pace (hereinafter, the nephews), as sole beneficiaries of his estate. In a second will dated January 4, 1979, Mr. Pace provided: \u201cI make no bequest whatsoever to my nephews, Hamilton W. Pace and Montie R. Pace, who are able to look after themselves and who have paid little or no attention to me during the last ten years.\u201d By that will, he devised a house and lot in Charlottesville to Hugh C. Yager who resided there as the testator\u2019s tenant. The rest and residue of his property he left to Lyle W. Ingalls and his wife, Ann M. Ingalls. The Ingallses and Joseph W. Richmond, an attorney, were named co-executors.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>At trial, the nephews attacked the second will on the grounds that the testator lacked testamentary capacity and that he was the victim of undue influence.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The chancellor sustained a motion to strike their evidence and entered a final decree admitting the second will to probate. Appealing from that decree, the nephews renew the attacks they made at trial and challenge an evidentiary ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The evidence showed that the testator and his wife lived alone for many years on a secluded mountain farm called Glenhaven. His wife died in 1968, and Mr. Pace decided to move. Paying a price in excess of its appraised value, Hamilton bought the farm, and Mr. Pace engaged his nephew to build a new house near Hamilton\u2019s home in Stony Point. The house contained two apartments, and Mr. Pace moved into the lower unit in May 1972. Later that year, the Ingallses, residents of Florida, moved into the upper apartment where they lived until Mr. Pace died nine years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The proponents of the January 4, 1979 will introduced a number of witnesses who saw the testator on the day it was executed. Dr. Bruce Carter, an ophthalmologist, had seen Mr. Pace a week earlier. Mr. Pace had awakened to find himself blind in one eye. Dr. Carter testified that his patient \u201cwas obviously upset about the loss of vision\u201d but that he \u201cfound him to be an extremely alert person\u201d. He described the testator\u2019s mental condition when he saw him again on the date he signed his will as \u201coriented, clear, concerned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Richmond, Mr. Pace\u2019s attorney, drafted the two wills offered for probate and had represented the testator in other legal matters. Mr. Pace came to his office on January 3, 1979 and told him that he wanted to make a new will because \u201che was very deeply upset and distressed about... the treatment that he had received from his two nephews\u201d. Richmond prepared the will and Mr. Pace executed it in his office the next day. He said that his client was \u201calert and oriented\u201d, \u201chis physical vitality was remarkable\u201d, and \u201che knew what his kin folk were.\u201d Responding to Richmond\u2019s inquiry, Mr. Pace identified the houses in Charlottesville and Stony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Point and told the attorney that \u201che had seventy-five or a hundred thousand dollars in the bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">James B. Murray, Jr., an attorney in Richmond\u2019s firm, subscribed the will as an attesting witness. Murray noticed nothing unusual in Mr. Pace\u2019s mental condition. Yvonne C. Ward, Richmond\u2019s secretary, also witnessed the will. She observed no \u201cdeficiencies in his mental powers\u201d and characterized his condition as \u201calert and the way he always was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u201c[T]he time of execution of the will ... is the critical time for determining testamentary capacity. The testimony of witnesses as to the mental capacity of the testatrix at this time carries great weight.\u201d <em>Thomason </em>v. <em>Carlton, </em>221 Va. 845, 853, 276 S.E.2d 171, 175 (1981). In <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Chumbley, </em>190 Va. 480, 57 S.E.2d 151 (1950), the testatrix made her will while on furlough from a mental institution. Upholding probate, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">\u201cNeither sickness nor impaired intellect is sufficient, standing alone, to render a will invalid. If at the time of its execution the testatrix was capable of recollecting her property, the natural objects of her bounty and their claims upon her, knew the business about which she was engaged and how she wished to dispose of her property, that is sufficient.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 495, 57 S.E.2d at 158 (quoting <em>Gilmer </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>186 Va. 630, 639, 44 S.E.2d 16, 20 (1947)).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">The evidence of testamentary capacity adduced by the proponents fully satisfies this test, the nephews\u2019 evidence does not contradict the testimony of those present when the will was executed, and we hold that their evidence was insufficient to raise a jury question.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">The nephews contend that even if the evidence is \u201cinsufficient to establish lack of testamentary capacity, the evidence of Mr. Pace\u2019s mental condition ... is highly relevant on the issue of undue influence.\u201d Before addressing the undue influence issue, we will review the testimony the nephews cite as evidence of the testator\u2019s mental impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">Murrell S. Jackson, a local business man, had known Mr. Pace for 40 years as \u201ca real sharp old fellow.\u201d In the summer of 1980, he noticed \u201ca drastic change.\u201d \u201cHe was very vague,\u201d Jackson said, \u201che was disoriented, he was confused, and I don\u2019t think he knew who I was.\u201d W. B. Waldorf, the testator\u2019s pastor, described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>an incident at church when Mr. Pace abruptly refused to accept an offer of a religious magazine. Waldorf discontinued his pastoral visits in Mr. Pace\u2019s home in 1980 or 1981. He explained that Mr. Pace \u201cwould not look at me when I talked to him . . . and I felt uncomfortable in his presence. He acted like he did not want me there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Rebecca Hamilton, who lived during the summers in a home near Mr. Pace, testified that \u201che was always very stubborn, very alert, very opinionated ... a very tough character.\u201d In the summer of 1979, she \u201cnoticed that he was vaguer, he was more irrational, he flew off the handle much more easily. He had his fears and he had his hates and he suddenly dropped religion .... He kept telling me . . . something awful is going to happen here.\u201d When the witness saw him in August 1981, she was \u201cshocked that . . . he\u2019d become so senile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Lucille Buck had known the testator since the death of his wife and had exchanged visits with him frequently. Buck testified that he became fearful, kept a shotgun by his bed, and offered her a pistol and a knife for her protection. In the summer of 1978, she said, \u201cwe went out in the garden to pick the tomatoes, and all of a sudden he started pulling all the tomatoes off, pitching them off down the hill\u201d. He told her that they had been damaged by \u201cradium, from the sun\u201d and that he was afraid for her to eat them. Theresa Pace, Montie\u2019s wife, testified that Mr. Pace lost his taste for tomatoes because he was concerned about the effects of radium.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Ruby Staley, Theresa Pace\u2019s mother, testified that Mr. Pace began refusing invitations to family gatherings in August 1978. During a conversation she held with him in 1979, she said that he \u201ckept his head bowed the whole time he talked to me\u201d, and \u201cin his later years ... he began to break his word to us\u201d and invented excuses to decline invitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Kenneth Wade described an incident which occurred on one of his visits. He said that Mr. Pace \u201calways kept his bedroom door locked and he couldn\u2019t find his key to his bedroom, so he sat up in the chair all night and worried about his key\u201d. Wade testified that Mr. Pace \u201cdemonstrated his strategy for unexpected guests. He got his pistol out of the bedroom and he took me to the door and he had a little peep hole in the door that he could look out into his garage, and he had a string that he could jerk the light on and then he could draw his pistol up to see who was there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Patricia Trainum, a neighbor, baked some rolls for the testator and asked her husband to deliver them. She stated that Mr. Pace \u201copened the door and he took the rolls and shut the door in my husband\u2019s face.\u201d Myrtie Donnelly met Mr. Pace in the grocery store \u201ctwo or three months before he died\u201d. The witness said that \u201che just didn\u2019t look like himself, he didn\u2019t act like himself ... he didn\u2019t smile or anything\u201d, and contrary to custom, \u201che seemed in sort of a hurry\u201d and left the store without waiting to talk with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">We will now summarize the testimony upon which the nephews rely as evidence of \u201ccircumstances indicative of undue influence\u201d. They contend that the testimony and the inferences it raises show that Mr. Pace \u201cwas susceptible to undue influence . . . because of his age . . . senility and weakmindedness\u201d and that \u201cMr. and Mrs. Ingalls drove a wedge between the old man and his family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Theresa Pace and her husband Montie frequently invited the testator to their home for meals and picnics. He failed to appear for dinner on Thanksgiving Day in 1978 and, thereafter, stopped accepting invitations to family gatherings. Mrs. Ingalls helped Mr. Pace redecorate his apartment, and family pictures displayed on his bookcase disappeared. Mr. Pace removed his telephone and television set, explaining that he could use the Ingallses\u2019 equipment when he needed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Lucille Buck testified that, after the apartment was redecorated, \u201cthings were disappearing all along\u201d. Mr. Pace told her that Mrs. Ingalls did most of his cleaning and cooking and mended his clothes. After Mr. Pace had removed his telephone, Buck called Mrs. Ingalls and asked to speak with Mr. Pace about an urgent matter. Buck testified that \u201cshe said he doesn\u2019t want to be bothered and slammed the phone down.\u201d Mr. Pace called Buck shortly before his death, told her Mr. and Mrs. Ingalls are \u201cout right now\u201d and asked her to \u201cplease come out here, I need to talk to you.\u201d Buck said that \u201che was frantic.\u201d For personal reasons, Buck was unable to leave home at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Rebecca Hamilton and Mr. Pace corresponded often. \u201c[H]e wrote his own letters\u201d, she said, \u201cand then suddenly Mrs. Ingalls wrote for him\u201d and \u201c[s]he signed his name\u201d. Theresa Pace and her aunt, Louise Bogard, delivered a portion of their Thanksgiving dinner to Mr. Pace in 1978, 1979, and 1980. Bogard remembered that \u201cMrs. Ingalls stood over the bannisters the whole time we were there, she never left.\u201d Ruby Staley said that whenever she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>visited Mr. Pace, Mrs. Ingalls \u201cwas always there or she came soon after we arrived.\u201d Fred Merchant, who did some plumbing work for Mr. Pace, testified that Mrs. Ingalls would often come down, stand around, and listen to their conversations until he left. Roy Morris delivered building blocks to Mr. Pace in 1980. Morris said that Mrs. Ingalls \u201ccome out on the carport and stood there and watched\u201d. Carolyn Steele, who first met Mr. Pace in November 1979, testified that \u201cMr. Ingalls came down, wanted to know who I was and what I was doing there.\u201d His only concern, she said, \u201cseemed to be to get me out of there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The nephews point to additional testimony which, they contend, supports an inference that \u201cAnn Ingalls . . . may have been [Mr. Pace\u2019s] mistress.\u201d Lucille Buck testified that sometime in 1972 Mr. Pace \u201ctold me if I would marry him that everything would be mine.\u201d When Buck visited in his home, Mrs. Ingalls \u201cwould . . . ask me what I was looking for or who I wanted to see.\u201d \u201c[A] lot of times\u201d, she continued, \u201cwe got cut off during a [telephone] conversation.\u201d There was no interior access between the apartments in Mr. Pace\u2019s house, and he constructed an outside staircase. Buck testified that Mrs. Ingalls had asked him to build the steps \u201cso she wouldn\u2019t have to go all the way around front to get to his apartment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Juanita Pace, Hamilton\u2019s wife observed Mrs. Ingalls \u201c[c]oming down the steps in her bathrobe and entering the door at the bottom.\u201d She saw her and Mr. Pace together \u201cconstantly in the yard and the garden\u201d and \u201c[s]he very seldom ever left his side.\u201d Ruby Staley and Patricia Trainum testified to the same effect. Audrey Carpenter and Peggy Kidd frequently saw Mrs. Ingalls in the yard with Mr. Pace.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The nephews called the Ingallses as adverse witnesses. Ann In-galls testified that she cooked a meal for Mr. Pace only once and remembered only one letter she had written for him. She denied that she mended his clothes, redecorated his apartment, gave him books, or screened his visitors. Asked if she had visited him in his apartment, she said, \u201cMaybe on a Wednesday.\u201d She explained that Mr. Pace shopped on Thursdays and had instructed her that if she needed anything from the store she \u201chad to see him on Wednesday.\u201d She acknowledged that she often met him in the yard and garden. Responding to another question, she denied that she and her husband grew \u201ccloser and closer to Mr. Pace the longer [they] lived at his house\u201d. \u201cHe never called me Ann, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>always called me Mrs. Ingalls\u201d, she said, and he called her husband Mr. Ingalls. Counsel inquired whether Mr. Pace kept her informed of his whereabouts and whether she was \u201cconcerned as to where he was\u201d. Mrs. Ingalls replied, \u201cNo. He was no relation to me. He was nothing to me.\u201d Mrs. Ingalls first learned about the contents of Mr. Pace\u2019s will \u201c[w]hen Mr. Richmond called us and they read the will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Lyle Ingalls testified that Mr. Pace\u2019s realtor required him to sign a new lease every year. Mr. Ingalls assisted his landlord in painting, mowing, plumbing, and repair work on the house, truck, and lawnmower. He installed a door bell on the exterior door and bored \u201ca hole in the door for him so he could look out.\u201d Although Mr. Pace had a driver\u2019s license and drove his own truck until he died, Mr. Ingalls sometimes drove it for him. He drove him to the bank on two occasions, once to deposit money and once to rent a safety deposit box. Mr. Ingalls knew that Mr. Pace had some bonds and the money he had received from the sale of the Glenhaven farm. He acknowledged that Mr. Pace had made him a gift of some of the bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">On January 4, 1979, Mr. Pace asked Lyle Ingalls to take him to Dr. Carter\u2019s office. Following that visit, Mr. Pace wanted to go to Richmond\u2019s law office. Mr. Ingalls remained in the reception room while Mr. Pace was with Richmond in an inner office. Mr. Ingalls testified that he did not know the purpose of the visit to the lawyer\u2019s office. He stated that \u201cabout a year or so later\u201d Mr. Pace \u201csaid something about Mr. Yager might own the house he was living in\u201d and \u201che might have let it slip that I might own [the Stony Point] house.\u201d At some point unclear from the testimony, Mr. Pace told Mr. Ingalls that he had named him one of the executors of his will and that he should contact Richmond \u201cif anything happened\u201d. The Ingallses made the testator\u2019s funeral arrangements at Richmond\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">On brief, the nephews list nine \u201ccircumstances\u201d which they contend are sufficient to support a finding of undue influence:</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">\u201c1. The testator was old .... 2. The testator was susceptible to undue influence . . . because of his age . . . senility and weakmindedness .... 3. The testator was . . . critically confused in that the reasons given for such bequest [to the Ingallses] did not comport with what several witnesses said was the truth. 4. The testator was . . . particularly susceptible to undue influence because ... he was \u2018extremely . . . obviously upset about the loss of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>vision in his right eye.\u2019 5. Ann Ingalls was very close to the testator and may have been his mistress. 6. Lyle and Ann Ingalls . . . stood in a relation of confidence and dependence \u2014 indeed, in a fiduciary capacity \u2014 to the testator. They . . . contribute [d] to the old gentleman\u2019s reclusiveness . . . playing upon his overblown fears and convincing him, contrary to fact, that his family had abandoned him. 7. When called upon to explain their relations with the testator, Lyle Ingalls was less than candid and Ann Ingalls was downright dishonest .... 8. The alleged will . . . makes an unnatural bequest in that it excludes the testator\u2019s kin in favor of his tenants. 9. The testator had previously expressed a different dis-positive intent . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">The chancellor ruled that the evidence was insufficient to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of undue influence. This Court has repeatedly and consistently defined what influence is undue. \u201cThe undue influence which will vitiate a will must be of such a character as to control the mind and direct the action of the testator.\u201d <em>Core </em>v. <em>Cores Adm\u2019rs, </em>139 Va. 1, 14, 124 S.E. 453, 457 (1924). \u201c[I]t must be sufficient to destroy free agency on the part of the . . . testator; it must amount to coercion \u2014 practically duress. It must be shown to the satisfaction of the court that the party had no free will\u201d. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>109 Va. 470, 472, 63 S.E. 994, 995 (1909). \u201cResistable persuasion, solicitation, advice, suggestions, and importunity do not constitute sufficient evidence of undue influence.\u201d <em>Wilroy </em>v. <em>Halbleib, </em>214 Va. 442, 446, 201 S.E.2d 598, 601 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u201cThe burden of showing undue influence rests upon those who allege it, and it cannot be based upon bare suggestion, innuendo, or suspicion.\u201d <em>Core </em>v. <em>Core\u2019s Adm\u2019rs, </em>139 Va. at 14, 124 S.E. at 457. The nephews suspect that Mrs. Ingalls was Mr. Pace\u2019s mistress and that she used the illicit relationship to induce him to make his will in her favor. Indeed, they place primary stress upon this \u201ccircumstance\u201d and Mr. Ingalls\u2019 alleged fiduciary relationship to Mr. Pace. We find nothing of record to show that Mr. Ingalls was more than a helpful friend or that Mrs. Ingalls was engaged with Mr. Pace in a meretricious relationship. Our decision in <em>Forehand </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>147 Va. 105, 136 S.E. 683 (1927) is instructive. There, the testator was survived by his wife of 34 years. Several years before his death, he and another woman became friends. She accompanied him to his lawyer\u2019s office where he executed a will changing the terms of a former will which fa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>vored his wife. By the new will, the testator left his widow a $200 annuity and two mules; the residue of his estate he devised to his new friend. The contestants challenged the will on grounds of undue influence and lack of testamentary capacity, and the jury found a verdict in their favor. Finding the verdict contrary to the evidence, we reversed the decree and remanded the cause with instructions to admit the will to probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">As the precedents teach, those who accuse another of abusing a personal relationship for selfish gain bear a heavy burden.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">Undue influence ... is a species of fraud, and so must be proved by clear, cogent and convincing testimony. Influence is not undue which rests upon natural affection and desire to give property to those who are most considerate, attentive and useful to us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-6\"><em>Thornton </em>v. <em>Thornton\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, </em>141 Va. 232, 240, 126 S.E. 69, 71 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The nephews argue that, considered collectively, the inferences raised by the testimony they adduced was sufficient to discharge the burden they bore and that the chancellor erred in striking their evidence. We have expressly noted, however, that the question whether testimony tending to show undue influence is sufficiently probative to submit to a jury is a question to be considered by the chancellor at the threshold. In <em>Wilroy </em>v. <em>Halbleib, </em>we reversed a decree denying probate on the ground the chancellor had erred in refusing to strike evidence of undue influence. \u201cTo justify submission of the question of undue influence to a jury\u201d, we said, \u201cthere must be evidence presented which is sufficient to show that the person executing the will was deprived of his volition to dispose of his property as he wished.\u201d 214 Va. at 446, 201 S.E.2d at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Viewing all the testimony and the inferences it is said to raise in the light most favorable to the nephews, and applying the evidentiary standards we have defined, we uphold the chancellor\u2019s ruling that the evidence was insufficient to submit the question of undue influence to the jury. <em>See Gill </em>v. Gill, 219 Va. 1101, 254 S.E.2d 122 (1979) (evidence insufficient as a matter of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Finally, the nephews ask us to reverse the decree on the ground \u201cthe trial court erred in refusing to receive the depositions of Ann M. Ingalls and Lyle W. Ingalls ... so far as admissible under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>rules of evidence\u201d. The chancellor ruled that counsel would be permitted to use the depositions, but only for purposes of impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The chancellor\u2019s ruling was made more than a year before our decision in <em>Horne </em>v. <em>Milgrim, </em>226 Va. 133, 306 S.E.2d 893 (1983). The issue raised by the plaintiff on appeal in that case, one of first impression, required us to construe and apply Rule 4:7(a)(3) which provides that \u201c[t]he deposition of a party . . . may be used by an adverse party for any purpose.\u201d Reversing the judgment for the defendant, we held that \u201ca party may, subject to the rules of evidence, introduce an adverse party\u2019s discovery deposition as substantive evidence in his own case, whether the deponent is present or not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 138, 306 S.E.2d at 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">We did not hold, as the nephews seem to think, that exclusion of a party\u2019s discovery deposition constitutes reversible error <em>per se. </em>We will not reverse a judgment for error in excluding evidence \u201cwhere it appears from the record that the error . . . could not and did not affect the verdict.\u201d <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Watts, </em>111 Va. 394, 398, 69 S.E. 328, 330 (1910). <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-678. Stated differently, if, upon consideration of all the evidence, including evidence excluded erroneously, we can conclude that there was no error in the judgment appealed from, we will affirm it. <em>Rorer Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Trout, </em>83 Va. 397, 414, 2 S.E. 713, 720 (1887). <em>See also Semmes </em>v. <em>Semmes, </em>201 Va. 117, 125, 109 S.E.2d 545, 550 (1959); <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>180 Va. 277, 284, 23 S.E.2d 240, 243 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The transcript of the proceedings at trial shows that counsel was permitted to use the depositions freely in his efforts to contradict the Ingallses. The nephews\u2019 complaint on appeal is that they were denied the right to use the depositions as evidence in chief. Specifically, they contend on brief that the depositions were material as substantive evidence to show that Mr. Ingalls \u201cwas a highly evasive witness\u201d; that \u201cMr. Ingalls\u2019 abrupt defensiveness . . . tends to corroborate appellants\u2019 contention that Ann Ingalls was intimate with Mr. Pace\u201d; that Mr. Ingalls \u201csteadfastly denied any peculiarity or unusual behavior on the part of Mr. Pace\u201d; that Mr. Ingalls volunteered, even when not asked, to assist Mr. Pace with his chores; that Mr. Ingalls was not candid concerning his knowledge on \u201cthe question of the decedent\u2019s monies\u201d; and that Mrs. Ingalls contradicted her husband when she \u201cdenied that Mr. Pace ever needed Lyle to help him with problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Although evidence may be relevant, its exclusion does not constitute reversible error if it is merely cumulative. <em>Eason </em>v. <em>Ea-son, </em>203 Va. 246, 254, 123 S.E.2d 361, 367 (1962). We have carefully scrutinized the text of both depositions, and we find nothing relevant to the issues of testamentary capacity and undue influence which was not fairly presented to the jury in live testimony. Considering all the evidence, including what was excluded, we are of opinion that the chancellor\u2019s failure to anticipate our interpretation of Rule 4:7(a)(3) was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">Finding no reversible error in the court below, we will affirm the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b238-7\"> Yager died testate following Mr. Pace\u2019s death, and the beneficiaries of his will, Dorothy P. Yager, Hugh C. Yager, Jr., Clyde W. Yager, and Cheryl Dale Breeden, were joined as parties in the court below. Mary Louise Gentry and Alma Wade, two of Mr. Pace\u2019s heirs at law, were also added as necessary parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
