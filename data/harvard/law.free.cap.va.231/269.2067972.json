In her motion for judgment, Lloyd alleged that she sustained injuries when she fell on a sidewalk located on the Inn\u2019s premises and that her injuries were proximately caused by the Inn\u2019s negligent failure to maintain the sidewalk in a safe condition. The Inn pled <em>res judicata </em>based upon the Industrial Commission\u2019s previous ruling in Lloyd\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim. The trial court sustained the plea and entered summary judgment for the Inn. Lloyd appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">The facts are undisputed. On March 11, 1980, Lloyd filed with the Industrial Commission a workers\u2019 compensation claim for her injuries. The Commission first determined that Lloyd\u2019s accident did not arise out of and in the course of her employment with the Inn. Notwithstanding this determination, the Commission further found that the accident was not the proximate cause of Lloyd\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">Lloyd contends on appeal, as she did at trial, that once the Commission determined her accident did not arise out of and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>the course of her employment, it lacked jurisdiction to determine causation. Thus, she asserts, the issue of causation has not been adjudicated by a tribunal of competent jurisdiction, and therefore, <em>res judicata </em>cannot be a bar to her tort action. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">It is well settled that a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive respecting the same cause of action in a subsequent suit between the same parties. <em>Corprew </em>v. Corprew, 84 Va. 599, 602, 5 S.E. 798, 799 (1888). For a prior judgment to preclude a subsequent action, however, the court in the first proceeding must have had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the controversy and the precise issue upon which the judgment was rendered. <em>Linkous </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>116 Va. 898, 906-07, 909-10, 83 S.E. 417, 419-21 (1914); <em>Seamster </em>v. <em>Blackstock, </em>83 Va. 232, 234, 2 S.E. 36, 37 (1887).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In the present case, the Industrial Commission acted within its authority when it received evidence and determined that Lloyd\u2019s accident did not arise out of and in the course of her employment with the Inn. Having made this threshold finding, however, the Commission had no jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of Lloyd\u2019s claim. Therefore, the Commission\u2019s finding of no causation was made without jurisdiction and could not bar Lloyd\u2019s subsequent action for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The conclusion we reach is consistent with our holding in <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Raven Red Ash Coal Co., </em>179 Va. 790, 20 S.E.2d 530 (1942). In <em>Griffith, </em>we said that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (now Workers\u2019 Compensation Act) leaves \u201cunimpaired the common-law right of action for damages for the personal injury or death of the employee when such does not arise out of and in the course of the employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 797, 20 S.E.2d at 533. Thus, we held in <em>Griffith </em>that \u201ca denial of an award of compensation, on the ground that the injury did not arise out of and in the course of the employment, is not <em>res judicata </em>in the employee\u2019s subsequent action at law to recover damages [from] the employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 800, 20 S.E.2d at 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The Inn relies upon our decision in <em>Raven Red Ash Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>181 Va. 911, 27 S.E.2d 360 (1943),<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> in support of its argument that Lloyd\u2019s law action is barred. Its reliance on <em>Raven Red Ash </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>In <em>Raven Red Ash, </em>Griffith\u2019s administratrix filed a claim under the Act for Griffith\u2019s death caused by a mining explosion. The Industrial Commission denied the claim based on its factual finding that Griffith was not engaged in a work-related activity at the time of the explosion.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Thereafter, Griffith\u2019s administratrix filed a law action for damages on the theory that the employer breached a common-law duty of reasonable care owing to Griffith as an invitee on the employer\u2019s premises. After a trial on the merits, the trial court entered judgment on a jury\u2019s verdict in favor of Griffith\u2019s administratrix, and Raven appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">On appeal, Raven argued that the evidence failed to establish that Griffith was an invitee on his employer\u2019s property. In response, Griffith\u2019s administratrix argued that Griffith was killed while performing work for his employer. In rejecting Griffith\u2019s argument, we said that the Commission\u2019s prior finding that Griffith was not engaged in his employer\u2019s business was a binding determination and could not be re-litigated. Thus, we held that, once the Commission made the necessary and jurisdictional finding that Griffith\u2019s injury did not arise \u201cout of and in the course of the employment,\u201d Griffith\u2019s administratrix was estopped from asserting in a subsequent proceeding a position contrary to the Commission\u2019s finding. <em>Id. </em>at 922, 27 S.E.2d at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">In the present case,- however, Lloyd is not asserting that her injury arose out of and in the course of her employment. Indeed, she concedes that the Commission\u2019s finding on that issue is conclusive. To the contrary, Lloyd\u2019s action is based upon the Inn\u2019s alleged negligence in failing to maintain the sidewalk in a safe condition, a right expressly reserved in <em>Griffith. </em>179 Va. at 797, 20 S.E.2d at 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Accordingly, because the trial court erred in sustaining the Inn\u2019s plea of <em>res judicata, </em>we will reverse its judgment and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b291-8\">The <em>Griffith </em>and <em>Raven Red Ash </em>cases are successive appeals arising out of the same litigation involving Griffith\u2019s accidental death.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
