Virginia Capital Bank (Bank) brought this action against the Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company (Aetna), alleging that the Bank had sustained a loss by reason of the fraudulent alteration of a promissory note, that Aetna had insured the Bank against such losses, and that Aetna had rejected the Bank\u2019s claim for reimbursement under the policy. Aetna denied that the Bank had suffered a covered loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">After considering the pleadings, discovery, an affidavit by the maker of the note, memoranda, and arguments, the trial court entered summary judgment in Aetna\u2019s favor. The court concluded that the note, although altered without the consent of the maker, was nevertheless enforceable by the Bank in its altered form as a matter of law. The court therefore held that the Bank\u2019s loss fell outside the coverage of Aetna\u2019s policy because the loss did not result from the alteration, but rather was caused by the insolvency of the maker and endorser of the note. We granted the Bank an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>During the relevant period of time, Aetna covered the Bank under a \u201cbanker\u2019s blanket bond\u201d which provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-3\">The Underwriter, in consideration of an agreed premium . . . agrees ... to indemnify and hold harmless the Insured for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-4\">(E) Loss (1) through the Insured\u2019s having, in good faith and in the course of business, . . . either gratuitously or otherwise, purchased or otherwise acquired, accepted or received, or sold or delivered, or given any value, extended any credit or assumed any liability, on the faith of, or otherwise acted upon, any securities, documents or other written instruments which prove to have been . . . (b) raised or otherwise altered ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Paul M. Tibbs, trading as Paul\u2019s Auto Sales, had a course of dealing, extending over a 22-year period, with the Bank and with James K. Mathews, president of Mathews General Insurance Corporation. Tibbs would purchase business insurance through Mathews and borrow money from the Bank to finance the premiums. Tibbs customarily signed, in blank, promissory notes on the Bank\u2019s forms and delivered them to Mathews. When Mathews ascertained the correct amount of the premiums and interest, he would fill in the notes, with Tibbs\u2019 authority, and deliver them to the Bank. The Bank would then advance the money for the premiums to Mathews and Tibbs would pay the notes when due. This arrangement, based on Tibbs\u2019 trust of Mathews, worked well from 1958 to 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The Bank\u2019s pleadings, supported by Tibbs\u2019 affidavit, show that in March 1980 Tibbs executed a note in blank on the Bank\u2019s form and delivered it to Mathews according to the usual custom. Mathews told Tibbs that the note would cover a premium of about $960.00, and Tibbs executed it on that understanding. Instead, without Tibbs\u2019 knowledge, Mathews filled in the note for a principal amount of $9,600.00, plus interest, for a total of $10,296.00. Mathews added the endorsement of his corporation, presented the note to the Bank and received the loan proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Tibbs made payments on the note, but then realized that they were excessive and refused to make further payments. He informed the Bank that the note had been completed in its present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>form without his knowledge and consent and that Mathews had not procured any insurance for him with the loan proceeds. The note has a present unpaid principal balance of $7,559.61. It is undisputed that the Bank gave value for the note and accepted it in good faith, in the regular course of business, without notice of any defense. Thus, the Bank is a holder in due course. Code \u00a7 8.3-302.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\">The Bank argues that the note was \u201craised or otherwise altered\u201d within clause (E)(1)(b) of Aetna\u2019s \u201cbanker\u2019s blanket bond.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.3-407 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-4\">(1) Any alteration of an instrument is material which changes the contract of any party thereto in any respect, including any such change in</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">(b) an incomplete instrument, by completing it otherwise than as authorized . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Thus, says the Bank, the unauthorized completion of the note \u201cis an alteration within the ambit of clause (E).\u201d Further, the Bank contends, citing <em>Citizens Bank of Oregon </em>v. <em>American Insurance Co., </em>289 F. Supp. 211 (D. Ore. 1968), the loss occurred when the money was paid out by the Bank in reliance on the altered note, not when the maker refused or failed to pay the balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Aetna contends that the alteration of the note is immaterial to the Bank\u2019s loss because, under Virginia law, the Bank has the clear right to enforce the note according to its terms. The Bank is a holder in due course, and Code \u00a7 8.3-407(3) provides: \u201cwhen an incomplete instrument has been completed [a holder in due course] may enforce it as completed.\u201d The Official Comment to that section states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-9\">Where blanks are filled or an incomplete instrument is otherwise completed, this subsection follows the original Section 14 in placing the loss upon the party who left the instrument incomplete and permitting the holder to enforce it in its complete form.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">Thus, says Aetna, in this situation the \u201claw allocates the risk of loss by providing that as between the maker and the holder in due course, the loss falls on the maker.\u201d Aetna argues that because Tibbs (as well as Mathews General Insurance Corporation, which endorsed the note) are both fully liable to the Bank on the note in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>its present form, any loss sustained by the Bank arose solely from the Bank\u2019s erroneous business judgment in extending credit to Tibbs and Mathews, and such ordinary business risks are not within Aetna\u2019s coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\">The Bank responds that it purchased Aetna\u2019s insurance to protect itself from the consequences of fraudulent alteration, and not to \u201cbuy a lawsuit.\u201d The Bank argues that Aetna is bound by its contract to indemnify the Bank and should undertake the burden of enforcing the note as the Bank\u2019s subrogee.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Code \u00a7 8.3-406 provides, in pertinent part: \u201cAny person who by his negligence substantially contributes to a material alteration of the instrument ... is precluded from asserting the alteration . . . against a holder in due course. . . .\u201d The Bank contends that because the enforceability of the note depends upon the factual issue of Tibbs\u2019 negligence, which in view of the long history of dealings between the parties could not be resolved as a matter of law, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment. We do not agree. Although the enforceability of the note might be established by proof of the maker\u2019s negligence under Code \u00a7 8.3-406, Code \u00a7 8.3-407(3) makes the note enforceable against the maker as a matter of law: \u201cA subsequent holder in due course may in all cases enforce the instrument according to its original tenor, and when an incomplete instrument has been completed, he may enforce it as completed.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the court did not err in resolving the matter as a pure question of law, cognizable on Aetna\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Under Code \u00a7 8.3-407(3), as under our earlier cases decided under the former Negotiable Instruments Law, <em>see Early </em>v. <em>Citizens Bank, </em>173 Va. 436, 438, 3 S.E. 2d 167, 168-69 (1939); <em>American Bank </em>v. <em>McComb, </em>105 Va. 473, 475, 54 S.E. 14, 15 (1906); \u00a7 5686, Code of 1919, the Bank had the right to enforce the note in its present form against the maker and the endorser for the full amount filled in.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>In light of the foregoing, we examine Aetna\u2019s contract insuring the Bank. Aetna is obligated to indemnify the Bank against [1] \u201closs, [2] through the Insured\u2019s having, in good faith and in the course of business . . . given any value . . . upon any . . . written instruments which prove to have been [3] raised or otherwise altered.\u201d Because the note is enforceable by the Bank, we do not agree with the Bank\u2019s contention that it suffered a \u201closs\u201d within the terms of the policy at the time it disbursed the loan proceeds in reliance on the altered note. No \u201closs\u201d is incurred by paying value for a valid and enforceable instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\">If the Bank should ultimately fail to collect the note, its loss would arise from the maker\u2019s insolvency or other cause unrelated to the enforceability of the note. Such a loss would not be caused by the alteration, and thus would not be incurred \u201cthrough the Insured\u2019s having . . . given any value ... on the faith of . . . written instruments which prove to have been . . . raised or otherwise altered.\u201d In <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>State Bank of Salem, </em>412 N.E.2d 103 (Ct. App. Ind. 1980), the court construed identical language in a \u201cbanker\u2019s blanket bond\u201d in accordance with the views expressed above: \u201closs through\u201d an altered instrument means \u201closs due to an alteration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113. Thus, even if the Bank\u2019s efforts to enforce the note should prove unavailing, its loss would not be due to the alteration, but rather would be the product of the ordinary business risks to which all lenders are subject. Losses of the latter kind are outside the coverage of the \u201cbanker\u2019s blanket bond\u201d involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Finding no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling, we will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-6\"> We construe the term \u201csubsequent holder in due course,\u201d as used in this section, to refer to one who takes the instrument subsequent to its alteration, rather than a holder subsequent to the first. A payee may be a holder in due course, Code \u00a7 8.3-302(2), and for the purposes of \u00a7 8.3-407(3) may also be a \u201csubsequent holder in due course.\u201d See Official Comment to \u00a7 8.3-302(2), examples d. and f.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b307-7\"> Aetna correctly points out that the U.C.C. contemplates two different varieties of alteration, which would have opposite consequences in the context of this case. If the maker had completed the note for $960.00 before delivering it to Mathews, and the note had thereafter been altered by raising it to a higher figure without the maker\u2019s authority, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>the first clause of \u00a7 8.3-407(3) would apply, and the Bank could only enforce the note \u201caccording to its original tenor,\u201d i.e. for $960.00. But where the note was delivered in blank, as here, the second clause of \u00a7 8.3-407(3) applies; an \u201cincomplete instrument has been completed.\u201d This, too, is an \u201calteration,\u201d as noted above, but the consequence differs; in such a case the holder may enforce the note \u201cas completed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
