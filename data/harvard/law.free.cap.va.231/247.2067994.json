Following a bench trial, the court below entered judgment for the defendant. We awarded the plaintiff this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">Lawton, a retired welder, purchased the note in question on April 15, 1980 from Martin Swersky, an acquaintance who had been in the aluminum siding business. The note consisted of blank spaces on a printed form completed with pen and ink as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-12\">\u201c$12,000.00/xx Jan 1 1976</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-13\">120 payment of $100.00/xx after date _I_ promise to</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-14\">pay to the order of Bearer__Twelve Thousand and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-15\">\u2014........... 00/xx Dollars at____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-16\">Value received</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-17\">No._Due 10th of Month /s/ Emily V.- Walker</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-18\">Witness: /s/ Stephen Allen Miller\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-19\">Lawton paid Swersky approximately $5,000 for the note which, at the time of Lawton\u2019s purchase, had a balance due of $7,050. As part of the transaction, Lawton received from Swersky a title certificate issued to \u201cEmily V. Walker\u201d for a 1976 Ford automobile and a payment book in Walker\u2019s name with the notation, \u201cTerms: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>$100 for 120 months. Amount of Note $12,000.00 (car).\u201d Lawton testified he \u201cbought other things\u201d from Swersky at the time as a \u201cpackage deal.\u201d The \u201cother things\u201d were \u201cmortgages\u201d on two houses owned by Walker. Responding on cross-examination, Law-ton answered affirmatively to the question, \u201cYou purchased it in bulk, you purchased everything at one time?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">Lawton further testified he was unaware of any \u201cproblems\u201d with the note when he acquired it. He said he knew that the note was for purchase of an automobile from Swersky by Walker. He stated that the transaction between Swersky and Walker was \u201ca straight cash sale\u201d without interest in which Swersky \u201callowed her to pay over the period of ten years.\u201d Lawton did not know the actual cost of the vehicle when Swersky sold it to Walker.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">According to the evidence, Walker made regular monthly payments to Swersky from February 1, 1976 to the date of the Swersky-Lawton deal and thereafter to Lawton. Walker ceased paying in October 1981, leaving a balance due of $4,950.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Over plaintiffs objection, Walker was permitted to testify concerning many details of the underlying transaction with Swersky. According to defendant, in 1976 she bought a used 1976 Ford automobile from Swersky, agreeing to pay him $7,200 for the vehicle over a period of five years. She produced at trial the original new-car invoice for the vehicle which showed the price to be $5,671. She denied agreeing at any time to pay Swersky the sum of $12,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Walker admitted that her signature appeared on the note in question but denied signing the document. She testified, \u201cI haven\u2019t signed anything.\u201d Walker claimed that she had paid a total of $7,250 through October 1981, thus fulfilling her original bargain with Swersky. Neither Swersky nor Miller, the purported witness to Walker\u2019s signature on the note, testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">In remarks from the bench following the trial, the court below ruled that Lawton was not a holder in due course. The basis for the ruling is not clear. At several points during his comments, the judge seemed to decide that Lawton was not a holder in due course because a bulk transaction was involved. The court concluded that because Lawton was not a holder in due course, he was \u201csubject to the defenses.\u201d Accordingly, the court determined that Walker had \u201csatisfied\u201d her contract with Swersky. The judgment order subsequently entered in favor of the defendant does not assign a reason for the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Pertinent to our decision are the following italicized portions of Code \u00a7 8.3-302, a part of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\">\u201c\u00a7 8.3-302. Holder in due course. \u2014 (1) <em>A holder in due course is a holder who takes the instrument</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">(a) for value; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">(b) <em>in good faith; and</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">(c) <em>without notice </em>that it is overdue or has been dishonored or <em>of any defense against or claim to it on the part of any person.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">(2) A payee may be a holder in due course.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-9\">(3) <em>A holder does not become a holder in due course of an instrument:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-10\">(a) by purchase of it at judicial sale or by taking it under legal process; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-11\">(b) by acquiring it in taking over an estate; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-12\">(c) <em>by purchasing it as part of a bulk transaction not in regular course of business of the transferor.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-13\">(4) A purchaser of a limited interest can be a holder in due course only to the extent of the interest purchased.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-14\">On appeal, the parties do not dispute that the document in question is an \u201cinstrument,\u201d meaning a \u201cnegotiable instrument,\u201d \u00a7 8.3-102(e), nor do they dispute that Lawton took the instrument for \u201cvalue.\u201d However, the plaintiff insists he also took the note \u201cin good faith\u201d and \u201cwithout notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-15\">The defendant asserts the plaintiff did not act in good faith and had notice of certain defenses to the payment of the note. The defendant also argues that the trial court \u201cdid not err in finding that the plaintiff purchased the note in question as part of a bulk transaction not in the regular course of business of the transferor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-16\">Additionally, defendant contends that even if the plaintiff was a holder in due course, he took the note subject to the \u201creal\u201d defense of fraud in the factum outlined in \u00a7 8.3-305(2)(c). That section provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-17\">\u201cTo the extent that a holder is a holder in due course he takes the instrument free from</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>(2) all defenses of any party to the instrument with whom the holder has not dealt except</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-4\">(c) such misrepresentation as has induced the party to sign the instrument with neither knowledge nor reasonable opportunity to obtain knowledge of its character or its essential terms. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The difficulty with this contention is that the trial court did not find fraud in the factum. Indeed, the court would have erred in so finding because there was insufficient evidence to sustain that defense. Thus, we reject this contention and, for the reasons that follow, reject defendant\u2019s arguments with respect to good faith, notice of defenses, and bulk transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">On the subject of good faith, the UCC provides that the term \u201cmeans honesty in fact in the conduct or transaction concerned.\u201d \u00a7 8.1-201(19). Good faith does not encompass a concept of negligence; the test is a subjective one. An act is deemed to be done in good faith, within the meaning of the UCC, if it is done honestly, whether or not it is performed negligently. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Potomac Savings Bank, </em>160 Va. 597, 606-07, 169 S.E. 922, 925 (1933) (pre-UCC case in accord with UCC definition, Virginia Comment, Code \u00a7 8.3-304). Under this test, good faith is determined by looking to the mind of the particular holder who asserts that he is a holder in due course, and not by focusing on what the state of mind of a reasonably prudent person should have been. <em>Breslin </em>v. <em>New Jersey Investors, Inc., </em>70 N.J. 466, 471, 361 A.2d 1, 3-4 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">In the present case, the evidence dealing with the circumstances of the Lawton-Walker transaction is insufficient to raise an inference of lack of good faith on Lawton\u2019s part. He testified that the instant transaction was his \u201cfirst try\u201d at the business of purchasing commercial paper. He stated he was unaware of any \u201cproblems\u201d with the note. Lawton thought the Swersky-Walker transaction was \u201ca straight cash sale,\u201d without interest, in which Swersky allowed Walker to pay for the automobile over a period of ten years. Nothing in the evidence suggests, and the trial court did not find, that Lawton\u2019s subjective intent was dishonest.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">The statutory requirements of taking \u201cin good faith\u201d and \u201cwithout notice\u201d are interrelated concepts. Virginia Comment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Code \u00a7 8.3-304. Insofar as pertinent here on the subject of notice, Code \u00a7 8.3-304 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-4\">\u201c(1) The purchaser has notice of a claim or defense if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">(a) the instrument is ... so irregular as to call into question its validity, ... or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">(b) the purchaser has notice that the obligation of any party is voidable in whole or in part, . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">(7) In any event, to constitute notice of a claim or defense, the purchaser must have knowledge of the claim or defense or knowledge of such facts that his action in taking the instrument amounts to bad faith. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Code \u00a7 8.1-201(25) provides that a person has \u201cnotice\u201d of a fact when \u201c(a) he has actual knowledge of it; or (b) he has received a notice or notification of it; or (c) from all the facts and circumstances known to him at the time in question he has reason to know that it exists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">In arguing the plaintiff took the note with \u201cnotice,\u201d defendant contends that, from all the facts and circumstances known to Lawton at the time he purchased the note, he is deemed to have been aware of the \u201crotten\u201d transaction between Walker and Swersky. Defendant points out that the instrument involved \u201conly\u201d the sale of a 1976 Ford automobile, purchased by an individual, for the alleged price of $12,000 interest free, to be paid in 120 installments, with no evidence of financing or disclosure statements required by consumer-protection laws. Walker also contends that the underlying obligation \u201cwas at a minimum voidable in part,\u201d under \u00a7 8.3-304(l)(b), because it should have been obvious to Lawton that the loan was made at a usurious rate of interest. The \u201cirregularities,\u201d the argument continues, demonstrate a scheme \u201cdetrimental\u201d to Walker, and Lawton\u2019s \u201cprotestations of ignorance . . . were nothing more than an effort to take advantage of an obviously shady transaction.\u201d Again, the difficulty with defendant\u2019s argument on this issue is that the record fails to support her conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">According to paragraph 2 of the UCC Official Comment, the irregularity contemplated in \u00a7 8.3-304(l)(a) is \u201cnotice to the purchaser of something wrong.\u201d More specifically, the fact that the purchaser may have acted negligently or may have been af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>fected with notice of suspicious circumstances is insufficient under \u00a7 8.3-304 to deny him the status of holder in due course. <em>Crum </em>v. <em>Hanna, </em>140 Va. 366, 369, 125 S.E. 219, 220 (1924). Under the UCC and the cases, the holder must have either actual knowledge of the infirmity in the instrument or knowledge of such facts that his action in taking the instrument amounts to bad faith. <em>National Bank of Suffolk </em>v. <em>American Bank and Trust Company, </em>163 Va. 710, 723-24, 177 S.E. 229, 234 (1934); <em>City National Bank </em>v. <em>Hundley, </em>112 Va. 51, 70 S.E. 494 (1911).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Even though Lawton may have been negligent and even though the circumstances may have been suspicious, we cannot say from this evidence that he acted in bad faith. Lawton\u2019s actual knowledge of the underlying transaction was limited to an awareness of a note with no \u201cproblems\u201d which had been given in connection with a \u201cstraight cash sale,\u201d payments to be made over an extended period. Under these circumstances, Lawton cannot be charged with knowledge that an exorbitant amount of interest was concealed within the sum due or that the Swersky-Walker transaction was \u201crotten,\u201d especially when the evidence requires pure speculation to reach such conclusions. A naked denial by Walker that she executed the instrument or that she agreed to pay Swersky $12,000 furnishes no basis for a contrary finding. And, significantly, the trial court did not find that Lawton acted in bad faith and with notice of a claim or defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">In conclusion, we will comment briefly on defendant\u2019s bulk-purchase contention made on brief, which was all but abandoned during oral argument. Under \u00a7 8.3-302(3)(c), one is not a due course holder if he purchased the instrument \u201cas part of a bulk transaction not in regular course of business of the transferor.\u201d According to paragraph 3 of the Official Comment, this subsection was intended to state existing law and to cover \u201ca few situations in which the purchaser takes the instrument under unusual circumstances which indicate that he is merely a successor in interest to the prior holder.\u201d <em>See Baach </em>v. <em>Bank of Pocahontas, </em>157 Va. 274, 282-83, 160 S.E. 68, 70-71 (1931). The Comment states that the subsection \u201capplies to bulk purchases lying outside of the ordinary course of business of the seller,\u201d as when a reorganized or consolidated corporation takes over in bulk the assets of a predecessor. But here, there was a transfer from Swersky to Lawton in the regular course of Swersky\u2019s commercial dealing. It is true that Lawton answered affirmatively on cross-examination to the ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>tion calling for the legal conclusion whether he purchased the instrument \u201cin bulk.\u201d Nonetheless, the evidence as a whole shows clearly that Lawton was not taking over Swersky\u2019s entire assets in bulk under unusual circumstances indicating he was Swersky\u2019s successor in interest. Consequently, Lawton\u2019s status as a holder in due course was not affected by the nature of the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Therefore, we will reverse the judgment in favor of the defendant and enter final judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $4,950.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
