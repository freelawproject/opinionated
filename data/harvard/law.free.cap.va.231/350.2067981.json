Marks and others, Trustees of the City of Newport News Employees\u2019 Retirement Fund. The bill alleged that Richard was the sole surviving child of Charles Louis Sanzo, a city firefighter who died February 2, 1969, from injuries received in the line of duty. The bill sought the entry of a decree requiring the Trustees to accord Richard Sanzo full death benefits payable from the Retirement Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">In response, the Trustees admitted that Charles Sanzo died in the line of duty and that he was a member in good standing of the Retirement Fund at the time of his death. The Trustees denied, however, that Richard was the child of Charles Sanzo or a beneficiary under the terms of the retirement ordinance in effect at the time of Charles Sanzo\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">The chancellor heard the matter ore tenus and ruled in a letter opinion that Richard was the child of Charles Sanzo. In a final decree, the chancellor ordered the Trustees to pay Richard death benefits of $310.42 per month from the date of Charles Sanzo\u2019s death, together with interest at statutory rates \u201cfrom the time each said monthly installment was due and payable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">The record shows that Charles Sanzo became a firefighter for the City of Newport News on January 25, 1965. In March of the same year, he met and \u201cfell in love\u201d with Patricia Mable Shelton. He moved into her home, and they lived together until his death in 1969. Although they never went through a marriage ceremony, the chancellor found that they \u201crepresented themselves to the community as married.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Patricia Shelton gave birth to a son, the child involved in this case, on August 18, 1966. The child\u2019s birth certificate showed his name as Richard Douglas Shelton, and a space provided for the name of the father was left blank. The child lived with his mother and Charles Sanzo until the latter\u2019s death. Charles Sanzo did not notify the Retirement Fund that he had a son. Consequently, upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>the death of Charles, the Fund paid Charles\u2019 mother, Madeline Sanzo, death benefits of $3,141.10.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Approximately one year after Charles Sanzo\u2019s death, Patricia Shelton disappeared \u201cin the middle of the night,\u201d taking Richard with her. Later, Charles\u2019 parents, Madeline and Joseph Sanzo, learned Richard was in the custody of the \u201cWelfare in California\u201d and that \u201che was going to be adopted out.\u201d The senior Sanzos obtained custody of Richard and brought him to their Hampton, Virginia home in June, 1975. They instituted proceedings to adopt Richard, and by order entered December 10, 1976, the. Circuit Court of the City of Hampton allowed the adoption and the change of Richard\u2019s name from Shelton to Sanzo.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">On September 2, 1980, Richard Sanzo, by his adoptive father and next friend, filed application with the Retirement Fund for the payment of benefits allegedly due Richard as the surviving child of Charles Sanzo. On November 25, 1980, the Fund denied the application, and this litigation followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">In the trial court, the Trustees contended that Code \u00a7 20-61.1<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> required Richard Sanzo to prove Charles Sanzo had admitted in court he was Richard\u2019s father or had voluntarily admitted paternity in writing, under oath. In their appellate briefs, the Trustees argued that the chancellor had erred in failing to impose the \u00a7 20-61.1 burden of proof upon Richard Sanzo.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">In oral argument, however, the Trustees conceded that Code \u00a7 20-61.1 no longer applied because the version of the statute upon which they relied was held unconstitutional in <em>Jones </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number><em>Robinson, </em>229 Va. 276, 287, 329 S.E.2d 794, 802 (1985), decided after appellate briefs were filed in the present case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Trustees also conceded in oral argument that proof by a preponderance of evidence was Richard Sanzo\u2019s proper burden. The Trustees insisted, however, that Richard Sanzo had failed to prove paternity even under this lesser burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">In their appellate briefs and in oral argument, the Trustees also contended that the chancellor erred in relying upon Code \u00a7 65.1-66, a part of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, to establish the standard of proof of paternity in this case. The Trustees say this was an attempt by the chancellor to combine the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act with the City\u2019s Retirement Fund when, in fact, there is no connection between the two and any effort to equate one with the other would be \u201ctotally inappropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">We cannot find, however, where the chancellor even mentioned the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act or Code \u00a7 65.1-66 either in his letter opinion or in his final decree. Code \u00a7 65.1-66 does define the term \u201cchild,\u201d as used in the section, to include \u201can acknowledged illegitimate child\u201d and the chancellor did use the term \u201cacknowledged\u201d when ruling in his letter opinion that Richard was Charles Sanzo\u2019s child. But this does not mean the chancellor \u201ccombined\u201d the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act with the City\u2019s Retirement Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">As Richard Sanzo suggests, the chancellor may have consulted the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act for guidance in determining the meaning of the term \u201cchild,\u201d as used in the City\u2019s retirement ordinance. The ordinance does not define \u201cchild,\u201d but it does define a compensable death as one \u201carising out of and in the course of employment from a cause compensable under the Virginia Workmen\u2019s [now Workers\u2019] Compensation Act.\u201d Given the ordinance\u2019s lack of a definition of the term \u201cchild\u201d and its reference to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act for the definition of a compensable death, we think it was not inappropriate for the chancellor to consult the Act for guidance in determining the meaning of the term \u201cchild,\u201d if he did, in fact, consult the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">But whether the chancellor was prompted to employ the term \u201cacknowledged\u201d from consulting the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act or from the use of his own common sense, the result is the same. Reliance upon a putative father\u2019s acknowledgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>paternity is certainly a logical and satisfactory way of deciding the difficult questions involved in this type of case.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The record in the present proceeding abounds with instances of acknowledgment by Charles Sanzo that Richard was his child. These acknowledgements were made not only to Charles Sanzo\u2019s mother, who became Richard\u2019s adoptive mother, but also to a number of witnesses who had no interest, financial or otherwise, in the outcome of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Notable in this group of disinterested witnesses was Eugene M. Jordan, an attorney. He testified that Charles Sanzo and Patricia Shelton consulted him on February 2, 1968, when Richard was approximately 18 months old, about having the child\u2019s surname changed from Shelton to Sanzo. In Jordan\u2019s conversation with Charles and Patricia, they represented themselves as husband and wife, and Charles stated he was Richard\u2019s \u201cnatural father.\u201d The change of name, however, had not been accomplished by the time Charles Sanzo died.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">We are of opinion that the evidence concerning Charles Sanzo\u2019s acknowledgment of paternity, coupled with other evidence showing his treatment of the child as his own, was more than sufficient to carry Richard\u2019s burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. The City offered nothing to contradict Richard\u2019s evidence in any way. Accordingly, we hold that the chancellor\u2019s finding of paternity was amply supported by evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The Trustees argue, however, that the trial court erroneously admitted into evidence certain hearsay statements made by Patricia Shelton concerning Richard\u2019s paternity and that when this evidence is disregarded, the remaining evidence is insufficient to support the chancellor\u2019s finding of paternity. We disagree with the Trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The trial court admitted the disputed evidence under the pedigree exception to the hearsay rule. This exception \u201callows consideration of hearsay evidence regarding a person\u2019s family relationship as proof of the existence of the relationship.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Givens, </em>223 Va. 455, 459, 290 S.E.2d 844, 846 (1982).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">Testimony concerning pedigree is well recognized as an exception to the hearsay rule, provided that no . . . better evidence can be obtained, and that the declarant or source of the witness\u2019 information was a member of the family or related to the family, whose history the fact concerns, and was deceased or out of the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number><em>Rawles </em>v. <em>Bazel, </em>141 Va. 734, 755, 126 S.E. 690, 696 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">The Trustees argue that the pedigree exception is inapplicable here because it was not shown that Patricia Shelton was \u201cdeceased or out of the State\u201d at the time of trial. The evidence on this point shows that Patricia Shelton disappeared with Richard from the Tidewater area of Virginia approximately one year after the death of Charles Sanzo in February, 1969. She apparently went to California because Richard became a ward of the Welfare Department of that state and Patricia was on probation or parole in the early 1970s for an offense committed there. In 1972 or 1973, Madeline Sanzo received a Valentine Day\u2019s card from Patricia postmarked in Texas. Since that time, Madeline Sanzo has not received \u201cany word as to [Patricia\u2019s] whereabouts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In preparation for trial, counsel for Richard Sanzo employed Rick Tvelia, a private investigator, in an attempt to determine the whereabouts of Patricia Shelton. In the four and one-half month period preceding the trial, Tvelia conducted an investigation in Virginia, California, and Texas by mail and telephone, consuming some 15 to 20 hours, in an attempt to find Patricia. Tvelia was unable to find her or to learn anything concerning her whereabouts other than the information she was on probation or parole in California in the early 1970s.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Prior to trial, a witness summons was issued for Patricia Shelton. The summons was returned \u201cnot found.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Under these circumstances, we think Richard Sanzo made a prima facie showing that Patricia Shelton was \u201cdeceased or out of the State\u201d and thus not available as a witness either by way of deposition or personal appearance. The Trustees offered no evidence to rebut this prima facie showing. Hence, the trial court did not err in admitting Patricia Shelton\u2019s statements concerning Richard\u2019s paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">The Trustees\u2019 final contention concerns the chancellor\u2019s allowance of interest \u201cfrom the time each . . . monthly installment [of death benefits] was due and payable\u201d to Richard Sanzo. The Trustees argue that they \u201cdid not know, and could not have known, about Mr. Richard Douglas (Shelton) Sanzo\u2019s retirement benefit application until it was actually made in 1980.\u201d Hence, the Trustees say, \u201c[i]t is wrongheaded to conclude that interest payments should be due on installment payments concerning which the . . . Trustees could not have reasonably anticipated payment.\u201d We disagree with the Trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>While the Trustees may not have known of Richard\u2019s <em>application </em>for retirement benefits until it was actually filed in 1980, they concede on brief that they knew of Richard\u2019s <em>existence </em>at the time they awarded death benefits to Madeline Sanzo in 1970. This knowledge on the part of the Trustees was derived from a memorandum dated March 20, 1969, some six and one-half weeks after Charles Sanzo\u2019s death. Authored by the City Attorney, the memorandum apparently was written in response to a claim made on Richard\u2019s behalf for payment of benefits under the Workmen\u2019s (now Workers\u2019) Compensation Act. In the memorandum, the City Attorney opined that \u201cno award for workmen\u2019s compensation should be made\u201d because the evidence indicated Charles Sanzo had \u201cnever acknowledged, under oath or otherwise, that Richard Douglas Shelton is his legal son.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">But aside from the question of the Trustees\u2019 knowledge, whether interest should have been awarded and, if so, from what date interest should run, were matters within the sound discretion of the chancellor. Code \u00a7 8.01-382; <em>Doyle &amp; Russell </em>v. <em>Welch Pile Driving, </em>213 Va. 698, 703, 194 S.E.2d 719, 723 (1973).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">The award of prejudgment interest is to compensate Plaintiff for the loss sustained by not receiving the amount to which he was entitled at the time he was entitled to receive it, and such award is considered necessary to place the [plaintiff] in the position he would have occupied if the party in default had fulfilled his obligated duty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-6\"><em>Employer-Teamsters, Etc. </em>v. <em>Weatherall Concrete, </em>468 F. Supp. 1167, 1171 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">In awarding interest \u201cfrom the time each . . . monthly installment [of death benefits] was due and payable,\u201d the chancellor obviously concluded that Richard Sanzo had suffered loss by not receiving death benefits to which he was entitled when he was entitled to receive them. Upon the record in this case, we cannot say this conclusion was plainly wrong; neither, therefore, can we say the chancellor abused the discretion vested in him.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">We do not overlook the fact that the Trustees, in apparent good faith, paid death benefits to Madeline Sanzo. Richard Sanzo, however, has agreed that if he receives a favorable ruling in this case, the amount paid Madeline Sanzo \u201cwill be repaid or credited, together with interest from the time it was paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>We will affirm the judgment appealed from. In view of Richard Sanzo\u2019s agreement concerning the payment to Madeline Sanzo, we will remand the cause so the trial court can supervise the allowance of a credit against the judgment when it is paid, in accordance with the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">\n<em>Affirmed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-8\"> Under \u00a7 32-24 of the City\u2019s retirement ordinance, the surviving widow of a member of the Retirement Fund is entitled to death benefits.

If no widow or child survives, the benefits are paid to a dependent father or mother.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b372-9\"> At the time of Charles Sanzo\u2019s death, Code \u00a7 20-61.1 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\">Whenever in proceedings hereafter under this chapter concerning a child whose parents are not married, a man admits before any court having jurisdiction to try and dispose of the same, that he is the father of the child or the court finds that the man has voluntarily admitted paternity in writing, under oath, the court may then enter and enforce judgment for the support, maintenance and education of such child as if the child were born in lawful wedlock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-11\">Notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 19-241.1 of any other law, the judge or other court officer before whom a man has admitted paternity of any child, whose support is the subject of any proceeding brought under the provisions of this chapter, may testify, in any court having jurisdiction to conduct proceedings under this chapter, as to any admission of paternity made by such man in his court and as to any other facts directly affecting the relevancy or probative value of such admission.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b373-8\"> The General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 20-61.1 in 1982, Acts 1982, ch. 307, to permit consideration of the results of genetic blood grouping tests.
