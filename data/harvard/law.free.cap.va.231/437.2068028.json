G. Thomas Montgomery and Patricia B. Montgomery own in fee simple one unit in the Columbia Knoll Condominium (the Condominium). The Columbia Knoll Condominium Council of Co-owners (the Council), an association of all unit owners, is responsible for the administration of the Condominium.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The Condominium units do not have individual meters for electrical and gas consumption. Therefore, the utility expenses are apportioned among the unit owners according to the size of their units. Based upon professional advice, the Council\u2019s board of directors recommended the replacement of all windows in the Condominium with insulated windows as the most effective means of reducing the common utility expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">At a meeting of the Council, a majority of the unit owners present voted to replace all the windows at a cost of $125,399.06. The Montgomerys were among the 29% present who opposed the expenditure.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Consequently, the Montgomerys instituted a declaratory judgment proceeding to challenge the Council\u2019s authority to replace the windows in their unit and to assess them the cost thereof without their consent. The trial court ruled that the Council acted within its authority, reasoning that \u201cthere exists a direct, tangible, demonstrable connection between the [Council\u2019s proposed action] and the common good.\u201d The Montgomerys appeal. The Condominium Act, Code \u00a7 55-79.39, <em>et seq., </em>provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">[A] 11 powers and responsibilities with regard to maintenance, repair, renovation, restoration, and replacement of the condominium shall belong (1) to the [Council] in the case of the <em>common </em>elements, and (2) to the individual unit owner in the case of any <em>unit or any part thereof.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Code \u00a7 55-79.79. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">The Council does not dispute that the windows in the Montgomerys\u2019 unit are \u201cpart\u201d of their unit. Indeed, the Condominium\u2019s master deed expressly defines a \u201cunit\u201d as including the windows. Thus, the Montgomerys contend that, because the win<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>dows are part of their unit and not \u201ccommon elements,\u201d the Council has no authority to replace them.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\">The Council, on the other hand, contends that it had authority to install the insulated windows because its action was a \u201creasonable [restriction] on the use of units\u201d and \u201cserve [s] the best interest of all of the [unit] owners.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In support of this contention, the Council cites the following provision of the Condominium\u2019s bylaws:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-4\">VI/SECTION 2. <em>Maintenance and Repair.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">(a) Every co-owner must perform promptly all maintenance and repair work within his own [unit] which, if omitted, would affect the Project and its entirety or in a part belonging to other co-owners, and is expressly responsible for the damages and liabilities which may result from his failure to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The Council\u2019s reliance upon this provision is misplaced. This provision clearly is limited to \u201cmaintenance and repair,\u201d terms which, by definition, do not include improvements. \u201cMaintenance\u201d means to preserve or to keep \u201cin a state of repair,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, </em>1362 (1981), and \u201crepair\u201d means to fix or \u201crestore . . . what is torn or broken.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1923.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">The installation of insulated windows clearly is an improvement \u2014 an enhancement in quality \u2014 to the individual units; it cannot be characterized as maintenance or repair. Nothing in the statute or the Condominium instruments authorizes the Council to improve the Montgomerys\u2019 unit against their will and at their expense. We conclude, therefore, that the Council exceeded its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and enter a final judgment in favor of the Montgomerys.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b459-10\">The Council relies in part on Article VI, Section 6 of the Condominium\u2019s bylaws to support its assertion of authority. We find no merit to this argument. Section 6, entitled <em>\u201cRules of </em>Conduct,\u201d governs the <em>conduct </em>of the unit owners, assuring the aesthetics of the common elements and the safety and peaceful enjoyment of all owners. Section 6 has no application whatsoever to the Council\u2019s authority over the unit owners\u2019 fee simple interest in their individual units.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
