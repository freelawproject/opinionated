In 1974, plaintiff sought psychiatric treatment, complaining that he was nervous and believed his bosses and coemployees were against him. He related a specific incident when a general foreman yelled \"you are crazy\u201d into his ear, subsequently causing him to hear roaring sounds in his head.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The plaintiff was later transferred to a different shift and experienced a decline in his psychiatric symptoms. However, following a return to his regular shift, the plaintiff\u2019s symptoms reappeared. He was treated for these symptoms on many occasions in the plant medical department, but the culmination of these problems led to the plaintiff\u2019s eventual placement on medical leave on September 27, 1975. On October 1, 1975, although still on medical leave, allegedly commanded by voices, he returned to the plant and attempted to convince plant officials to turn off the machine he believed was controlling his mind. The following afternoon, again \"commanded to do so by the voices he was hearing,\u201d he attempted suicide by jumping off an 1-75 overpass. The multiple injuries sustained in the fall rendered plaintiff a paraplegic.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">The plaintiff was denied benefits by a hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>referee, but, on appeal, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board, in applying the \"honest perception\u201d standard of <em>Deziel (After Remand), supra, </em>found that work stresses \"contributed to his illness, attempted suicide, and resulting disability.\u201d Subsequently, leave to appeal was denied by the Court of Appeals. However, application for leave to appeal in this Court was held in abeyance pending decision in <em>Selk v Detroit Plastic Products Co, </em>419 Mich 1; 345 NW2d 184 (1984). Following <em>Selk, </em>this Court granted leave to appeal on September 19, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">The pertinent rule of statutory construction used to determine the effect an amendatory act has on transactions and events completed prior to its enactment is set forth in 1A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction (4th ed), \u00a7 22.36, pp 300-301:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">In accordance with the rule applicable to original acts, it is presumed that provisions added by the amendment affecting substantive rights are intended to operate prospectively.

375 NW2d 715 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">The majority does not set forth and acknowledge its decisions in <em>Selk </em>and <em>Franks </em>on the retroactivity-prospectivity of the 1980 and 1981 reform legislation, or make any effort to explain how its decision today might be reconciled with its decisions in those cases other than to quote a generali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>zation that an amendatory act affecting substantive rights is presumed to operate prospectively, and not to \"transactions and events completed prior to its enactment\u201d absent an express or implied statement or circumstances surrounding enactment indicating a contrary legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Without further discussion, the majority holds that because there is \"no indication the Legislature intended that\u201d \u00a7 301(2) \"have any other interpretation,\u201d the section affects \"only those personal injuries occurring on or after January 1, 1982.\u201d There is no consideration of whether the January 1, 1982 specific effective date might not be indicative of a contrary legislative intent, of an intent that \u00a7 301(2) apply, as in <em>Franks, </em>to weekly benefit periods commencing on and after January 1, 1982, although the injury or disability occurred before that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">In <em>Selk, supra, </em>pp 34-35, this Court held on resubmission that the date of the award was \"not determinative,\u201d and that \"it is the date of payment which triggers the application of the [increase in interest payable on unpaid compensation from five percent to the twelve-percent] rate\u201d enacted as part of the 1981 reform legislation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The 1981 reform act considered in <em>Selk, </em>like the 1980 reform act being considered in this case, also had a specific January 1, 1982, effective date.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">In <em>Franks </em>and the companion cases of <em>Chambers </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>and <em>Gomez v General Motors Corp, </em>this Court considered the effective date question in the context of the provisions of the 1980<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 1981<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> reform legislation providing for the coordination of workers\u2019 compensation benefits and unemployment compensation, social security, and pension retirement benefits. Those amendatory acts also provided a specific effective date of January 1, 1982.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This Court held \u2014 although the amendments under consideration affected substantive rights \u2014 that the coordination provisions of the 1980 and 1981 reform legislation were applicable to weekly benefit periods commencing on or after the effective date although the injury or disability, and resulting entitlement to workers\u2019 compensation benefits under prior law, occurred and arose before January 1, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Thus, in sum, this Court has held that the date of award is not determinative <em>(Selk), </em>the date of injury is not determinative <em>(Franks), </em>and the date of payment is determinative <em>(Selk). </em>This suggests, consistent with <em>Selk </em>and <em>Franks, </em>that amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>\u00a7 301(2) is effective as to weekly benefit periods commencing on and after January 1, 1982, without regard to the date of injury or disability or of award. Nevertheless, the Court holds today that the date of injury is determinative for the purposes of \u00a7 301(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">I dissented in <em>Selk </em>and concurred in <em>Franks. </em>In my view, the specific effective date of January 1, 1982, is determinative. In both <em>Selk </em>and <em>Franks, </em>I wrote that the Legislature, by providing a specific effective date of January 1, 1982, evidenced its intent not to leave the matter open to judicial construction, and meant that the amendatory act applies to weekly benefit periods commencing on and after the specific effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">In <em>Selk, supra, </em>p 36,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> I expressed the view that interest accrued at the higher twelve-percent rate on and after, but not before, the January 1, 1982, effective date, without regard to the date of award or payment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">In <em>Franks, supra, </em>p 678,1 agreed with the majority that the provisions of the 1980 and 1981 reform legislation requiring the coordination of benefits were applicable to weekly benefit periods commencing on and after the effective date although the injury or disability occurred before January 1, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>The generally conflicting<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> rules of statutory construction, the empty distinction between an amendatory act concerning a substantive right and an amendatory act concerning remedy or procedure, need not be and should not be invoked where the Legislature has provided a specific effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">The legislative purpose in providing a specific future effective date was to indicate when the provision of this amendatory act superseding the \"honestly, even though mistakenly\u201d component of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Deziel v Difco Laboratories, Inc (After Remand), </em>403 Mich 1; 268 NW2d 1 (1978), would take effect. In stating that \"this amendatory act should take effect January 1, 1982,\u201d the Legislature indicated its intention that the superseding provision would become effective on January 1, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The superseding provision is a subject matter of this amendatory act; a purpose of the act is to supersede the honest though mistaken component of <em>Deziel. </em>The apparent purpose of the January 1, 1982 effective date was to state when the Legislature desired the provisions of the amendatory act so superseding <em>Deziel </em>to become effective. The words \"this amendatory act shall take effect January 1, 1982\u201d thus mean that the honest though mistaken component of <em>Deziel </em>is superseded, effective on January 1, 1982, and not before that date. Accordingly \u2014 I agree with the majority that \u2014 the superseding provision does not apply to weekly benefit periods commencing before January 1, 1982, but \u2014 and here I find myself in disagreement with the majority \u2014 does apply as to each weekly benefit period commencing on and after that date although the worker was injured or disabled before that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">In the instant case, the majority, in deciding that the amendment of \u00a7 301(2) has prospective application, indicates, although it does not state, that the amendment affects \"substantive rights.\u201d The coordination provisions of the 1980 and 1981 reform legislation \u2014 held in <em>Franks </em>to be applicable to weekly payments of workers\u2019 compensation benefits that became payable on or after the effective date although the injury or disability, and resulting entitlement to workers\u2019 compensation benefits under prior law, occurred and arose before January 1, 1982 \u2014 also affected substantive rights. Workers\u2019 compensation benefits payable to persons as a result of injuries or disabilities that occurred before January 1, 1982, were reduced or eliminated altogether as a result of the enactment of the coordination provisions and this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Franks </em>holding that the coordination provisions applied to weekly benefit periods that commenced on or after the effective dates although the worker was injured before January 1, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The question ultimately turns on what the Court perceives to have been the legislative intent. In <em>Hlady v Wolverine Bolt Co, </em>393 Mich 368, 391; 224 NW2d 856 (1975), I observed that a change in law, just as a change in facts, may justify or require a redetermination of entitlement to workers\u2019 compensation benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">Workmen\u2019s compensation disability benefits, like social security and unemployment compensation benefits, are a form of income maintenance for persons whose wage-earning capacity has been suspended or terminated. A claimant\u2019s entitlement to such benefits depends on the circumstances at the time of application and payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">A change in law, statutory or judge-made, like a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>change in fact, can effect a change in circumstances justifying, upon application of worker or employer, an award of benefits or termination or suspension of benefits previously awarded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-4\">The right to workmen\u2019s compensation disability benefits depends on whether, at a given point in time, the claimant is within the statutory intendment. The scope of that intendment is subject to change. A determination that a claimant is not today entitled to disability benefits does, not preclude reexamination of his entitlement should the facts or the law, by legislative amendment or court decision, change tomorrow. Entitlement to continuing disability benefits is an open question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">This Court said in <em>Franks, supra </em>at 654:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">Workers\u2019 compensation benefits are social-welfare income-maintenance benefits. Workers\u2019 compensation is the first or progenitor safety net providing a means of income maintenance for persons who have met misfortune or whose regular income source has been cut off. All the social welfare programs \u2014 workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment compensation, social security old age, disability, and survivors benefits, no-fault automobile benefits, aid to families with dependent children, and general assistance \u2014 are directed to the same objective, income maintenance. All these programs are funded by impositions on employers and others of mandatory payments (to the government, insurers or, in the case of the self-insured, to the beneficiary), with statutorily prescribed benefits. In providing for such benefits, the Legislature did not covenant not to amend the legislation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">Income-maintenance benefits payable under a legislatively mandated social welfare program are not property protected by the Due Process Clause, the Contract Clause, or the Takings Clause from substantive change by subsequent legislation irrespective of whether the recipient contributed to the cost of funding the benefit or of whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>program replaces a tort remedy which has been abolished.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">In <em>Franks, supra </em>at 683,1 said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">Workers\u2019 compensation benefits are payable weekly, and are geared to weekly wage loss. The nature of workers\u2019 compensation is that events after an award of benefits may change the extent of an entitlement to benefits. A disabled worker may cease to be disabled or obtain gainful employment. The number of the worker\u2019s dependents may change. The right to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits thus generally depends on one\u2019s status, week by week, and is subject to change during any week. [Levin, J., concurring.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Although each of the four amendatory provisions considered in <em>Selk, Franks,</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and the instant case was set forth in an act stating that the amendatory provision would \"take effect January 1, 1982,\u201d this Court has given those words a different meaning in each case, moving from date of award on or after January 1, 1982, in <em>Selk </em>(on original submission), to date of payment on or after January 1, 1982 in <em>Selk </em>(on resubmission), to weekly benefit period commencing on or after January 1, 1982, in <em>Franks, </em>to personal injury occurring on or after January 1, 1982, in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Absent our attention being called to something in the language or in the history of the 1980 reform legislation that would justify the conclusion that the Legislature, which expressly stated that the amendment of \u00a7 301(2) was to become <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>effective on January 1, 1982, did not intend that the amendment would become effective as to weekly benefit periods commencing on and after that date, without regard to whether the injury or disability occurred before that date, I would hold that the amendment of \u00a7 301(2) is effective as to weekly benefit periods commencing on and after January 1, 1982, whether or not the injury or disability occurred before that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">Intuitions that the Legislature \"could not\u201d have intended to defeat injured or disabled worker expectations based on past determinations, or to require redetermination of eligibility or entitlement where an employer claims that the amendment of \u00a7 301(2) justifies a change in a former determination do not, in my judgment, provide an adequate basis for reading the specific effective date \u2014 contrary to our decision in <em>Franks </em>\u2014 as if the Legislature had added before the words \"January 1, 1982\u201d the words \"as to injuries and disabilities that occur on or after.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">To be sure there is a difference between an amendment that might require a redetermination of eligibility or entitlement (\u00a7 301[2]) and an amendment providing for a setoff (coordination of benefits dealt with in <em>Franks) </em>that reduces or eliminates altogether benefits resulting from a prior determination of eligibility or entitlement, but the difference is not a substantive or legal difference. The Court indicates that \u00a7 301(2) involves a \"substantive right,\u201d but has not explained the substantive difference between the amendment at issue in this case and the amendment at issue in <em>Franks.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">If the Court were to adopt the construction I would adopt, it would mean that in those cases where the employer asserts that the change in law brought about by \u00a7 301(2) terminates the employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>er\u2019s obligation to pay benefits that under prior law it is obligated to pay, the employer could, by filing a petition to stop payment of benefits<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> with the bureau of workers\u2019 compensation, apply for a hearing seeking a determination that benefits are no longer, as of January 1, 1982, payable. Until the employer received a favorable determination, it would be obligated to continue to make payments pursuant to any prior determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">In the instant case, the employer, Ford Motor Company, argued that the amendment of \u00a7 301(2) was fully retroactive in all cases pending before an administrative tribunal or the appellate courts on January 1, 1982, with the result that weekly benefits that became payable before, as well as after, January 1, 1982, that would no longer be payable under the provisions of amended \u00a7 301(2), would be eliminated. Because, in my view, the specific eifective date of January 1, 1982, is determinative, I join with the majority in rejecting Ford\u2019s claim that the amendment of \u00a7 301(2) was fully retroactive in all pending cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Ford did not alternatively contend that if this Court rejects its claim that \u00a7 301(2) is fully retroactive it should hold that \u00a7 301(2) nevertheless limits its obligation to pay weekly benefits, that otherwise would become payable on and after January 1, 1982, in respect to injuries or disabilities that occurred before that date. Because Ford did not make that alternative argument, the Court does not have the alternative question before it. Interested parties, who might seek to file amicus briefs on the question, have not had an opportunity to brief and argue the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Recognizing that the precise question is not before us and that judgment should be reserved until the question is presented, I have had no alternative but to now address the question because the Court holds that \u00a7 301(2) applies \"only\u201d to personal injuries occurring on or after January 1, 1982.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-14\"> \"(2) Mental disabilities and conditions of the aging process, including but not limited to heart and cardiovascular conditions, shall be compensable if contributed to or aggravated or accelerated by the employment in a significant manner.
