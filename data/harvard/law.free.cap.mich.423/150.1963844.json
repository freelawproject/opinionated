We granted leave to appeal in order to consider a number of assignments of error relating to the trial court\u2019s handling of the jury-instruction phase of the trial, specifically, the court\u2019s refusal to advise counsel before final argument what instructions the jury would be given, the failure to give the \"material substance\u201d of the plaintiffs\u2019 theories of the case, and the refusal to give a number of proposed jury instructions requested by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">The facts of the case insofar as they are pertinent to our decision are as follows: Pulte Homes, Inc., was the developer and general contractor for a residential construction project in the City of Troy. Defendant Clyde Cinader was employed by Pulte Homes as a subcontractor under a written contract with Pulte to provide backfill and grading work at the construction site. Clyde Cinader was not present when the plaintiff was injured, al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>though his employee and son, Scott Cinader, and another employee, Duane Joyce, were present. Marvin Moody was hired by Clyde Cinader to haul dirt at the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The testimony of the various witnesses differs sharply as to how Moody was injured. It appears incontrovertible, however, that the injury occurred when Moody\u2019s left hand was caught between a fan belt and a pulley while Moody was helping Scott Cinader start a bulldozer. There was sharply conflicting testimony whether Scott Cinader started the bulldozer while Moody\u2019s hand was in the area of the fan belt and pulley, or whether Moody started the engine himself by placing a piece of metal across a solenoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Moody and his wife filed a two-count complaint against Pulte Homes and Clyde Cinader. Count I of the complaint alleged that the work undertaken by Pulte Homes through its contractor, Clyde Cinader, was inherently dangerous and that Pulte Homes was \"vicariously liable\u201d for the negligent acts of Cinader and directly liable for its own negligence in hiring a careless and incompetent contractor, in failing to exercise control over the personnel and equipment on the project, and in failing to supervise the project. Count I also alleged that Cinader was directly negligent in hiring incompetent employees and permitting them to operate heavy equipment and in failing to adequately supervise and inspect the project. Plaintiffs also alleged that Cinader was vicariously liable for the negligence of his employee and son, Scott Cinader, in starting and operating the bulldozer without warning to the plaintiff,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and without permitting the plaintiff to leave the vicinity of the bulldozer.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Count II of the complaint alleged that plaintiff was a third-party beneficiary of a written contract between the defendants that imposed various duties upon each of them regarding project safety and the safety of personnel on the job site. At the close of plaintiffs\u2019 proofs, the trial court granted a motion for a directed verdict as to Count II in favor of Pulte Homes. At the close of all the proofs, the jury returned a verdict of no cause of action, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 125 Mich App 739; 337 NW2d 283 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In the first of the assignments of error we address, plaintiff claims to have been unfairly prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s failure to advise counsel, prior to closing arguments, which of the proposed jury instructions requested by the parties would be given and which would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">At the close of the proofs, counsel for all the parties presented to the court their requests for jury instructions. After listening to argument concerning the proposed instructions, the court directed the attorneys to proceed with closing arguments, without indicating which of the parties\u2019 requested instructions, if any, would be given. The plaintiff objected. The following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\"><em>The Court: </em>Bring in the jury Mr. Grekonich.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\"><em>[.Plaintiff\u2019s </em>Counsel]: Your Honor, may we have a ruling on the instructions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-9\"><em>The Court: </em>No. Just follow along. I\u2019ll give the instructions to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">(Whereupon the jury was escorted into and seated in the Courtroom)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-11\"><em>[Plaintiff\u2019s </em>Counsel]: Could we approach the bench?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-12\"><em>The Court: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>(Whereupon counsel approached the bench, off the record.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-4\">After closing arguments, the following occurred:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">(Whereupon the Court Officer was duly sworn the the [sic] jury excused from the Courtroom at approximately 5:45 p.m.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\"><em>The Court: </em>The record should reflect that [plaintiff\u2019s counsel] asked earlier that the Court rule in advance on the various discussions or conflicts between their attitudes about the proposed jury instructions. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\"><em>[PlaintifFs </em>Counsel]: Yes, your Honor. I simply want the record to show a clear objection to the Court\u2019s failing to rule before our having to argue to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\"><em>The Court: </em>Yes, and I want the record to show that you are not now just bringing it up. You did bring it up earlier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\"><em>[Plaintiff\u2019s </em>Counsel]: Yes, thank you your Honor. And I assume and the Court presumes there is an objection to the Court\u2019s failure to give many of the proffered instructions that were not given?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-10\"><em>The Court: </em>Yes. Let the record reflect, because this is the time, and I take it neither counsel has abandoned your request for the jury instructions that you made that were not given. Any that were not given, you have not abandoned that request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-11\"><em>[Plaintiff\u2019s </em>Counsel]: Yes, that is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-12\"><em>[Defense </em>Counsel]: That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-13\"><em>[Plaintiff\u2019s </em>Counsel]: And I object to the Court\u2019s refusal to give those that the Court did not give.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-14\"><em>The Court: </em>Likewise true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-15\"><em>[Defense </em>Counsel]: Yes, but I\u2019m happy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-16\">Plaintiff claims that the court\u2019s refusal to advise counsel prior to closing arguments which, if any, of the requested jury instructions would be given is error.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-17\">We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>GCR 1963, 516.1<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-4\">Request for Instructions. At or before the close of the evidence, any party may, or at any time the Court reasonably directs, the parties shall, file written requests that the Court instruct the jury on the law as set forth in the request. A copy of such requested instructions shall be served on the adverse parties in accordance with [GCR 1963,] 107. <em>The court shall inform counsel of its proposed action on the requests prior to their arguments to the jury, and, subject to the provision of subrule 516.3, shall instruct the jury after the arguments are completed. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The court gave no reason for its failure to comply with the court rule, and none is evident from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The purpose of the rule that requires that counsel shall be informed, prior to addressing the jury, of the court\u2019s decision concerning requested instructions is, of course, to enable counsel to tailor the closing argument to the facts of the case in the context of the law that the court will advise the jury is applicable. If the court decides not to give one or more instructions requested by counsel, particularly instructions critical of a party\u2019s theory of recovery, counsel should know that before addressing the jury, not only to avoid embarrassment and the appearance of ineptness, but to avoid needless comment upon irrelevant matters, to avoid the risk of alienating jurors with what may appear, to them, to be unfair attention to inconsequential or inappropriate matters or even an attempt to confuse them. More importantly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>compliance with the rule tends to preclude prejudice to a party that may follow upon any of the foregoing. See <em>Hunt v Deming, </em>375 Mich 581, 585; 134 NW2d 662 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Here, as will be seen shortly, counsel for plaintiff requested at least ten instructions that the trial court did not give, and the court required plaintiff\u2019s counsel to argue without knowing whether or not the instructions would be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">It is obvious from the language of Rule 516.1 that the trial court erred in violating its mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Having found error in the trial court\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 516.1, we must now consider whether such error can be considered harmless. GCR 1963, 529.1. Because we reverse in part the judgment of the Court of Appeals and vacate, on other grounds, the jury\u2019s verdict of no cause of action against defendant Cinader, it is not necessary to address plaintiff\u2019s claim of unfair prejudice from the violation of Rule 516.1 with respect to plaintiff\u2019s claims against Cinader. It suffices to repeat that the rule is mandatory and does not confer upon trial courts the freedom to ignore it. <em>Hunt, supra, </em>p 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">As stated below, however, we affirm the Court of Appeals judgment affirming the verdict of no cause of action in favor of Pulte Homes, Inc. Given the lack of evidence in support of plaintiff\u2019s claims against Pulte, we do not think that the trial court erred in failing to give to the jury plaintiff\u2019s proposed special instructions concerning Pulte\u2019s liability. (See n 19.) Since the evidence did not warrant giving these instructions, the plaintiff was not unfairly prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s failure to inform counsel that it was not going to give them.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">Moreover, our refusal to reverse and remand for a new trial against Pulte Homes on the basis of the trial court\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 516.1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>is not \"inconsistent with substantial justice,\u201d Rule 529.1, because the lack of evidence supporting plaintiffs claims against Pulte would have justified the trial court\u2019s granting of a directed verdict on all of those claims. In their complaint, plaintiffs alleged several theories of liability against Pulte Homes: (1) vicarious liability for the negligent acts of its subcontractor Cinader; (2) direct liability for negligently hiring a careless and incompetent subcontractor; (3) direct liability for negligently failing to exercise control and supervision over the construction project. However, the great bulk of the testimony and arguments presented by plaintiffs in this case related to the alleged negligence of defendant Cinader, particularly his alleged vicarious liability for the acts of his employee, Scott Cinader. There was a complete failure of proof regarding plaintiffs claims of negligent hiring or negligent supervision on the part of Pulte Homes. As for the vicarious liability claim, the general rule is that a general contractor is not liable for the negligent acts of an independent subcontractor in the absence of the right of control. <em>Barlow v Krieghoff Co, </em>310 Mich 195, 198; 16 NW2d 715 (1944). Plaintiff presented no evidence suggesting that Pulte had retained the right to control the personnel or equipment brought onto the construction site. Indeed, the contract between Pulte and Cinader, introduced by plaintiff as a trial exhibit, specifically stated that \"[the] Subcontractor shall be responsible for initiating, maintaining and supervising all safety precautions and programs in connection with the work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Assessing the evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiffs, we are convinced that Pulte Homes would have been entitled to a directed verdict, as a matter of law, on all of plaintiffs claims against it. Therefore, we find the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>court\u2019s violation of Rule 516.1 to be harmless error as to defendant Pulte.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">In his next assignment of error, plaintiff asserts that the trial court erroneously refused to comply with GCR 1963, 302.4(4) and MRE 106 in failing to require Clyde Cinader\u2019s counsel to offer into evidence all or substantially all of Moody\u2019s discovery deposition after a portion of it was offered and received in evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, plaintiff asserts that the Court of Appeals erroneously applied an abuse of discretion standard for reviewing violations of Rule 302.4(4) and MRE 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">GCR 1963, 302.4(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">Use of Depositions. At the trial or upon the hearing of a motion or an interlocutory proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>ing, any part or all of a deposition, so far as admissible under the rules of evidence, may be used against any party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had due notice thereof, in accordance with any 1 of the following provisions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-4\">(4) If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, an adverse party may require him to introduce all of it which is relevant to the part introduced, and any party may introduce any other parts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">MRE 106 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">When a writing or recorded statement or part thereof is introduced by a party, an adverse party may require him at that time to introduce any other part or any other writing or recorded statement which ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously with it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">The above rules are designed to prevent unfairness which may result if a statement is taken out of context. However, a trial court has discretion in ruling on the admissibility of a deposition, and the court\u2019s exercise of discretion will be upheld unless an abuse of discretion is manifest. <em>Hilyer v Hole, </em>114 Mich App 38, 41; 318 NW2d 598 (1982). [125 Mich App 747.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">The Court of Appeals then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-10\">Instead of requiring the defendants to introduce into evidence the portions of Moody\u2019s deposition that were relevant to the starting of the bulldozer, the trial court stated that plaintiffs could introduce the evidence during Moody\u2019s redirect examination. Because the deposition was admitted into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>evidence and brought to the jury\u2019s attention, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying plaintiffs\u2019 request to have defendants introduce into evidence the deposition testimony. [125 Mich App 748.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">We think that the Court of Appeals correctly applied an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing the asserted violation of these court rules. MRE 611(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">The court shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to (1) make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">It is clear that the mode and order of admitting proofs and interrogating witnesses rest within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Coburn v Goldberg, </em>326 Mich 280, 285; 40 NW2d 150 (1949). We do not read GCR 302.4(4)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> nor MRE 106 as eliminating that discretion. See McCormick, Evidence (3d ed), \u00a7 56, p 145. We agree with the Court of Appeals that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in this case because it allowed plaintiff\u2019s counsel to introduce into evidence the other relevant portions of Moody\u2019s deposition on redirect examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Plaintiff also claims entitlement to reversal and a new trial because the trial court erroneously failed to advise the jury of the plaintiffs\u2019 theory of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>the case as required by GCR 1963, 516.7, and erroneously failed to give ten proposed jury instructions requested by the plaintiff. Four of the requested instructions were the following sjis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-4\">SJI2d 3.06 Whether Party Is Insured Is Irrelevant</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGM\">SJI2d 3.10 Circumstantial Evidence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATc\">SJI2d 5.01 Impeachment of a Witness (Not a Party) by Prior Inconsistent Statement or Conduct</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At1U\">SJI2d 5.02 Impeachment of a Party by Prior Inconsistent Statement or Conduct</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The other six instructions requested by plaintiff and rejected by the court are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">Supplemental Proposed Instruction No. 1 Third-Party Beneficiary Contract Liability of Defendant Cinader</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Atc\">Supplemental Proposed Instruction No. 2 Vicarious Liability of Defendant Cinader for Acts of His Employees</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ8\">Special Instruction No. 1 Negligence Arising out of the Failure to Perform a Contractual Obligation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVb\">Special Instruction No. 2 Liability of a General Contractor for Hazardous Work</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1x\">Special Instruction No. 3 Liability of One Contracting an Activity Through Servants or Other Agents</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmQ\">[Untitled] Corporation Liable for Acts of Agents</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-13\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b229-14\">We address first the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the trial court disregarded the requirements of GCR 1963, 516.7 in failing to apprise the jury of plaintiffs\u2019 theory of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-15\">The rule provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>.7 Statement of Issues and Theories of the Parties</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\">(a) The court shall present to the jury the issues in the case and, if a party requests after the close of the evidence, that party\u2019s theory of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">Gj) After the close of the evidence each party shall submit in writing to the court a statement of the issues and, if a party makes a request under subrule .7(a), his theory of the case as to each issue. The statement must be concise, be narrative in form, and set forth as issues only those disputed propositions of fact which are supported by the evidence. It must be submitted in addition to requests for instructions submitted under subrule 516.1. The theory may include those claims supported by the evidence or admitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">(c) The court need not give the statement or theory in the form submitted if the court presents to the jury the material substance of the issues and of the theories of each party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Acknowledging that the trial court is not required to repeat a party\u2019s theory of the case verbatim, plaintiff claims, however, that the court in this case did not give the \"material substance of the issues and . . . the theories\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit against defendant Cinader comprises three theories: (1) Cinader\u2019s negligent failure to properly supervise his employees on the job site as required by Cinader\u2019s contract with defendant Pulte; (2) Cinader\u2019s negligence in placing a bulldozer \"in extraordinarily poor condition\u201d on the job site; (3) the negligent operation of the bulldozer by Cinader\u2019s employees causing plaintiff\u2019s injury. The first and second of the theories are claims of primary liability for acts of omission (1) or commission (2) of defendant Clyde Cinader himself. The third theory of recovery is one of vicarious liability of an employer-principal for the negligence of his employee-agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>The complete text of the plaintiffs\u2019 three theories of liability, as submitted to the trial court, are reproduced below on the left, and the trial court\u2019s entire statement of the plaintiffs\u2019 theories against defendant Cinader is reproduced below on the right.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">It is the claim of the Plaintiff that, although Defendant, Cinader\u2019s contract called for him to give his personal attention to the work and to maintain a competent supervisor on the job site, he failed to do so, leaving the work in the hands of the two teenagers.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Plaintiffs also contend that the bulldozer in question was in extremely poor con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>dition and should have never been allowed on the job site by either Defendant Cinader or Defendant Pulte Homes, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>It is the Plaintiff\u2019s claim that he was asked to assist in the starting of Defendant Cinader\u2019s bulldozer, and while checking the fan belt Defendant Cinader\u2019s son turned the engine over, and that cut off one finger and seriously injured another one, and that the conduct of Cinader\u2019s son was negligent and that negligence resulted in the injury to his hand ....</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>It is the claim of the Plaintiff that he was asked to assist one of the teenage employees of Defendant, Cinader, in starting the bulldozer and his hand was injured when that teenage employee attempted to start the equipment without checking to be sure that Marvin Moody was clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\"><em>Factually, </em>the essence of plaintiff\u2019s theories of recovery against defendant Cinader is that the plaintiff was injured because of Cinader\u2019s carelessness in the fashion in which he conducted his affairs as a subcontractor at the construction site, specifically as regards the operation by his employee-son of the bulldozer Cinader brought to the job site for use in completing his work as a subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\"><em>Legally, </em>however, plaintiffs indentified three separate and distinct legal duties assertedly breached by Cinader, proof of any one of which, if shown to have proximately resulted in Moody\u2019s injury, warranted recovery. Each was an analytical route plaintiff invited the jury to follow to reach the concl\u00fasion that Cinader was responsible for Moody\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">It was not necessary at that threshold part of the instructions to the jury that the court fully delineate the principles of tort or contract law and the legal analysis that underlay the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>claim. The detail concerning the legal character of the duties owed to the plaintiff, the analytical distinction between the respective duties, and the jurors\u2019 duties with respect to each theory proved, were matters to be covered in the more substantive portion of the court\u2019s charge when advising the jurors as to the law governing the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">It is our view, however, that Rule 516.7 requires the trial court to include in its statement of a party\u2019s theory of the case, at a minimum, all legally relevant facts to that party\u2019s theories of recovery. When the trial court told the jury that the plaintiff\u2019s theory was that the plaintiff was injured because \"while [he was] checking the fan belt[,] defendant Cinader\u2019s son turned the engine over, and that cut off one finger and seriously injured another one, and that the conduct of Cinader\u2019s son was negligent and that negligence resulted in the injury to [Moody\u2019s] hand,\u201d the court had adequately stated the legally relevant facts pertaining to the plaintiff\u2019s third theory of recovery, that of vicarious liability of an employer-principal for the negligence of his employee-agent. However, plaintiff alleged two other theories of primary liability for the allegedly negligent acts of Clyde Cinader himself, and the trial court\u2019s statement omitted the legally relevant facts pertaining to those theories: (a) that Cinader had left the job site und\u00e9r the supervision of his teenaged son (relevant to plaintiff\u2019s first theory), and (b) that Cinader allowed the use of a bulldozer on the job site which was in poor condition (relevant to plaintiff\u2019s second theory). Both of these were \"disputed propositions of fact which [were] supported by the evidence,\u201d Rule 516.7(b), and therefore would have been properly included in the trial court\u2019s statement of plaintiff\u2019s case. When a trial court has stated only the facts which are legally relevant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>one of a party\u2019s theories of recovery, it has not adequately complied with GCR 1963, 516.7. Therefore, we hold that the trial court erred in failing to comply with the mandate of Rule 516.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">We are unable to conclude that this error was harmless in view of the fact that, as discussed below, the court\u2019s instructions on the applicable law were also seriously deficient. Taken together, the shortcomings in the court\u2019s statement of plaintiff\u2019s theory of the case, and the serious deficiencies in the court\u2019s substantive charge to the jury, so unfairly prejudiced the appellants in a materially substantial way that we are required to reverse as to defendant Cinader.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">It is asserted that, in addition to his failure to adequately describe the plaintiffs\u2019 theories of recovery, the trial judge erroneously failed to give ten jury instructions proposed by plaintiff. The first four were standard jury instructions (SJI2d), and the last six were special instructions drafted by plaintiff\u2019s trial counsel and assertedly tailored to the plaintiffs\u2019 theories of recovery and the evidence in the case.

You must refrain from any inference, speculation, or discussion about insurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>After retiring to consider their verdict, the jurors interrupted their deliberations, returned to the courtroom, and submitted a question to the court. The record shows what occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-4\"><em>The Court: </em>The record should reflect the following question from the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">\"Did Mr. Moody have bodily injury insurance to cover on site accidents doing [sic] his May 27, 1977 job?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">Gentlemen your responses, or your suggested responses to that question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\"><em>[Plaintiff\u2019s </em>Counsel]: Your Honor, I think that the only proper response would be SJI 2nd, 3.06, the instruction informing the jury that insurance is irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\"><em>The Court: </em>I can\u2019t hear you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-9\"><em>[Plaintiff\u2019s </em>Counsel]: Informing the jury that insurance is irrelevant to the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-10\"><em>[Defense </em>Counsel]: I think under the circumstances I have to agree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-11\"><em>The Court: </em>You can bring in the jury Mr. Grekonich.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-12\">(Whereupon the jury was escorted into the Courtroom)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-13\"><em>The Court: </em>Ladies and gentlemen I have been delivered a question.

Whether he did or not, as I indicated, isn\u2019t any of our business. Our concern here is the issue of negligence on either party\u2019s side and contributory negligence if any, and what injury occurred and what damages were suffered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-17\">I mean it is a normal, and perhaps human <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>reaction to be concerned about that, but that has nothing to do with whether or not somebody\u2019s at fault, or whether or not they suffered an injury or whether or not that injury is compensable in dollars and cents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\"><em>Juror Number Six: </em>Your Honor could we make an explanation of our question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\"><em>The Court: </em>No, you don\u2019t have to, and don\u2019t apologize for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-8\"><em>Juror Number Six: </em>No, I mean why we want an answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-9\"><em>The Court: </em>Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-10\"><em>Juror Number Six: </em>We read the contract by the sub-contractor, that he signed, and in that contract it is specifically stated that it was his duty to see to it that a third, that a sub-contractor, to him had full insurance coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-11\"><em>The Court: </em>Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-12\"><em>Juror Number Six: </em>And, so we feel that if he did not do that, then he was negligent of not doing that and of not completing that contract. That was our feeling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-13\"><em>The Court: </em>Okay. Now, in none of the theories, nor in the case that we have given to you, has he been sued for not conforming to that part of the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-14\"><em>Juror Number Six: </em>I see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-15\"><em>The Court: </em>So, again I tell you I don\u2019t know, and we won\u2019t and we won\u2019t care until somebody sues him for that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-16\"><em>Juror Number Six: </em>That helps.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-17\"><em>The Court: </em>Well, I can see, you go romping through there and you say well, we\u2019ve got the contract and I think that should be our concern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-18\">The standard jury instruction specifically with regard to insurance says that whether a party is insured has no bearing whatever on any issue that you have to decide, and you should refrain from any inference or speculation or discussion about insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-19\">You know, you might get involved as jurors some time in a suit where somebody is either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>suing on a policy or because somebody else didn\u2019t buy one, and well, that would be what you have in that case. But it is not involved here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">It is evident from the colloquy between the court and Juror Number Six that had the trial judge merely read SJI2d 3.06 he would not have addressed the jurors\u2019 real concerns. The jurors were troubled whether defendant Cinader was liable, on a breach of contract theory, for failure to comply with a term of the construction contract \u2014 the duty of the subcontractor to \"see to it that a third, that a subcontractor to him had full insurance coverage.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court correctly disabused the jurors of the idea that such a theory was before them. His handling of the jury question was brief, direct, responsive, and accurate. SJI2d 3.06 would not, standing alone, have adequately responded to the jurors\u2019 inquiry. The court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Plaintiff next complains that the court failed to give requested SJI2d 3.10 concerning Circumstantial Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The instruction reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">It is not necessary that every fact be proven directly by a witness or an exhibit. A fact may be proven indirectly by other facts or circumstances, from which it usually and reasonably follows according to the common experience and observation of mankind. This is called circumstantial evidence, which you are to consider along with other evidence in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Neither in his brief to this Court nor in oral argument has plaintiff suggested what circumstantial evidence was introduced in this case to warrant the requested instruction. We have carefully examined the record and we can find none.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">On the record before us, the court was not obligated to instruct on circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Next, the plaintiff complains of prejudice resulting from the court\u2019s failure to give requested SJI2d 5.01 and 5.02. At the time of trial, SJI2d 5.01 read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-9\">In deciding whether you should believe a witness, you may consider the fact that at some earlier time [he/or/she] [said/did] something that does not agree with what [he/or/she] testified to here on an important point. What [he/or/she] said earlier may be considered only in deciding whether you should believe [him/or/her] and may not be considered as proof of the facts in [his/or/ her] earlier statement (unless [he/or/she] testified that [his/or/her] earlier statement was true, in which event it may be considered as proof of the facts in the statement).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">By its terms, the instruction is designed to emphasize that any prior inconsistent statement which may have been used to impeach the veracity of a witness may be considered by the jury only for the significance it has in reflecting upon the credibility of the witness for having spoken inconsistently at different times on the same important <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>point. The unstated thrust of the instruction is that the prior inconsistent statement of the non-party witness is ordinarily inadmissible hearsay and may not be considered by the jury for the truth of the content of the prior statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">The only non-party witnesses who testified at the trial were Scott Cinader and Duane Joyce, Cinader\u2019s employees. However, plaintiff does not invite our attention to any evidence in the record of any effort to impeach the credibility of either non-party witness with the use of a prior inconsistent statement. Consequently, there was no necessity for the court to give the requested instruction, and its refusal to do so was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">More troublesome is the court\u2019s failure to give requested SJI2d 5.02 concerning impeachment of a party witness by a prior inconsistent statement. At the time of trial, that instruction read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">In deciding whether you should believe a party who has testified, you may consider that at some earlier time [he/or/she] [said/did] something that does not agree with what [he/or/she] testified to here on an important point. Because [he/or/she] is a party, what [he/or/she] [said/did] earlier may be considered not only in deciding whether you should believe [him/or/her], but also may be considered as evidence of the facts in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">One of the principal purposes of SJI2d 5.02 was to distinguish between purposes for which the jury may consider a prior inconsistent statement by a party witness and a prior inconsistent statement of a non-party witness. While the latter may be considered only as bearing on the veracity of the witness impeached, the former, because it may be the admission of a party opponent, is \"not hearsay\u201d under MRE 801(d)(2)(A) and thus may be considered by the jury both as bearing on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>witness\u2019 veracity and for the truth of the content of the statement. See \"Note on Use,\u201d SJI2d 5.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Upon cross-examination, Moody was confronted with two previous statements he had made: his pretrial discovery deposition and a lengthy handwritten statement made shortly after the accident. Defense counsel used both statements in an effort to impeach Moody\u2019s veracity by showing that his testimony at trial was at variance, in different particulars, with both the discovery deposition and the handwritten statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The deposition material was of questionable inconsistency. At one place in the deposition, Moody is shown to have stated that he, rather than Scott Cinader, had touched the wires that started the bulldozer. At trial, Moody steadfastly insisted that he had not touched the wires, and that the deposition text which read, \"I touched the wires,\u201d was a typographical error or had been taken down or transcribed incorrectly by the stenographer, and should have read, \"He touched the wires.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel strenuously objected to the use of the deposition as a prior inconsistent statement, charging that the text of the deposition was in error. He later introduced other parts of the deposition which tended to show that Moody had all along maintained that he had not touched the wires, strongly suggesting that there indeed had been an error in the deposition transcript. Nevertheless, the point was in dispute and the effort at impeachment was before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Defense counsel unquestionably succeeded in showing that Moody\u2019s' trial testimony was inconsistent with a portion of his handwritten pretrial statement in which he declared that Scott Cinader may not have heard Moody tell Cinader not to start the engine of the bulldozer. At trial, Moody stated that he was \"positive he heard me.\u201d In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>handwritten statement, plaintiff said: \"I told [Scott Cinader] not to start the engine, as I had found the trouble but he did start, and maybe he did not hear me . . . Moody attempted to explain the apparent inconsistency by stating: \"Maybe I could have made a mistake there, saying that he didn\u2019t hear me,\u201d and \"I\u2019m positive he did hear me. When this question was asked of me, I just don\u2019t know directly what was said.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">Upon redirect examination, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel offered the entire handwritten statement in evidence. It was received without objection.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Plainly, Moody was shown to have made at least one prior inconsistent statement, and possibly two. Ordinarily, in such circumstances, the impeaching party, not the party attacked, will insist that SJI2d 5.02 or its equivalent be given, not only because it calls the jury\u2019s attention to the fact that the witness\u2019 veracity has been impeached, but because it advises the jury that the out-of-court prior inconsistent statement may be considered for the truth of its content. That is so, as we have said, because it is an admission of a party opponent and \"not hearsay\u201d under MRE 801(d)(2)(A). Here, however, counsel for the party witness who was impeached offered the prior inconsistent statement without stating the purpose for which he wished it to be considered by the jury. No matter by whom the handwritten statement was offered, once the statement was received in evidence, SJI2d 5.02 was applicable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Despite the request by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, the trial court declined to give the requested instruction. Plaintiff claims the failure to do so violated the rule of <em>Javis v Ypsilanti Bd of Ed, </em>393 Mich 689; 227 NW2d 543 (1975), since the instruction was accurate, applicable, and properly requested by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The Court of Appeals stated that the trial court did not err in failing to give SJI2d 5.02 because the prior inconsistent statement had been admitted in evidence, and because the court\u2019s general charge on credibility of the witness sufficiently covered the matter. The Court of Appeals added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">The determination of whether the requested instruction is applicable and accurate is within the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>Zmija v Baron, </em>119 Mich App 524, 540; 326 NW2d 908 (1982). Here we find no abuse <em>of </em>discretion. [125 Mich App 754.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">We think the trial court erred in failing to give requested SJI2d 5.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">Ordinarily, a trial court\u2019s discretion to determine whether to give a requested standard jury instruction does not include the authority to decline to give the instruction when it is plainly accurate, applicable, and is properly requested by a party. GCR 1963, 516.6(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">As we said today in <em>Johnson v Corbet, </em>423 Mich 304, 326-327; 377 NW2d 713 (1985):_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>However, it remains the duty of the trial court, as historically it has been, to determine the subject matter of the instructions to be given to the jury, and that includes the duty to determine the applicability of the particular sji requested by counsel. <em>Socha </em>[v <em>Passino, </em>405 Mich 458, 467; 275 NW2d 243 (1979)]. That duty cannot be delegated to counsel. Merely because the evidence in a case may include the subject matter of an sji, it does not mean that the court, upon request of counsel, is automatically required to read every sji which might tangentially touch on the subject matter. The trial court\u2019s duty to determine the \"applicability,\u201d under MCR 2.516, of a requested sji runs deeper than that and calls for the exercise of discretion. It is conceivable, for example, that a given sji would accurately state the law and be applicable, in the theoretical sense that the evidence in a case included reference to the subject matter of that sji, but that a wise and experienced trial judge, in the exercise of informed discretion, would determine that reading the sji would confuse the jurors or unnecessarily distract them from the material issues in the case, or extend the jury instruction process out of all proportion to the educational benefit to the jurors and fairness to the litigants, or unduly emphasize a potentially prejudicial aspect of the evidence, or simply add nothing to an otherwise balanced and fair jury charge nor enhance the ability of the jurors to decide the case intelligently, fairly, and impartially. This, of course, is a way of saying that it is for the trial court to determine when the sji are applicable, not in an abstract or theoretical sense, but in the context of the \"personality\u201d of the particular case on trial, and with due regard for the adversaries\u2019 theories of the case and of counsel\u2019s legitimate desire to structure jury argument around anticipated jury instructions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">But even in cases in which the requested sji was unquestionably applicable, as here, there remains the appellate duty to determine whether the error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>in omitting the sji was so prejudicial as to require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Under <em>Javis, </em>and until today, the trial court\u2019s failure to give SJI2d 5.02 in this case would have been error requiring reversal without regard to any unfair prejudice to the complaining party. However, under the modification of the <em>Javis </em>rule we announced today in <em>Johnson, </em>we must decide whether the failure to give SJI2d 5.02 so unfairly prejudiced the plaintiff that failure to vacate the jury\u2019s verdict would be \"inconsistent with substantial justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">We think it did not. In fact, the particular departure from the mandate of GCR 1963, 516.6(2) involved here is an excellent example of the need for easing the sweep of the prophylactic presumption of error rule of <em>Javis. </em>Here, the prior inconsistent statements related to relatively insignificant points, matters that on the whole record were unlikely to influence the jury concerning the Moodys\u2019 general credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">With the introduction of substantial portions of the discovery deposition and the explanatory testimony of Moody, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel persuasively demonstrated that the purported prior inconsistent deposition statement by Moody that read, \"I touched the wires,\u201d was either a typographical error, or had been taken down incorrectly in the first instance, and should have read, \"He touched the wires.\u201d Nowhere else in the evidence is there any suggestion that Moody had \"touched the wires.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Similarly, we think the impeachment of Moody by the use of the prior handwritten statement was, in the context of the whole trial, a matter of little or no significance to the jury. Recall, that the trial testimony of Moody which was attacked was his statement on cross-examination that he was \"posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>tive\u201d that Scott Cinader had heard him caution Cinader not to start the engine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-4\"><em>Question [by defense </em>counsel]: Mr. Moody, how do you know Scott Cinader heard you say, don\u2019t start the engine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\"><em>Answer: </em>As clear and as loud as my voice is, I\u2019m positive he heard me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The impeaching prior inconsistent statement upon which defense counsel relied was Moody\u2019s pretrial statement as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">I told him not to start the engine, as I had found the trouble, but he did start, and maybe he did not hear me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Although the question whether Moody had warned Scott Cinader not to start the engine might have had importance on the question of Moody\u2019s possible comparative negligence and Scott Cinader\u2019s negligence, the testimony sought to be impeached could hardly be determinative of the matter. Despite Moody\u2019s trial testimony, the fact is that he could not have been \"positive\u201d that Cinader heard his warning. He could only have had an opinion upon the matter. Whether Cinader heard him or not is a matter which could not have been within Moody\u2019s personal knowledge, particularly since Cinader made no acknowledgment of having heard the warning. Similarly, the prior handwritten statement that \"maybe [Cinader] did not hear me\u201d is wholly speculative and therefore equally lacking in probativeness about whether the warning had been heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">While the court erred in failing to instruct the jury that it was entitled to consider Moody\u2019s prior inconsistent statements for their truth, the court\u2019s failure to do so was harmless, given the relatively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>innocuous subject matter of the asserted inconsistencies and the fact that the court fully and accurately instructed the jury that the credibility of the witness was in dispute and that the jury was obligated to consider all the evidence in the case in order to determine who to believe relative to disputed points in the evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We conclude that the court\u2019s failure to give SJI2d 5.02, although error, did not materially prejudice the plaintiff.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">We address finally the plaintiff\u2019s claim that he suffered material prejudice because of the court\u2019s refusal to give several requested special jury instructions. Those instructions, to repeat, are plaintiffs\u2019 Supplemental Proposed Instruction No. 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>concerning Cinader\u2019s liability to Moody as a third-party beneficiary under the contract between Cinader and Pulte Homes,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> plaintiffs\u2019 Supplemental Proposed Instruction No. 2 concerning the vicarious liability of Cinader for the acts of his employees,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> plaintiffs\u2019 Special Instruction No. 1 concerning duties owed to third persons arising out of a contractual relationship,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> plaintiffs\u2019 Special Instruction No. 2 concerning the liability of Pulte for the negligence of its subcontractor,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> plaintiffs\u2019 Spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>cial Instruction No. 3 concerning the vicarious liability of \"[o]ne conducting an activity through servants or other agents\u201d,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and plaintiffs\u2019 proposed instruction regarding the liability of Pulte Homes, Inc., for the acts of its agents and employees.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Four of these requested Special Instructions were concerned with the potential liability of Clyde Cinader.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>The special significance of those instructions that related to Cinader is that Cinader was not present at the construction site at the time of the accident and had no direct involvement in the activities which ultimately resulted in the plaintiffs injury. On the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 theory of the case, the only possible way he could recover against Cinader was if he could establish, by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) Cinader\u2019s direct liability for failing to supervise the activities of his employees on the job site, or (2) his direct liability for placing a \"dangerous\u201d bulldozer on the job site for use by his employees, or (3) his vicarious liability as an employer responsible for the negligent acts of his employees performed in the scope of their employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Those theories could not have been on the jurors\u2019 minds, however, because the trial court declined to articulate the plaintiffs\u2019 theories in the language suggested by the plaintiff, or in any other language, but advised the jurors instead that \"[i]t is the Plaintiffs claim that he was asked to assist in the starting of Defendant Cinader\u2019s bulldozer and, while checking the fan belt, Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Cinader\u2019s son turned the engine over, and [injured plaintiff] and that the conduct of Cinader\u2019s son was negligent . . . Nothing in the court\u2019s abbreviated statement of the plaintiffs\u2019 theories of liability against Cinader suggested that it was plaintiff\u2019s claim that Cinader was liable because of his failure to supervise the work of his employee-son, or because he placed a dangerous bulldozer on a job site, or because the law imposes vicarious liability upon an employer for the negligent acts of his employee committed within the course of employment. Moreover, nothing in the trial court\u2019s substantive instructions to the jury concerning the law applicable to this case suggested, even remotely, that the asserted negligence of Scott Cinader was attributable to his father-employer Clyde Cinader, or that recovery could be had against Clyde Cinader for his primary negligence in failing to supervise the job or for negligently placing a dangerous instrumentality on the job site.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Even viewed in a light most favorable to the defendant, the most an ordinarily attentive juror could have derived from the court\u2019s instructions was that a verdict could be returned for plaintiff if the jurors found that the plaintiff was injured because the defendant\u2019s \"son was negligent and that negligence resulted in the injury\u201d to the plaintiff. But against whom such verdict could be returned was not made clear. Even that statement was described by the trial court as the \"plaintiffs\u2019 claim\u201d and not a verdict option available to the jury on the basis of a duty imposed by law upon the defendant and the evidence in the case. Immediately following that statement, the court declared that the \"[p]laintiff further claims that defendant Pulte should have been out there on the job site, either supervising or controlling the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>duct of the Cinaders . . . No such claim of failure to supervise against Cinader was recognized by the trial court, and the jury was not instructed to consider such failure as a means of holding Cinader liable. Moreover, as we have said, the vicarious liability of Cinader as an employer responsible for the negligent acts of his employee was never addressed by the court either as a theory pleaded by the plaintiff or as an issue before the jury to be resolved. While lawyers and judges may have had no trouble interpreting the evidence and the court\u2019s instructions as implicitly recognizing the possible vicarious liability of Cinader as an employer, jurors untrained in the law of torts and agency cannot be expected to have inferred it.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">In addition, of course, there was no mention in the trial court\u2019s instructions of the jury\u2019s duty to consider whether Cinader was liable to the plaintiff under a third-party beneficiary contract theory of liability arising from the contract between the general contractor, Pulte Homes, and the subcontractor, Cinader.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury in detail concerning the plaintiffs\u2019 vicarious liability theory against Clyde Cinader as employer of Scott Cinader was not ameliorated by the verdict form given to the jurors and the six questions contained in the verdict form.

The court shall inform the attorneys of its proposed action on the requests before their arguments to the jury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b226-10\"> The Court of Appeals accurately summarized the facts relevant to this assertion of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">\"In this case, Marvin Moody testified that Scott Cinader attempted to start the bulldozer\u2019s engine by placing a metal object over the starter\u2019s solenoid. On cross-examination, a portion of Moody\u2019s deposition transcript was read, in which Moody stated that he touched the wires that started the bulldozer. Moody contended that the deposition transcript read by defense counsel contained misprints or mistakes, and that he did not testify on oral examination as having touched the wires. At this point, plaintiffs\u2019 attorney requested that the court require defendants to read other portions of Moody\u2019s deposition relevant to the ignition of the bulldozer engine. The court ruled that plaintiffs\u2019 attorney could address the issue on redirect examination. On redirect examination, Moody contended that he did not start the bulldozer. Further, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel read at length from Moody\u2019s deposition, with continued verification by Moody, in an attempt to convince the jury that the reporter had incorrectly transcribed Moody\u2019s testimony on several pages, including the page read by defense counsel during cross-examination and admitted into evidence as defendants\u2019 Exhibit A. Plaintiffs then marked and entered into evidence several pages of Moody\u2019s deposition transcript with the admitted transcript pages being marked as plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibits 5 through 8. On appeal, plaintiffs contend that the trial court committed reversible error by refusing to require defendants to introduce into evidence the portions of Moody\u2019s deposition which were relevant to starting the bulldozer engine.\u201d 125 Mich App 747-748.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b228-10\"><em> </em>MCR 2.308, concerning the use of depositions in court proceedings, does not include the language of GCR 1963, 302.4(4). The Note to MCR 2.308 states: \"That subject is now covered by MRE 106.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b231-7\"> The court further stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">\"Plaintiff further claims the defendant Pulte should have been out there on the job site, either supervising or controlling the conduct of the Cinaders in such a fashion that the injury could not have occurred, and that they breached a duty in not supervising and controlling, and because of that, they are also liable for the injury that has been suffered by the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">Plaintiffs do not assert as error the trial court\u2019s failure to give the material substance of their negligence claim against defendant Pulte. As stated, the trial court had directed a verdict for Pulte on Count II (Breach of Third-Party Beneficiary Contract) at the close of plaintiffs\u2019 proofs. At that time, the court took under advisement defense counsel\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on Pulte\u2019s behalf as to Count I (Negligence). The trial court, however, never ruled on the matter but, instead, submitted one of plaintiffs\u2019 three negligence theories against Pulte to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">While the court\u2019s statement referred to only one of plaintiff\u2019s three theories of recovery against Pulte, any possible error is harmless in light of our previous conclusion that the evidence presented at trial did not support any of these theories. We note that GCR 1963, 516.7(b) states that \"[a party\u2019s] theory [of the case] may include those claims <em>supported by the evidence </em>or admitted.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b237-9\"> While it is speculation at best, perhaps the jurors\u2019 confusion could have been avoided had the trial court more explicitly advised the jury at the outset of the instructions concerning the three legal theories upon which the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was brought which would not have included the insurance coverage question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b238-11\"> It is arguable that in every case in which witnesses testify there is necessarily some circumstantial evidence, if only concerning the veracity of the witnesses. If that is what appellants have in mind\u2014 and we are left to guess at the matter because no suggestion is made that any circumstantial evidence was introduced in the case \u2014 we think the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury concerning the general credibility of witnesses, SJI2d 4.01, 4.07, adequately covered the subject.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b241-6\"> We express no opinion about the admissibility of plaintiff\u2019s out-of-court statement offered by plaintiff.

However, if you had personal knowledge of a particular fact, in this case, such knowledge could not be used as evidence. That is why you will recall I was inquiring at the beginning of the case if any of you had personal knowledge of the case or any of the parties involved, and that sort of thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">\"As to the credibility of witnesses, you are the sole judges of the facts in the case and you have to determine which witnesses you will believe and what weight you will give that testimony. In doing so, you may take into account the witnesses\u2019 ability and opportunity to observe, the witnesses\u2019 memory and manner while testifying, any interest or bias or prejudice a witness might have, and the reasonableness of the testimony considered in light of all of the other evidence in the case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b246-12\"> As further support for our holding that plaintiff was not materially prejudiced by the court\u2019s failure to give SJI2d 5.02, we note that SJI2d 5.02 informs the jury that it may consider a party\u2019s prior <em>inconsistent </em>statements as substantive evidence. It does not state that the jury may also consider a party\u2019s prior <em>consistent </em>statements as substantive evidence. It is difficult to conceive of any benefit of which the plaintiff might have been deprived from the jury not considering his prior <em>inconsistent </em>statements as substantive evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b247-5\"> \"A contract between the Defendant Pulte Homes, Inc. and Defendant Clyde Cinader has been placed into evidence in this case.
