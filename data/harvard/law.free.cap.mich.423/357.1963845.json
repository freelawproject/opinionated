We answer no to the first question and yes to the second, and therefore reverse defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Defendant Schweidel Tyson and another man, Tommy Lee Forrest, were charged with armed robbery and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony in connection with the robbery of Flag\u2019s Restaurant in Belleville on December 16, 1980. Defendant\u2019s postarrest statements to the police were the subject of a lengthy <em>Walker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearing, following which the trial judge ruled the statements involuntary and therefore inadmissible. Essentially, defendant had confessed the crime to police, stating that he had originally planned on robbing a bank, but was deterred when he saw the protective glass covering the tellers\u2019 windows.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">During direct examination of the officer in charge of the case in defendant\u2019s second trial,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the prosecutor was pursuing a line of questioning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>related to defendant\u2019s demeanor during the trial<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>in an apparent attempt to discredit defendant\u2019s insanity defense by eliciting testimony that he was \"putting on sort of an act.\u201d Following testimony to that effect, amid several objections by defense counsel, the record then reveals the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\"><em>Q. </em>Now, the way the Defendant appeared during the booking process immediately after his arrest, does that \u2014 did he appear then pretty much then as he appears at times in the courtroom now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\"><em>A. </em>I don\u2019t feel so, other than I would have to say when I first spoke with him he appeared to have a \u2014a feeling of \u2014 or <em>he displayed a feeling of remorse. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Defense counsel objected and had the jury excused, whereupon the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-9\"><em>Mr. Hallmark: </em>Your Honor, I believe the last testimony elicited from the officer was in direct and deliberate violation of this Court\u2019s order as to any and all oral and written statements made by the Defendant. It was intended to and it did get across to this jury the notion that the Defendant talked about this offense, and that he showed some remorse, some feeling of guilt. It was deliberately done. And I would ask for a mistrial at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number><em>Mr. Seller: </em>Well, first, as to the notion of it being deliberately done. I can certainly address the Court, and I think it is incumbent upon me to say there was no intention on my part to get into the context of any statements whatsoever, and I think from my perspective it was not deliberate on the officer\u2019s part. It is a difficult area sometimes where you search for words. Certainly one can look sorry as well as saying I am sorry, and I don\u2019t know whether it got across to the jury, you know, what the defense attorney says it got across. It certainly wasn\u2019t intended in any case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\"><em>Mr. Hallmark: </em>Your Honor, I have been objecting for the last ten minutes to this line of questioning, because it was leading in that direction. The officer indicated, if I am correct in my recollection, expressed a remorse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\"><em>The Court: </em>I doubt that it was intended to violate any Court\u2019s order, but it contains a clear implication that the Defendant said he was sorry he did it. The Motion is granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Defendant unsuccessfully moved to bar retrial on the ground that double jeopardy prevented further proceedings because the mistrial was provoked by the prosecutor\u2019s deliberate misconduct or gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">The third attempt at trying defendant resulted in his conviction of both charges. Defendant\u2019s insanity defense was unsuccessful. A court-appointed psychiatrist, Dr. Joel Dreyer, testified in support of the defendant\u2019s insanity defense, stating his opinion that defendant was a schizophrenic and an alcoholic, and had no impulse control. Testimony from defendant\u2019s family and acquaintances revealed that he had exhibited bizarre behavior since childhood, that he had been in several mental hospitals and alcohol rehabilitation centers, and that he had repeatedly attempted suicide by slashing his wrists, the last attempt being two days before the robbery of the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>During cross-examination of Dr. Dreyer, the prosecutor asked him a hypothetical question which was factually based upon defendant\u2019s post-arrest statements, previously ruled involuntary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\"><em>Q. </em>Now once it occurred to him to rob the Flag\u2019s Restaurant, he couldn\u2019t say no?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\"><em>A. </em>That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\"><em>Q. </em>Had it occurred to him to rob a bank, he would not have been able to say no?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\"><em>A. </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-10\"><em>Q. </em>Even if he walked in there and found himself faced with bulletproof glass, he couldn\u2019t have stopped himself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-11\"><em>A. </em>Yep, you got it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">Defense counsel objected on the ground that the prosecutor was again attempting to get into evidence a statement that had been ruled inadmissible.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nevertheless, both the prosecution\u2019s expert, Dr. Charles Clark, and Officer Lindberg, the officer in charge of the case, were allowed to testify on rebuttal as to defendant\u2019s postarrest statements regarding the bank.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court gave a cautionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>instruction, admonishing the jury that the statements were to be considered not as substantive evidence that defendant had committed the robbery; rather, they could be used only to show his state of mind.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">During closing argument, the prosecutor made several references to the fact that defendant\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Dreyer, had been paid for his testimony and that that was his motivation for testifying. He also argued to the jury that Dr. Dreyer was lacking in integrity and that the prosecution\u2019s expert, Dr. Charles Clark (employed at the Forensic Center), was an \"unbiased expert who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>works for the State of Michigan.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>objected both during and after the prosecutor\u2019s argument and moved for a mistrial because of the \"unfair inferences\u201d made by the prosecutor.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial judge declined to grant the mistrial, but allowed defense counsel to respond to some of the statements, ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\"><em>The Court: </em>All right. Number one, the question was not asked of the doctor how he was going to be paid, during the course of either Direct or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Cross-Examination. Strictly speaking, it goes beyond the scope of testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">In order to balance one against the other, the Court will permit counsel for Defendant, in his Closing Argument, to state that the doctor \u2014 Dr. Dreyer was a court-appointed psychiatrist. If you wish to state he was paid by the County, you may do so, although you are not required to. And I may also state for the record that he or any psychiatrist could get more money in their private practice than by a court-appointment. I think that will balance it off. Anything more, gentlemen?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Defense counsel made the following statement during his closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">I believe in Closing Argument, Mr Seller was just a little bit less than kind to Dr. Dreyer. He indicated that Dr. Dreyer\u2019s testimony in this courtroom was bought and paid for; that he wouldn\u2019t have testified on behalf of this Defendant if he wasn\u2019t bought and paid for. That is what it comes down to. Well, it is unfair, for this reason. He failed to say and he failed to put into evidence when he had the opportunity to do so, that Dr. Dreyer is Court-appointed. That man is indigent. The County of Wayne pays Dr. Dreyer, not that man, not me. He failed to say, also, that Dr. Dreyer can earn far more money sitting in his own office treating patients. He is an active treating psychiatrist. He can make more money in his own practice than he can make sitting on that witness stand in this courtroom and standing around during delays and taking abuse from two attorneys who may not think the same or understand the terminology the same as a medical person or a psychiatrist would.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The Court of Appeals affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction of both charges, 133 Mich App 318; 350 NW2d 248 (1984), rejecting defendant\u2019s double jeopardy argument and holding that, although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was misconduct, that \"this claim of error was waived when defense counsel accepted the court\u2019s offer to make countering arguments.\u201d <em>Id., </em>325. We granted leave to appeal. 419 Mich 943 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">We turn first to defendant\u2019s contention that the mistrial occasioned by Officer Lindberg\u2019s response to the prosecutor\u2019s question regarding defendant\u2019s demeanor following his arrest and at trial should have barred retrial on double jeopardy grounds. Defendant contends that the prosecutor, either by intentional misconduct or gross negligence, precipitated the mistrial by asking a question which was sure to elicit an improper response.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">As a general rule, both the federal<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and state<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> guarantee against being put twice in jeopardy for the same crime does not bar the retrial of a defendant after his prior trial has been terminated following his successful mistrial motion. 98 ALR3d 997 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">Both on the federal and state levels, however, an exception to the rule has developed where the successful mistrial motion is precipitated by prosecutorial or judicial error. Difficulties have arisen, however, both in attempts to define the type of error required for a double jeopardy bar to retrial and in applying the definition to the facts of a given case. As a result of this, different standards have evolved in the federal and state court systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">The federal standard has evolved through a series of United States Supreme Court cases, culminating in the decision of <em>Oregon v Kennedy, </em>456 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>US 667; 102 S Ct 2083; 72 L Ed 2d 416 (1982). In that case, the Oregon Court of Appeals had barred defendant\u2019s retrial for theft of an oriental rug on the ground that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct in asking the complaining witness whether his refus\u00e1l to do business with defendant was because \"he [was] a crook\u201d constituted prosecutorial overreaching sufficient to invoke the protections of the double jeopardy clause. <em>Id., </em>669.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">The Supreme Court reversed, holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">[t]he circumstances under which such a defendant may invoke the bar of double jeopardy in a second effort to try him are limited to those cases in which the conduct giving rise to the successful motion for a mistrial was intended to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial. <em>[Id., </em>679.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Prior to <em>Kennedy, </em>several federal and state courts had relied on language from earlier Supreme Court cases, which had suggested that the standard was not one of subjective intent to cause a mistrial, but rather \"prosecutorial . . . overreaching,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \" 'bad-faith conduct by [the] judge or prosecutor,\u2019 \u201d intended to provoke a mistrial request by the defendant in order to \" 'afford the prosecution a more favorable opportunity to convict\u2019 the defendant,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or \"motivated by bad faith or undertaken to harass or prejudice,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> in analyzing issues of this kind.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Since Kennedy, some state courts have opted to offer broader-reaching double jeopardy protection under their own constitutions, and have adhered to the <em>pre-Kennedy </em>standard.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">We find it unnecessary to decide at this time whether Michigan should adopt the <em>pre-Kennedy </em>or the <em>Kennedy </em>standard of prosecutorial error, because we find that the prosecutor\u2019s error in this case was insufficient to meet either standard. The record reflects that the prosecutor was pursuing a line of questioning designed to show the jury that the defendant was a sophisticated actor rather than an insane schizophrenic and could change his demeanor at will, depending upon who was watching him. This line of questioning was certainly relevant, and the question regarding any differences in defendant\u2019s demeanor following his arrest and at trial was a proper one. Officer Lindberg\u2019s answer exceeded the bounds of the question and could not reasonably have been anticipated by the prosecutor. We also note that, following defense counsel\u2019s mistrial motion, the prosecutor denied that the motion had been intentionally provoked, and the trial judge agreed that there had been no intentional misconduct on the prosecutor\u2019s part. We concur in the Court of Appeals statement that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>[w]e are unwilling to assume bad intent where the conduct of the prosecutor is, at least, equally consistent with a good faith effort to comply with the court\u2019s order. The objective facts do not support defendant\u2019s claim of deliberate misconduct. [133 Mich App 321.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Accordingly, we hold that there was neither intentional misconduct nor overreaching on the part of the prosecutor, and that defendant was properly retried on the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">We now turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor\u2019s statements during his closing argument in the third trial, to the effect that defendant\u2019s psychiatric expert had testified only because he was paid to do so, was misconduct so prejudicial that it denied defendant a fair trial. The prosecutor variously referred to Dr. Dreyer as \"totally lacking in integrity,\u201d \"a businessman who gets paid to do this sort of thing,\u201d and \"testifying in a way that was in his best interests to testify.\u201d The trial judge attempted to \"balance out\u201d the error by allowing defense counsel to state to the jury that Dr. Dreyer was court-appointed and that the fee paid him by the County of Wayne was less than he could have earned in private practice. The Court of Appeals held that this waived any claim of error by defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">We agree with defendant\u2019s claim that the argument made by the prosecutor must be considered misconduct. The record clearly supports defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor was aware that his statements to the jury inaccurately characterized the facts concerning the payment of the court-appointed psychiatrist. This argument appears to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>have been a deliberate attempt to inject prejudicial error into the trial. Nonetheless, we believe that this claim of error was waived when defense counsel accepted the court\u2019s offer to make countering arguments. Defense counsel could have reasonably believed that these countering arguments successfully undermined the credibility of the prosecuting attorney to the extent that defendant might benefit from having his case decided by this jury. To waive this claim of error was a reasonable tactical choice. We find no manifest injustice even though the trial judge might have done more to correct the misstatements made by the prosecuting attorney. [133 Mich App 325.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">We agree with the Court of Appeals that the prosecutor committed misconduct in his closing argument to the jury. We disagree, however, that the error was waived by counsel\u2019s countering statements. Further, we hold that the error was not cured by defense counsel\u2019s statements, and therefore reverse defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">In <em>People v Williams, </em>218 Mich 697; 188 NW 413 (1922), the prosecutor charged during closing argument that the defense experts had \"prostitute[d] themselves\u201d by testifying in support of defendant\u2019s insanity claim. This Court reversed, holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">[t]he argument of the prosecuting attorney was highly prejudicial and cannot be excused by anything in the record .... The testimony of the alienist being in the case it was reversible error for the prosecutor to urge the jury to reject the opinions of the alienists and take his opinion and to ask that this be done on the ground they had not been given the facts. . . . There should have gone forth an instruction . . . that it was not permissible for the jury to take the personal opinion of the prosecutor, and also that the alienists were not subject to the charge of prostituting themselves by coming in as witnesses and giving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>their opinion evidence relative to the mental condition of the accused. <em>[Id., </em>705-707.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Similarly, in <em>People v Cowles, </em>246 Mich 429; 224 NW 387 (1929), this Court reversed the conviction of defendant where the prosecutor stated during closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">I don\u2019t believe there was ever a more disreputable thing seen \u2014 I don\u2019t think there was anything more disreputable pulled off in a court of justice, than was pulled off by these two doctors ... if these two doctors were to put on a stunt like that in a vaudeville show, they would go over big. They would get a big laugh. . . . Now, gentlemen of the jury, we all pay taxes for universities, and they turn out things like that. I ask you, gentlemen, what chance a girl has to defend herself against such testimony? And I tell you that those two doctors are worse than the Indian medicine men or negro voodoos? How any professional man can so prostitute his profession and come in here and swear to such statements as that in a court of justice is beyond me. <em>[Id., </em>431-432.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">This Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-9\">The prosecuting attorney had a right to analyze the testimony, urge the jury, upon reason existing in the case to reject it and point out, if possible, its inapplicability. But invective, ridicule, injection of his belief, and innuendoes was not permissible argument, and was unfair to the experts and prejudicial to defendant. See <em>People v Williams, </em>218 Mich 697 [188 NW 413 (1922)]. [246 Mich 432-433.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">In the civil context, this Court has likewise refused to let stand verdicts rendered following trials in which one party committed misconduct during closing argument. <em>Wayne Co Road Comm v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number><em>GLS LeasCo, </em>394 Mich 126; 229 NW2d 797 (1975); <em>Kern v St Luke\u2019s Hospital, </em>404 Mich 339; 273 NW2d 75 (1978); <em>Reetz v Kinsman Marine Transit Co, </em>416 Mich 97; 330 NW2d 638 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Today, we reaffirm the rule established in <em>Williams </em>and <em>Cowles, supra. </em>The closing argument of the prosecutor in this case squares exactly with the situations in those cases. The question whether, and how much, Dr. Dreyer was being paid for his testimony was raised for the first time in closing argument, was without evidentiary support, and was clearly injected to attempt to impeach defendant\u2019s claim of insanity. This personal attack on the defendant\u2019s expert was intended to, and did, distract the jury from the real issues, and required defendant to defend on an issue that was improperly before the jury. Clearly, the critical issue in this case was whether or not defendant was insane. This case, as are so many others, was obviously decided on the basis of which expert the jury chose to believe. For this reason, it is especially important to protect against prosecutorial misconduct designed to impugn the credibility of the defendant\u2019s expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Because of the high stakes involved in any criminal trial, and because the trial judge in this case failed to give any cautionary instruction to the jury to disregard the prejudicial portion of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, we decline to employ a harmless-error analysis. Although defense counsel was given an opportunity to attempt to balance the error, he was still forced to counter an argument that had no basis in the evidence adduced at trial.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we reverse defendant\u2019s conviction and remand the case for retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Because it may reoccur on retrial, we briefly address one other claim of error by defendant. Both Officer Lindberg and Dr. Clark, the prosecution\u2019s psychiatric expert, were allowed to testify on rebuttal to defendant\u2019s postarrest statements, previously ruled involuntary following a <em>Walker </em>hearing. The jury was given a cautionary instruction that the testimony was to be used only to show defendant\u2019s state of mind, and not for substantive evidence that he had committed the offenses with which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">Involuntary confessions may not be used for any purpose at trial, either for substantive evidence or for impeachment purposes. <em>People v Reed, </em>393 Mich 342; 224 NW2d 867 (1975), <em>cert den </em>422 US 1044, 1048 (1975). See also <em>Mincey v Arizona, </em>437 US 385; 98 S Ct 2408; 57 L Ed 2d 290 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">The prosecution makes an interesting and novel argument that the statements used in this case were not the type of confession ruled involuntary, and therefore inherently untrustworthy, in <em>Reed </em>and <em>Mincey, </em>and that this Court should recognize a distinction between statements \"involuntary in fact\u201d and those \"involuntary in law,\u201d and allow the latter to be admitted for impeachment purposes or in rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>While we find this argument to be worthy of consideration, we decline to take this opportunity to address it since it is not necessary to our decision today. We have reviewed the <em>Walker </em>hearing transcript de novo<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and find that the trial judge did not clearly err in holding defendant\u2019s statements to be involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Defendant also contends that the trial court erred in giving, over his objection, an instruction on the disposition of defendant in the case of his acquittal by reason of insanity. For the reasons stated in our opinion in <em>People v Goad, </em>421 Mich 20; 364 NW2d 584 (1984), there should be no such instruction given on retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">We have reviewed defendant\u2019s other claim of error and find it to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">For the foregoing reasons, defendant\u2019s convictions are reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b444-11\">Williams, C.J., and Levin, Ryan, Cavanagh, and Riley, JJ., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-10\"> <em>People v Walker, </em>374 Mich 331; 132 NW2d 87 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b426-11\"> The first mistrial came about during the empaneling of the jury.

The jury can observe themselves what the Defendant\u2019s demeanor is. That\u2019s their position. It is not for this Officer to testify as to what his demeanor is at times when the jury isn\u2019t present. It is what goes on in the courtroom when the jury is present that is evidence in this case, not what this officer may or may not have seen or may or not believe, as to a difference in this Defendant\u2019s demeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\"><em>\"The Court: </em>The People cannot testify?</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">\"Mr. <em>Hallmark: </em>A change.

Dr. Dreyer' took the stand and said, Yeah, he\u2019s mentally ill. He\u2019s schizophrenic. I know because I\u2019m an intelligent qualified psychiatrist. I talked to him. He told me he\u2019s a prophet and I believe him and he exhibited signs of having trouble controlling his emotions and he told me he heard voices that told him he was a prophet. And I guess that\u2019s about it. I\u2019m not sure what else he had to say.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">\n<em>\"My position, quite simply, is that Dr. Dreyer is lacking in integrity.

And what Defendant is going to hire him to testify he is not insane and criminally responsible?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\"><em>\"Mr. Seller: I\u2019m not suggesting necessarily that Dr. Dreyer just came to you and just plain out and out lied for a few bucks. I\u2019m suggesting to you Dr. Dreyer was seeing what he wanted to see, which was insanity, getting him off the hook and getting his fee. </em>I\u2019m not suggesting, by the way, that he only gets paid if he comes down in favor of the Defendant. <em>I\u2019m suggesting it is a business. I\u2019m suggesting, therefore, that he\u2019s willing to look at what he saw with that kind of an eye, with that kind of self-interest, not the kind of impartial self-interest of a medical man or somebody who was looking objectively at the set of facts. </em>But I don\u2019t know. <em>Perhaps, as a businessman he doesn\u2019t have the kind of integrity he should have. </em>Therefore, his opinion, I suggest to you, comes out shallow and unsupported by evidence and lacking any relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">\"I hope very much you could see this, that you can see through Dr. Dreyer. I compare him with Dr. Clark who is here in the courtroom. I don\u2019t want to call attention to Dr. Clark, but <em>contrast the testimony of Dr. Dreyer with Dr. Clark and their positions. Dr. Clark is an unbiased expert who works for the State of Michigan. He is automatically appointed by the Court to examine anybody who has raised the defense of insanity.

He has no connection with me or to the Defendant, in fact, as you heard at the last trial I was in, that Dr. Clark was in, also, he testified on the other side. He testified the fellow, in fact, did meet the requirements of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">\"Getting back to Dr. Dreyer\u2019s testimony, he comes in and tells you, As sure as I am Dr. Dreyer \u2014 and that means something \u2014 as sure as I\u2019m Dr. Dreyer, this man is crazy. Why? Well, I suppose the best thing he had to say was that somewhere in some hospital record he had found somebody had written down 'schizophrenic\u2019 years ago in some other place, That\u2019s the best thing he had to say.</p>\n<p id=\"AUn\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>\"The Defendant, when he took that test, was faking it. It is the People\u2019s position he did the same thing with Dr. Dreyer. Dr. Dreyer bought it. <em>He bought it because he wanted to buy it, because he gets paid to do this sort of thing.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b434-11\"> The full text of defense counsel\u2019s objection is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\"><em>\"Mr. Hallmark: </em>Your Honor, this is my first opportunity I\u2019ve had to address the Court outside the presence of the jury since the Prosecutor\u2019s Closing Argument. And I have stated at least one objection during the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">\"There are several things in the Closing Argument I find objectionable and prejudicial. Most important of those is the statement by the Prosecutor that Dr. Dreyer\u2019s testimony was paid for. That is an unfair inference. It is not based upon the testimony. The Prosecutor had every opportunity to bring out, in testimony from Dr. Dreyer, just what his status is here. The Court record shows that and we argued that before, outside the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">\"It\u2019s been mentioned a number of times. Dr. Dreyer is court-appointed. The Defendant is indigent. The County is paying for Dr. Dreyer\u2019s services and Dr. Dreyer could make far more money outside in his own practice, in his own office, than what he could make coming down here to accept a court appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-15\">\"I\u2019ve expressed to the Court in front of the Prosecutor, a number of times, and I\u2019ve expressed before Judge Dunn a number of times the difficulty I had to get any psychiatrist to even consider examining the Defendant because of the lack of financial payment on the part of the County, the small amount of payment. There was a great deal of difficulty, and Judge Dunn personally had to persuade the doctor to take this case. I think this is an unfair inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-16\">\"It is all the more crucial, because he is the most important Defense witness in the case. It is extremely prejudicial. If I\u2019m not, in some manner, allowed to respond to that, I don\u2019t see how I can respond on the basis of the evidence. Of course, no evidence was introduced as to this Court\u2019s appointment as to the amount of money he\u2019s to be paid for this service.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-17\">\"Again, I\u2019d ask for a mistrial. I believe it is that prejudicial to this client, to have the doctor\u2019s credibility in Closing Argument, to be put before the jury, which is not in evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b436-11\"> US Const, Am V.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b436-12\"> Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b437-7\"> <em>United States v Jorn, </em>400 US 470, 484; 91 S Ct 547; 27 L Ed 2d 543 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b437-8\"> <em>United States v Dinitz, </em>424 US 600, 611; 96 S Ct 1075; 47 L Ed 2d 267 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b437-9\"> <em>Lee v United States, </em>432 US 23, 33; 97 S Ct 2141; 53 L Ed 2d 80 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b437-10\"> As a practical matter, however, it is only in the most egregious cases that retrial has been barred on double jeopardy grounds, regardless of whether the higher standard of subjective intent or the more lenient standard of overreaching or bad faith harassment is employed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>See, <em>e.g., United States v Kessler, </em>530 F2d 1246 (CA 5, 1976); <em>United States v Broderick, </em>425 F Supp 93 (SD Fla, 1977); <em>United States v Martin, </em>561 F2d 135 (CA 8, 1977).

This continues to illustrate the reality that the prosecutorial overreaching exception does not serve as a carte blanche to prevent reprosecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b442-8\"> We reject the Court of Appeals holding that defense counsel waived any claim of error by accepting the court\u2019s offer to rebut the prosecutor\u2019s statements during his closing argument. The trial court already denied his motion for mistrial; he was faced with either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>letting the extremely prejudicial statements stand unrebutted, only to risk having an appellate court say he waived the error by <em>not </em>accepting the court\u2019s offer to cure it, or attempt to balance the statement as best he could, within the offer of the trial judge, and hope for the best while still preserving the issue for appeal. The Court of Appeals opinion essentially places a defendant in a no-win situation: he waives the error by accepting the offer and also waives it by declining. This situation hardly allows defense counsel to make, as put by the Court of Appeals, \"a reasonable tactical choice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b444-13\"> <em>People v Robinson, </em>386 Mich 551; 194 NW2d 709 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b444-12\">Boyle, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AbD\">(dissenting). Although I agree that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument erroneously referred to matters outside the evidence, I believe the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that counsel waived the error. As that Court noted, 133 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>App 318, 324; 350 NW2d 248 (1984), after defense counsel objected to the argument he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-4\">If I\u2019m not, in some manner, allowed to respond to that, I don\u2019t see how I can respond on the basis of the evidence. Of course, no evidence was introduced as to this Court\u2019s appointment as to the amount of money he\u2019s to be paid for this service. Again, I\u2019d ask for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">In response to these statements, the trial judge stated that he would allow defense counsel to reply in kind. Defense counsel did so without renewing his request for mistrial or otherwise indicating that the trial court\u2019s offer was inadequate to cure the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, <em>ante, </em>pp 376-377, had defense counsel insisted on a mistrial, he would not have waived the claim that the prosecutor\u2019s bad-faith misconduct so irretrievably prejudiced defendant that the trial should have been aborted. Given the fact that the record already contained one basis for a claim of double jeopardy, it is understandable that a skillful lawyer in defense counsel\u2019s position would opt not for a further appellate issue, but for an opportunity to attack the credibility of the prosecutor and his expert evidence in closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Moreover, since even absent objection the appellate court will review for error which creates \"a manifest injustice,\u201d <em>People v White, </em>25 Mich App 176; 181 NW2d 56 (1970); <em>People v Lane, </em>127 Mich App 663; 339 NW2d 522 (1983), in accepting the trial court\u2019s offer, defense counsel made not only a reasonable, but an extremely skillful tactical decision. I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
