An explosion of litigation, the creation of new courts, new judicial remedies, inflation, the introduction of unionization into the public sector, substantial unemployment, and public resistance to tax increases created increased competition between the courts and units of local government for local tax revenues.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">The judicial system would be benefited if our \"one court of justice,\u201d Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 1, was financed by the State Legislature. While the state has undertaken to eliminate local funding of state functions, MCL 600.9947; MSA 27A.9947, relief has been forthcoming primarily in Detroit and in Wayne County. The result has been disparity in compensation and in delivery of services.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">The allocation of tax revenues has become an ever more difficult task for local funding units. The need to maintain and improve local court staff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>and services is confounded by shortage of funds. Local judges who should be independent of the political process find themselves increasingly involved in the political give-and-take inherent in the appropriation process.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">In this perplexing and disturbing situation, we attempt to provide guidance for resolution of conflict and a basis for the development of data supporting further movement toward statewide financing by procedures set forth in the administrative order attached as an appendix, effective upon issuance of the Court\u2019s judgment orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">A. <em>Hillsdale County</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">The County of Hillsdale established a contributory retirement plan in which the employees contribute three percent and the county four percent of the gross wages of all non-union county employees. In a previous action, the district court employees for that county obtained a circuit court judgment against the county declaring that they could withdraw from the plan; thereafter they entered into an agreement with the judge increasing their compensation by the four percent that the county would, under the plan, have been required to contribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">When the county refused to provide funds to pay the additional compensation, the district court issued an administrative order directing the county to pay the additional four percent to the court employees. The county again refused and the employees and the judge commenced this action in the circuit court to compel payment by the county. The county filed a countersuit for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">The circuit judge found that payment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>increase would not adversely affect the county and that failure to pay the increase would not adversely affect the operation of the district court. Placing the burden of proving that the administrative order was unreasonable on the county, the circuit judge held that the order was reasonable and that the county was obliged to pay the increased salary. The county appealed to the Court of Appeals and filed an application for leave to appeal to this Court before issuance of a decision by the Court of Appeals. We granted leave on May 17, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">B. <em>Cheboygan County</em></p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The Cheboygan circuit judge asked the county to provide $5,619.25 for a part-time mediation clerk. The board of commissioners agreed to provide $2,400 to employ one part-time employee for one full seven-hour day each week at the rate of $4.93 per hour. However, the judge hired a part-time mediation clerk for 17 <em>Vi </em>hours per week and directed that she be paid $5.91 per hour and receive pro-rata sick leave, vacation, medical, and hospital insurance benefits. The county policy is that part-time county employees do not receive such benefits. The board adopted a resolution stating that the employee would not receive fringe benefits and would be paid $4.93 per hour in accordance with county policies for all part-time personnel paid with county funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">On January 6, 1984, the judge issued Administrative Order 1984-1 requiring that the county provide the wages and benefits agreed upon by the judge. The county decided to comply to the extent of the $2,400 previously appropriated for part-time circuit court employees. In March 1984, the county advised the judge that it did not consider the employee\u2019s salary to be reasonable and necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>to the court\u2019s operations and that it would not appropriate funds beyond the $2,400. The county also took steps to charge the fringe benefit costs against the $2,400 appropriation. On March 28, 1984, the circuit judge entered Administrative Order 1984-2, requiring, inter alia, that the county refrain from altering the budget of the court without prior written consent of the court. The administrative order warned that it was enforceable through the judge\u2019s contempt power. On April 3, 1984, the judge issued an order to show cause why the county clerk should not be held in contempt for failure to comply with the administrative order. On April 6, 1984, the board, the county clerk, and the county treasurer filed a motion for immediate consideration and a complaint for superintending control with this Court. The judge filed a counter-complaint for declaratory judgment and sought an order requiring payment by the county of attorney fees incurred in defending the case before this Court. This Court granted the county\u2019s motion for immediate consideration and ordered that the case be argued and submitted as a calendar case together with the <em>Hillsdale County </em>appeal. On stipulation of the parties, hearings in circuit court to enforce the administrative orders were adjourned.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">We hold that MCR 8.112(B) does not provide authority to compel expenditures and conclude that when agreement cannot be reached between a court and a funding unit, the court may initiate suit and shall bear the burden of proof<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> regarding expenditures in excess of appropriations. Our first conclusion requires vacation of the administrative order and pendent contempt proceedings in <em>Che</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number><em>boygan Co Comm\u2019rs v Cheboygan Circuit Judge. </em>Our second conclusion requires discussion of the law applicable to the situation presented in <em>Employees &amp; Judge of the Second Judicial Dist v Hillsdale Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">The issue in <em>Hillsdale </em>is whether the district control unit has the authority to decline to fund salary increases for district court employees which were not alleged or proven to be necessary to maintain a statutory function of the court or to provide for the overall administration of justice. In <em>Cheboygan </em>the issues are whether a court may direct a county to appropriate funds by means of an administrative order and whether the circuit judge may employ counsel to defend the court\u2019s interest in these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">Each branch of government has inherent power to preserve its constitutional authority.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-8\">It was certainly never intended that any one department, through the exercise of its acknowledged powers, should be able to prevent another department from fulfilling its responsibilities to the people under the Constitution. <em>[O\u2019Coin\u2019s, Inc v Worcester Co Treasurer, </em>362 Mass 507, 511; 287 NE2d 608 (1972).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">However, an indispensable ingredient of the concept of coequal branches of government is that \"each branch must recognize and respect the limits on its own authority and the boundaries of the authority delegated to the other branches.\u201d <em>United States v Will, </em>449 US 200, 228; 101 S Ct 471; 66 L Ed 2d 392 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">No claim has been asserted in the <em>Hillsdale </em>case that a statutory function, the overall operation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>the court, or a constitutional function<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is in jeop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>ardy because of the actions taken by the funding unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The Legislature has specifically authorized the district court to \"appoint employees and fix their compensation,\u201d MCL 600.8271; MSA 27A.8271. However, we are unable to conclude from the record in <em>Hillsdale </em>that additional expenditures beyond appropriations may be compelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">This Court held in <em>Judges of the 74th Judicial Dist v Bay Co, </em>385 Mich 710; 190 NW2d 219 (1971), that the directive by the Legislature that the court shall appoint and fix compensation of its employees represents a legislative intent to place those determinations in the control of the district court judge. The court has the authority to fix salaries, which if reasonable and within appropriations, must be paid by the funding unit. <em>Sturgis v Allegan Co, </em>343 Mich 209; 72 NW2d 56 (1955). We are unable to conclude, however, that the phrase \"within appropriations provided by the . . . district control unit,\u201d MCL 600.8271; MSA 27A.8271, is a determination by the Legislature that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>funding unit is limited to <em>approving </em>the amounts fixed by the district court. To so construe the statute would be to disregard the statutory language. The Legislature has amended several statutes authorizing the courts to appoint and fix salaries.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It has not, however, eliminated the function of the funding unit. Despite amendment of the District Court Act by 1980 PA 438, the language restricting the compensation \"within appropriations fixed by the district control unit\u201d has been retained. MCL 600.8271(1); MSA 27A.8271(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">The Legislature has stated that the exercise of the judicial authority is limited to setting of salaries \"within appropriations set by the governing body of each district control unit,\u201d MCL 600.8271; MSA 27A.8271. This language cannot, however, bar a claim that an amount in excess of appropriations is necessary to fulfill a function mandated by the Legislature. To hold otherwise would be to permit a legislative directive to be frustrated by the funding units\u2019 failure to provide necessary funds. <em>Wayne Circuit Judges v Wayne Co, </em>15 Mich App 713, 726; 167 NW2d 337 (1969). See also <em>Jail Inmates v Wayne Co Sheriff, </em>391 Mich 359; 216 NW2d 910 (1974).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Where the Legislature has by statute granted authority or created a duty,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the local funding unit may not refuse to provide adequate funding to fulfill the function.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> _</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>However, since the trial court in <em>Hillsdale </em>found, and it is not disputed here, that the district court was functioning at a level \"satisfactory to all,\u201d without the four-percent increase proposed by the district court judge, there is on this record no basis for resolving the issue of when and under what standards the judiciary may compel expenditures beyond those appropriated to fulfill a statutory function.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Our responsibility in this case is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature, <em>In re Certified Question, </em>416 Mich 558; 331 NW2d 456 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">We harmonize the principles outlined above and give effect to each by concluding 1) that the court has the authority to set salaries which, if reasonable and \"within appropriations,\u201d must be approved by the control unit, and 2) that where the parties are unable to agree, the court may institute suit and shall bear the burden of proving that the appropriation it seeks is necessary to the performance of its statutorily mandated function. This construction carries out the apparent intent of the Legislature that the courts are free to appoint employees and set salaries \"within appropriations,\u201d and yet provides a means for the court to obtain additional funds where it demonstrates that they are necessary to perform a statutory function.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>The issue in <em>Cheboygan </em>is whether the trial court may employ an administrative order to compel funding in excess of appropriations. We hold that the use of administrative orders to compel payment of requested funding is inappropriate under MCR 8.112(B).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> MCR 8.112(B)(1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-5\">A trial court may issue an administrative order governing only <em>internal </em>court management. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">We conclude, in view of the clear language of the rule, that MCR 8.112(B) does not authorize trial courts to issue administrative orders to compel appropriations.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">As there has been no determination of the reasonableness of the attorney fees incurred by the circuit judge in <em>Cheboygan </em>in connection with his representation before this Court, we remand for a determination of the reasonableness of the attorney fees incurred. MCL 49.73; MSA 5.826.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">This Court has stood \"foursquare\u201d in support of the constitutional doctrine of inherent power, <em>Wayne Circuit Judges v Wayne Co (On Rehearing), supra, </em>386 Mich 8. However, the standard against which such authority is to be measured has not been articulated. Indeed, the original Black-Dethmers opinion in <em>Wayne Circuit Judges v Wayne Co, </em>383 Mich 10; 172 NW2d 436 (1969) (adopted by the Court on rehearing), references several possible standards.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">We agree with the statement of our dissenting colleagues that an inherent power analysis is implicated when judicial functions are in jeopardy. <em>Post, </em>p 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">However, this observation is simply inapplicable to the cases before us. On this record there is no allegation and no proof that the additional salary item(s) were required to be funded by any formulation of the inherent-power doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">An assertion of judicial power ultimately rests on the consent of thoughtful citizens. Where circumstances demonstrate a right and the record supports relief, history demonstrates public support. Public belief in the propriety, fairness, and justice of our decisions is essential. Therefore we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>defer to the observation that public willingness to accept and abide by a court decision \"ultimately rests on sustained public confidence in its moral sanction.\u201d <em>Baker v Carr, </em>369 US 186, 267; 82 S Ct 691; 7 L Ed 2d 663 (1962) (Frankfurter, J., <em>dissenting).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">In our judgment such confidence will be fostered by awaiting a proper record for further development of the relationship between judicial independence and the doctrine of separation of powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The opinion of the trial court in <em>Employees &amp; Judges of the Second Judicial Dist v Hillsdale Co </em>was not based on an asserted constitutionally conferred power to compel increased compensation for the district court employees; nor was it premised on an impairment of a statutory function. Therefore, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Administrative Orders 1984-1 and 1984-2 and the pendent contempt proceedings in <em>Cheboygan Co Comm\u2019rs v Cheboygan Circuit Judges </em>were not appropriate under MCR 8.112(B). Accordingly, we vacate the proceedings below. We remand to the Cheboygan Circuit Court for a determination of reasonable attorney fees under MCL 49.73; MSA 5.826 and entry of an appropriate order.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">No costs, a public question being involved.</p>\n<judges id=\"b791-9\">Levin, Brickley, and Cavanagh, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<p id=\"b791-10\">Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b791-11\">The present anomaly of constitutionally and statutorily mandated state functions financially dependent on local governments \u2014 which often operate on a limited tax base \u2014 leaves trial courts in a vulnerable and perplexing position.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-12\">Until such time as full state court financing is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>realized, it is important to accomplish several objectives. First, in the interest of governmental comity and in deference to the principle of separation of powers, it is important to avoid conflicts between state courts and local funding units that arise over unsubstantial or marginal appropriation issues. Second, it is necessary to have a procedure and a data base that will insure that where there is a substantial difference between a court and its funding unit that rises to a constitutional or statutory neglect the court can prudently but effectively protect its mandate. Finally, to give guidance to the courts in effective budgeting and in dispute resolution involving courts and local funding units, and to prepare for the administration of full state court financing, there is a need for a broader, centralized data base on trial court budgeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">In response to those concerns and in furtherance of these goals, we adopt the following Administrative Order to be effective on issuance of the judgment order in the instant cases:</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">Administrative Order No. 1985-6</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">Court Funding; Funding Disputes Between Courts and Local Funding Units; Submission of Budgets</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b792-11\">This Administrative Order applies to all trial courts as defined in MCR 8.110(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b792-13\">A court shall submit its proposed and appropriated annual budget or any supplements thereto to the State Court Administrator at the time of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>submission to or receipt from the local funding unit or units.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">If, after the local funding unit or units have made their appropriations, a court concludes that the funds provided for its operations by its local funding unit or units are insufficient to enable the court to properly perform its duties and that legal action is necessary, the procedures set forth in this order shall be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">1. Legal action may be commenced 30 days after the court has notified the State Court Administrator that a dispute exists regarding court funding that the court and the local funding unit or units have been unable to resolve. The notice must be accompanied by a written communication indicating that the chief judge of the court has approved the commencement of legal proceedings. With the notice, the court must supply the State Court Administrator with all facts relevant to the funding dispute. The State Court Administrator may extend this period for an additional 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">2. During the waiting period provided in paragraph 1, the State Court Administrator shall attempt to aid the court and the involved local funding unit or units to resolve the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">3. If, after the procedure provided in paragraph 2 has been followed, the court concludes that a civil action to compel funding is necessary, the State Court Administrator shall assign a disinterested judge to preside over the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">The procedures provided in this Administrative Order do not apply to any portion of a court\u2019s budget that is funded by the state.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-7\"> These cases do not present a question involving the authority of a court to negotiate collective bargaining agreements, <em>Livingston Co v Livingston Circuit Judge, </em>393 Mich 265; 225 NW2d 352 (1975). Our opinion is not intended to reach this question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b784-4\"> An examination of the cases dealing with funding of the courts reveals two dimensions to the disputes. The first involves the kinds of expenses for which the power to compel funding is asserted. Second, the courts reviewing such disputes have taken three distinct approaches to the issues before them.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The kinds of expenses for which the power to compel funding has been asserted can be classified along a spectrum. In the first kinds of cases, funding is sought for a specific matter necessary to conducting court, and the propriety of the amount sought is not disputed. These cases have often involved expenses necessitated by somewhat unusual, even emergency, circumstances. See, <em>e.g., O\u2019Coin\u2019s v Worcester Co Treasurer, </em>362 Mass 507; 287 NE2d 608 (1972) (tapes and tape recorder for use in criminal trials where stenographer not available); <em>Stowell v Jackson Co Bd of Supervisors, </em>57 Mich 31; 23 NW 557 (1885) (boarding and lodging costs for sequestered jury); <em>Grimsley v Twiggs Co, </em>249 Ga 632; 292 SE2d 675 (1982) (temporary clerical help for court clerk); <em>Knuepfer v Fawell, </em>96 Ill 2d 284; 449 NE2d 1312 (1983) (provision of sufficient number of courtrooms). Closely related are cases in which the authority of the court to employ certain permanent personnel is at issue. See, <em>e.g., Flathead Co Comm\u2019rs v 11th Dist Court, </em>182 Mont 463; 597 P2d 728 (1979) (county refused to fund position provided for by statute). In the next category of cases, while the court\u2019s authority to hire certain personnel may also be discussed, it is the amount of compensation which is at issue: here the proper amount of funding for the position is disputed. See, <em>e.g., In re Lyon Co Court Clerk v Lyon Co, </em>308 Minn 172; 241 NW2d 781 (1976); <em>Young v Pershing Co Bd of Comm\u2019rs, </em>91 Nev 52; 530 P2d 1203 (1975) (probation officers, secretary, and other court employees). Related cases involve the question of who, the court or the county, has the power to hire, control, and determine the compensation of court personnel. See, <em>e.g., Mowrer v Rusk, </em>95 NM 48; 618 P2d 886 (1980); <em>State ex rel Weinstein v St Louis Co, </em>451 SW2d 99 (Mo, 1970); <em>Holohan v Mahoney, </em>106 Ariz 595; 480 P2d 351 (1971). Finally, other cases involve the broadest assertion of judicial inherent power to determine the overall budget of the court; here, the focus is not upon a specific court function, or a specific cost, but instead upon the sum total of the costs for all the functions of the court. See, <em>e.g., Commonwealth ex rel Carroll v Tate, </em>442 Pa 45; 274 A2d 193 (1971); <em>Mowrer v Rusk, supra; Beckert v Warren, </em>497 Pa 137; 439 A2d 638 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The courts have also taken three distinct approaches in reviewing disputes over court funding. Sometimes, where statutes are not considered, or where the applicable statutes are found not to authorize the funding sought by the court, the issues are resolved solely on the basis of an inherent power analysis. See, <em>e.g., Commonwealth v Tate, supra; Beckert v Warren, supra; In re Salary of Juvenile Director, </em>87 Wash 2d 232; 552 P2d 163 (1976); <em>Young v Pershing Co Comm\u2019rs, supra </em>(expenses for secretary and library); <em>People ex rel Bier v Scholz, </em>77 Ill 2d 12; 394 NE2d 1157 (1979); <em>Noble Co Council v State ex rel Fifer, </em>234 Ind 172; 125 NE2d 709 (1955); <em>Smith v Miller, </em>153 Colo 35; 384 P2d 738 (1963). The second approach interprets the applicable statutes to be coextensive with the inherent power of the judiciary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>either on the grounds that the statute would otherwise be unconstitutional, or on the ground that the statute constitutes a legislative recognition of the judiciary\u2019s inherent power. See, <em>e.g., Grimsley v Twiggs Co, supra; O\u2019Coin\u2019s v Worcester Co Treasurer, supra; State v Superior Court of Marion Co, </em>264 Ind 313; 344 NE2d 61 (1976); <em>State ex rel Johnson v Taulbee, </em>66 Ohio St 2d 417; 423 NE2d 80 (1981) (discussion of prior statute). The third approach to resolving such disputes is based solely on statutory analysis. In these cases, a statute is either held to provide sufficient authority to meet the court\u2019s need, or the court\u2019s claim is held to fail because statutory procedures have not been followed. See, <em>e.g., Deddens v Cochise Co, </em>113 Ariz 75; 546 P2d 811 (1976); <em>Knuepfer v Fawell, supra; Pena v Second Dist Court, </em>681 P2d 953 (Colo, 1984); <em>State ex rel Schneider v Cunningham, </em>39 Mont 165; 101 P 962 (1909); <em>State ex rel Kitzmeyer v Davis, </em>26 Nev 373; 68 P 689 (1902).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">Inherent power analysis often does not distinguish between a court directive to provide funds to fulfill a specific constitutionally required function, and a court directive to fund that which is reasonable and necessary for the administration of justice, <em>Beckert v Warren, supra. </em>See Note: <em>The courts\u2019 inherent power to compel legislative funding of judicial functions, </em>81 Mich L R 1687-1701 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b786-7\"> MCL 600.1481; MSA 27A.1481 was amended in part by 1980 PA 438, but the provision concerning the compensation of judicial assistants (other than those in the 36th District Court, the Third Judicial Circuit Court, and the City of Detroit Recorder\u2019s Court) was unchanged: \"The compensation of a judicial assistant shall be fixed by the recommending judges within the sum appropriated therefor by the legislative body . . . .\u201d MCL 600.1471; MSA 27A.1471, which 1980 PA 438 amended to provide for law clerks in district courts as well as circuit courts, states: \"The compensation of a law clerk shall be fixed by the judges of the court within the sum appropriated for that purpose by the county board of commissioners or by the governing body of the district control unit.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b786-8\"><em> </em>Justice Brennan has explicated a distinction between the legislative and executive functions of the county.

The district court employees for the second district, second division, opted to withdraw from the retirement program, but the county refused their proposal. The employees then sued the county, and the visiting circuit judge issued an opinion holding that the employees were court, not county, employees. The trial judge also ordered that the employees be allowed to withdraw from the pension plan and that their three-percent contributions be returned. Pursuant to the trial judge\u2019s opinion, the county refunded the three percent paid by the employees. This opinion is not an issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Having successfully litigated their right to withdraw from the retirement plan, the employees then bargained as a group with the district judge for the 1983 budget. Agreement was reached which provided, in part, that the four-percent benefit, otherwise paid by the county into the retirement fund, would be paid directly to the employees. The district court submitted this agreement to the county as part of its 1983 budget proposal. The county countered by deleting the four-percent wage increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Responding to the Hillsdale Circuit Court\u2019s action, the district court issued an administrative order directing the county to pay the four-percent wage increase to the court employees. When the county refused to comply with the administrative order, the district judge and his employees commenced suit. The county filed a countersuit seeking injunctive relief. The trial judge found that payment of the four-percent wage increase would have no adverse effect on the fiscal affairs of the county; nor would failure to pay the four percent have any adverse effect on the operation of the district court. The trial court also concluded that it was the burden of the county to show that the administrative order was unreasonable. Finding the administrative order to be reasonable, the trial court ruled in favor of the employees. The county appealed to the Court of Appeals and filed an application to this Court for leave to appeal prior to a decision by the Court of Appeals, which we granted on May 17, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">B. <em>Cheboygan County</em></p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The Cheboygan County Board of Commissioners (hereinafter, the board) is the supervising body of Cheboygan County and is responsible for all public funds received by the county. Each funded unit within the county is responsible for submitting a budget proposal to the board for the following fiscal year. On September 16, 1983, Circuit Judge Livo sent the board a copy of the 1983 budget with the amounts requested for the fiscal year 1984. On September 21, 1983, Judge Livo met with the county budget committee and submitted an alternative budget, requesting a greater appropriation for the court than he had originally proposed on September 16, 1983. In October, 1983, the county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>adopted Judge Livo\u2019s original request of September 16, 1983, for the 1984 fiscal year.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">On December 7, 1983, Judge Livo wrote the board advising that effective January 1, 1984, the court would be hiring a part-time employee who would receive a specific salary and certain fringe benefits (hospitalization and retirement). On January 3, 1984, the board adopted a resolution (consistent with county policies regarding all county-funded part-time personnel) that the proposed employee would not receive benefits and would be paid at a lower hourly rate than Judge Livo had stated in his letter of December 7, 1983. This board resolution prompted Judge Livo to issue Administrative Order 1984-1, directing the implementation of benefits reflected in his letter of December 7, 1983. The board, in an attempt to avoid further controversy, voluntarily determined not to carry out the January 3, 1984 resolution, as long as there remained existing funds in the circuit court\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">However, on March 5, 1984, the board sent a letter to Judge Livo stating that it did not consider the disputed employee\u2019s position to be reasonable and necessary to the operation of the circuit court. Furthermore, it advised that it did not intend to appropriate additional funds beyond those allowable under the original request by Judge Livo for the 1984 fiscal year. Thus, on March 28, 1984, Judge Livo entered Administrative Order 1984-2, requiring, among other things, that the clerk and the treasurer refrain from any efforts to reduce the budget of the court. The administrative order also stated that it was enforceable through Judge Livo\u2019s contempt power. On April 6, 1984, the board, the county clerk, and the county treasurer jointly filed a motion for immediate consideration and a complaint for superintending control with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>this Court. The motion for immediate consideration was granted, and it was directed that the case be submitted as a calendar case.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">A. <em>One Court of Justice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">The State of Michigan has one court of justice. Art 6, \u00a7 1 of the Michigan Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-9\">The judicial power of the state is vested exclusively in one court of justice which shall be divided into one supreme court, one court of appeals, one trial court of general jurisdiction known as the circuit court, one probate court, and courts of limited jurisdiction that the legislature may establish by a two-thirds vote of the members elected to and serving in each house.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">This section of the Michigan Constitution created a court of general jurisdiction known as the circuit court. For the administration of the circuit court, the state was divided into judicial circuits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The chief judge of the circuit court within each judicial circuit is responsible for the administrative duties of that court. One of these administrative duties requires the appointment and wage fixing of the circuit court employees within the appropriations provided by the county board. MCL 600.591; MSA 27A.591 states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-11\">(1) Except as otherwise provided by law, the chief judge of the circuit court in each judicial circuit shall appoint the employees of the circuit court in each judicial circuit and fix their compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>sation within appropriations provided by the county board of commissioners of the county or counties comprising the judicial circuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-5\">(2) Compensation of the employees of the circuit court in each judicial circuit shall be paid by the county or counties comprising the judicial circuit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Pursuant to the authority provided by art 6, \u00a7 1 of the Michigan Constitution, the Legislature created a court of limited jurisdiction in the form of a district court. MCL 600.8101; MSA 27A.8101 provides in \u00a7 8101:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-7\">(1) A district court is established in the state. The district court is a court of record. The state is divided into judicial districts of the district court each of which is an administrative unit subject to the superintending control of the supreme court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">Within the judicial districts of the district court, the presiding judge has authority over all matters of administration, subject to the supervision of this Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Similar to the statutory authority of the circuit courts, the district courts also have the statutory authority to appoint employees of the district court and fix their compensation within the appropriations provided by the governing body.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-9\">(1) Except as otherwise provided, the judges of the district court shall appoint the employees thereof and fix their compensation within appropriations provided by the governing body of each district control unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-10\">(2) Compensation of employees of the district court shall be paid by each district control unit, except as otherwise provided in this act. [MCL 600.8271; MSA 27A.8271.]_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>In <em>Judges of the 74th Judicial Dist v Bay Co, </em>385 Mich 710, 723-724; 190 NW2d 219 (1971), this Court applied the statutory authority set forth above, holding, in part, that the district judge, not the county, regulates the terms of employment with the employees of the district court, even though they are paid by the district control unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Thus, the State of Michigan has both circuit and district courts, each with the statutorily created administrative authority to appoint employees and to fix their compensation, within the appropriations provided by the governing entity. In addition to these statutorily created administrative rights, the judiciary also has certain \"inherent powers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">B. <em>Inherent Powers</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-6\">The phrase \"inherent powers\u201d is used to refer to powers included within the scope of a court\u2019s jurisdiction which a court possesses irrespective of specific grant by constitution or legislation. Such powers can neither be taken away nor abridged by the legislature. But the power a court possesses only by virtue of a statutory grant is not an inherent power. [20 Am Jur 2d, Courts, \u00a7 78, p 440.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">One of these inherent powers is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-8\">authority to incur and order paid all such expenses as are reasonably necessary for the holding of court and the administration of the duties of courts of justice. [59 ALR3d, \u00a7 2, p 574.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">This inherent authority is a judicial power insofar as it is a necessary ancillary to the power of the judicial branch of government. This inherent authority of the court is nonadjudicatory. It does not deal with justiciable matters. It only relates to the administration of the business of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>One aspect of the administration of district and circuit courts is the determination of the operational needs of the court and the establishment of a budget to provide for these needs. The power to assess these needs and compel funding for payment of same does not usurp, although it does intrude upon, the power of the legislative branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Clearly, however, our constitution has established an independent and coequal judicial branch. It follows, then, that the cost of operating this coequal branch is a legislative expense of state government, for which taxes must be assessed, and with which coequal branches may not interfere. Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 1 and art 5, \u00a7 20. If an appropriation is reasonable and necessary to the court\u2019s operation, the court has the power to declare its need.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">In Michigan, the Supreme Court has long recognized the inherent powers doctrine. In <em>Stowell v Jackson Co Bd of </em>Supervisors, 57 Mich 31, 33-34; 23 NW 557 (1885), this Court granted mandamus to compel payment by the county of a hotel bill for a sequestered jury, noting that \"the inherent power and duty of courts to exercise their functions must authorize such action as becomes expedient in the course of judicial business.\u201d In <em>Wayne Circuit Judges v Wayne Co, </em>383 Mich 10, 26; 172 NW2d 436 (1969), facing a request by the judges for mandamus to compel the appropriation of money for salaries of additional personnel, this Court recognized the inherent power doctrine but restricted its use to apply only to \"practical necessities of effectively continuing court functioning.\u201d Additional probation officers were not held to fall within this narrow definition. In <em>Wayne Circuit Judges v Wayne Co (On Rehearing), </em>386 Mich 1; 190 NW2d 228 (1971), this Court reversed its earlier decision, expressly quoting language from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number><em>Commonwealth ex rel Carroll v Tate, </em>442 Pa 45, 52; 274 A2d 193 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-4\">\"Expressed in other words, the Judiciary <em>must possess </em>the inherent power to determine and compel payment of those sums of money which are reasonable and necessary to carry out its mandated responsibilities, and its powers and duties to administer Justice, if it is to be in reality a coequal, independent Branch of Government. This principle has long been recognized, not only in this Commonwealth but also throughout the Nation.\u201d <em>[Wayne Circuit Judges, supra, 9. </em>Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Thus, it appears that in addressing fiscal crises and inadequate funding, courts have developed the doctrine of inherent power to compel adequate funding from other branches of government.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This theory has its genesis in earlier cases, which invoked the court\u2019s inherent power to compel funding for necessary judicial functions, and has grown into a broader assertion of judicial autonomy. See, <em>e.g., State ex rel Lorig v Bd of Comm\u2019rs, </em>52 Ohio St 2d 70; 369 NE2d 1046 (1977); <em>O\u2019Coin\u2019s v Treasurer, </em>362 Mass 507; 287 NE2d 608 (1972); <em>Carroll v Tate, supra, cert den </em>402 US 974 (1971); <em>Conn v Randolph, </em>35 Ill 2d 24; 219 NE2d 337 (1966); <em>Carlson v State, </em>247 Ind 631; 220 NE2d 532 (1966); <em>Smith v Miller, </em>153 Colo 35; 384 P2d 738 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">This power is said to originate, and be a necessary concomitant of, the separation of powers doctrine. This power has been stated to be necessary to preserve the integrity and freedom of the judiciary as a coequal branch of government. <em>Noble Co Council v State ex rel Fifer, </em>234 Ind 172; 125 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>NE2d 709 (1955). More importantly, it has been said that the power is necessary to preserve for the people <em>their </em>security and freedom. The Indiana court said it well as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-5\">A court of general jurisdiction, whether named in the Constitution or established in pursuance of the provisions of the Constitution, cannot be directed, controlled, or impeded in its functions by any of the other departments of the government. The security of human rights and the safety of free institutions require the absolute integrity and freedom of action of courts. <em>[Knox Co Council v State, </em>217 Ind 493, 512; 29 NE2d 405 (1940).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">It has been noted that a contrary result would effectively concede to the Legislature the power to destroy the judicial branch.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-7\">A Legislature has the power of life and death over all the Courts and over the entire Judicial system. Unless the Legislature can be compelled by the Courts to provide the money which is reasonably necessary for the proper functioning and administration of the Courts, our entire Judicial system could be extirpated, and the Legislature could make a mockery of our form of Government with its three co-equal branches \u2014 the Executive, the Legislative and the Judicial. <em>[Carroll v Tate, supra, </em>57.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">The theory has been almost unanimously accepted in case law throughout the United States. The courts of eighteen states have recognized the inherent power rule and of all states only Alabama does not. The Supreme Court of Alabama rejected the doctrine holding that it is incompati<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>ble with a true separation of powers. <em>Morgan Co Comm v Powell, </em>292 Ala 300; 293 So 2d 830 (1974). In so holding, it explicitly rejected <em>Carroll v Tate, supra, </em>which the Court viewed as the most sweeping of those decisions supporting the inherent power of the judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Many courts, while emphatically asserting the inherent power doctrine, have recognized limits on this power, as do I, and have been mindful of the need to exercise it responsibly. <em>State ex rel Hill v Sullivan, </em>48 Mont 320; 137 P 392 (1913); <em>Wayne Circuit Judges v Wayne Co, supra, </em>383 Mich 39, 42-44 (separate opinion by Adams, J.); <em>Leahey v Farrell, </em>362 Pa 52, 59-60; 66 A2d 577 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">My analysis of existing authority persuades me that, while the judiciary does have the inherent power to compel reasonable and necessary funding from the county or district control unit, the power is not absolute. Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-6\">The powers of government are divided into three branches: legislative, executive and judicial. No person exercising powers of one branch shall exercise powers properly belonging to another branch except as expressly provided in this constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Because the judiciary and appropriation authority are coequal branches of government, the separation of powers doctrine protects both a board\u2019s power over the county funds and the court\u2019s power as a judicial entity. The coequal and independent judiciary must possess powers commensurate with its responsibilities and functions which implicitly means the right to protect itself from any attempt to dilute its power. I conclude, however, that current judicial approaches to implementing the inherent power doctrine have not been sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>sensitive to the issues raised as the result of court-funding confrontations.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Because the lines demarking the authority of the branches of government and their respective powers have never been specifically defined, conflicts inevitably arise: the legislative branch wary of any intrusion by the judiciary, the judicial-branch wary of any challenge to their independence by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Implicit in the separation of powers doctrine is the concept that one branch of government must not usurp the functions of another branch and conversely no branch\u2019s power should go unchecked by another branch. Implicit also in the separation of powers doctrine is the spirit of cooperation among the three branches of government.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">For the executive, legislative, and judicial branches to operate smoothly and perform their respective duties effectively, each branch must engage in some activities constitutionally within the province of another branch of government. This crossing over is necessary to the ability of each branch to perform its exclusive function effectively, and thus this \"power\u201d that each possesses is incidental, not exclusive. It is when the judiciary exercises an incidental power, rather than its exclusive power, that it must bear the burden of establishing the need for the incidental intrusion into the legislative function. To forbid such a limited intrusion in favor of unlimited legislative discretion would be to so weaken the judicial branch as to destroy it and our tripartite form of government. The \"power of the purse\u201d is the exclusive domain of the Legislature, but it is not absolute. It may not be used to. divest the court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>the ability to function independently and effectively.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Thus, in reexamining the constitutional bases of the inherent power doctrine, I am persuaded that, while sound constitutional arguments support the judiciary\u2019s implication of the doctrine, the judiciary must bear the burden of articulating the constitutional bases for asserting this power.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">It is because of the practical and theoretical problems that court-funding litigation imposes that the judicial branch has agonized in search of principled procedures for minimizing these confrontations and disposing of litigation that cannot otherwise be resolved.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Today I seek a procedure that will address the constitutional, political, and practical problems created by the assertion of judicial power to compel appropriations. Historically, the judicial function has been to determine the rights of parties according to the law. Given considered guidelines relative to how to proceed in inherent power disputes, I am confident that the judicial branch will invoke its authority with caution, in a manner that will not place in jeopardy the public\u2019s confidence in the integrity of the judiciary._</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>C. <em>Uniform Budgeting and Accounting Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 1, gives the Legislature authority and requires it to provide by law for maintenance of a uniform accounting system (which requires certain charts of accounts or categories) by units of local government. The Legislature has done this in MCL 141.421 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.3228(21) <em>et seq. </em>Under this statute, there is now a requirement that a \"local unit\u201d of government conform to the uniform accounting procedures manual. The procedures preclude local administrative officers from spending money except as authorized by their boards of commissioners. Also, money may not be transferred from one budgetary account to another without the board\u2019s approval. Thus, lump-sum budgetary appropriations are eliminated under the 1978 Uniform Budgeting and Accounting Act. In addition, the act now permits line-item appropriations.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">The issue arises in <em>Cheboygan Co </em>whether the court is a \"local unit\u201d within the meaning of the act, thus subject to line-item appropriations. I conclude that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">\"Local unit\u201d is defined in MCL 141.422d(2); MSA 5.3228(22d)(2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-8\">Except as used in sections 14 to 20a, \"local unit\u201d means a village, city, township, or an authority or commission established by a village, city, or township ordinance or charter. As used in section 14 to 20a, \"local unit\u201d means any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-9\">(a) A village.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-10\">(b) A city.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-11\">(c) A local school district.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-12\">(d) An intermediate school district.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-13\">(e) A township.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-14\">(f) A county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-15\">(g) A county road commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>(h) An authority or organization of government established by law which may issue obligations pursuant to Act No. 202 of the Public Acts of 1943, as amended, and which either may levy a property tax or may expend funds of the authority or organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">There is no reference in the act to any judicial appropriations or to any judicial units within the state; in particular, trial courts are not mentioned in the act or in its definitional sections. While subsection (2d)(l)(f) specifies that the board of commissioners of a county is the \"legislative body,\u201d the same section defining \"local units\u201d makes no reference to the judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Therefore, because the district and circuit courts do not come within the parameters of the Uniform Budgeting and Accounting Act, the county board or control unit cannot interfere with a court\u2019s inherent and statutory authority by the use of line-item appropriations. In so concluding, I nevertheless urge my judicial colleagues to make a good-faith effort to accommodate their county boards by submitting their court budgets in a manner that will facilitate their boards\u2019 compliance with the Uniform Budgeting and Accounting Act requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">D. <em>Administrative Orders</em></p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">Finally, I address the propriety of a court entering an administrative order to compel funding for court operations. MCR 8.112(B).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This court rule, as did GCR 1963, 927.2(a), provides that_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>(1) A trial court may issue an administrative order governing only <em>internal </em>court management. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">In light of the clear language of the court rule, this Court concludes that MCR 8.112(B) provides no authority for a court to compel needed funding by issuing an administrative order. Therefore, I would hold that administrative orders may not be used as a procedure by which the courts exercise their authority to obtain reasonable and necessary appropriations.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">Thus, to lay a foundation for establishing a procedure for the trial courts of Michigan to compel funding, I would hold that the court has the inherent power to compel funding for reasonable and necessary expenditures for court operations but that this power cannot be broader than the established need which compels its exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">I would hold further that the court is not a \"local unit\u201d within the parameters of the Uniform Budgeting and Accounting Act; hence, the county has no authority to exercise line-item control over the court\u2019s budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">Finally, I would hold that it is a misuse of the administrative order as provided in MCR 8.112(B) to compel appropriations by issuing such orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">Having established this foundation, I would hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>that, when accord cannot be reached with the legislative funding authority, the court should initiate suit and bear the burden of proving that its appropriation request is reasonable and necessary to the court\u2019s operation. I would caution that to be reasonable and necessary the need must not only be practical rather than relative, but it must be shown that the funds are needed for the effective administration of justice.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s opinion should set forth specific findings of fact, identifying those judicial functions that will be in jeopardy if the appropriation requested is denied, and conclusions of law indicating why the function is required by the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">In so concluding, I reject Hillsdale County\u2019s argument that the \"serviceability\u201d test is the equivalent of the test for \"reasonableness\u201d and is the proper test to be used in appropriation disputes. The theory of a serviceable level of funding, they argue, was adopted by this Court in <em>Wayne Circuit Judges, supra, </em>9, and further defined by the Court of Appeals in <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor v Wayne Co Bd of Comm\u2019rs, </em>93 Mich App 114, 124; 286 NW2d 62 (1979), wherein the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-7\">A serviceable level of funding is the minimum budgetary appropriation at which statutorily mandated functions can be fulfilled. A serviceable level is not met when the failure to fund eliminates the function or creates an emergency immediately threatening the existence of the function. A serviceable level is not the optimal level. A function funded at a serviceable level will be carried out in a barely adequate manner, but it will be carried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>out. A function funded below a serviceable level, however, will not be fulfilled as required by statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">However, I am persuaded that \"serviceability\u201d must be equated with \"necessity\u201d and not \"reasonableness\u201d as the Hillsdale County Board argued. A serviceable level of funding is a lower level than the reasonable and necessary standard of funding defined in this opinion. A reasonable and necessary standard will provide a court with the means to carry out its constitutionally mandated functions effectively for the people of the State of Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Furthermore, implicit in this opinion is the conclusion that a court may not institute an original mandamus action to compel appropriations. This opinion requires a court to initiate suit and bear the burden of proving that its funding request is reasonable and necessary. The very fact that what must be proven is the reasonableness and necessity of the expenditure, clearly renders a mandamus proceeding inappropriate. In <em>Toan v McGinn, </em>271 Mich 28; 260 NW 108 (1935), this Court stated that mandamus will not lie to compel performance of a disputed fact, but rather only where there is a plain and clear legal duty. Consequently, a mandamus action should not be used by the judiciary to compel court-requested appropriations.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Finally, I would require that the State Court Administrator assign a circuit court judge to preside over these proceedings. I would require further that these proceedings be completed and an opinion entered within ninety days of the assignment of the circuit court judge. I would provide that, in an appeal from the trial court to the Court of Appeals, the time for taking all steps should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>halved. This includes the time for filing the claim of appeal; ordering and filing the transcript; filing the record and briefs and notice of hearing. I believe that these cases should take precedence over other cases in being placed on a session calendar and an opinion should be filed by the court within ninety days following the date of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">I would apply the guidelines and procedures set forth in this opinion to all cases now pending in the trial courts or in the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Conclusions</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Thus, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">I would reverse and remand <em>Employees &amp; Judge of the Second Judicial Dist v Hillsdale Co, </em>because the trial court improperly placed the burden of proving that the administrative order was unreasonable on the County of Hillsdale.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">And, I would vacate Administrative Order 1984-2 and the pendent contempt proceedings in <em>Bd of Comm\u2019rs of Cheboygan Co v Cheboygan Circuit Judge, </em>for the reason that the issuance of such an order was an improper use of MCR 8.112(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">I would deny Cheboygan County\u2019s request for injunction as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">Finally, I would address the remaining issue raised in <em>Cheboygan Co </em>to give guidance to the trial court in the event of future proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-12\">Attorney Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b812-13\">The procedure outlined in this opinion puts the burden on the judiciary to prove that requested appropriations for court operations are reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>and necessary. Pursuant to this procedure, a court will need to employ outside counsel to litigate its interests. Invariably, the need for outside counsel will give rise to the issue of attorney fees, as was true in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">I conclude, first, that the right to attorney fees in inherent power cases cannot arise out of MCL 49.73; MSA 5.826 or MCR 8.110(E).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In order for a board of commissioners to pay reasonable attorney fees for representation of a judge under MCL 49.73; MSA 5.826, the judge must be a defendant in a civil matter, exercising an official act or duty of the office.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Without addressing all the criteria a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>judge must meet to fall within the purview of this statute, I would dispose of its applicability solely on the \"as a defendant\u201d language. Under the procedure set forth in this opinion, the judge of a court who institutes an action to compel the provision of funds for the court\u2019s operation will always be a plaintiff, carrying the burden of proof. Thus, a judge initiating inherent power litigation would not qualify for reasonable attorney fees under MCL 49.73; MSA 5.826.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Moreover, a judge will not be able to obtain reasonable attorney fees in these inherent power cases under MCR 8.110(E).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> While this court rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>does state certain duties and powers of a chief judge, it does not grant to the judge, either expressly or by implication, the right to recover reasonable attorney fees when the judge is a party to inherent power litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">I conclude, however, that the inherent power of a court includes those powers reasonably required for its practical exercise. Michigan, as well as other jurisdictions, has allowed a court to employ counsel and recover reasonable attorney fees arising out of such inherent power litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">In <em>Wayne Circuit Judges, supra, </em>9, this Court ordered, inter alia, that the respective judgments of the circuit court and the Court of Appeals be affirmed. The circuit court, in its decision, had concluded that the judges who brought the mandamus action had the right to employ counsel and recover attorney fees and expenses incurred in connection with the litigation. By affirming the circuit court\u2019s decision on this point, this Court endorsed the right to attorney fees in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">In <em>Young v Bd of Co Comm\u2019rs of Pershing Co, </em>91 Nev 52, 55-56; 530 P2d 1203 (1975), the Nevada Supreme Court held that where a district judge was required to employ counsel to institute a mandamus action to compel the county to appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>priate certain budgetary requests, the district judge was entitled to reasonable attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Finally, the Indiana Supreme Court in <em>Levco v Auditor of the State, </em>271 Ind 415, 418; 393 NE2d 749 (1979), stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-5\">[W]here the judge institutes the action in his official capacity, not for his personal pecuniary reward, but for the purpose of meeting the operational needs of the court, a reasonable attorney fee must be paid by the county. <em>Sullivan Co Council v Hon Brian W Smith </em>[271 Ind 92; 390 NE2d 645 (1979)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Thus, I conclude that a court can employ outside counsel and recover reasonable attorney fees in an inherent power controversy. To hold otherwise would impair the inherent power of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">In concluding that there is a right to reasonable attorney fees, I conclude also that the standard for determining \"reasonableness\u201d is the standard set forth in <em>Crawley v Schick, </em>48 Mich App 728; 211 NW2d 217 (1973), and adopted by this Court in <em>Wood v DAIIE, </em>413 Mich 573; 321 NW2d 653 (1982).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals in <em>Crawley </em>held, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-8\">Where the amount of attorney fees is in dispute each case must be reviewed in light of its own particular facts. There is no precise formula for computing the reasonableness of an attorney\u2019s fee. However, among the facts to be taken into consideration in determining the reasonableness of a fee include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) the professional standing and experience of the attorney; (2) the skill, time and labor involved; (3) the amount in question and the results achieved; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>(4) the difficulty of the case; (5) the expenses incurred; and (6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client. See generally 3 Michigan Law and Practice, Attorneys and Counselors, \u00a7 44, p 275 and Disciplinary Rule 2-106(B) of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Ethics. <em>[Crawley, supra, </em>737.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">This Court in <em>Wood, supra, </em>adopted the six-factor guideline enumerated in <em>Crawley, </em>and also affirmed the Court of Appeals decision suggesting that the list was not exhaustive. The <em>Wood </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-6\">While a trial court should consider the guidelines of <em>Crawley, </em>it is not limited to those factors in making its determination. <em>[Wood, supra, </em>588.][<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>Thus, I conclude and would hold that the trial court requesting funding for reasonable and necessary court operations has the burden of proving that the requested attorney fees are reasonable. Moreover, an itemized bill of costs will not be sufficient on its face to establish reasonable attorney fees. <em>Petterman v Haverhill Farms, Inc, </em>125 Mich App 30, 33; 335 NW2d 710 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Finally, I would adopt the language in <em>Wood, supra, </em>588, to be applied in court appropriation disputes in relation to findings of specific factors and appellate review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-6\">Further, the trial court need not detail its findings as to each specific factor considered. The award will be upheld unless it appears upon appellate review that the trial court\u2019s finding on the \"reasonableness\u201d issue was an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">Thus, I would reverse and remand <em>Hillsdale </em>and <em>Cheboygan </em>for proceedings consistent with this opinion. And, I would award no costs, a public issue being involved.</p>\n<judges id=\"b818-8\">Williams, C.J., and Ryan, J., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b794-8\"> It may be argued, as does the majority, that in deciding these cases we need not address the constitutional doctrine of inherent power because there is statutory authority that may be relied upon to decide the instant cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">I do not agree. I address the constitutional issue because I believe . that to do otherwise is to miscalculate the enormity of the problem and to be insensitive to the concerns of members of the judiciary and county funding units who seek our guidance. Implicit in the conflicts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>that arise between these two units of government is the issue of inherent power. To leave this issue \"to another day,\u201d as my colleagues do, is to leave unresolved the fundamental question in cases that have plagued us for a decade; and thus prolong the struggle rather than speak to it now. This, I believe, does not serve the parties in the instant cases, those cases presently making their way through the court system, nor the people of the State of Michigan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b798-12\"> \"The state is divided into judicial circuits as provided in this chapter [600.502 through 600.549g].\u201d MCL 600.501; MSA 27A.501.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b799-12\"> \"The presiding judge shall have full authority and control, subject to supervision of the supreme court, over all matters of administration.\u201d MCL 600.8221; MSA 27A.8221.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b802-8\"><em> </em>See Note: <em>The courts\u2019 inherent power to compel legislative funding of judicial functions, </em>81 Mich L R 1687-1701 (1983); Baar, <em>Separate but subservient: Court budgeting in the American states, </em>pp 6-7 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b803-9\"> Conversely, this slight intrusion by the judicial branch into the legislative function does little to weaken the legislative branch.

My signature is appended to, and I fully support, the well-reasoned opinion of Justice Riley in this matter. I write separately, because, as Chief Justice, I have been intimately involved with the trial courts in their struggles with the problems giving rise to these lawsuits and with the need for guidance in bringing about their resolution. The problems in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>volving these parties are unfortunately neither peculiar to them, nor rare and uncommon.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">As a consequence, I will review further the origins and status of the problem and the relationship of statutory power and inherent power as a solution for the problem. I do so knowing of the urgent need for understanding to preserve the smooth functioning of our political system of separation of powers. To fail to do so is to put form over substance and to fiddle while Rome burns.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">I. The Underlying Problem</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">The 1963 Constitution established one court of justice, and the Legislature, in 1980 PA 438, took the first steps to financially implement that mandate. Act 438 provided for state assumption of court costs for the Wayne Circuit, Detroit Recorder\u2019s, and the 36th District Courts. At the same time, the Legislature promised to assume the costs of the courts of the rest of the state. However, for whatever reason, except for partial payment of judges\u2019 salaries, the Legislature has not yet fulfilled its promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">Meanwhile, most state courts and local funding units struggle with the outmoded and inadequate system of local funding of state courts. In some instances, superior statesmanship on both sides or luck and local prosperity have produced harmonious and successful funding of the administration of justice on a viable level. Elsewhere, the judiciary has struggled with inadequate support and understanding. In too many cases, efforts at negotiated resolution of differences have broken down, and the local judiciary in one way or another has sought to enforce compliance with perceived requirements and entitlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">The ubiquitousness of dissatisfaction and conflict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>is illustrated by the fact that on the local level both sides have established training in how to legally and procedurally outmaneuver the other side, while both sides at a different level have endeavored to promote conciliation and compromise in order to avoid such conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">The two cases at bar, therefore, are not unique and rare phenomena requiring only individual resolution of two specific differences of opinion. These two cases are merely the first two in an already enlarging pipeline tapping a sea of discontent and conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">As a consequence, this Court is called upon not merely to decide between <em>A </em>and <em>B </em>and <em>C </em>and <em>D, </em>but to lay down comprehensible guidelines to reasonably regulate the flow of problem solving, with as much understanding and civility and with as little confusion and acrimony as possible. With this in mind, I will consider general principles, their application to the facts, appropriate procedures for future conflict resolution, and guidelines for possible further proceedings in the instant matters.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">II. Basis foe Statutory Power</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">It is absolutely correct that there is a doctrine of statutory power as well as a doctrine of constitutional inherent power. <em>People v Macomb Co, </em>3 Mich 475 (1855); <em>Sturgis v Allegan Co, </em>343 Mich 209; 72 NW2d 56 (1955); <em>Jail Inmates v Wayne Co Sheriff, </em>391 Mich 359; 216 NW2d 910 (1974). These cases indicate that where there is no question either of the clear statutory duty of a governmen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>tal entity to pay an obligation or of the reasonableness of the obligation, the Court will enforce payment of that obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The obligations in the three cited cases were, respectively, costs incurred by a county board of health as required by statute, the salary of a county school superintendent fixed by the education board pursuant to statute, and the costs to provide, as required by statute, a \"suitable and sufficient jail.\u201d In each case, no question was raised as to the reasonableness of the amount or to the statutory mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">The salient principle in the doctrine of statutory power is that the court is not exercising its own discretion, but is enforcing the mandate of the Legislature. As <em>Allegan </em>recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-7\">The situation here is that we are dealing with plaintiff\u2019s right to collect a salary, not claimed to be unreasonable in amount, <em>duly fixed in accordance with an act of the legislature. </em>[343 Mich 217. Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">Indeed, in both <em>Macomb </em>and <em>Jail Inmates, </em>it is emphasized that the Legislature has so well specified what it wants done, that the county has no subordinate legislative power to exercise, but only to carry out. the Legislature\u2019s mandate in an executive capacity. 3 Mich 478; 391 Mich 364. In other words, the county has no discretion to exercise. It has only to perform the duty to pay imposed by the Legislature. And the court\u2019s only function is to enforce that legislative mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">III. Basis for Inherent Power</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">Justice Riley, in Part 11(B) of her opinion, has clearly set out the origins, universal acceptance, and character of the doctrine of inherent power. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>remains therefore in this opinion only to examine and compare the differences in the bases for statutory and inherent power.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">In examining the doctrine of <em>statutory power, </em>I concluded that \"[t]he salient principle in the doctrine of statutory power is that the Court is not exercising its own discretion but is enforcing the mandate of the Legislature.\u201d In the cases we examined, the court was ordering the county to pay health bills, a superintendent of education\u2019s salary, and jail-improvement costs, all clearly and unequivocally upon the mandate of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">In examining the doctrine of <em>inherent power, </em>we are dealing with the exercise of a power by a court to protect the court\u2019s constitutional position in our tripartite governmental system. See Riley, J., <em>ante, </em>pp 736-737; <em>Wayne Circuit Judges v Wayne Co (On Rehearing), </em>386 Mich 1, 9; 190 NW2d 228 (1971). The basis for the specific exercise of the power may be possessed \"irrespective of specific grant by constitution or legislation.\u201d 20 Am Jur 2d, Courts, \u00a7 78, p 440, quoted by Justice Riley, <em>ante, </em>p 734. Or it may arise because of support of a specific constitutional right, such as the right to trial by jury, <em>e.g., Stowell v Jackson Co Bd of Supervisors, </em>57 Mich 31 (1885) mentioned by Justice Riley, <em>ante, </em>p 735. Likewise, the basis may be constitutional with legislative mandate, as ordering additional personnel in order to administer justice, <em>Wayne Circuit Judges, supra, </em>referenced by Justice Riley, p 735. See also the opinion of Justice Levin in <em>Wayne Circuit Judges v Wayne Co, </em>15 Mich App 713, 723; 167 NW2d 337 (1969): \"In almost all the cases where the inherent power of the judiciary to direct the appropriation of funds was recognized the court also relied on legislation authorizing the expenditure . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>In short, the basic difference in the foundation for the exercise of statutory power and for the exercise of inherent power is that, with respect to statutory power, the court is enforcing a clear legislative mandate without employing its own discretionary judgment, whereas, with respect to inherent power, the court in its sound constitutional judgment is protecting its position in our tripartite system of government, usually in order to properly continue the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">IV. Application of Analysis to Instant Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Before turning to the instant facts, it may be instructive to review the analysis as applied to the cited Michigan cases. Obviously, in <em>Macomb, Allegan, </em>and <em>Jail Inmates, </em>the Court was enforcing the clear legislative mandate to pay bills for Health Department smallpox services ordered by the Legislature, to pay the salary of a school superintendent fixed in accordance with statute, and also to pay costs to provide a \"suitable and sufficient jail\u201d per statute. The Court was not protecting its own constitutional place in government, it was enforcing the Legislature\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">In <em>Wayne Circuit Judges, </em>however, the court was protecting its constitutional role to administer justice. The court had requested additional personnel, over and above the budget appropriated by the county. The county refused to pay for such personnel. The county did not claim such personnel were not needed nor unreasonable. The county challenged the right of the court to order the county to pay for such personnel. 383 Mich 34 (opinion of Black, J.) and 386 Mich 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">Looking to the instant facts, it is abundantly apparent that there is no clear statutory mandate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>to enforce, and hence statutory power cannot support these actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">What is the mandate? What are the facts? The mandate is for the funding unit to pay compensation fixed by the court \"within appropriations provided.\u201d The facts in both <em>Hillsdale </em>and <em>Cheboygan </em>appear to be that the courts were seeking compensation not \"within,\u201d but in excess of \"appropriations provided.\u201d There is no clear mandate because the Legislature ordered payment only when the compensation was \"within appropriations provided,\u201d and here payment was not \"within appropriations provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">In both cases the records indicate that the courts sought to have items included in the budget which the county specifically excluded. There is nothing in the record to indicate that there were internal budget transfers to provide for compensation for the rejected items. Rather, it would appear that the courts were seeking to compel payment of compensation outside of, and in excess of, the budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">If there had been lawful budget transfers so that the employee or employees could be paid the court-fixed compensation \"within appropriations provided,\u201d then statutory power could be used to compel payment if the county refused to pay, because such payment would fall within the Legislature\u2019s mandate. The same would be true if another employee with the same compensation retired and was not replaced, because funds from the retired employee would then be available. If, however, the court were seeking to compel the payment of compensation for employees at a higher rate along with all the rest of the budget granted, as in <em>Hillsdale, </em>or was seeking to compel the compensation of an additional employee over and above all the other employees and other expenses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>as in <em>Cheboygan, </em>then the court would not be enforcing a legislative mandate, and statutory-power would not support the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">At this point, it might be remarked that in <em>Cheboygan </em>the county did not refuse to pay the part-time employee in question while there were funds available for such payments and for the rest of the budget presumably. If at that point, while there were yet funds available, the county had refused to pay the part-time employee in issue, then the theory of statutory power would have applied. In fact, however, the county paid until such funds ran out before challenging payment for this employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">The theory behind this rule is as follows. The phrase, \"fix their compensation within appropriations provided\u201d by the governmental unit, is a significant and pregnant statement. On the one hand, it permits judicial appointment of personnel and setting of salaries to be paid by local government under MCL 600.591; MSA 27A.591 and MCL 600.8271; MSA 27A.8271, but, on th\u00e9 other hand, it allows the exercise of that judicial power only within the limitation \"within appropriations provided.\u201d \"[W]ithin appropriations provided\u201d means that the Legislature has delegated to the local unit the <em>legislative </em>discretion to determine the maximum appropriation. <em>Judges of the 74th Judicial Dist v Bay Co, 385 </em>Mich 710, 726; 190 NW2d 219 (1971). That limitation is of utmost significance. While the local unit of government is generally subordinate to the Legislature\u2019s mandate to pay for salaries fixed for personnel appointed by the judiciary, the previously recognized limitation of \"within appropriations provided\u201d transforms a purely executive response by local government into an executive response modified by the grant of specific legislative power contained in the limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>tion \"within appropriations provided.\u201d In other words, the court has no clear legislative mandate to enforce unless the local governmental unit is refusing to pay compensation \"within [the] appropriations provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">If the local unit of government refused to pay compensation \"within appropriations provided,\u201d then it might very well be violating the doctrine set forth in <em>Allegan, </em>where the county refused to pay the salary of a superintendent of education fixed according to statute and where there was no statutory limitation and no contesting of the reasonableness or need.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">In short, in neither <em>Hillsdale </em>nor <em>Cheboygan </em>is there a clear mandate of the Legislature to enforce. The applicable legislation relates to compensation \"within appropriations provided.\u201d The applicable facts relate to compensation <em>not </em>\"within appropriations provided.\u201d Therefore, there is no legislative mandate with respect to the facts of <em>Hillsdale </em>and <em>Cheboygan </em>for the courts to enforce under <em>statutory power. </em>If appropriate, enforcement can only be through the exercise of inherent power.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">Thus, this construction of \"within the appropriations provided\u201d is clear. Justice Brennan, in <em>Judges v Bay Co, supra, </em>726, adverted to this fact as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-8\">If, however, the statute means what it says, <em>i.e., </em>that the judges are to fix the compensation of their employees, then it follows that the language \"within appropriations\u201d simply means that the judges\u2019 statutory power to employ personnel and fix their compensation must be exercised within the overall limits of funds appropriated by the district control unit or units, for the operation and maintenance of the district court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>Furthermore, the comments of Justice Adams in his separate opinion in Wayne <em>Circuit Judges, </em>383 Mich 47, are apropos:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-4\">In my view, the Court of Appeals has confused the implementation of inherent power with the exercise of statutory authority. Inherent power, when it is present, needs no statutory implementation. But where a court is proceeding under a statute, it is bound by the statute\u2019s terms and conditions. The action taken must conform to the statute and may not be in derogation of that part of the statute which imposes restrictive conditions.</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b820-8\"> These cases do not present a question involving the authority of a court to negotiate collective bargaining agreements, <em>Livingston Co v Livingston Circuit Judge, </em>393 Mich 265; 225 NW2d 352 (1975). We do not express an opinion on the method by which such controversies shall be resolved.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
