The probate court and Court of Appeals concluded that adopted grandchildren were excluded. We disagree, and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b701-14\">Jane Gilmore Maloney, the settlor, created an irrevocable <em>inter vivos </em>trust on December 29, 1964, designating it as the \"Jane Gilmore Maloney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Grandchildren\u2019s Trust, dated December 29, 1964.\u201d It provided that until February 1, 1975, the income from the trust would be distributed to public bodies or charitable organizations. On February 1, 1975, the trust property was to be separated into equal funds for each of the settlor\u2019s grandchildren living on that date.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trust instrument further provided that if additional grandchildren were born after February 1, 1975, and before the final distribution of the trust property,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>separate funds for these grandchildren were to be created by deducting equal shares from the then-existing funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">On February 1, 1975, there were three grandchildren of the settlor living, and separate funds were created as provided by the trust instrument.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The present dispute arose because on June 25, 1976, one of the settlor\u2019s sons adopted three children.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">The trustee was uncertain as to the status of the adopted children and brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment as to their right to participate as beneficiaries of the trust. The action was treated as a petition for instructions, and was transferred to the probate court under MCL 700.22; MSA 27.5022.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">The probate court and the Court of Appeals recognized that MCL 700.128; MSA 27.5128 creates a presumption that adopted persons are within terms such as \"grandchild,\u201d unless it appears from the terms of a trust agreement or will that they are to be excluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>In the construction of a trust agreement or will, whether executed on, before, or after June 23, 1966, the term \"child\u201d, \"grandchild\u201d, \"issue\u201d, \"heir\u201d, \"descendant\u201d, \"beneficiary\u201d or other equivalent term shall be construed to include any adopted person and his descendants whether natural or adopted unless a contrary intention appears by the terms of the instrument or unless the estate devised to the \"child\u201d, \"grandchild\u201d, \"issue\u201d, \"heir\u201d, \"descendant\u201d, \"beneficiary\u201d or equivalent person vested before June 23, 1966, in an already ascertained person or persons who have an immediate indefeasible right of enjoyment or a present indefeasible fixed right of future enjoyment in the estate.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Both courts, however, found such an intention to exclude adopted grandchildren because of the settlor\u2019s use of the words \"born\u201d and \"date of birth\u201d at several points.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The probate court reasoned that inclusion of adopted grandchildren would require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>rewriting the trust document to add reference to the date of entry of an order of adoption. The court directed the trustee not to withdraw assets from the existing trusts for the natural-born grandchildren of the settlor.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">The guardian ad litem of the adopted grandchildren appealed, but the Court of Appeals affirmed in an Unpublished per curiam opinion. The Court of Appeals also focused on the reference to when grandchildren were \"born\u201d and to their \"dates of birth.\u201d It noted several cases in other jurisdictions holding that classifications of beneficiaries by birth indicates an intent to include only natural born persons.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It agreed with the probate court that inclusion of adopted grandchildren would require too drastic a revision of the operative provisions of the trust:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\">We cannot agree, as appellants apparently contend, that only a declaration similar to \"I intend to exclude adopted grandchildren\u201d would clearly and unambiguously express the settlor\u2019s intent. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>read the words \"born or adopted\u201d into the document at every place where the term \"born,\u201d or similar language referring to birth, appears, exceeds the proper bounds of trust construction and amounts to reformation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">We granted leave to appeal. 419 Mich 933 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">II</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-6\">A fundamental precept which governs the judicial review of wills is that the intent of the testator is to be carried out as nearly as possible. As with other legal documents, the \"intent\u201d is to be gleaned from the will itself unless an ambiguity is present. The law is loath to supplement the language of such documents with extrinsic information. This is especially so in the case of testamentary documents because the maker is not available to provide additional facts or insight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">However, presence of an ambiguity requires a court to look outside the four corners of a will in order to carry out the testator\u2019s intent. Accordingly, if a will evinces a patent or latent ambiguity, a court may establish intent by considering two outside sources: (1) surrounding circumstances, and (2) rule of construction. <em>In re Butterfield Estate, </em>405 Mich 702, 711; 275 NW2d 262 (1979). <em>[In re Kremlick Estate, </em>417 Mich 237, 240; 331 NW2d 228 (1983), <em>reh den </em>417 Mich 1143 (1983).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">These general rules apply to the interpretation of trust documents. We note that generally, a settlor must relinquish permanent control of trust property to enjoy the favorable tax consequences inherent in an irrevocable <em>inter vivos </em>trust. Bogert, Trusts &amp; Trustees (2d ed), \u00a7234, pp 47-48. Accordingly, we should ascertain the settlor\u2019s intent at the time the instrument was created.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">We cannot say that the wording of the trust is clear and unambiguous. We believe that the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>of Appeals and the probate court have attached undue importance to the use of the term \"born\u201d and \"date of birth\u201d in the trust instrument. Those terms appear to us to be convenient ways of explaining the mechanics of the administration of the trust. We are not persuaded that those terms clearly indicate an intent to exclude adopted grandchildren.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The Court of Appeals noted that classification by birth generally indicated an unambiguous intent to include only natural born persons. See n 7. However, numerous cases from this and other jurisdictions indicate that such an interpretation is far from the general or prevailing view. On the contrary, different circumstances, statutes, and instruments have created a variety of results. See generally, 76 Am Jur 2d, Trusts, \u00a7 144, pp 386-387; Bogert, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 182, pp 267-306. 86 ALR2d 115, \u00a7 4 (Later Case Service, pp 343-346).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">We find that the wording of the trust is ambiguous. Accordingly, the rule of construction which includes adopted persons should be employed. MCL 700.128; MSA 27.5128. That statute requires an expression of intent to the contrary. However, we find no indication of an affirmative intention to exclude adopted children.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At the time the trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>instrument was executed, there were no adopted grandchildren, and we think it likely that the settlor simply did not consider that possibility. We hold that, in the absence of any expressed intention, the statutory presumption that adopted grandchildren are to be treated like any other grandchild controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals and the probate court\u2019s order dated September 9, 1981, are reversed. The case is remanded to the probate court for an entry of an order instructing the trustee to make a proper division of the trust assets and to provide equal trusts for the adopted grandchildren in accordance with the terms of the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b707-6\">Williams, C.J., and Levin, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b702-10\"> The trust instrument provided that if there were no grandchild living on that date, such a fund should be created on the date of birth of the first grandchild.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b702-11\"> The final distribution date was to be when the settlor\u2019s youngest surviving son reached fifty years of age or on the death of both sons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b702-12\"> Another grandchild was born on June 1, 1980.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b702-13\"> All three of the adopted children had been born before 1975.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b703-6\"> In 1957 the Legislature amended the adoption code to provide that adopted persons have all of the rights of natural children. 1957 PA 255.

These statutes reversed the common-law presumption that terms such as \"child,\u201d \"grandchild,\u201d or \"issue\u201d created a presumption against including adoptees.

The court found no intent to exclude adoptees:</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">\"We therefore conclude that settlor, Willis K. Nash, used no expression indicative of his attitude toward adopted children of his son, Willis Vanderhoef Nash. He very likely gave the matter no thought. The phrase 'hereafter born\u2019 was obviously intended to include those who might become children of the life tenant before the termination of the trust. It does not, in our opinion, negative the possibility of adopted children. In dividing the trust for distribution to remainder-men, settlor designated them only as 'children\u2019 of his son. <em>We cannot assume he and his attorneys were wholly oblivious to the laws of adoption when they drafted the trust instrument. </em>Settlor having at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>most shown an indifference to their effect, we are not prepared to say that considerations of public policy require us to find settlor entertained a conscious purpose to exclude adopted children. The reasoning and philosophy expressed by the legislature and the courts in this state require a contrary conclusion.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b707-7\">Ryan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aah\">(concurring). I concur in the opinion and judgment of the Court, and I write separately only to emphasize my conviction that Mrs. Maloney did not express in her <em>inter vivos </em>trust the intention that the term \"grandchild\u201d or its equivalent, as used in the trust, should be construed to exclude her later adopted grandchildren.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">Had we been called upon, without explicit guidance from the Legislature, to determine whether Mrs. Maloney, at the time she executed her <em>inter vivos </em>trust, intended that any children who may later have been adopted by either of her sons were to be considered to be her grandchildren within the meaning of the trust, our task might have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>been more difficult than it actually is. As events occurred, however, the Legislature has greatly simplified our task and, in my judgment, made the construction of this trust easy and evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The trust document was executed in 1964. In 1978, with the enactment of MCL 700.128; MSA 27.5128, the Legislature mandated, in effect, that the term \"grandchild\u201d or \"its equivalent\u201d in Mrs. Maloney\u2019s trust \"shall be construed\u201d to include her adopted grandchildren \"unless a contrary intention appears by the <em>terms of the instrument . . . </em><footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Therefore, our duty is simply to examine the language of the instrument to determine whether Mrs. Maloney expressed an intention that her later adopted grandchildren were <em>not </em>to be considered to be her \"grandchild,\u201d \"issue,\u201d \"heir,\u201d \"descendant,\u201d or \"beneficiary,\u201d because that is the \"contrary intention\u201d but for which the Legislature has commanded that all of Mrs. Maloney\u2019s grandchildren, biological and adopted, are entitled to take under the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">After the most careful scrutiny of the trust instrument, I can find nothing in the language of the trust that suggests even remotely that Mrs. Maloney gave the slightest consideration to including or excluding her later adopted grandchildren, or even that she adverted at all to the possibility that she may someday have grandchildren by adoption. It is sound to conclude, judging from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>language of the instrument at least, that Mrs. Maloney never considered the matter. In using the words \"born\u201d and \"date of birth\u201d in the trust, Mrs. Maloney and her scrivener were employing common, familiar, and convenient terms to describe, as my brother Cavanagh says, \"the mechanics of the administration of the trust.\u201d They were establishing a method, by reference to an event the settlor did consider probable, having grandchildren, for the orderly and uniform subdivision of the trust corpus in order that Mrs. Maloney could make provision for equal treatment of all her grandchildren.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">To conclude that Mrs. Maloney intended that \"grandchild\u201d and \"grandchildren,\u201d as used in the trust, did not include grandchildren who might later be adopted, and that she expressed that purpose by employing the terms \"born\u201d and \"date of birth,\u201d is to ascribe to Mrs. Maloney an intention to divide her grandchildren into two classes, biological and adopted, and to cut oif from her beneficence her later adopted grandchildren solely because they were adopted; and to do so by employing the most imprecise, abstruse, and cryptic language imaginable in a trust instrument that is otherwise a model of clarity, simplicity, and lucidity.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">For those reasons, it is my judgment that only by the most strained and unfriendly interpretation of the trust instrument can it be concluded that Mrs. Maloney intended to foreclose her later adopted grandchildren from sharing in the family wealth to the same extent as their cousins.</p>\n<judges id=\"b709-6\">Williams, C.J., and Levin, J., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b708-9\"> \"In the construction of a trust agreement or will, whether executed on, before, or after June 23, 1966, the term 'child\u2019, 'grandchild\u2019, 'issue\u2019, 'heir\u2019, 'descendant\u2019, 'beneficiary\u2019 or other equivalent term shall be construed to include any adopted person and his descendants whether natural or adopted unless a contrary intention appears by the terms of the instrument or unless the estate devised to the 'child\u2019, 'grandchild\u2019, 'issue\u2019, 'heir\u2019, 'descendant\u2019, 'beneficiary\u2019 or equivalent person vested before June 23, 1966, in an already ascertained person or persons who have an immediate indefeasible right of enjoyment or a present indefeasible fixed right of future enjoyment in the estate.\u201d MCL 700.128; MSA 27.5128.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b709-7\">Brickley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJ0\">(concurring). I concur with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>majority result, but write separately to express a somewhat different analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">I agree that the settlor did not express in her will \"a contrary intent\u201d on the question whether adopted children were to be included as beneficiaries. The reference to \"born\u201d and \"date of birth\u201d are neutral terms in relation to the question whether adoptees were intended to be included.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">However, after application of MCL 700.128; MSA 27.5128 to interpret the word \"grandchild\u201d to include an adoptee, a literal reading of the remainder of the instrument still excludes the adopted children because they were not \"born between the initial division date [February 1, 1975] and the final division date,\u201d even though they were adopted during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">A further look at the instrument, however, discloses an ambiguity, if the words \"born\u201d and \"at birth\u201d are read literally. Paragraph 7 of the trust states \"[i]f no grandchild[ren] . . . [are] born before the final division date\u201d then the trust shall be allocated to other beneficiaries. Under this section the adopted grandchildren, having obviously been born before the final disposition date, would have been included in that definition of grandchildren, given the application of \u00a7 128 of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">On the other hand, under paragraph 5 of the trust, the adopted children having been born before February 1, 1975, would have been excluded in that paragraph\u2019s definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">The fact that the use of \"born\u201d in paragraph 5 excludes these adopted grandchildren, even after the application of \u00a7 128, and the use of \"born\u201d in paragraph 7 included those same adopted grandchildren not only creates an ambiguity within the instrument itself, but makes it clear that the words \"born\u201d and \"at birth\u201d were intended to fix the date at which a grandchild becomes a grand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>child rather than to have the date of birth become determinative as to eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">To give a literal reading to \"born\u201d and \"at birth\u201d under paragraph 5 of the trust, thereby excluding these adopted children because they were born before February 1, 1975, would bring about a result unintended by the use of these words.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">When an ambiguity presents itself within the instrument, it is our responsibility to interpret it in a way most consonant with the overall intention of the settlor. <em>In re Butter\u00f1eld Estate, </em>405 Mich 702, 711; 275 NW2d 262 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">We can best effectuate the legislatively presumed intention of the settlor to include adoptees under the word \"grandchild\u201d by reading \"born\u201d and \"at birth\u201d to be equivalent to \"adopted\u201d and \"at adoption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">I therefore concur in the result of the majority.</p>\n<judges id=\"b711-8\">Levin, J., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b711-9\">Riley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AaN5\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">The issue presented is whether the specific terms of the trust agreement at issue indicate an intent to include only natural born grandchildren and thus to exclude adopted grandchildren from the class of beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">Pursuant to the trust agreement\u2019s \"initial division date\u201d provision, on February 1, 1975, the trust corpus was divided equally into separate trusts for the settlor\u2019s then living grandchildren, and a fund was specifically named for each.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The funds set aside in the separate trusts for each such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>grandchild are subject to subsequent reallocation, by the terms of the instrument, to provide a share for each grandchild of the settlor born after the initial division date. The \"open\u201d provision of the trust agreement is reflected in paragraph five and reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">If a grandchild or grandchildren of mine shall be born between the initial division date and the final division date, then as of the date of birth of each such grandchild the trustee shall deduct equally from the separate funds . . . sufficient amounts to provide an additional separate fund to be designated by the name of such newly born grandchild equal in value to the average value (after deduction of such amounts) of the funds from which the deductions are made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">The question is whether the trust assets are to be reapportioned for the benefit of the grandchildren adopted by one of the settlor\u2019s sons, on June 25, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">The Revised Probate Code, \u00a7 128, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-9\">In the construction of a trust agreement or will, whether executed on, before, or after June 23, 1966, the term \"child\u201d, \"grandchild\u201d, \"issue\u201d, \"heir\u201d, \"descendant\u201d, \"beneficiary\u201d or other equivalent term shall be construed to include any adopted person and his descendants whether natural or adopted unless a contrary intention appears by the terms of the instrument .... [MCL 700.128; MSA 27.5128.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">It is argued for the appellants (adopted children) that the terms \"born\u201d or \"birth\u201d in paragraphs three, five, and seven of the trust agreement<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> do not indicate an intent to exclude the adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>grandchildren, and that these terms are to be treated as \"equivalent terms\u201d within the statute. Thus, the statutory rule of construction is applicable, and separate trusts should be established for the appellants pursuant to paragraph five of the trust instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">For the appellees (natural children) it is argued that the use of the words \"born\u201d and \"birth,\u201d is, in and of itself, a manifestation of an intent to include only natural-born children, and that the consistent use of these terms by the settlor in the present case indicates an intention that the trust assets be reapportioned only for the benefit of the settlor\u2019s natural-born grandchildren.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Cases from other jurisdictions that have involved construing similar terms in wills, testamentary, or <em>inter vivos </em>trusts, seem to support the appellees\u2019 position. See <em>Thomas v Trust Co Bank, </em>247 Ga 693; 279 SE2d 440 (1981) (adopted children of income beneficiary of <em>inter vivos </em>trust did not qualify as remaindermen of trust which provided that remaindermen were \"the children born or to be born\u201d of the beneficiary); <em>Whitfield v Matthews, </em>334 So 2d 876 (Ala, 1976) (adopted child not included as beneficiary in <em>inter vivos </em>trust where trust instrument provided that trust was for benefit of \"children now or later born\u201d to trustor\u2019s son); <em>First Natl Bank v Waldron, </em>406 SW2d 56 (Mo, 1966) (adoptive children excluded where beneficiaries limited to \"and their children, born in lawful wedlock\u201d); <em>Knox College v Jones Store Co, </em>406 SW2d 675 (Mo, 1966) (child adopted by life tenant not included where trust deed provided that it was made for \"use and benefit\u201d of life tenant and named natural-born sons of life tenant, which class could be enlarged to include other children as \"may be born to\u201d life tenant). See also <em>Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co v Andrews, </em>264 NC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>531; 142 SE2d 182 (1965); <em>Vaughn v Vaughn, </em>161 Tex 104; 337 SW2d 793 (I960). The only decision brought to our attention reaching a contrary result is <em>In re Trusteeship Under Agreement With Nash, </em>265 Minn 412; 122 NW2d 104 (1963).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Nevertheless, it must be noted that every trust is unique. In <em>In re Trusteeship Under Agreement With Nash, supra, </em>415, the Minnesota Court, in construing the trust agreement in that case, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-5\">No case has been called to our attention in which the precise language of this trust has been construed. We have noted that every testator\u2019s circumstances and plan of disposition is unique, that \"no will has a brother,\u201d and therefore precedents are of no great value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">While the use of the terms \"born\u201d or \"birth\u201d may not, in and of itself, indicate an intent to include only natural-born children within an open class of beneficiaries, the decision of the Court of Appeals in the present case, that the use of these terms within the context of the subject trust agreement does indicate such an intent, was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">In the trust agreement at issue, the word \"born\u201d was used four times and the words \"date of birth\u201d were used twice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Furthermore, these terms were used in the operative provisions of the trust determining if, when, and how a separate fund is established for a grandchild. To include the adopted grandchildren, paragraph five of the trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>agreement would have to be interpreted as if it read: If a grandchild or grandchildren of mine shall be born <em>or adopted </em>between the initial division date and the final division date, then as of the date of birth <em>or date of entry of a decree or an order of adoption </em>of each such grandchild, the trustee shall deduct equally from the separate funds named for the other grandchildren of mine then held hereunder sufficient amounts to provide an additional separate fund to be designated by the name of such newly born <em>or adopted </em>grandchild.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">The section of the Revised Probate Code relied upon by the appellants is a rule of construction, and it provides in part that the term \"grandchild\u201d shall be construed to include adoptees, unless a \"contrary intention appears by the terms of the instrument.\u201d MCL 700.128; MSA 27.5128. The purpose of this statutory rule of construction, however, is not to frustrate a testator\u2019s or settlor\u2019s intent, which must be effectuated if it can be ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The statutory language at issue cannot be interpreted as requiring an express, specific, and unequivocal statement excluding adopted children. The decision of the Court of Appeals so concluding was not clearly erroneous. Thus, I would affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b715-6\">Boyle, J., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-12\"> The \"initial division date\u201d provision is incorporated in paragraph three of the trust agreement:</p>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">\"February 1, 1975, or the date of birth of the first grandchild of mine born after February 1, 1975, if there is no grandchild of mine living on February 1, 1975, shall be the 'initial division date.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b712-11\"> See <em>ante, </em>pp 637-638, n 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b714-8\"> The probate judge, in the present case, considered many of the cited cases from other jurisdictions, including <em>In re Trusteeship Under Agreement With Nash, </em>which the court found to be distinguishable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b714-9\"> See <em>ante, </em>pp 637-638, n 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
