They raise a variety of challenges to the 1979 Adult Foster Care Facility Licensing Act (afcfla), 1979 PA 218, MCL 400.701 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 16.610(51) <em>et seq., </em>and \u00a7 3b of the City and Village Zoning Act (cvza), 1921 PA 207, as amended by 1976 PA 396, MCL 125.583b; MSA 5.2933(2). We reject each of plaintiffs\u2019 challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">\n<em>Livonia v DSS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">Three of these cases involve afc small group homes located in residential areas of Livonia, Michigan. Defendants R. Roberts Residential Services, Inc., Brant Homes, Inc., and Human Services and Aftercare, Inc., are nonprofit corporations. Each corporation filed an unrelated application with the Department of Social Services (dss) for a temporary license to operate an afc small group home for six or less developmentally disabled persons. In January and February, 1981, the dss notified the City of Livonia Bureau of Inspection of these applications and its intent to issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>three temporary licenses. On March 19, 1981, the city attorney filed three separate complaints with the dss requesting that the licenses be denied because of alleged noncompliance with the afcfla, Livonia zoning ordinances and building code, and restrictive covenants in the homeowners\u2019 deeds. On May 4, 1981, the Director of the dss responded that there was no basis to deny any of the applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">In response to this decision, the city submitted a written objection with the dss on May 11, 1981, and requested an administrative hearing. In addition, the city and several homeowners filed three separate suits in the Wayne Circuit Court on April 1 and 2, 1981, seeking to permanently enjoin the licensure and operation of the homes. Temporary restraining orders were entered in each case prohibiting the dss from issuing the licenses. However, by July, 1981, defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment had been granted in each case, and the temporary restraining orders were dissolved. Plaintiffs appealed these decisions to the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The administrative proceedings continued while the appeals were pending. Pursuant to MCL 400.723(3); MSA 16.610(73)(3), temporary licenses were issued to the afc small group homes prior to the resolution of the administrative proceedings. In an opinion dated November 25, 1981, a hearing officer rejected or declined to address most of the city\u2019s challenges. He nevertheless recommended that the licenses be rescinded without prejudice because the Department of Mental Health (dmh) had failed to notify the city of its plan to establish the homes until after the site-selection process was completed and had failed to give the city an oppor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>tunity to present suggestions or objections.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On December 17, 1981, the Director of the dss adopted the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, except insofar as the hearing officer had recommended rescission. The director found that the dss had \"no legal obligation\u201d to withhold licensure pending cooperation between the dmh and local units of government. The licensures were therefore upheld. Plaintiffs apparently did not appeal this administrative decision to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The Court of Appeals upheld the circuit court decisions concerning the Roberts and Brant homes in <em>City of Livonia v Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>119 Mich App 806; 328 NW2d 1 (1982) (hereinafter <em>Livonia I). </em>However, the Court believed that the cases should be remanded to determine whether the dss had failed to comply with the afcfla on prior occasions. As to the Human Services home, the Court of Appeals, in an opinion by Justice Riley, affirmed in all respects. <em>City of Livonia v Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>123 Mich App 1; 333 NW2d 151 (1983) (hereinafter <em>Livonia II). </em>We granted plaintiffs\u2019 applications for leave to appeal. 418 Mich 874 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">\n<em>Greentrees Civic Ass\u2019n v Pignatiello</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Defendant Victory Wisdom Nonprofit Housing, Inc., a nonprofit corporation, applied to the dss for a license to operate an afc small group home for six or less women in a residential neighborhood of Southfield, Michigan. The women were to be selected from the residents of Clinton Valley Center, a state psychiatric facility, after appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>screenings. The home is adjacent to the Greentrees subdivision. Plaintiff Greentrees Civic Association is a group of subdivision homeowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The dss notified the City of Southfield of the proposed licensure in August, 1980. Defendants and representatives of the dss, the city, and the association met several times to discuss the intended use of the home, but could not reach a mutually agreeable solution. On September 19, 1980, the city attorney filed a complaint with the dss, alleging that the proposed licensure would violate the afcfla. The Director of the dss responded on November 6, 1980, that there was no basis to deny defendants\u2019 application.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">In response, plaintiff association filed suit in the Oakland Circuit Court on November 21, 1980, seeking to permanently enjoin the operation of the home.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A temporary restraining order was entered prohibiting defendants from operating any type of afc facility. The City of Southfield was subsequently allowed to intervene. The restraining order was modified on March 31, 1981, to allow defendants to operate an afc small group home, but prohibited the placement of mentally ill adults therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">In the meantime, the city attorney submitted a written objection with the dss on December 1, 1980, contesting the director\u2019s decision and requesting an administrative hearing. In an opinion dated May 4, 1981, the hearing officer rejected two of the city\u2019s challenges, but agreed that mentally ill persons could not be placed in the home. On June 16, 1981, the Director of the dss adopted the hearing officer's recommendation that the home should be licensed. However, he concluded that the afcfla permitted placement of mentally ill per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>sons in afc small group homes because the terms \"emotionally disturbed\u201d and \"mentally ill\u201d are used synonymously in the act. The city appealed this administrative decision to the Oakland Circuit Court on June 29, 1981. The circuit court subsequently affirmed after <em>Oxford Twp v Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>120 Mich App 103; 327 NW2d 409 (1982), was issued. The city\u2019s appeal of that decision is currently pending in the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Shortly after the Director of the dss issued his decision, the independent injunctive action was resolved. The circuit court ruled that defendants could operate an afc small group home, but could not provide foster care to mentally ill persons. A permanent injunction to that effect was issued on July 1, 1981. Defendants appealed the injunctive order and plaintiffs cross-appealed the decision permitting plaintiffs to operate the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">While that appeal was pending, plaintiffs filed a petition for an order to show cause with the circuit court, alleging that defendants had violated the July 1, 1981, injunction by placing mentally ill adults in the home. On January 15, 1982, the circuit court ordered an independent psychiatric evaluation of the five resident women. The psychiatrist concluded that each resident was both developmentally disabled and suffering from some degree of mental illness. The Director of Community Placement for the dmh had previously concluded that the women were only developmentally disabled. Apparently no hearings have been conducted to resolve this dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The Court of Appeals subsequently upheld the licensure of the home. The majority also concluded that the circuit court had erred in enjoining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>placement of mentally ill adults therein. <em>Greentrees Civic Ass\u2019n v Pignatiello, </em>123 Mich App 767; 333 NW2d 350 (1983). We granted plaintiffs\u2019 application for leave to appeal. 418 Mich 880 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">We begin our analysis with an overview of the movement toward deinstitutionalization and community placement of adults requiring foster care. Prior to the early 1960\u2019s, mentally retarded and other developmentally disabled persons were routinely institutionalized. Institutionalization was initially designed to shelter such persons from the risks of society. By the early twentieth century, however, the rationale for institutionalization changed to that of protecting society from these persons. By the 1960\u2019s, a \"distinct humanistic renaissance\u201d had occurred, which stressed the \"normalization\u201d of disabled individuals.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to this approach, disabled persons who are unable to live with their families are allowed to reside in homes of normal size, located in normal neighborhoods, that provide opportunities for normal societal integration and interaction. Such community placement permits disabled persons to reach their full potential and become contributing, productive members of society.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Some communities, however, were and are reluctant to allow \"community,\u201d \"group,\u201d or \"foster care\u201d homes in residential areas. Zoning ordinances and practices have been used either to exclude such homes entirely or to restrict them to commercial areas. The result frequently is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>creation of \"ghettos\u201d of foster care homes, particularly in transitional residential areas, business, or institutional zones. Such concentrations of foster care homes often change the character of the neighborhoods, thus undercutting the purposes behind normalization and provoking negative reactions by area residents.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Many states have enacted statutes governing community residential facilities for developmentally disabled, physically handicapped, mentally ill, or aged persons.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 1972 PA 287, MCL 331.681 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 16.610(1) <em>et seq. </em>(hereinafter 1972 afcfla), was this state\u2019s initial effort to license and regulate afc facilities that provide alternative care services to adults who do not require institutional medical or nursing care.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The 1972 afcfla did not categorize afc facilities by the number of persons who resided therein, nor did it designate the types of disabled persons for whom care could be provided.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The administrative rules promul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>gated by the Director of the dss, however, defined three classes of afc facilities:</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">1) family homes, which provided care to no more than six adults with at least one caretaker being required to reside in the home, 1979 AC, R 400.2103(3), 400.2202(2);</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">2) group homes, which provided care to more than six but no more than twenty adults, 1979 AC, R 400.2103(5); and</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">3) congregate facilities, which provided care to more than twenty adults. 1979 AC, R 400.2102(5).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">In addition, the rules allowed placement of mentally ill adults in afc family homes. See 1979 AC, R 400.2211(e), (g).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">To prevent municipalities from using zoning ordinances as a basis for excluding or segregating afc facilities, the Legislature in 1976 added \u00a7 16a to the County Rural Zoning Enabling Act, MCL 125.216a; MSA 5.2961(16a), \u00a7 16a to the Township Rural Zoning Act, MCL 125.286a; MSA 5.2963(16a), and \u00a7 3b to the City and Village Zoning Act, MCL 125.583b; MSA 5.2933(2).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> These sections each provide that a state-licensed residential facility, as defined in 1972 PA 287, which provides supervision or care to six or. less persons shall be considered a residential use of property for zoning purposes and a permitted use in all residential zones. The amendments also: require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>notification of the appropriate county, township, city, or village as to the location of the proposed afc facility; prevent facilities from being located in proximity to each other; and forbid licensure of a proposed facility if it will \"substantially contribute to an excessive concentration of state licensed residential facilities\u201d within that particular community.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">In 1979, the Legislature repealed 1972 PA 287 and replaced it with a more extensive act \u2014 1979 PA 218, MCL 400.701 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 16.610(51) <em>et seq. </em>(hereinafter 1979 afcfla). The House Legislative Analysis of HB 4104, which became 1979 PA 218, reveals that the 1979 afcfla was designed to provide more specificity and to deal with circumstances which had not been foreseen at the time the original afcfla was enacted. In addition, the Legislature wished to classify, license, and regulate homes for the aged as afc facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Under the 1979 afcfla, \"adult foster care facility\u201d is defined as an establishment having as its principal function the receiving of adults for foster care. It includes facilities and homes for aged, emotionally disturbed, developmentally disabled, or physically handicapped adults who require ongoing supervision, but not continuous nursing care. As in the prior act, certain institutions are not considered afc facilities. These include nursing homes, homes for the aged, general hospitals, hospitals for the mentally ill, facilities for the developmentally disabled, county infirmaries, child care institutions, children\u2019s camps, foster family homes, foster family group homes, alcohol or substance abuse rehabilitation centers, residential facilities for persons released from or assigned to adult correctional institutions, maternity homes, and hotels or rooming houses which do not provide or offer foster care. As of March 27, 1984, homes for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>the aged were to be categorized as afc facilities. MCL 400.703(4); MSA 16.610(53)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\">In addition, the 1979 afcfla established five categories of afc facilities:</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">1) camps, which provide care to more than four adults in a facility located in a natural or rural environment, MCL 400.703(2); MSA 16.610(53X2);</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">2) family homes, which provide care to six or fewer adults in private residences, the licensee of a family home being required to be a member of the household and an occupant of the residence, MCL 400.703(5); MSA 16.610(53)(5);</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">3) small group homes, which provide care to twelve or fewer adults, MCL 400.703(7); MSA 16.610(53X7);</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">4) large group homes, which provide care to at least thirteen but not more than twenty adults, MCL 400.703(6); MSA 16.610(53X6); and</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">5) congregate facilities, which provide care to more than twenty adults, MCL 400.703(3); MSA 16.610(53X3).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Beginning on March 27, 1984, large group homes and congregate facilities would have been required to elect between accepting adults who were aged and adults who were mentally ill, developmentally disabled or physically handicapped. See 1979 PA 218, \u00a7 3(3), (6), codified at MCL 400.703(3), (6); MSA 16.610(53X3), (6). However, 1984 PA 40, effective March 26, 1984, dropped this requirement, as well as other provisions relating to the licensing of homes for the aged as afc facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">As of the date of this opinion, the Legislature has not amended the references to 1972 PA 287 contained in the three aforementioned zoning acts to reflect the passage of the 1979 afcfla.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">In <em>Livonia v DSS, </em>plaintiffs city and homeowners assert:</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>1) The repeal of the 1972 afcfla by the 1979 afcfla, coupled with the Legislature\u2019s failure to change the reference to 1972 PA 287 in \u00a7 3b of the City and Village Zoning Act (cvza), means that afc facilities are no longer exempt from local zoning ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">2) Even if afc facilities which care for six or less adults need not comply with local zoning ordinances under \u00a7 3b of the cvza, the afc small group homes at issue here have a capacity of up to twelve adults and therefore must comply with applicable zoning ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">3) Section 3b of the cvza impermissibly divests home rule cities of their constitutional and statutory authority to enact zoning ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">4) Section 3b of the cvza violates the Title-Object Clause of Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">5) Section 33 of the 1979 afcfla violates the Title-Object Clause of Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">6) Section 16(1) of the 1979 afcfla and \u00a7 3b of the cvza are unconstitutional because they do not provide sufficient standards for the dss to determine what constitutes an \"excessive concentration\u201d of afc facilities in a community.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">7) The 1979 afcfla and cvza violate the Due Process Clause because they provide inadequate notice and opportunity for a hearing prior to licensure and deprive parties of a fair and impartial decisionmaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">8) The dss failed to comply with the notice requirements of \u00a7 32 of the 1979 afcfla and \u00a7 3b of the cvza.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">9) Additional statutory and ordinance violations preclude the licensure of the houses as afc small group homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">10) Under the 1979 afcfla, mentally ill adults cannot be placed in afc small group homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>11) The operation of an afc small group home in these houses would violate building and use restrictions contained in the owners\u2019 deeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">12) Defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment should have been denied under GCR 1963, 117.2(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">In <em>Greentrees Civic Ass\u2019n v Pignatiello, </em>plaintiffs city and homeowners present three issues which correspond to Issues 1, 5, and 10 above.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">\n<em>Applicability of \u00a7 3b of the cvza (Issues 1 and 2)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AMg\">Section 3b of the cvza presently provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-9\">(1) As used in this section, <em>\"state licensed residential facility\u201d means a structure constructed for residential purposes that is licensed by the state pursuant to Act No. 287 of the Public Acts of 1972, as amended, being sections 331.681 to 331.694 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, </em>or Act No. 116 of the Public Acts of 1973, as amended, being sections 722.111 to 722.128 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, which provides resident services for 6 or less persons under 24-hour supervision or care for persons in need of that supervision or care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-10\">(2) In order to implement the policy of this state that persons in need of community residential care shall not be excluded by zoning from the benefits of normal residential surroundings, a state licensed residential facility providing supervision or care, or both, to 6 or less persons shall be considered a residential use of property for the purposes of zoning and a permitted use in all residential zones, including those zoned for single family dwellings, and shall not be subject to a special use or conditional use permit or procedure different from those required for other dwellings of similar density in the same zone. [MCL 125.583b; MSA 5.2933(2). Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">Plaintiffs argue that since 1972 PA 287 was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>repealed by \u00a7 35 of the 1979 afcfla, MCL 400.735; MSA 16.610(85), and \u00a73b(l) of the cvza has not been amended to include a reference to 1979 PA 218, the afc small group homes at issue here cannot be considered a residential use of property under \u00a7 3b(2) of the cvza. Plaintiffs believe that this legislative inaction evidences an intent that all new afc facilities must now conform to local zoning ordinances.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In the instant case, the respective Livonia and Southfield zoning ordinances would allegedly prohibit defendants from establishing afc small group homes for six or less adults in residential neighborhoods.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The goal of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the Legislature. If the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, the intent must be determined accordingly and no judicial interpretation is warranted. <em>Dussia v Monroe Co Employees Retirement System, </em>386 Mich 244, 248; 191 NW2d 307 (1971); <em>Melia v Employment Security Comm, </em>346 Mich 544, 562; 78 NW2d 273 (1956). Viewed in isolation, \u00a7 3b(l) does limit the definition of \"state licensed residential facility\u201d to those facilities licensed under 1972 PA 287 or 1973 PA 116. However, such a limited view is not appropriate here. Section 3b of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>cvza and the 1972 afcfla both related to the regulation of afc facilities caring for six or less adults and have always been read <em>in pari materia. </em>Although the 1979 afcfla contains significant revisions, it is still concerned with the regulation of afc facilities for six or less adults. Thus, \u00a7 3b(l) should be read in connection with and interpreted in light of the 1979 afcfla, even though they were enacted at different times. A strict construction of \u00a7 3b(l) cannot be followed if that construction would defeat an important purpose of the 1979 afcfla. See <em>County Rd Ass\u2019n of Michigan v Bd of State </em>Canvassers, 407 Mich 101, 109; 282 NW2d 774 (1979); <em>Detroit v Michigan Bell Telephone Co, </em>374 Mich 543, 558, 560; 132 NW2d 660 (1965), <em>cert den </em>382 US 107 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">An examination of the 1979 afcfla and its legislative history reveals no legislative intent to subject afc facilities caring for six or less adults to local zoning restrictions. In response to an argument that family homes and small group homes for six or less adults should not be treated differently under the 1979 afcfla, the House Legislative Analysis of HB 4104 noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">The differences between a foster care home occupied by the licensee . . . and a nonprofit home occupied by a resident manager are significant enough to warrant placing them in separate categories. . . . [However, bjeing classified as a small group home will not be burdensome to nonprofit homes with six or fewer clients. . . . [A]ZZ <em>adult foster care homes with six or fewer adults are </em>[presently] <em>protected against zoning restrictions, </em>regardless of whether they are private residences or nonprofit adult foster care facilities; <em>there is no suggestion that that will change with a change in the categories of homes. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Furthermore, \u00a7 16(2) of the 1979 afcfla, MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>400.716(2); MSA 16.610(66)(2), states that a temporary license to operate an afc facility for more than six adults shall not be granted if the proposed facility has not obtained zoning approval or a special or conditional use permit if required by local ordinance. By negative implication, facilities for six or less adults need not obtain such approval. In addition, \u00a7 16(3) specifically incorporates by reference \u00a7 3b of the cvza, as well as the other pertinent sections of the County and Township Rural Zoning Acts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\"><em>The department shall not issue a temporary license to an adult foster care facility which does not comply with </em>section 16a of Act No. 183 of the Public Acts of 1943, as amended, being section 125.216a of the Michigan Compiled Laws, Section 16a of Act No. 184 of the Public Acts of 1943, as amended, being section 125.286a of the Michigan Compiled Laws, and <em>section 3b of Act No. 207 of the Public Acts of 1921, as amended, being section 125.583b of the Michigan Compiled Laws. </em>[MCL 400.716(3); MSA 16.610(66)(3). Emphasis added.] \u25a0</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Finally, we note that MCL 8.3u; MSA 2.212(21) allows us to update the reference to the afcfla:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">The provisions of any law or statute which is reenacted, amended or revised, so far as they are the same as those of prior laws, shall be construed as a continuation of such laws and not as new enactments. <em>If any provision of a law is repealed and in substance re-enacted, a reference in any other law to the repealed provision shall be deemed a reference to the re-enacted provision.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">The reference in \u00a7 3b(l) is to the entire 1972 afcfla. Although there are significant revisions in the 1979 afcfla, it was intended to cover the same subject matter as the prior act and retains many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>of the prior provisions and departmental rules promulgated thereunder. We agree with Justice Riley\u2019s observations that the reference to 1972 PA 287 \"was only necessary for the informational purpose of indicating under what statute such facilities were <em>then </em>state licensed\u201d and that the failure to change the reference must be viewed as a \"legislative oversight.\u201d <em>Livonia II, </em>123 Mich App 7-8. If plaintiffs\u2019 literal interpretation were adopted, the placement of disabled persons into the community could be significantly impaired, a result not intended by the Legislature.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Plaintiffs further contend that even if \u00a7 3b of the cvza permits afc facilities for six or less adults to operate in residential areas regardless of zoning restrictions, it is inapplicable to afc small group <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>homes. They reason that at the time \u00a7 3b was enacted, there was no \"small group home\u201d category \u2014 only family homes were authorized to care for six or less adults. Although the afc small group homes at issue here are licensed to care for no more than six adults, plaintiffs note that such homes are statutorily authorized by definition to receive up to twelve adults.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Regardless of the circumstances existing at the time \u00a73b was enacted, the plain language of \u00a7 3b(2) and the 1979 afcfla indicate no legislative intention to limit the applicability of \u00a7 3b(2) to afc family homes. We agree with Justice Riley\u2019s reasoning on this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">Section 3b of 1921 PA 207 as amended requires that a state licensed residential care facility \"providing supervision or care, or both, to 6 or less persons\u201d be considered a residential use by local governments. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 argument overlooks the fact that this statute does not provide that facilities must be 'licensed\u201d for the care of six or fewer to be considered residential uses; rather, the criterion is whether a facility is actually providing care to six or fewer persons. The exemption is obviously concerned with the number of residents actually living in the facility, not the number of potential residents. </em>See <em>Brandon Twp </em>[v <em>North-Oakland Residential Services, Inc, </em>110 Mich App 300, 309; 312 NW2d 238 (1981), <em>lv den </em>412 Mich 900 (1982)]. Moreover, the applicant in the case at bar only sought a license for a facility to care for six or fewer persons and, therefore, the small group home license issued by defendant department was restricted to six or fewer persons. Our conclusion in this regard is supported by the statutory provisions under the new Adult Foster Care Facility Licensing Act. MCL 400.713(5); MSA 16.610(63X5) requires a license for an adult foster care facility to state the maximum number of persons to be received for foster care at one time. Any increase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>beyond six in the number of persons to be received for foster care at one time in a small group home requires application for a temporary license. MCL 400.719(3); MSA 16.610(69X3). A proposed adult foster care facility for more than six adults must obtain zoning approval or obtain a special or conditional use permit if required by a local ordinance before a temporary license can be granted. MCL 400.716(2); MSA 16.610(66)(2). Thus, if a structure has the capacity for more than six residents, it may not expand beyond six without conforming to local zoning ordinances. Therefore, limiting the exemption to family homes is not necessary to insure that facilities with more than six residents will comply with zoning ordinances. <em>[Livonia, II, </em>123 Mich App 9-10. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">We also note that the previously quoted portion of the House Legislative Analysis of HB 4104 also supports the conclusion that afc family homes and small group homes for six or less adults are to be treated identically vis-\u00e1-vis zoning restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">\n<em>Section 3b\u2019s Limitation on a City\u2019s Power to Zone (Issue 3)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Plaintiffs argue that a municipality\u2019s power to enact zoning ordinances is derived from Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 22 and the Home Rule Cities Act, MCL 117.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.2071 <em>et seq. </em>Pursuant to that power, the City of Livonia enacted zoning ordinances which would prevent afc small group homes from operating in residential areas without prior approval from the city. Section 3b of the cvza conflicts with these ordinances since it requires that state-licensed residential facilities for six or less persons be treated as a permitted use in all residential zones. Plaintiffs conclude that this conflict impermissibly \"divests\u201d or limits a city\u2019s constitutional and statutory right to zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Plaintiffs concede that <em>Clements v McCabe, </em>210 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Mich 207; 177 NW 722 (1920), squarely held that a city\u2019s power to enact zoning ordinances is not derived from the state constitution or the Home Rule Cities Act. They note, however, that <em>Clements </em>was decided prior to <em>Village of Euclid v Ambler Realty Co, </em>272 US 365; 47 S Ct 114; 71 L Ed 303 (1926). Plaintiffs believe that <em>Euclid </em>impliedly overruled <em>Clements </em>and rendered \"nugatory, though not invalid,\u201d the cvza.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">In <em>Euclid, </em>an aggrieved property owner maintained that the village\u2019s zoning scheme was unreasonable and confiscatory. The United States Supreme Court upheld the zoning plan as a reasonable exercise of the municipality\u2019s police power. However, the Supreme Court did not have to address where or how the village had obtained its zoning power;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the focus was on the reasonableness of the exercise thereof.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In contrast, <em>Clements </em>addressed the source of a city\u2019s power to zone. This Court noted that the \"police power\u201d is an inherent attribute of the state which belongs to subordinate governmental divisions only when and as conferred by the state through the constitution or statute. Incorporation invests a city with limited police powers, but the power to zone is not one of them. After examining the 1908 Constitution and the then-existing Home Rule Cities Act, 1909 PA 279, this Court concluded that they contained no express or implied mention of the power to zone. 210 Mich 215-218. Since <em>Clements, </em>this Court has repeatedly held that, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>the absence of state enabling legislation, a political subdivision has no inherent power to zone. See, <em>e.g., Delta Charter Twp v Dinolfo, </em>419 Mich 253, 260, n 2; 351 NW2d 831 (1984); <em>Detroit Osteopathic Hospital v City of Southfield, </em>377 Mich 128, 132; 139 NW2d 728 (1966); <em>Krajenke Buick Sales v Hamtramck City Engineer, </em>322 Mich 250, 254-255; 33 NW2d 781 (1948).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In response to <em>Clements, </em>the Legislature enacted the cvza, 1921 PA 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Plaintiffs also contend that <em>Clements </em>is no longer viable because it was based upon an interpretation of the 1908 Constitution. Although Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 22 is similar to Const 1908, art 8, \u00a7 21, plaintiffs note that the former provision contains a specific reference to \"property\u201d as a matter upon which ordinances can be enacted.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Neverthe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>less, the Convention Comments to Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 22 clearly indicate that the new language was intended to give home rule cities full power over their <em>own </em>property, rather than private property within their boundaries.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> There is no evidence that any of the homes in these cases is owned by the cities.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">We note that after <em>Clements </em>was decided, \u00a7 4i was added to the Home Rule Cities Act. See 1929 PA 126, MCL 117.4\u00cd; MSA 5.2082. Subsection (3) specifically allows a city to provide in its charter for the establishment of districts or zones within which the use of land and structures may be regulated by ordinance. We do not find this statute to be in conflict with \u00a7 3b of the cvza, since it merely authorizes a city to adopt charter provisions and ordinances related to zoning. Moreover, local ordinances must give way to conflicting constitutional and statutory provisions. See Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 22; MCL 117.2, 117.36; MSA 5.2072, 5.2116; <em>Dearden </em>v Detroit, 403 Mich 257, 264; 269 NW2d 139 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">We recognize that prior to 1976, the cvza permitted cities to enact reasonable zoning ordinances restricting the placement of afc facilities in residential areas. Once a power has been granted to a political subdivision, it should not be artificially limited. <em>Delta Charter Twp, supra, </em>419 Mich 260, n 2; Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 34. This has not occurred here. Section 3b was enacted \"to implement the policy of this state that persons in need of commu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>nity residential care shall not be excluded by zoning from the benefits of normal residential surroundings . . . MCL 125.583b(2); MSA 5.2933(2)(2). This policy furthers the goals of Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 8:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">Institutions, programs and services for the care, treatment, education, or rehabilitation of those inhabitants who are physically, mentally, or otherwise seriously handicapped shall always be fostered and supported.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">As the Convention Comments note, this constitutional provision was revised because the prior language was \"not only too restrictive in scope, but in certain cases ha[d become] outmoded by recent developments in the field of physical and mental rehabilitation. The words 'programs and services\u2019 [were] added as broader concepts not necessarily confined to institutional treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">\n<em>Title-Object Clause Challenges to \u00a7 3b of the cvza and \u00a7 33 of the 1979 afcfla (.Issues 4 and 5)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 24 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">No law shall embrace more than one object, which shall be expressed in its title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">This constitutional provision requires that 1) a law shall not embrace more than one object, and 2) the object of a law must be expressed in its title. <em>Advisory Opinion re Constitutionality of 1975 PA 227, </em>396 Mich 123, 128; 240 NW2d 193 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">Plaintiffs maintain that \u00a7 3b of the cvza and \u00a733 of the 1979 afcfla violate the Title-Object Clause of Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 24. As to the former statute, plaintiffs concede that the title of the cvza <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>accurately reflects the purpose of \u00a7 3b, <em>i.e., </em>\"to designate the use of certain state licensed residential facilities . . . Thus, the second constitutional requirement has been satisfied. Plaintiffs argue, however, that the addition of \u00a7 3b by 1976 PA 396 impermissibly created a second object within the cvza. They reason that prior to the addition of \u00a7 3b, the sole object of the cvza was to grant to cities and villages the power to enact zoning ordinances. In contrast, \u00a7 3b limits that grant of power by requiring cities and villages to treat state-licensed residential facilities as permissible residential uses of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Greentrees </em>succinctly summarized the applicable rules of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">The purpose of the [\"one object\u201d] constitutional limitation is to insure that both the legislators and the public have proper notice of legislative content and to prevent deceit and subterfuge. <em>Advisory Opinion re Constitutionality of 1972 PA 294, </em>389 Mich 441, 465; 208 NW2d 469 (1973). However, in effectuating these purposes, the \"one object\u201d provision is to be construed reasonably and not in so narrow or technical a manner as to frustrate the legislative intent. <em>Kuhn v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>384 Mich 378, 387-388; 183 NW2d 796 (1971). An act may contain all matters germane to its object and any provisions which \"directly relate to, carry out and implement the principal object.\u201d <em>Advisory Opinion, supra, </em>pp 465-467. [123 Mich App 771.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">The \"object\u201d of a law is its general purpose or aim. <em>Local No 1644, AFSCME v Oakwood Hospital Corp, </em>367 Mich 79, 91; 116 NW2d 314 (1962). The object of the cvza is to enable cities and villages to regulate in a reasonable manner the use of land and structures within their boundaries. However, a city\u2019s power to zone is not unfettered \u2014 its zoning regulations must further certain legislatively des<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>ignated goals. Section 1 of the cvza, MCL 125.581; MSA 5.2931, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">(1) The legislative body of a city or village may regulate and restrict the use of land and structures; ... to insure that uses of the land shall be situated in appropriate locations and relationships; ... to facilitate adequate and efficient provision for . . . education, recreation, and other public service and facility needs; and to promote public health, safety, and welfare, and for those purposes may divide a city or village into districts of the number, shape, and areas considered best suited to carry out this section. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">(2) The land development regulations and districts authorized by this act shall be made in accordance with a plan designed to promote and accomplish the objectives of this act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Section 3b merely defines and furthers the explicit statutory goal of providing for the health, education, and welfare of persons in need of community residential care. We agree with the Court of Appeals conclusion that \"[a] restriction on a municipality\u2019s zoning power clearly belongs in the act granting that power.\u201d <em>Livonia % </em>119 Mich App 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Plaintiffs attack \u00a7 33 of the 1979 afcfla on two grounds. First, they believe that \u00a7 33 impermissibly creates a second object, <em>i.e., </em>to preempt local ordinances, regulations, and construction codes regulating institutions. This objective allegedly does not fall within the act\u2019s stated object of licensing and regulating afc facilities. Second, plaintiffs believe that the purpose of \u00a7 33 is not expressed in the title of the afcfla.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">The title to the 1979 afcfla states that it is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-10\">An act to provide for the licensing and regulation of adult foster care facilities; to provide for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>establishment of standards of care for adult foster care facilities; to prescribe powers and duties of the department of social services and other departments, to prescribe penalties; and to repeal certain acts and parts of acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Section 33 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">This act supersedes all local regulations applicable specifically to adult foster care facilities. Local ordinances, regulations, or construction codes regulating institutions shall not be applied to adult foster care large group homes, adult foster care small group homes, or adult foster care family homes. This section shall not be construed to exempt adult foster care facilities from local construction codes which are applicable to private residences. [MCL 400.733; MSA 16.610(83).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">As previously noted, an act may contain any provision which directly relates to, carries out, and implements the principal object of the act. Legislation should not be invalidated merely because it contains more than one means of attaining its primary object. <em>Local No 1644, supra. </em>However, if the act contains \"subjects diverse in their nature, and having no necessary connection,\u201d it violates Const 1963, art 4, \u00a724. <em>Advisory Opinion, </em>396 Mich 131, quoting <em>People ex rel Drake v Mahaney, </em>13 Mich 481, 494-495 (1865).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">For the reasons stated by the intervenor-defendants, we conclude that the 1979 afcfla does not contain more than one object:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-9\">[Section] 33 of the act simply precludes a municipality from inappropriately applying the construction code provisions intended to govern institutions to the subject foster care residences. The provision is certainly germane to the general purpose of providing for the licensing and regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>of foster care homes. In the absence of the super-session clause, some municipalities may be inclined to treat adult foster care homes, which are intended to be \"normalized residential settings,\u201d as hospitals, and thus impose numerous requirements which are not imposed on private residential dwellings. The legislative intent is clear that the subject homes be regarded as homes; the expression of that intent so as to prohibit the practical exclusion of such homes from residential neighborhoods by municipalities acting under the guise of [local construction and fire ordinances] is logical and entirely relevant to the act and its title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Plaintiffs suggest that the restrictions on the applicability of the State Construction Code Act of 1972, MCL 125.1501 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.2949(1) <em>et seq., </em>should have been added to that act, rather than the afcfla. However, the Legislature is free either to enact an entirely new act or to amend any act to which the subject of the new legislation is germane, auxiliary, or incidental. This legislative choice will not be invalidated merely because an alternative location for the new legislation might appear to some to be more appropriate. <em>People v Milton, </em>393 Mich 234, 241; 224 NW2d 266 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 assertions, \u00a7 33 will not jeopardize the lives, safety, and welfare of the residents of afc homes by eliminating all construction and fire safety requirements. Section 33 specifically allows municipalities to enforce local construction codes which are applicable to private residences. Moreover, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 11, and 20 of the afcfla require the Department of Social Services to promulgate and enforce adequate fire prevention and safety rules governing afc facilities. See MCL 400.710, 400.711, 400.720; MSA 16.610(60), 16.610(61), 16.610(70).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>As to plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the title of the afcfla does not adequately reflect the provisions of \u00a7 33, it is not necessary that a title be an index of all of an act\u2019s provisions. It is sufficient that \"the act centers to one main general object or purpose which the title comprehensively declares, though in general terms, and if provisions in the body of the act not directly mentioned in the title are germane, auxiliary, or incidental to that general purpose . . . .\u201d <em>Milton, </em>393 Mich 246-247, quoting <em>Loomis v Rogers, </em>197 Mich 265, 271; 163 NW 1018 (1917). In light of our conclusion that \u00a7 33 is germane to the act\u2019s stated purpose of licensing and regulating afc facilities, we find that the title is sufficiently comprehensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">\n<em>Adequacy of Standards for Determining What Constitutes an \"Excessive Concentration of State-Licensed Residential Facilities\u201d (Issue 6)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Section 16(1) of the afcfla, MCL 400.716(1); MSA 16.610(66)(1), states that the dss cannot issue a temporary license to a proposed afc facility without local approval if the issuance \"would substantially contribute to an excessive concentration of community residential facilities within a city, village, or township.\u201d Section 3b(4) of the cvza, MCL 125.583b(4); MSA 5.2933(2)(4), contains a similar provision. Plaintiffs note that neither the Legislature nor the dss has defined the term \"excessive concentration\u201d or provided any standards or guidelines to aid the dss in making its licensing determinations. Plaintiffs believe that the term is a subjective one and that its interpretation \"can vary from case-to-case, from community-to-community, and from one interpreter of the phrase to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>another,\u201d thus resulting in arbitrary and discriminatory treatment. They therefore conclude that the entire afcfla and \u00a7 3b of the cvza should be declared unconstitutional since the \"excessive concentration\u201d standard is not as reasonably precise as the legislation requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">In determining whether legislative standards, or lack thereof, constitute an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to an administrative agency, the following observations and rules of law must be applied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">The rule with regard to delegation was simply and aptly stated in the leading case of <em>Locke\u2019s </em>Appeal, 72 Pa 491, 498-499 (1873):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">\"The legislature cannot delegate its power to make a law; but it can make a law to delegate a power to determine some fact or state of things upon which the law makes, or intends to make, its own action depend.

In other words, the dss cannot look to the number of facilities or residents located in another municipality. Furthermore, \u00a7 16(3) states that a temporary license cannot be issued to an afc facility which does not comply with \u00a7 3b of the cvza. Section 3b(4) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">A state licensing agency shall not license a proposed residential facility when another state licensed residential facility exists within the 1,500 foot radius, unless permitted by local zoning ordinances, of the proposed location or when the issuance of the license would substantially contribute to an excessive concentration of state licensed residential facilities within the city or village. In a city with a population of 1,000,000 or more a state licensing agency shall not license a proposed residential facility when another state licensed residential facility exists within a 3,000 foot radius of the proposed location.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Thus, the dss must also consider the physical proximity of the proposed facility to other residential facilities as one factor in deciding whether to issue a license. Finally, \u00a7 3b(2) provides that persons in need of community residential care are entitled to \"the benefits of normal residential surroundings . . . .\u201d The dss therefore must consider the overall residential character of the surrounding neighborhood as it exists and how that character will be changed, if at all, by the addition of an afc facility. Such an inquiry also protects resident homeowners from the creation of foster care home \"ghettos\u201d which would destroy the residential character of the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">As to the second and third <em>Seaman </em>tests, we adopt Justice Riley\u2019s analysis and conclusion that the standards enunciated in the afcfla and \u00a7 3b of the cvza are sufficiently precise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">[I]t is clear that the licensing and regulation of adult foster care residential facilities is a subject that requires some degree of flexibility. The Legislature has established, by statute, a specific maximum density for adult foster care facilities. The \"excessive concentration\u201d criteria is only applicable to situations where the concentration of homes is allegedly excessive even though it satisfies the statutory maximum density. Any attempt to specifically set forth further criteria for determining whether excessive concentration has occurred would be impractical as the level of permissible concentration may well vary according to the constantly changing demographic characteristics of a particular community. Such a determination inherently requires the exercise of some limited discretion. We hold that, under the present scenario, the defendant department is permitted to exercise such discretion while it is prohibited from acting arbitrarily and, therefore, we find that these statutes are valid as they confer administrative and not legislative power and as they vest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>discretionary and not arbitrary authority. Our conclusion in this regard is bolstered by the rule of statutory construction which requires this Court to afford a statute the presumption of constitutionality and to construe it as constitutional unless the contrary clearly appears. <em>People v McQuillan, </em>392 Mich 511; 221 NW2d 569 (1974). <em>[Livonia II, </em>123 Mich App 16-17.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">We note that even where the Legislature has properly delegated authority to an administrative agency, the agency cannot act arbitrarily and must provide adequate procedural due process to the parties involved. Where legislative standards are by necessity somewhat general in nature, this Court must determine whether the parties had adequate notice, opportunity to be heard, and review of an adverse decision. <em>Seaman, </em>396 Mich 313-314. See also <em>Dukesherer Farms, Inc v Director of Dep\u2019t of Agriculture (After Remand), </em>405 Mich 1, 30, n 8; 273 NW2d 877 (1979); <em>Westervelt v Natural Resources Comm, </em>402 Mich 412, 447-449, 458-459; 263 NW2d 564 (1978) (opinions of Williams, J., and Ryan, J.). These due process considerations are the basis of plaintiffs\u2019 next challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\"><em>Due Process Challenges (Issue </em>7)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Plaintiffs raise three arguments, the first two of which are interrelated. First, plaintiffs believe that the issuance of a license pursuant to \u00a7 23(3) of the afcfla, MCL 400.723(3); MSA 16.610(73)(3), prior to an administrative hearing violates the Due Process Clause. Second, plaintiff homeowners contend that the afcfla\u2019s failure to provide them with adequate notice and any opportunity for a hearing prior to the licensure of an afc facility similarly deprives them of their property rights without d\u00fae process of law. Finally, plaintiffs argue that the final decisionmaker in the adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>trative process \u2014 the Director of the dss \u2014 was not impartial because of his prior roles in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">We begin our analysis with an overview of the afcfla\u2019s procedures for licensing an afc facility. Before issuing a license, the dss must investigate the applicant and facility. MCL 400.713(3); MSA 16.610(63X3). If the dss decides that it will issue a license, it must notify the city of its plans at least forty-five days before the licensure. MCL 125.583b(4); MSA 5.2933(2X4), MCL 400.732(1); MSA 16.610(82)(1). The city in turn must notify all residents whose property lines are within a 1500-foot radius of the proposed facility. MCL 125.583b(4); MSA 5.2933(2)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">A city that wishes to contest the dss\u2019 decision to issue a license may file a complaint with the dss. Within forty-five days, the dss must resolve the issues raised in the complaint. If the city disagrees with the response, it must submit a written objection to the dss within thirty days after receiving the response. The Director of the dss, or a designated representative, must then conduct a hearing.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The dss may nevertheless issue the license pending resolution of the administrative proceedings. MCL 400.723; MSA 16.610(73). A person aggrieved by the decision of the Director of the dss must appeal to the circuit court within ten days after receipt of the decision. MCL 400.725; MSA 16.610(75).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Turning to plaintiffs\u2019 arguments concerning the adequacy of notice and hearing, we initially conclude that the afcfla provides adequate notice to a city and nearby property owners prior to a proposed licensure.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The remaining question is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>whether the city and owners here were entitled to a hearing before the licenses were issued. The short answer is that plaintiffs received a hearing during the injunctive action. The licensures of the Livonia homes did not occur until after the circuit court had decided plaintiffs\u2019 case on the merits and dissolved the temporary restraining orders prohibiting the licensures.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The long answer is that plaintiffs were not entitled under the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause to a hearing prior to the licensures. Except in emergency situations, the state cannot deprive a person of a protected liberty or property interest without affording the person notice and an opportunity for a hearing before the termination becomes effective. <em>Bd of Regents of State Colleges v Roth, </em>408 US 564, 570, n 7; 92 S Ct 2701; 33 L Ed 2d 548 (1972); <em>Bell v Burson, </em>402 US 535, 542; 91 S Ct 1586; 29 L Ed 2d 90 (1971). However, these procedural due process requirements apply only if there is to be a deprivation of interests which constitute \"liberty\u201d or \"property.\u201d <em>Roth, </em>408 US 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">We cannot find any liberty or property interest of which the city would have been deprived by the issuance of the licenses prior to the administrative hearing. Any limitation on the city\u2019s power to regulate afc facilities for six or less adults was validly imposed by the Legislature through the cvza and afcfla (see Issues 3-5, above), not by the</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">DSS.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">We recognize that plaintiff homeowners have a protected property interest in the value, use, and enjoyment of their property, as well as a contractual right to enforce the restrictive covenants in their deeds. Nevertheless, plaintiffs failed to suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>ciently allege any <em>deprivation </em>of these property rights. Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 repeated assertions, the issuance of a license does not rezone any property. The neighborhoods and lots on which the afc small group homes are situated are still zoned for single-family, residential use. Section 3b(2) of the cvza merely states that an afc facility for six or less adults is a residential use of property. As will be more fully explained in Issue 11, below, the operation of these homes does not constitute a multifamily or commercial use; nor does it violate any restrictive covenants. Finally, plaintiffs failed to allege sufficient facts concerning any diminution in the value,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> or interference with the use and enjoyment,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> of their property caused by the licensures.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">As to plaintiffs\u2019 final argument concerning the partiality of the Director of the dss, we initially . note that the right to a hearing before an unbiased and impartial decisionmaker is a basic requirement of due process. <em>Withrow v </em>Larkin, 421 US 35, 46; 95 S Ct 1456; 43 L Ed 2d 712 (1975); <em>Crampton v Dep\u2019t of </em>State, 395 Mich 347, 350-351; 235 NW2d 352 (1975). Moreover, the Administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>tive Procedures Act requires that administrative hearings be conducted in an impartial manner before an unbiased officer. MCL 24.279; MSA 3.560(179). Actual bias need not be shown. If the situation is one in which \"experience teaches that the probability of actual bias on the part of a decisionmaker is too high to be constitutionally tolerable,\u201d the decisionmaker must be disqualified. <em>Withrow, </em>421 US 47; <em>Crampton, </em>395 Mich 351.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">Among the situations identified by the <em>[With-</em>row] Court as presenting that risk are where the judge or decisionmaker</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">(1) has a pecuniary interest in the outcome;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">(2) \"has been the target of personal abuse or criticism from the party before him\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-8\">(3) is \"enmeshed in [other] matters involving petitioner . . .\u201d; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-9\">(4) might have prejudged the case because of prior participation as an accuser, investigator, factfinder or initial decisionmaker. <em>[Crampton, supra.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">The first situation is not applicable. As to the second, plaintiffs briefly assert that the Director of the dss \"has been the target of substantial public criticism . . . .\u201d If plaintiffs are merely referring to the fact that communities and citizens, including plaintiffs, have publicly disagreed with the dss\u2019 decisions to allow afc facilities to operate in residential areas, we do not find that these comments rise to the level of \"personal abuse or criticism.\u201d <em>Cf. Mayberry v Pennsylvania, </em>400 US 455; 91 S Ct 499; 27 L Ed 2d 532 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">As to the third situation, plaintiffs incorrectly assert that the director and the dss were parties in the administrative proceedings. The adverse parties there were the city on one hand and the owners and operators of the afc small group <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>homes on the other. The dss, through the director and the hearing officer, was the decisionmaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Nevertheless, the director and the nss were joined as defendants in the injunctive action which was initiated while the administrative proceedings were pending. However, that action had terminated in defendants\u2019 favor several months before the administrative hearing was held and the final decision was rendered. Although an appeal of the injunctive action was pending at that time, under the particular facts of this case we conclude that the director was not so immediately and personally \"enmeshed\u201d in the appellate proceedings as to automatically preclude him from rendering an impartial administrative decision. <em>Cf. Johnson v Mississippi, </em>403 US 212; 91 S Ct 1778; 29 L Ed 2d 423 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">As to the last situation, the director did not personally conduct the initial investigation of the applicants and facilities; nor did he preside as the factfinder during the administrative hearing. However, he did review the city\u2019s initial complaints and issued the final decision after reviewing the hearing officer\u2019s findings. Nevertheless, mere familiarity with the facts of a case obtained during the performance of a statutory duty does not disqualify a decisionmaker. Nor is disqualification required because the decisionmaker has taken a public position on an issue, unless there is a specific showing of incapability of judging that particular case fairly. <em>Hortonville Joint School Dist No 1 v Hortonville Ed Ass\u2019n, </em>426 US 482, 493; 96 S Ct 2308; 49 L Ed 2d 1 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">In <em>Withrow, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court discussed the propriety of allowing a state examining board to investigate a doctor and later suspend him on the basis of charges uncovered by the initial investigation. In upholding this combination of investigatory and adjudicative roles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>against a procedural due process challenge, the Court made analogy to situations where a decision-maker is involved in both the initial and final adjudicative proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">Judges repeatedly issue arrest warrants on the basis that there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and that the person named in the warrant has committed it. Judges also preside at preliminary hearings where they must decide whether the evidence is sufficient to hold a defendant for trial. Neither of these pretrial involvements has been thought to raise any constitutional barrier against the judge\u2019s presiding over the criminal trial and, if the trial is without a jury, against making the necessary determination of guilt or innocence. Nor has it been thought that a judge is disqualified from presiding over injunction proceedings because he has initially assessed the facts in issuing or denying a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">The initial . . . determination of probable cause and the ultimate adjudication have different bases and purposes. The fact that the same agency makes them in tandem and that they relate to the same issues does not result in a procedural due process violation. Clearly, if the initial view of the facts based on the evidence derived from nonadversarial processes as a practical or legal matter foreclosed fair and effective consideration at a subsequent adversary hearing leading to ultimate decision, a substantial due process question would be raised. But in our view, that is not this case. [421 US 56, 58.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Here, the director was not required to reevaluate his initial decision. Rather, his review was limited to the findings of fact and conclusions of law made by the hearing officer after an adversarial hearing. Although special facts and circumstances in a particular case may require disqualifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>cation because of prior involvement, <em>id., </em>p 58, plaintiffs have not alleged such facts.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">\n<em>The dss\u2019 Failure to Comply With Statutory Notice Provisions (Issue 8)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Section 32(1) of the afcfla, MCL 400.732(1); MSA 16.610(82)(1), requires the dss to notify the clerk of a city, village, or township as to where a proposed afc facility will be located at least forty-five days before a license is issued. Section 3b(4) of the cvza, MCL 125.583b(4); MSA 5.2933(2X4), similarly requires a state licensing agency to notify the council or designated agent of a city or village.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">It is undisputed that the dss notified the Livonia Bureau of Inspection in January and February, 1981, concerning the licensure of the three Livonia afc small group homes. However, the bureau is not a designated agent of the city clerk or council for notification purposes. Nevertheless, city officials and concerned residents met on March 16, 1981, to discuss the proposed licensure. Moreover, the city attorney, on behalf of \"the legislative body of the City of Livonia,\u201d sent letters of complaint to the dss on March 19 and 20, 1981, and copies thereof to the council and city clerk. Plaintiffs filed the instant suits on April 1 and 2, 1981, and obtained temporary restraining orders preventing the proposed licensures. These orders were not dissolved until May 11, May 28, and July 20, 1981. Licensure in each case therefore occurred over forty-five days after the council and city clerk received actual, albeit indirect, knowledge of the dss\u2019 plans._</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Plaintiffs submit that the statutory notice requirements are mandatory and jurisdictional in nature. Therefore, they believe that the licenses should be rescinded because of the dss\u2019 technical noncompliance. We disagree. Although mandatory notice provisions cannot be ignored, <em>Krajenke Buick Sales, </em>322 Mich 255, substantial compliance is sufficient. <em>Meredith v City of Melvindale, </em>381 Mich 572, 579-580; 165 NW2d 7 (1969). Plaintiffs have not alleged, nor does the record reveal, that they were prejudiced by the noncompliance. See <em>Lisee v Secretary of State, </em>388 Mich 32, 45; 199 NW2d 188 (1972); <em>Montiy v East Detroit Civil Service Bd, </em>54 Mich App 510, 515-516; 221 NW2d 248 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">\n<em>Additional Statutory and Ordinance Violations (Issue 9)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Plaintiffs allege four additional violations of law which allegedly would preclude licensure of the Livonia homes. First, they maintain that the dss has acted with \"complete indifference to the views of the City of Livonia and its citizens\u201d in processing defendants\u2019 license applications, in violation of \u00a7 9(2) of the afcfla. That section provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">The department [dss] shall cooperate with other state departments and agencies and local units of government in administering this act. [MCL 400.709(2); MSA 16.610(59)(2)J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">The only allegation of noncooperation appears in \u00b6 39(e) of plaintiffs\u2019 complaints. That paragraph states that representatives of the dss or the dmh did not attend a March 16, 1981, meeting of city officials and concerned residents regarding the locations of the three afc homes. The Director of the dss responded that the dss was not aware of, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>or invited to attend this meeting. Nevertheless, representatives of the dss and the dmh did attend an April 2, 1981, meeting. The hearing officer found that the evidence presented did not establish that the dss had failed to cooperate with the city.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Since this finding is supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence, MCL 24.306(l)(e); MSA 3.560(206)(l)(e), we agree that no violation of \u00a7 9(2) occurred.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Second, plaintiffs believe that the dss violated \u00a713(4) of the afcfla, MCL 400.713(4); MSA 16.610(63X4), because it did not include the names of any lessors of the Livonia homes in the notices of application for licensure sent to the city. Section 13(4) requires an applicant to disclose <em>to the dss </em>the names of any lessors of the real estate on or in which the afc facility will be located. Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>12(3), MCL 400.712(3); MSA 16.610(62X3), states that the application for licensure and material submitted therewith shall be confidential. However, \u00a7 12(3) further provides that these materials shall be open to a party in a contested case involving the facility. Therefore, the names of any lessors were properly omitted from the notices of application sent to the city, but plaintiffs were entitled to this information under \u00a7 12(3) once they contested the proposed licensures.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Third, plaintiffs maintain that each of the Livonia homes are in violation of several building, plumbing, electrical, heating, and fire code regulations and ordinances. As noted in Issue 5, \u00a7 33 of the afcfla allows the city to enforce local construction codes which are applicable to private residences. All other local regulations and ordinances are superseded. The dss nevertheless has promulgated extensive fire and safety rules for afc small group homes providing care to six or less adults. See 1984 AACS, R 400.1601-400.1613. At the time the licenses were issued to the Livonia homes, 1979 AC, R 400.2113(1) allowed the dss to issue a temporary license to a new applicant if a preliminary investigation indicated that the applicant had the capacity to meet licensing requirements. Items of noncompliance could not constitute \"an immediate clear and present threat to the health, safety or well-being of any resident.\u201d These deficiencies nevertheless had to be corrected within a reasonable period of time. 1979 AC, R 400.2112(8).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> None of the violations mentioned by plaintiffs constituted an immediate clear and present danger to the residents, and defendant licens<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>ees apparently had the capacity to remedy them. However, if any remaining violations exist which may be legitimately enforced, they should be remedied forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Finally, plaintiffs believe that the operation of the afc small group homes should have been permanently enjoined under \u00a7 7 of the cvza, MCL 125.587; MSA 5.2937. Section 7 states that uses which violate local zoning ordinances constitute nuisances per se which may be abated by an injunction. However, since afc small group homes for six or less adults constitute a residential use of property under \u00a7 3b(2) of the cvza, no local zoning ordinances have been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">\n<em>Placement of Mentally Ill Persons in afc Small Group Homes (Issue 10)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Plaintiffs maintain that mentally ill adults cannot be placed in afc small group homes under the 1979 afcfla. The Court of Appeals in <em>Livonia I </em>and <em>II </em>correctly declined to address this issue, since the parties have stipulated that no mentally ill adults would be placed in any of the three Livonia homes. However, the issue is squarely presented in <em>Greentrees, </em>since there is evidence that the residents of the Southfield home are mentally ill as well as developmentally disabled. The dss maintains that it has consistently interpreted both the 1972 and 1979 afcfla to allow placement of mentally ill adults in all afc facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">The 1972 afcfla did not designate the categories of adults who could reside in afc facilities. It merely defined an afc facility as \"an establishment which provides supervision, assistance, protection or personal care, in addition to room and board, to adults.\u201d 1972 PA 287, \u00a7 2(b), former MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>331.682(b); MSA 16.610(2)(b). The 1979 afcfla definition is significantly more detailed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">\"Adult foster care facility\u201d means a governmental or nongovernmental establishment having as its principal function the receiving of adults for foster care. It includes facilities and foster care family homes for adults who are aged, <em>emotionally </em>disturbed, developmental^ disabled, or physically handicapped who require supervision on an ongoing basis but who do not require continuous nursing care. Adult foster care facility does not include any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">(d) A hospital for the <em>mentally ill . . </em>. operated by the department of mental health under Act No. 258 of the Public Acts of 1974, as amended, being sections 330.1001 to 330.2106 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. [MCL 400.703(4); MSA 16.610(53)(4). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">An afc small group home is simply defined as \"an <em>adult foster care facility </em>with the approved capacity to receive 12 or fewer adults . . . .\u201d MCL 700.703(7); MSA 16.610(53X7) (emphasis added). Similarly, the definitions of afc camps and family homes do not specifically refer to the categories of adults who may reside therein. See MCL 400.703(2), (5); MSA 16.610(53X2), (5). In contrast, the original definitions of afc large group homes and congregate facilities did contain such references. After defining the capacity of each of these afc facilities, the following provision appeared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-8\">Beginning 4 years after the effective date of this act, an adult foster care congregate facility [or large group home] which is licensed by the department to provide foster care in each respective category may receive only those adults in a category whose primary need for services is based upon only 1 of the following categories:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>(a) Aged condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">(b) <em>Mental illness, </em>developmental disability, or physical handicap, or a combination of <em>mental illness, </em>developmental disability, or physical handicap. [1979 PA 218, \u00a73(3), (6), codified at MCL 400.703(3), (6); MSA 16.610(53)(3), (6). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Finally, the 1979 afcfla does not define the term \"emotionally disturbed,\u201d but it does define \"mental illness\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-7\">\"Mental illness\u201d means a substantial disorder of thought or mood which significantly impairs judgment, behavior, capacity to recognize reality, or ability to cope with the ordinary demands of life. [MCL 400.705(4); MSA 16.610(55X4).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">This definition is identical to the definition of \"mental illness\u201d contained in \u00a7 400a of the Mental Health Code, MCL 330.1400a; MSA 14.800(400a).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">Plaintiffs argue that the terms \"emotionally disturbed\u201d and \"mentally ill\u201d are mutually exclusive \u2014 the former term describes a person with psychological problems that do not rise to the level of a substantial impairment of thought or mood which significantly impairs certain aspects of a person\u2019s life. The inclusion of the term \"mental illness\u201d in the definitions of afc large group homes and congregate facilities means that mentally ill adults may reside only in these larger facilities. Plaintiffs conclude that since an afc small group home is defined only as an \"afc facility\u201d and the general definition of \"afc facility\u201d refers only to emotionally disturbed adults, mentally ill adults cannot be placed in afc small group homes. (Similar logic would also preclude the placement of mentally ill adults in afc family homes and adult camps.)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>The majority of the <em>Greentrees </em>Court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 arguments for the reasons stated in <em>Oxford Twp v Dep\u2019t of Social Services, supra. </em>We need not examine the validity of the Court\u2019s reasoning since an examination of recent legislation and the Mental Health Code makes it clear that all afc facilities may provide foster care to mentally ill persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The provision requiring large group homes and congregate facilities to choose the type of adult to whom they would provide services reflected the Legislature\u2019s original intent to place homes for the aged under the control of the dss and the licensing provisions of the 1979 afcfla by March 27, 1984 (the fourth anniversary of the enactment of the 1979 afcfla).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> See House Legislative Analysis of HB 4104. However, the Legislature subsequently decided against this change and struck from the afcfla all references to homes for the aged. See 1984 PA 40 and House Legislative Analysis of HB 5410. The aforequoted provision contained in \u00a7 3(3) and (6) was one of these deletions.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Thus, as presently written, the only reference to \"emotionally disturbed\u201d in the afcfla appears in the general definition of afc facility in \u00a7 3(4). The only reference to \"mentally ill,\u201d apart from the statutory definition in \u00a7 5(3), appears in the exclusion of hospitals for the mentally ill from the definition of afc facility in \u00a7 3(4)(d). There is now no statutory basis for concluding that mentally ill adults can be placed only in larger afc facilities. If mentally ill adults can be placed in one kind of afc facility, they can be placed in any size facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Although there is no statutory definition of \"emotionally disturbed\u201d for purposes of placing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>adults into afc facilities,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> the Legislature contemplated that afc facilities could be used as a \"mainstreaming\u201d mechanism for persons who have been hospitalized for their psychological problems. The Mental Health Code requires county mental health programs and state facilities to \"develop an individualized pre-release plan for appropriate community placement and a prerelease plan for aftercare services appropriate for each individual\u201d who has been hospitalized. MCL 330.1209a(l); MSA 14.800(209a)(l). MCL 330.1209b; MSA 14.800(209b) contains a specific reference to placement of individuals \"in a supervised community living arrangement, such as a foster home, group care home, nursing home, or other facility . . . .\u201d The House Legislative Analysis of HB 5256 (the bill which added the prerelease planning sections to the Mental Health Code),<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> clearly shows the Legislature\u2019s preference for community-based care of mentally ill persons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">The apparent problem:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">With the emphasis now placed on transferring persons from state mental health institutions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>community treatment programs, the need for better pre-release planning of aftercare services for persons in community placements has become apparent. Of critical importance in this process are the 55 county and multi-county community mental health programs in the state, whose job it is to provide mental health services to persons living in their areas. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">\"Each <em>local mental health authority will assure the delivery of.. . residential, </em>and inpatient <em>programs to all persons in its service area who are impaired by or at risk of </em>developmental disability, <em>emotional disturbance, or mental illness </em>. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">Arguments:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">For:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\">The bill would ensure continuity of care for most persons released from state mental health institutions into the community and would facilitate the process of deinstitutionalization. The bill would enhance the long-term effectiveness of mental health treatment for these individuals by providing planning for appropriate community placement and aftercare services, and could thereby decrease the number of them who might otherwise be Institutionalized again in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-9\">For</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-10\">The knowledge that a plan for aftercare services existed for mental health services recipients living in the community, and that the local county program was responsible for regularly reviewing the appropriateness of such treatment, could eliminate some of the opposition to community mental health facilities and enhance the prospects for public acceptance of community-based mental health treatment. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">We note, however, that although mentally ill persons may be placed in afc facilities, not every mentally ill person is a proper candidate for such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>placement. Afc facilities are not designed to render \"treatment\u201d to persons with psychological problems. The principal function of an afc facility is providing foster care. \"Foster care\u201d is defined in \u00a7 4(5) of the afcfla as \"the provision of supervision, personal care, and protection in addition to room and board . . . .\u201d MCL 400.704(5); MSA 16.610(54)(5). \"Supervision,\u201d \"personal care,\u201d and \"protection\u201d are also specifically defined in the act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">\"Supervision\u201d means guidance of a resident in the activities of daily living, including all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">(a) Reminding a resident to maintain his or her medication schedule, as directed by the resident\u2019s physician.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">(b) Reminding a resident of important activities to be carried out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\">(c) Assisting a resident in keeping appointments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-9\">(d) Being aware of a resident\u2019s general whereabouts even though the resident may travel independently about the community.

[MCL 400.706(1); MSA 16.610(56)(1).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-11\">\"Protection\u201d means the continual responsibility of the licensee to take reasonable action to insure the health, safety, and well-being of a resident, including protection from physical harm, humiliation, intimidation, and social, moral, financial, and personal exploitation while on the premises, while under the supervision of the licensee or an agent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>or employee of the licensee, or when the resident\u2019s assessment plan states that the resident needs continuous supervision. [MCL 400.706(4); MSA 16.610(56X4).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Noticeably absent from the afcfla is any reference to \"treatment.\u201d \"Treatment\u201d is defined in the Mental Health Code as \"care, diagnostic, and therapeutic. services including the administration of drugs, and any other service for the treatment of an individual.\u201d MCL 330.1400(e); MSA 14.800(400)(e). A mentally ill individual who is adjudicated to be a \"person requiring treatment\u201d pursuant to the Mental Health Code can be involuntarily hospitalized. MCL 330.1468, 330.1476(2); MSA 14.800(468), 14.800(476X2). \"Person requiring treatment\u201d is defined as a person who, in addition to being mentally ill, may injure himself or others, or is unable to attend to his basic physical needs. MCL 330.1401; MSA 14.800(401). An individual can be voluntarily hospitalized if he is deemed to be clinically suitable for hospitalization. MCL 330.1411, 330.1415; MSA 14.800(411), 14.800(415). Neither type of person can be initially placed in an afc facility because of his treatment needs. The Legislature did not intend that placement in an afc facility could take the place of hospitalization. Nor were afc facilities designed to provide treatment to their residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Once an individual is no longer deemed a person requiring treatment or a person suitable for hospitalization, the individual may be a suitable candidate for placement in an afc facility. However, afc small group homes for six or less adults cannot \"accept or keep a person whose behavior requires isolation or restraint and shall not admit a person whose present care requirements and service needs are incompatible with those of other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>residents in the group home.\u201d 1984 AACS, R 400.2303(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">\n<em>Violations of Building and Use Restrictions in Homeowners\u2019 Deeds (Issue 11)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Plaintiffs claim that restrictive covenants contained in the deeds of the homes operated by defendants Human Services and Aftercare, Inc., and R. Roberts Residential Services<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> effectively prohibit the operation of afc small group homes in these houses. The pertinent covenants concerning the Human Services home are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">No lot shall be used except for residential purposes.

They point to the hearing officer\u2019s finding that traffic has increased in the neighborhood, that there are parking problems, and that the operation of the homes constitutes a commercial or business use.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">We initially note that neither the afcfla nor the cvza purport to regulate private restrictive covenants.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> \"Zoning laws determine property owners\u2019 obligations to the community at large, but do not determine the rights and obligations of parties to a private contract. These are separate obligations, both of which may be enforceable.\u201d <em>Rofe v Robinson, </em>415 Mich 345, 351; 329 NW2d 704 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Restrictive covenants in deeds are strictly construed against parties seeking to enforce them. All doubts are resolved in favor of the free use of property. <em>Boston-Edison Protective Ass\u2019n v Paulist Fathers, Inc, </em>306 Mich 253, 258-259; 10 NW2d 847 (1943); <em>Wood v Blancke, </em>304 Mich 283, 287; 8 NW2d 67 (1943). Nevertheless, restrictions which are clear on their face, reasonable in scope, and do not violate public policy will be upheld. <em>Oosterhouse v Brummel, </em>343 Mich 283, 287; 72 NW2d 6 (1955); <em>Grant v Craigie, </em>292 Mich 658, 661; 291 NW 44 (1940). Restrictions for residence purposes are particularly favored by public policy and are valuable property rights. <em>Oosterhouse, supra; Wood, </em>304 Mich 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Only the covenants pertaining to the Human <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Services home specifically limit the type of structure that can be built (single family dwelling) and the purposes to which the structure can be put (residential). There is no dispute that the Human Services house is a single family dwelling. Nevertheless, restrictive covenants regulating the type of permissible structures that can be erected also contemplate that the use and occupancy of the property will be similarly restricted. <em>Basset Building Co v Jehovah Evangelical Lutheran Church, </em>371 Mich 459, 463; 124 NW2d 236 (1963); <em>Wood, </em>304 Mich 287. Thus, we must determine whether the six developmentally disabled adults, plus any resident caretakers, living in the Human Services home constitute a single family and whether the house is being used for residential purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">\"Family\u201d is not defined in the covenant.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> However, this Court has construed the term to include more than just a nuclear or extended family whose members are related by consanguinity, marriage, or adoption. As early as 1883, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">Now this word \"family,\u201d contained in the statute, is an expression of great flexibility. It is applied in many ways. It may mean the husband and wife having no children and living alone together, or it may mean children, or wife and children, or blood relatives, or any group constituting a distinct domestic or social body. It is often used to denote a small select corps attached to an army chief, and has even been extended to whole sects, as in the case of the Shakers. <em>[Carmichael v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number><em>Northwestern Mutual Benefit Ass\u2019n, </em>51 Mich 494, 496; 16 NW 871 (1883).][<footnotemark>38</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">We have construed the term \"family\u201d in a restrictive covenant to include a household of five priests, <em>Boston-Edison, supra, </em>and have struck down a zoning ordinance which arbitrarily defined \"family\u201d to include only a traditional family unit plus one unrelated adult. <em>Delta Charter Twp v Dinolfo, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The adults who reside in the Human Services home function as a fixed housekeeping and social unit. For the reasons stated in <em>Malcolm v Shamie, </em>95 Mich App 132, 136-137; 290 NW2d 101 (1980), we conclude that the home is being occupied by a single family and is being used for residential purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">Five mentally retarded women living with a foster parent in an environment therapeutically designed to emulate a more conventional family environment should also be considered a family, and such use of the property, an appropriate family residential use. The residents are more than a group of unrelated individuals sharing a common roof. They do not have natural families on which to rely .... The substitute family provided by the group home allows the residents to lead more normal and meaningful lives within the community than would be feasible were they institutionalized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-8\">The facts in the case at bar do not connote a temporary living arrangement. . . . [T]he inhabitants of the foster care facility will live there on a permanent, year-round basis and will, other than a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>blood relationship, comprise all the elements of a family.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Numerous decisions from other states have similarly concluded that persons living together in residential group homes constitute a \"single family\u201d or that the operation of such homes constitutes a residential use of property. See, <em>e.g., Concord Estates Homeowners Ass\u2019n, Inc v Special Children\u2019s Foundation, Inc, </em>459 So 2d 1242 (La App, 1984); <em>Knudtson v Trainor, </em>216 Neb 653; 345 NW2d 4 (1984); <em>Crane Neck Ass\u2019n, Inc v NYC/Long Island Co Services Group, </em>92 AD2d 119; 460 NYS2d 69 (1983), <em>aff\u2019d </em>61 NY2d 154; 472 NYS2d 901; 460 NE2d 1336 (1984), <em>cert den </em>469 US 804 (1984); <em>Welsch v Goswick, </em>130 Cal App 3d 398; 181 Cal Rptr 703 (1982); <em>Costley v Caromin House, Inc, </em>313 NW2d 21 (Minn, 1981); <em>J T Hobby &amp; Son, Inc v Family Homes of Wake Co, </em>302 NC 64; 274 SE2d 174 (1981); <em>Crowley v Knapp, </em>94 Wis 2d 42; 288 NW2d 815 (1980); <em>State ex rel Region II Child &amp; Family Services, Inc v Eighth Judicial Dist Court, </em>187 Mont 126; 609 P2d 245 (1980); <em>Berger v State, </em>71 NJ 206; 364 A2d 993 (1976).<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">We reject plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to characterize the operation of an afc small group home as a business or commercial use of property. Since these homes are not allowed to provide continuous nursing care or psychiatric treatment, they are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>institutional in nature. The fact that the adults may be required to pay for certain items and services, see MCL 400.727(2)(b); MSA 16.610(77)(2)(b), does not of itself transform the nature of the activities conducted in the home from residential to commercial. <em>Concord Estates, </em>459 So 2d 1244; <em>Costley, </em>313 NW2d 26; <em>J T Hobby, </em>302 NC 72-73. The only fact plaintiffs point to is the increased traffic and parking problems. These concerns fall more within the covenant in each home\u2019s deed prohibiting activities which constitute an annoyance or nuisance. However, the same problems could have arisen if a large traditional family with several cars and numerous visitors had moved into the homes. See <em>Dinolfo, </em>419 Mich 273. The covenants contemplate more than just traffic problems. <em>Cf.

The Ohio Supreme Court in that case invalidated a statute analogous to \u00a7 3b of the cvza which purportedly superseded a local zoning ordinance barring facilities for the mentally retarded from residential areas. We do not view <em>Garcia </em>as persuasive authority, since the relevant Ohio constitutional provisions and case law are sufficiently dissimilar to our own constitution and jurisprudence. The <em>Garcia </em>Court noted that \u00a7 3, art XVIII of the Ohio Constitution directly conferred the power to zone upon municipalities and therefore further enabling statutes were unnecessary. However, <em>Euclid </em>was not cited as authority for this proposition of law, but <em>Pritz v Messer, </em>112 Ohio St 628; 149 NE 30 (1925), which was decided prior to <em>Euclid </em>was cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b560-7\"> Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 22 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">\"Under general laws the electors of each city and village shall have the power and authority to frame, adopt and amend its charter,'and to amend an existing charter of the city or village heretofore granted or enacted by the legislature for the government of the city or village. <em>Each such city and village shall have power to adopt resolutions and ordinances relating to its municipal concerns, property and government, subject to the constitution and law. </em>No enumeration of powers granted to cities and villages in this constitution shall limit or restrict the general grant of authority conferred by this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Const 1908, art 8, \u00a7 21 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">\"Under such general laws, the electors of each city and village shall have power and authority to frame, adopt and amend its charter and to amend an existing charter of the city or village heretofore granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>or passed by the legislature for the government of the city or village <em>and, through its regularly constituted authority, to pass all laws and ordinances relating to its municipal concerns, subject to the Constitution and general laws of this state.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b561-8\"> The 1963 Convention Comments state:</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">\"The new language is a more positive statement of municipal powers, giving home rule cities and villages full power over their own property and government, subject to the constitution and law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b566-7\"> The most recent administrative rules governing fire safety in afc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>small group homes for six or less adults appear in 1984 AACS, R 400.1601-400.1613.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b572-9\"> The hearing must be conducted in accordance with Chapter 4 of the Administrative Procedures Act, MCL 24.271-24.287; MSA 3.560(171)-3.560(187).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b572-10\"> In light of our conclusion in Issue 8, below, that the city received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>adequate notice, any failure to notify the homeowners lies with the city.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b574-6\"> Plaintiff homeowners did not submit any evidence that the value of their property has or will decline, or that they have been unable to sell their property, because of their proximity to an afc small group home.

This argument overlooks \u00a7 24 of the afcfla, MCL 400.724; MSA 16.610(74). This section allows an individual who believes that the afcfla or rules promulgated thereunder may have been violated to request an investigation, obtain an administrative hearing, and appeal an adverse decision to circuit court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b578-8\"> We reject plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the director\u2019s decision did not adequately state the reasons for rejecting the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation that the licenses be rescinded without prejudice. The director sufficiently stated that the dss had \"no legal obligation\u201d (i.e., no statutory or regulatory duty) to withhold licensure pending cooperation between the dmh and local units of government.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b580-6\"> The hearing officer nevertheless found that the dmh had not cooperated with the city, in accordance with its departmental guidelines and procedures. We note that MCL 330.1244(g); MSA 14.800(244)(g), added by 1980 PA 423, effective March 31, 1981, similarly requires the dmh to seek the advice and consultation of a city prior to planning and locating a \"specialized residential service\u201d in the community. However, this section became effective after the site-selection process was completed in each case and therefore is inapplicable. More importantly, plaintiffs did not name the dmh as a defendant and relied solely on the dss\u2019 alleged violation of \u00a7 9(2) of the afcfla. We agree with the conclusion of the Director of the dss that nothing in the afcfla or rules promulgated thereunder requires the dss to withhold licensure until the dmh complies with its departmental procedures. This conclusion, however, does not mean that the city cannot initiate an action to compel the dss or the dmh to fulfill their statutory duty to cooperate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b580-7\"> The Court of Appeals in <em>Livonia I, </em>119 Mich 811, concluded that the dss could be permanently enjoined from issuing licenses, including the instant licenses, if it had repeatedly failed to cooperate with other municipalities. Since past compliance was a question of fact and the evidence presented by the parties was insufficient to decide the question on review, the case was remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Remand was an inappropriate disposition. Plaintiffs never alleged that the dss had previously failed to comply with \u00a7 9(2); nor did they seek to enjoin the dss from issuing any future licenses. Plaintiffs merely sought to enjoin the issuance of the three licenses at issue here on the basis of the dss\u2019 alleged noncompliance with \u00a7 9(2) in these cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b581-6\"> Under the present rules, the dss may grant an exemption from an administrative rule if there is clear and convincing evidence that the alternative complies with the intent of the rule.
