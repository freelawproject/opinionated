W. Smiley is superintendent of the Belmont Oil Company, and James O\u2019Donnell is a tank gauger, and both live in the McDonald oil field near the premises operated in the lease in question. J. E. and Wm. Gallagher are residents of Olean, N. Y., and are oil producers and operators, and have been in the business in the McDonald field from sometime before' Sept. 23, 1893. O\u2019Donnell and Smiley, who were not operators or producers but who occasionally took oil and gas leases with the purpose of having them developed by other parties, learned that ten acres of land belonging to the McDonald Bros, could be leased for $1,000 bonus and the usual royalty. They sought out some one who was able and willing to operate this piece of land, if a lease should be obtained upon it. They and the Gallagher Bros, finally came together and agreed to take a, lease from the McDonald Bros.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-4\">\u201cOn Sept. 14', 1893, O. It. Cook, Esq., prepared a lease and it was signed by J. C. and K. Noble McDonald and J. E. and Wm. Gallagher, and left the lease in his office for the signatures of O\u2019Donnell and Smiley who were not present, and that same day the following paper was prepared by Mr. Cook:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-5\">\u201c \u2018 Articles of Agreement made and entered into this 14th day of September A. D. 1893, by and between Gallagher Bros, of Olean, in the state of New York, parties of the first part, and James O\u2019Donnell parties of the second part, as follows, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ANP\">\u201c \u2018 Whereas, the said parties to this agreement have leased for oil and gas purposes from J. C. and K. Noble McDonald a certain tract of land situated in Mount Pleasant Township, in the County of Washington and State of Pennsylvania, near Primrose Station, containing ten acres, said lease being dated September 14th, A. D. 1893:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-7\">\u201c\u2018Now therefore this'agreement witnesseth that the said party of the first part agrees to drill at their own proper cost, the first well to be drilled on said premises as provided in said lease and to furnish all material necessary to complete said well and to give or allow to the said party of the second part a full equal one eighth interest in said first well.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>\u201c \u2018 In consideration whereof the said party of the second part agrees to pay the one thousand (1000) dollars bonus as provided for in said lease, that is to say, five hundred (500) dollars in cash and the remaining five hundred (500) dollars out of the share of production first set apart to the said party of the second part. The said party of the second part also agrees to pay their proportionate share of the running expenses of said first well after the same has been completed, and also their proportionate share of the cost and expense of drilling and operating any well or wells that may be drilled on said premises after the said first well.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-4\">\u201c \u2018 In witness whereof the said parties of the first part and second part have hereunto set their hands and seals <em>the </em>day and year aforesaid.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-5\">\u201c In witness whereof this paper was signed and sealed by Gallagher Bros, and James O\u2019Donnell some time before Sept. 23, 1893.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-6\">\u201c On the last mentioned day the parties were at Mr. Cook\u2019s office to close up the matter; when it was discovered that the lease, written Sept. 14, 1893, and partly executed, contained a mistake in the description that might lead to a misunderstanding between the parties, the lease was rewritten and there signed by all the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-7\">\u201c The Gallagher Bros, took possession under the lease and commenced operations; at the time this bill was filed had completed two wells which were producing considerable oil and are now drilling a third well. Neither Smiley nor O\u2019Donnell have taken any active part in the operations upon this lease but have allowed the Gallagher Bros, to make the contracts and drill and operate the wells, which, so far as the testimony shows, was done in their own name, at least Mr. Smiley says he had no part in making the contracts for the development of the territory. No division order has ever been signed by the parties interested and given to the pipe line company; that is, no division of the oil produced has been agreed upon in writing and filed with the company and no settlement has been made as to the expenses incurred by the Gallagher Bros, in operating the lease, at least so far as the plaintiff is concerned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-8\">\u201c All that Smiley ever paid on account of the lease and its development was the $250 to the McDonald Bros., his half or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>share of the bonus which had to be paid when the lease was executed, and the Gallaghers have never paid anything on account of money received from oil produced and sold. By reason of a written notice served by Smiley upon the pipe line company, one fourth of the oil now being produced is held by the pipe line company subject to a determination of this suit. The exact amount of oil that has been produced from the leased premises and the exact amount of monejr expended in operating does not appear in the pleadings or testimony, nor does it appear how much of' the expenses incurred has not been paid by the Gallagher Bros.; in other words the account between the tenants in common, the plaintiff aud defendants, is open and unsettled and if the parties cannot agree on a settlement will have to be stated by the court upon a further hearing. The questions now before us are preliminary, and must be determined before an account is stated: Collyer v. Collyer, 83 Pa. 257 ; we must first determine the extent of the plaintiff\u2019s interest, and to this question we will now turn our attention.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-3\">\u201c J. W. Smiley testified that prior to the execution of the lease of Sept. 23, 1893, he and O\u2019Donnell had an agreement with the Gallagher Bros, that they were to pay the bonus money and that this was to stand as that much put into the operation of the lease by them (the Gallaghers), in other words, that the four lessees were to be equal owners in the leasehold and in drilling for oil and gas,' or, to use his own words, he was to be let in on the ground floor; every dollar of his money was to be as good as what they would put in.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-4\">\u201c The Gallaghers den}r this and say that they agreed to operate the lease and carry a one eighth interest in the first well for O\u2019Donnell and Smiley free of cost, if they would pay in cash the first half of the bonus and allow the other half to be paid out of their oil, and that, in other wells drilled, if oil was found, they (O\u2019Donnell and Smiley) should have a one eighth interest between them but should pay their proportionate share of the expenses, and that this verbal agreement, made before this lease was executed, with both O\u2019Donnell and Smiley, was reduced to wilting by Mr. Cook at their instance and was signed- by O\u2019Donnell, but that Smiley omitted to sign it, not, however, repudiating the verbal contract until some time after the lease had been executed and operations commenced. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>only corroboration of Mr. Smiley\u2019s version of the contract is found in the lease which is made to four persons, and the presumption is that each had an equal interest in the leasehold estate thereby created. But a knowledge of the oil business, the manner in which leases are taken and working interests in wells are carried, and the fact that the consideration is a royalty of the oil produced by labor bestowed upon the leasehold, to some extent weakens this presumption, and it is not as strong as where land is conveyed in fee simple for a fixed sum, which, on the face of the deed, appears to have been paid by all the parties jointly. In such a case equalit}r of ownership arises out of the supposition that each party paid an equal part of the purchase money, but the privilege to drill for oil or gas may be, and usuall}*- is obtained on the covenants of the lease -to deliver a certain proportion of the oil produced, and the expenditure of money by the lessees in operating the lease; and the proportion each puts in for this purpose is frequently made the basis for calculating their respective interests in the production. But over against this presumption, giving it full weight, and the testimony of the plaintiff, we have the testimony of the two Gallaghers corroborated by that of James O\u2019Donnell and Edward Morely, and the weight of the testimony as a whole is clearly against the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-4\">\u201cIt is very evident from the testimony, and.is not seriously disputed, that the purpose of O\u2019Donnell and Smiley in this and other leasing ventures was to take a lease and then have some producer who had money to develop it, they retaining as large a working interest as possible, which was to be carried by the operators in the first well; then, if the first well was good, their interest would enable them to carry 'for themselves their interest in succeeding wells; and if the first well was dry the operators would be out all the expenses of drilling the first well, and they would be out only what it cost to get into the lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-5\">\u201c Such contracts are common. Smiley, himself, admits enough to show that he and O\u2019JDonnell, of the one part, and the Gallagher Bros., of the other part, had some kind of a contract between themselves iipreference to taking and operating this lease, and that part of that contract was that he and O\u2019Donnell should pay in cash, when the lease was executed, $500 of the bonus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>then due, and that the Gallagher Bros, should pay nothing. It is true that Smiley says that this was done because the Gallaghers then had no ready money and that they were to put that much more into the expenses of drilling the first well, and thus put them on an equality as owners and operators of the lease, but this version of the transaction is inconsistent with the fact that Smiley and O\u2019Donnell borrowed of the Gallagher Bros. $167 to pay this $500, and afterwards paid it back to them, which they did, as clearly appears from the testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-3\">\u201c Again, [the testimony of Edward Morely shows that O\u2019Donnell and Smiley were working together as contracting parties, as against the Gallagher Bros., and that the four lessees, in this lease, did not expect to go in as equal owners in the lease and its operation.] [3] The contract which O\u2019Donnell admits, and which was afterwards put in writing, is consistent with the other facts in the case, while Smiley\u2019s claim is inconsistent. We have no doubt that [he made the same agreement with the Gallaghers that O\u2019Donnell did,] [4] that when the lease was executed and delivered by the McDonald Bros, to the four lessees-, this contract between them existed, [and that Smiley, when he refused to sign the writing that O\u2019Donnell signed and denied the agreement therein set forth, was already bound by a verbal contract, the terms of which are the same as that contained in the writing signed by O\u2019Donnell,] [4] and which, having been acted upon by the Gallaghers, could not be repudiated by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-4\">\u201c It was argued that the contract signed by O\u2019Donnell was unfair in its terms. Granting that it is, the plaintiff cannot now change it if he once was a party to it, so as to make it more favorable to himself. The only relevancy that the terms of the two contracts set up have to the question in dispute is the bearing they would have on the probability that the parties would enter into such a contract as is averred by defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-5\">\u201c If the terms of a verbal contract which was admittedly made \u00e1re disputed by the contracting parties, and the evidence is evenly balanced, the terms that are most just and equitable should prevail. But in this case [the contract was in regard to a matter that was speculative and full of contingencies, and whether the contract, as alleged by the defendants, was favorable or unfavorable to Smiley and. O\u2019Donnell depends on circumstances to be developed in the future.] [5] If Gallagher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Bros, should have been required to spend $5,000 in drilling the first well (and they say this is not an unreasonable estimate), and the lease should have proved worthless, they, the owners of the seven eighths interest would have lost $5,000, while O\u2019Donnell and Smiley, owners of their one eighth would have lost only $500, whereas, if they (O\u2019Donnell and Smiley) were owners of one half of the well, they would have had to pay one half of the $500 bonus and one half of the $5,000 expended in drilling the well, and lost it all; or granting that they owned the one eighth together, and Gallaghers seven eighths, each .lessee to share in paying the bonus and the expense of drilling the well, then they would have had to pay one eighth of the bonus, $62.50, and one eighth of the expense, $625, or in all $787.50, in place of the $500 which they paid to be carried free, so the advantage of the bargain depended on what it would cost to drill the first well and whether oil would be found or not, and, if oil was found, how much; things unknown when the bargain was made. The way this venture turned out it may be that the Gallaghers had the best of it. But it might have turned out so that the bargain made would have been most advantageous to O\u2019Donnell and Smiley. The terms of the O\u2019Donnell contract therefore throw no light on the question, whether it was also joined in by Smiley or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-4\">\u201c On Nov. 21, 1893, J. E. and ffm. Gallagher assigned their interest in the lease to J. R. Gallagher of Olean, N.
