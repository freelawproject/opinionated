Until the erection of the building now in use, and which was used for the first time for the term just closed, four sisters had been employed by the school board as teachers and taught public schools in a building belonging to them or to the Catholic congregation at Gallitzin, which was rented by the school board for that purpose, and in the public school building in another part of the town there were two schools taught by teachers other than sisters. On the completion of the new building, which contained eight rooms, in the fall of 1898, the six sisters made defendants here were employed as teachers, and Mr. Gray and Miss McGlade were also employed, Miss McGlade teaching in room No. 1, the lowest grade, and Mr. Gray in room No. 7, having all boys as pupils, and Sister Mary John in room No. 8, having all girls as pupils. The pupils in No. 6 were also all girls, the other rooms having pupils of both sexes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-5\">\u201c [It does not appear that there was any principal in the sense that any one teacher had any supervision or control over any room other than his or her own. The grading was done by Mr. Gray and Sister Mary John under the direction of the school board; and while there was some evidence of improper grading in the testimony of Mr. Gray, there was none that the sexes were separated to accommodate any disqualification of the sister to teach males. The term commenced about the first of Novemb\u00e9r, 1893, and continued until the 30th of April, 1894, when it was interrupted by the service of process in this case. The contract with the teachers, when the term commenced, was for seven months, but by resolution of the board of directors, concurred in by the teachers, it had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>agreed, a few days before the service of this injunction, that the term should end at the expiration of six months.

They wore at all times the familiar and distinctive garb of their order, with' crucifix suspended from the neck and black beads or rosary attached to a cincture, or girdle, which they wore around their waists; but there was no sufficient evidence that they used the garb or insignia mentioned in such a manner as to attract particular attention to them or their signification, or endeavored to so use them as to impart sectarian or religious instruction.] [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-5\">\u201c There were two pianos in the public school belonging to the sisterhood, one in Sister Mary John\u2019s room and one in the directors\u2019 room, the former being used to accompany the school in vocal musical exercises, and on the other Sister Mary John gave lessons to private pupils after school hours, and they sometimes practiced on it during school hours.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-6\">. \u201c In the rooms where sisters were employed as teachers, the Catholic catechism was taught by them each day, excepting Friday, immediately after the close of the regular school exercises, to children of- Catholic parents, or, to state the matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>more precisely, all Catholic children were expected by the teachers and their parents to remain after 4 o\u2019clock and recite lessons previously assigned them, and which they'were expected to have prepared the same as any other lessons, from catechisms containing religious instructions applicable to the Roman Catholic Church, and containing explanations and instructions as to observances, ceremonies, and beliefs peculiar to the Roman Catholic Church. These books were furnished by the sisters to the pupils, or purchased bjr .the parents from the church authorities. They were-taken to the schoolhouse by the children with their other books and kept in their desks with them. It was a common occurrence for the children to take the catechisms from their desks or school-bags and study their lessons in them during school hours, sometimes one hearing another recite the lesson. This was forbidden by the sisters, and frequent instances were given in evidence of reproof administered by them whenever this prohibition' was violated. So far as the evidence shows that the sisters had anjv knowledge of this use of the catechism during school hours, thej'- invariably forbade such use and reproved the children detected in it. This catechism instruction after school hours was with the knowledge of the directors and was permitted and allowed by them. There was but one instance in evidence of any instruction in the catechism excepting after school, and that was where a recitation was given two or three children before school hours, during which protestant children were not permitted to enter the room, and the sister giving this lesson stated in evidence that it was done as a punishment to these children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b661-3\">\u201c [There was no evidence of any religious instruction or religious exercises of any character whatever during school hours.] [11]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b661-4\">\u201c [None of the sisters engaged as teachers attended the teachers\u2019 institute, held at Ebensburg in the fall of 1893.

We find no evidence that they conducted themselves in any manner different from any other person visiting the schools, either in the hearing of recitations or otherwise, nor that there was any difference observed in the treatment of them by the scholars from that accorded to any other visitor, the same custom being-observed as to rising and saluting any other grown person who visited the schools; as, for instance, where a physician visited the schools, the scholars would rise and say, \u2018 Good-morning, Doctor; \u2019 and as to, any grown person not having a title, he would be addressed by his proper name when it was known.] [9]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b662-4\">\u201c The population of Gallitzin is about three thousand, consisting of about two hundred and fifty Catholic families and about fifty protestant families.

The evidence of this intention is found in the history of the schools during the period concerning which evidence was admitted, and in the correspondence of the board with the county superintendent.

The plain, obvious meaning of the 2d section of article 10, and of the 18th section of article 3, is that money raised by compulsory taxation for the support of public schools or other public purposes shall not be used for the propagation or encouragement of the doctrines of any religion, or church\u2014 as the term is more commonly used\u2014-since that would be a diversion of the money from the purpose for which it was raised, and a violation of article 1, section 3, of the constitution just quoted. Judge Cooley, in his work on Constitutional Limitations, at page 469, enumerates among the things which are not lawful under any of the American constitutions, \u2018.Compulsory support by taxation or otherwise of religious instruction ; \u2019 and he says, \u2018Not only is no denomination to be favored at the expense of the rest, but all support of religious instruction must be entirely voluntary. It is not within the sphere of government to coerce it.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b665-3\">\u201c Similar provisions exist in the constitutions of nearly every state in the Union; and we might quote from .the opinions of many eminent judges to demonstrate the wisdom and purpose 'of such provisions, which have invariably been approved when judicially considered. We will content ourself, however, with one such quotation, and that from the opinion of our distinguished predecessor\u2014Judge Dean\u2014delivered in the case of Wesley Spires against the Treasurer and School Directors of Gallitzin District, No. 73, Sept.

We have referred to a case arising under the Nevada constitution. In that state it is provided in the original constitution that any school district which should allow instruction of a sectarian character therein, might be deprived of its portion of the interest of the- public school fund during the time of such instruction. It is also provided that no sectarian instruction shall be imparted or tolerated in any school or university that may be established under the constitution ; and, subsequently, these provisions not being considered stringent enough, there was embodied in the constitution a prohibition against the use of the funds of the state or of any county or municipality for sectarian purposes. [We might give numerous extracts showing the more stringent provisions in the constitutions, as well as the laws of other states, which have been before the courts for construction, but nowhere have we any intimation in the decisions of any court that the teaching in the public schools by a member of the order of the Sisters of St. Joseph or any similar order, in the habit of their .order. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>made the school a sectarian school; or that it violated the right's of conscience of any one. On the contrary, the only judicial utterance we have on the subject is that of Judge Dean, in the opinion already quoted from, wherein he says: \u2018 S\u2019or example,' the fact that Sisters Angela and Stanislaus were members of St. Joseph\u2019s Convent, and wore the habit of their order while engaged in teaching, in itself proves nothing.

We quote from his opinion: \u2018A school is not sectarian because taught by a minister or priest or any church official; but a school controlled or managed in the interests of any particular church organization, upholding its peculiar confession and ecclesiastical practice, and used for any class of pupils exclusive of others, is certainly sectarian.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-4\">\u201c And, although not in evidence in this case, it has become public property in connection therewith, as part of the literature pertaining to such matters, that similar views are entertained by the present superintendent of public instruction. We do not mention these matters as affecting our decision, nor as in the least binding upon us, but as indicating the absence of such conclusion as the plaintiffs contend for in the minds of those who are in control of the affairs of the public schools in the state. W e have studied with care and interest the decision of a distinguished ex-judge, who, at the time of its delivery, was superintendent of public instruction in New York state, and on which considerable reliance was placed by counsel for plaintiffs; and we concur in much that was said therein by him, but it by no means follows from the language used by him that had he then been on the. bench and asked to apply the strong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>arm of the equity side of the court he would have found the matters that he says \u2018 ought not to be persisted in \u2019 sufficient grounds to warrant him in doing so.] [10]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-4\">\u201c [The policy of the directors of the Gallitzin public schools of discriminating in the employment of teachers, in favor of persons belonging to a particular class, members of an exclusive religious order, connected by vows and organization with the church to which all the members of the board belong, indicates to our mind a reprehensible indifference on the part of the directors to the policy of the law to absolutely divorce all matters tending to sectarianism from the public schools. But it is also the policy of the school law of this state, which lodges in the' directors the power to employ teachers, not to interfere with them in the exercise of that power unless it be arbitrarily exercised to the detriment of the schools or interference with the rights of the taxpayers, and while it is apparent to us that these directors were influenced and controlled in the selection of teachers by their religious associations and connections, yet, it being conceded that the teachers who were employed were efficient and competent instructors, and it not being proven that they intruded their religious belief in the form of religious instruction or religious observances during school hours, there is neither authority in the law nor in the decisions for us to say that the selection of them by the directors was the exercise of such an arbitrary discretion as would warrant the court in interfering at this date. They liad regular certificates issued by the count}' superintendent, granted after an examination] ; [4] [they contracted with the school directors to teach these schools; had already taught within a few days of six months when this proceeding was commenced, and would have completed the term in three or four days had it not been interrupted by it.] [7] Some of them had been employed in these public schools for years uncomplained of, so far as the evidence shows ; and while this custom would not make it lawful, if otherwise unlawful, yet we could not disregard it if the case hinged on the question as to whether the directors had exercised an arbitrary discretion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-5\">\u201c [We conclude, as to this branch of the case, that, in the absence of proof that religious sectarian instruction was imparted by them during school hours, or religious sectarian exercises engaged in, we cannot restrain, by injunction, members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>of tlie order of Sisters of St. Joseph from teaching in the public schools in the garb of their order, nor the school directors from employing or permitting them to act in that capacity.] [5] [15]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-3\">\u201c The use of the public school building in imparting religious instruction after school hours, in the manner detailed by us in our conclusions of fact, is not only a violation of the fundamental law of the state in that the instruction, being purely and essentially sectarian in its character, is prohibited, but the directors exceeded their authority in permitting any such use to be made of the building. It is very clear to us that the prohibition of the appropriation of money raised for the support of public schools to sectarian schools includes the use of the public school buildings, erected by such money, for any sectarian purpose. But there is a further reason for restraining the use of the public school building for this purpose, as well as for any other purpose foreign to public school instruction; and that is that, the building having been erected for a particular corporate purpose, the corporate authorities cannot authorize its use for any other, and any diversion is illegal, and must be restrained when complained of. This seems to be the tendency of all the decisions where this question has been raised. Our school law (act of May 8, 1854) gives the school districts the capacity of bodies corporate, and authorizes the purchase of such real and personal property as may be necessary for-the establishment and support of the schools. The sehoolhouses and school property are held by the directors as corporate bodies, in trust for the uses for which they were erected under the law and the constitution, and none other; and under the familiar and well-known principle that corporations have only such powers as are within the scope of their charters, they cannot permit this property to be used for any other purpose. The use for which these buildings were held and are held is for public or common schools; and while it might be argued that the misuse complained of in this case may be regarded as incidental to the primary purpose of the building, and that the purpose is innocent and promotive of the improvement and benefit of the pupils participating in it, nevertheless it is a diversion of the building from its primary purpose, beyond the power of the directors to permit. There are a number of decisions bearing on this question, but the principle is so clear to us that we will not burden this opinion with quotations from them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>\u201c The use of the public school building by these sisters for a free term after the conclusion of the public school term, to be conducted in the manner they had previously conducted similar terms in the building belonging to them, would be a plain violation of the law as just laid down by us that' would not be tolerated, for that would be a misuse of the school property beyond the authority of the school board to authorize, and not permissible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-4\">\u201c While it is true that the evidence of the intent to conduct a private term of school in the manner indicated at the conclusion of the public term is slight, yet it is sufficient to warrant the apprehension that such would be done unless restrained. Everything that we have said as to the use of the public school buildings for any other than common school' purposes would apply to their use for giving music lessons to private pupils therein, which is a misuse of the building, and should be restrained when complained of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-5\">\u201c The fact that the sisters employed as teachers did not attend the sessions of the teachers\u2019 institute indicates to our mind a lack of professional zeal and interest in their employment, and the fact that they closed their schools on church holidays indicates that possibly their zeal as members of the church was greater- than their professional zeal, but these are matters concerning which they must ansrver to their employers\u2014the directors\u2014and concerning which the latter must answer to their constituents. The court cannot take action on such matters as these without usurping the functions of the school directors, and more especially since it was in evidence by the testimony of the sisters that there is nothing in their vows or elsewhere to prevent them from attending the teachers\u2019 institutes or teaching on church holidays, if required to do so by the directors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-6\">\u201c [ [There were other matters in evidence, not affecting the main question involved, to which the preceding suggestions apply.

Justice Dean,</author>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">This bill was filed to restrain the school directors of Gallitzin borough from permitting sectarian teaching in the common schools of the borough, and from employing as teachers, sisters, or members of the order of St. Joseph, a religious society of the Roman Catholic Church. What seem to us the most material averments of the bill were denied in the answer. The employment, however, of the'members of this society, was admitted. The court, after full hearing, found as a fact: \u201cThere was no evidence of any religious instruction or religious exercises of any character whatever, during school hours.\u201d But the court further found that after school hours the schoolroom was used by the teachers in imparting Catholic religious instruction to children of Catholic parents, with the consent of or by request of the parents. This the court enjoined, because it was a use of the- school property for sectarian pui\u2019poses aftei school hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">As to the fact admitted, that of the eight teachers, six of them were sisters of a religious order of the Catholic church, and while teaching wore the habit of their order, the learned judge of the court below says: \u201cWe conclude, as to this branch of the case, that, in the absence of proof that religious sectarian instruction was imparted by them during school hours, or religious sectarian exercises engaged in, we cannot restrain by injunction members of the order of Sisters of St. Joseph from teaching in the public schools in the garb of their order, nor the school directors from employing or-permitting them to act in that capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">This legal conclusion is reached, after a very able and impartial opinion, in which the facts are reviewed, and the law bearing on the question very fully cited. The opinion is so convincing, that it seems to us it must compel the assent of the unprejudiced mind, whether layman or lawyer. In thus expressing our full accord with the learned president judge of the court below, we intimate no opinion as to the wisdom or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>unwisdom of the action of the school board in selecting six Catholic school teachers, members of an exclusively religious order. In this matter was involved, solely, the exercise of discretion by the school board in the performance of an official duty, for which they alone are responsible; this discretion, when it does not transgress the law, is not reviewable by this or any other court. When a teacher of good moral character applies for a school, and presents a certificate of qualification as to scholarship and aptness to teach, that is an end of judicial inquiry into the action of \u00abthe board in appointment, because the law makes no further inquisition up to this point. The burden of appellant\u2019s complaint here is set out in the 8th assignment of error, as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b679-3\">\u201c The court erred in finding that the employment of the Sisters of St. Joseph as teachers in the public schools, and their acting as such while wearing the distinctive sectarian garb, crucifixes and rosaries of their order and sect, could not be enjoined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Unquestionably these women are Catholics, strict adherents of that faith, believing fully in its distinctive creed and doctrine. But this does not disqualify them. Our constitution negatives any assertion of incapacity or ineligibility to office because of religious belief. Article 1 of the Bill of Rights declares : \u201c All men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God aecordipg to the dictates of their own conscience ; .... no human authority can in any case whatever control or interfere with the rights of conscience.\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">If by law any man or woman can be excluded from public office or employment because he or she is a Catholic, that is a palpable violation of the spirit of the constitution; for there can be, in a democracy, no higher penalty imposed upon one holding to a particular religious belief, than, perpetual exclusion from public station because of it. Men may disqualify themselves by crime, but the state no longer disqualifies because of religious belief. We cannot now, even if we wanted to, in view of our law, both fundamental and statutory, go back a century or two to a darker age, and establish a religious test as a qualification for office. In this case, the school board committed no unlawful act in selecting these Catholic women as teachers, because, by moral character and certified attain-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>merits, they were qualified, and their religion did not disqualify. The board may have thought that because of-their previous training and discipline they were specially qualified as teachers, just as protestnntschool boards sometimes think the graduates of particular schools or colleges make the best teachers ;'but there is no proof that they were appointed because they were Catholics, in preference to others, as well, or better, qualified, but not members of that church. It appears, that the members of the school board are Catholics. The voters of the borough number between four and five hundred, and all but about fifty of these are Catholics. Under such circumstances, it is probable that often the board will be wholly Catholic, just as we see all over the commonwealth in school districts largely protestant, the whole board composed of non-Catholics. We suppose, in many cases, the Catholic school director is of the opinion that the schools and colleges controlled by his church train the best teachers; the protestant director is of an opposite opinion, and prefers, as teachers, those educated in protestant denominational schools or colleges. Inevitably, in a \u2022popular government by the majority, public institutions will be tinged, more or less, by the religious proclivities of the majority ; but in all cases where a discretion is reposed by law, we must assume, in the absence of evidence to the. contrary, that the public officer has performed his duty. We cannot infer, from the mere fact that a school.board composed of Catholics has selected a majority of Catholic teachers, therefore it has unlawfully discriminated in favor of Catholics; because, the selection of Catholic teachers is not a violation of law or, which is the same thing, is not an abuse of discretion. Unless this be the case, no court has power to revise the exercise of this discretion, for the very sufficient reason, the law lias not made the court school directors, while it has devolved on six citizens of Gallitzin borough the duties of that office.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Nor does the fact that these teachers contributed all their earnings beyond their support to the treasury of their order, to be used for religious purposes, have any bearing on the question. It is none of our business, nor that of these appellants, to inquire into this matter. American men and women, of sound mind and twenty-one years of age, can make such disposition of their surplus earnings as suits their own notions. We might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>as well, so far as any law warranted it, inquire of a lawyer,'before admitting him to the bar, what he intended' to do with his surplus fees, and make his answer a test of admission. What he did with his money, could in no way affect his right to be sworn as an officer of this court, therefore it would be impertinence in us to inquire.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-3\">But it is further argued that, if the appointment of these Catholic teachers was lawful, they ought to be enjoined from appearing in the schoolroom in the habit of their order. It may be conceded that the dress and crucifix impart at once knowledge to the pupils of the religious belief and society membership of the wearer. But is this, in any reasonable sense of the word, sectarian teaching, which the law prohibits? The religious belief of many teachers, all over the commonwealth; is indicated by their apparel. Quakers or Friends, Ommish, Dunkards \"and other sects, wear garments which at once disclose their membership in a religious sect. Ministers or preachers of many protestant denominations wear a distinctively clerical garb. No one has yet thought of .excluding them as teachers from the schoolroom on the ground that the peculiarity of their dress would teach to pupils the distinctive doctrines of the sect to which they belonged. The dress is but the announcement of a fact, that the wearer holds a particular religious belief. The religious belief of teachers and all others is generally well known to the neighborhood and to pupils, even if not made noticeable in the dress, for that belief is not secret, but is publicly professed. Are the courts to decide that the cut of a man\u2019s coat, or the color of a woman\u2019s gown, is sectarian teaching, because they indicate sectarian, religious belief? If so,, then they can be called upon to go further. The religion of the teacher being known, a pure unselfish life, exhibiting itself in tenderness to the young, and helpfulness for the suffering, necessarily tends to promote the religion of the man or woman who lives it. Insensibty, in both young and old, there is a disposition to reverence such an one, and, at least to some extent, consider the life as the fruit of the particular .religion. Therer fore, irreproachable conduct, to that degree, is sectarian teaching. But shall the education of the children of the commonwealth be intrusted only to those men and women who are destitute of any religious belief?</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>Our recollection extends back almost to the beginning of the common school system of the commonwealth ; in many counties there never was a time when ministers of protestant sects were not frequently selected as teachers; some of them wore, in the schoolroom where children of Catholic parents were pupils, a distinctively clerical garb; when the office of county superintendent was first created in 1854, in many counties preachers were chosen to fill the office; the present State Superintendent of Public Instruction is a protestant preacher. It is fair to presume\u2018that high moral character, the result of Christian sectarian teaching, as well as scholarly attainments, prompted their selection. Ordination vows binding them to a particular creed, were considered no disqualification; it was not assumed that the fact of membership in a particular church, or consecration to a religious life, or the wearing of a clerical coat or necktie, would turn the schools into sectarian institutions. In the sixty years of existence of our present school system, this is the first time this court has been asked to decide, as matter of law, that it is sectarian teaching for a devout woman to appear in a schoolroom in a dress peculiar to a religious organization of a Christian church. We decline to do so; the law does not so say. The legislature may, by statute, enact that all teachers shall wear in the schoolroom a particular style of dress, and that none other shall be worn, and thereby secure the same uniformity of outward appearance as we now see in city police, railroad trainmen, and nurses of some of our large hospitals. But we doubt if even this would repress knowledge of the fact of a particular religious belief; that, if the teacher had any, would still be effectively taught by unselfish devotion to duty; no mere significance or insignificance of garb could conceal it; the daily life would either exalt or make obnoxious the sectarian belief of the teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">After a most careful consideration, we see nothing of merit in any of the assignments of error which have been so earnestly pressed in the argument. The decree is affirmed and appeal dismissed, at costs of appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b682-5\">Me. Justice Williams</author>\n<p id=\"AvX\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">I can go with my brethren on all the questions involved in this case save one. I cordially assent to the proposition that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>teachers should be selected for the common schools because of their fitness and not because of their religious belief or their church affiliation. I am glad that in this state and in this country the rights of conscience are no less sacred than the rights of property, and that test oaths and religious disqualifications belong to a period further back than the memory of the present generation can reach. I hope they may never be restored. But the constitution and laws of this commonwealth provide for open free schools, for all children of the proper age, that shall be secular in character. Schools in which the consciences and the sectarian bias of both parents and children shall be respected, or at least not interfered with. Their purpose is to provide an elementary education that shall help to fit the rising generation for actual business, and the duties and privileges of citizenship. Is the public school in the borough of Gallitzin so conducted ? It is a school with eight departments and a separate teacher for each. The eight teachers are members of the same church or sect. This is unusual but not unlawful. Six of these teachers presiding over six of the departments are nuns of the sisterhood of St. Joseph. They have renounced the world, their own domestic relations, and their family names. They have also renounced their property, their right to their own earnings, and the direction of their own lives, and bound themselves by solemn vows to the work of the church and to obedience to their ecclesiastical superiors. They have ceased to be civilians or secular persons. They have become ecclesiastical persons known by religious names, and devoted to religious work. Among other methods by which their separation from the world is emphasized, and their renunciation of self and subjection to the church is proclaimed, is the adoption of a distinctively religious dress. This is strikingly unlike the dress of their sex whether Catholic or protestant. Its use at all times and in all places is obligatory. They are forbidden to modify it. Wherever they go this garb proclaims their church, their order, and their separation from the secular world as plainly as a herald could do if they were constantly attended by such a person. The question presented on this state of facts is whether a school that is filled with religious or ecclesiastical persons as teachers, who come to the discharge of their daily duties wearing their ecclesiastical robes and hung about with the rosaries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>and other devices peculiar to their church and order is not necessarily dominated by sectarian influences and obnoxious to the spirit of the constitutional provisions and the school laws ?</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">This is not a question about taste or fashion in dress, nor about the color or cut of a teacher\u2019s clothing. If it was only this I would favor the largest liberty. It is deeper and broader than this. It is a question over the true intent and spirit of our common school system as disclosed in the provisions referred to. If this is a proper administration of the school laws in Gallitzin it would be equally so in any other school district of the state; and if every common school was presided over by ecclesiastics in their distinctive ecclesiastical robes, supplying pupils with copies of their church catechism on application and teaching it before and after school hours to all who chose to remain for that purpose, it seems to me very plain that the common schools would cease to be such and would become, to all practical intents and purposes, parochial schools of the church whose ecclesiastics presided over them.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Clergymen sometimes wear on the street a coat or hat that affords some evidence of their profession, but they do not appear in ehurchly robes when about their daily work, or in any garb that points out- the church to which they belong or the creed to which they adhere. But these six teachers in Gallitzin do just that. They wear, and must wear, at all times a prescribed unchangeable ecclesiastical dress which was plainly intended to proclaim their non-secular and religious character; their particular church and order, and their separation from the world. They come into the schools not as common school teachers, or as civilians, but as the representatives of a particular order in a particular church whose lives have been dedicated to religious work under the direction of that church. Now the point of the objection is not that their religion disqualifies them. It does not. Nor is it thought that church membership disqualifies them. It does not. It is not that holding an ecclesiastical office or position disqualifies, for it does not. It is the introduction into the schools as teachers of persons who are by their striking and distinctive ecclesiastical robes necessarily and constantly asserting their membership in a particular church, and in a religious order within that church, and the subjection of their lives to the direction and control of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>officers. No priest or bishop in full canonical dress more plainly declares his church, and his office therein, than do these non-secular and ecclesiastic persons when they come into the schoolroom of a secular public school wearing the peculiar uniform and insignia of their sisterhood. The common schools are supported by general taxation. The Catholic and the protestant, the Jew and the infidel, help support them, and have an equal right to their benefits. The common schools cannot be used to exalt any given church or sect, or to belittle or override it; but they should be, like our political institutions, free from ecclesiastical control and from sectarian tendencies. Is the public school of Gallitzin such an one ? The protestant children of that borough do not think so. Their parents do not think so, as appears most plainly by this litigation. The directors evidently did not think so for they repulsed the mothers who came to them to beg that their children might be put in a department not presided over by one of these ecclesiastical persons. The learned judge of the court below did not think so for he enjoined against the teaching of the catechism and all other sectarian instruction, but he left the ecclesiastics in full charge. With faces averted from the world they have renounced; wearing their peculiar robes which tell of their church, their order and their subordination to the guidance of their ecclesiastical superiors; using their religious names and addressed by the designation, \u201c sister,\u201d. they direct the studies and the deportment of the children under their care, as ecclesiastical persons. They cannot or they will not attend teachers\u2019 institutes. They have no touch with those engaged in the same pursuit about them. They do not attend public examinations; but, examined in the seclusion of the \u201c Mother House \u201d of their order, after having been selected by the \u201c Sister Superior\u201d in compliance with the written request of the directors, they come to their work as a religious duty, and their wages pass, under the operation of their vows, into the treasury of the order. If a school so conducted is not dominated by sectarian influence, and under sectarian control, it is not easy to see how it could be. If in some neighboring borough the several departments of the public school should be filled by Episcopal clergymen as teachers, who should appear only in their canonical robes, and with their prayer books sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>pended from their necks, and if Catholic parents of children entitled to admission into the school should appeal to the courts for relief for their children from the presence and influence of ecclesiastics who insisted upon keeping the name of their church and their relation to it before the minds of their pupils, I should no more doubt their right to such relief than I can doubt the right of the plaintiffs in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
