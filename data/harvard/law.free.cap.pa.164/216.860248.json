Eby, William Leaman and J. Hay Brown, Esqrs., after reviewing the facts of the giving of a plain promissory note by decedent to his nephew Alanson J. Stevens, July 12, 1858, on demand, which was the subject of the present claim, continued:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-7\">\u201c After the death of Alanson J. Stevens, his brother, Thaddeus Stevens, had possession of the said promissory note, on which claim is now made, up to the time of his death, Nov. 1, 1874, and the said Thaddeus Stevens was the administrator of the estate of Alanson J. Stevens, deceased. After the death of the said Thaddeus Stevens, the said promissory note was in the possession of R. W. Shenk, administrator of the estate of said Thaddeus Stevens, deceased. After the death of the said R. W. Shenk, Sept. 26, 1880, the said promissory note came into the hands of William Leaman, where it remained until April 19, 1886, when it passed over to J. M. Wiestling, administrator of the estate of Alanson J. Stevens, deceased, by whom claim has been made upon it before the auditors. No demand was made for the payment of the said promissory note upon Hon. Thaddeus Stevens, during his lifetime, after the same was made and delivered, either by Alanson J. Stevens, while he was living, or by his legal representative, Thaddeus Stevens, administrator of the estate of Alanson J. Stevens, deceased. Hon. Thaddeus Stevens died Aug. 12, 1868, more than ten years after the date of the said promissory note. The said promissory note was made payable on demand, and, therefore, the statute of limitation began running from its date. The statute, consequently, has had full operation, and is an effectual bar to recovery, unless there has been a subsequent promise by Hon. Thaddeus Stevens, or an acknowledgment by. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>him of the debt, from which the legal inference of a promise to pay can be made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-4\">\u201c Simon Stevens was called as a witness. He now resides in the city of New York, at No. 61 Broadway, and is an attorney at law. He became acquainted with Hon. Thaddeus Stevens, and knew him well up to the day of his death. He entered as a student at law in the office of Mr. Stevens, Jan. 1, 1845. He frequently saw Mr. Stevens in Washington, and visited him at his residence in that city. He testifies that \u2018 Mr. Stevens on several occasions, while speaking of Alanson and other family relations, expressed, surprise that the note had never been presented for payment.\u2019 \u2018He made inquiries for it .once of Mr. Sweeney in my presence. Mr. Stevens expressed himself then as believing that the note was lost when Alanson was killed. The last time he spoke of it to me was about a month or two before he died, remarking substantially in these words : \u201c Simon, you know all about this note ; that I hold the money in a fiduciary, capacity ; and if it is ever presented you can explain that it must be paid to the legal holder.\u201d \u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-5\">\u201c These conversations were not held with either the \u2018 legal holder \u2019 or his agent, but with an entire stranger to the contract between the parties. It was observed in Kyle v. Wells, 17 Pa. 286, that \u2018 it is a mere perversion of the word \u201c promise \u201d to apply it to a declaration made to one who has no interest in or connection with the subject spoken of.\u2019 \u2018 A promise made to a stranger is a mere declaration of intention, which the promisor may change at pleasure. To be binding upon him it ought to be made under circumstances which indicate an intention to pay the debt; not a mere loose declaration: \u2019 McKinley v. Snyder, 78 Pa.'497. The statements, or declarations, made by Mr. Stevens to Simon Stevens, have no legal effect. They were not made under the circumstances required by law to constitute a promise to pay, or an acknowledgment consistent with a promise to pay, or from which the legal inference of a promise to pay could be made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-6\">\u201c Simon Stevens continues: \u2018On one occasion, when Mr. Dickey was present, Mr. Stevens turned around to Thad, whom he called Major, and said: \u201c Major, it is strange that that note of mine never turned up.\u201d The Major replied: \u201c May be the Rebs may present it to you.\u201d \u2019 The Major was his nephew, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Thaddeus Stevens, Jr., who was the administrator of the estate of Alanson J. Stevens, deceased. Granting that Hon. Thaddeus Stevens referred on this occasion to the promissory note made by himself to Alanson J. Stevens, the declaration has no legal value. It is not shown that Hon. Thaddeus Stevens knew that Thaddeus Stevens, Jr., was administrator of the estate of Alanson J. Stevens, deceased, and that as such he held the said promissory note. On the contrary, it is shown that he did not know that such was the fact. Simon Stevens testifies that the last time Mr. Stevens spoke to him about the promissory note in question, about a month or two before his death, he said: \u2018 If it is ever presented you can explain that it must be paid to the-legal holder.\u2019 Here it is plainly apparent that Mr. Stevens recognized that it was possible that the said promissory note might have passed from the hands of Alanson J. Stevens for a consideration, and that he did not know who was then the \u2018 legal holder.\u2019 If he had the anxiety to pay this note, which the testimony of Simon Stevens would show he had, and had he known that his nephew, Thaddeus Stevens, held it, as administrator of the estate of Alanson J. Stevens, deceased, the most obvious and natural course for him to pursue would be to pay such administrator and lift the note, and not give a direction to Simon Stevens to see to its post mortem payment to the \u2018legal holder.\u2019 It is certain that Thaddeus Stevens, Jr., in the conversation in which Mr. Stevens addressed him as Major, did not inform Mr. Stevens that he held the said promissory note as the administrator of the estate of Alanson J. Stevens, deceased, or make any demand at that time for its payment, for he answered his uncle in a jocular manner: \u2018 May be the Rebs may present it to you.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-4\">\u201c Pakson, J., in McKinney v. Snyder, 497, remarks: \u2018 In the Farmers\u2019 and Mechanics\u2019 Bank v. Wilson, 10 Watts, 261, it was held that an acknowledgment, such as will avoid the operation of the statute limiting the time within which an action may be brought for the recovery of lands, must be made to the owner, or his agent known as such.\u2019 Says Huston, J.: \u2018 No loose conversations, \u00f1o inferences from what was said many years ago, no expressions to neighbors or strangers to the title, will deprive a man of the protection of this most beneficial statute.\u2019 We may well apply by analogy this vigorous language to the present case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>\u201c\u2022 If Mr. Stevens, a month or two before his death, had promised to pay the said promissory note to Thaddeus Stevens, Jr., with knowledge that he was administrator of the estate of Alanson J. Stevens, deceased, and that he held the said promissory note, or had made an acknowledgment consistent with a promise to pay, and from which the legal inference of a promise to pay would be made under circumstances which indicated an actual intention to pay the debt; even if such were the facts of the case, the statute of limitation would be a complete bar to recovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-4\">\u201c Hon. Thaddeus Stevens died Aug. 12, 1868, and letters testamentary were issued to his executors, Sept. 21, 1868. Thaddeus Stevens, Jr., who was administrator of the estate of Alanson J. Stevens, deceased, and who held the said promissory note as such administrator, died Nov. 1, 1874, more than six years after said letters testamentary were issued, without demanding payment. The statute had its full operation at the time of the death of Thaddeus Stevens, Jr. The attention of the executors of the will of Hon. Thaddeus Stevens, deceased, was not called to the existence of the said promissory note until the year 1884. J. M. Wiestling administered upon the estate of Alanson J. Stevens, deceased, on the 18th day of December, 1885, and formally presented the claim on the said promissory note at a meeting of the auditors, held June 24, 1887. At this last mentioned date, nearly nineteen years had elapsed since the death of Hon. Thaddeus Stevens. No evidence, showing a respite in the running of the statute, was produced. At the audit held in 1875\u2014the auditors\u2019 report being presented Dec. 24, 1875\u2014no claim was made upon the said promissory note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-5\">\u201c In Yorks\u2019s Appeal, 110 Pa. 69, it is held, Paxson, J., delivering the opinion of the court, \u2018 that the orphans\u2019 court has the power in a proper case to apply the statute by way of analogy, and that where no claim is made upon the executors for six years after the time they have taken out their letters testamentary, it is entirely proper to apply it.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-6\">\u201c The effort to show that Thaddeus Stevens held the fund as trustee is ineffectual. If Simon Stevens reports Mr. Stevens correctly as saying that he \u2018 held the money in a fiduciary capacity,\u2019 Mr. Stevens must have used the phrase in some fig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>urative, and not in a legal sense. He was not an executor, administrator, guardian or trustee by testamentary or official appointment, or under any technical and continuing trust, which is not cognizable at law, but which falls within the peculiar and exclusive jurisdiction of chancery : Yorks\u2019s Appeal, 110 Pa. 79.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-3\">\u201c On July 12, 1858, a relation of debtor and creditor was established between Thaddeus Stevens and Alanson J.

Justice Williams,</author>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">This appeal presents but one question. The facts upon which it is raised are free from difficulty. Alanson Stevens was the son of Morrill Stevens of Vermont, who was a brother of the late Hon. Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania. After the death of his brother in Vermont, Thaddeus Stevens brought his two sons to Pennsylvania and treated them with the same kindness and liberality that he would have been expected to show them if they had been his own sons. Their interests in their father\u2019s estate had remained in the hands of their guardian in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>their native state until after they came of age, when they executed a power of attorney to their uncle to settle with their guardian and receipt for the money due them. By virtue of this power of attorney Thaddeus Stevens received two thousand four hundred and sixty-one dollars belonging to Alanson. The power of attorney bore date on June 30, 1858. On the 12th of July following the decedent settled with Alanson and gave him his note for two thousand four hundred dollars of the money he had received from Kittridge, the guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">This terminated the relation of principal and agent, or attorney and client, and established that of debtor and creditor. In the meantime Alanson had been made the agent of his uncle, and was employed at a salary as superintendent of the Caledonia Iron Works located in Franklin county. In 1859 he married, but continued to reside at, and take charge of, the Iron Works. In 1861 or 1862 he enlisted in the army of the Union, in the artillery branch of the service, with a battery he had been instrumental in organizing. In 1863, while in the discharge of his duty, he was killed at the battle of Chickamauga. After his death his brother found the note of Thaddeus Stevens for twenty-four hundred dollars among other papers in his army trunk. This brother became the administrator of Alanson Stevens\u2019s estate, which he settled; but he never made any use of, or claim upon, the note, and did not treat it as part of his brother\u2019s assets. He held it for about eleven years, and died in 1874. His estate was administered by R. W. Shenk, who found the note among his papers, took possession of it, and placed it in the hands of William Lea-man, Esq., who retained it after Shenk\u2019s death in 1880. In 1886 Wiestling, the appellant, who had been appointed administrator de bonis non of Alanson Stevens for this purpose, obtained possession of it and demanded payment from the executors of Thaddeus Stevens, the maker. The note was given in July, 1858, payable on demand. The maker died in 1868. No demand or claim of any sort was made upon him in his lifetime, and no paj^ment upon or acknowledgment of it was ever made by him. The payee held the note for over five years before his death. His administrator held it for more than eleven years. Shenk and Leaman held it for twelve years more. Twenty-eight years after its date the first demand is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>made for payment, and that comes after the death of all the parties who were in a position to know about the transaction or to explain its nonpresentment. Under such circumstances the statute of limitations is a conclusive answer to the appellant\u2019s demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">But it is urged that the statute ought not to apply because the maker of the note was a trustee for the payee. We are unable to find any evidence of the existence of a trust relation. Kittridge, the guardian, was a trustee, but his ward had grown out of his minority and called upon him, by his attorney in fact, for settlement. After the settlement with his guardian he next settled with his attorney in fact, received sixty-one dollars in cash, and a note payable on demand for twenty-four hundred dollars in full for the money received by him. The relation of guardian and ward was terminated by the act of the agent of Alanson Stevens. The relation of principal and agent was then closed by his own act in making settlement in full with his agent. The note created a new relation, that of debtor and creditor, and, so far as the evidence enables us to judge, that was the only relation thereafter existing between them. One witness testifies that the decedent once spoke of the note as representing money held by him in a fiduciary character. If this was so, it is clear that the word fiduciary must have been used in a popular and not in a legal sense, for there is no single fact in the case that points to the existence of any trust relation between the maker and the payee of the note. Rupp\u2019s Appeal, 100 Pa. 537, and kindred authorities are not applicable on the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The decree appealed from was properly entered and is now affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
