A mule drawing a train of empty pit cars ran away, and the cars jumping the track, crushed plaintiff\u2019s leg against a rib of coal. Plaintiff claimed that defendants were negligent in permitting the mule to be used in the mine with knowledge that it was wild and vicious, with a propensity to run away. Defendants claimed that the mule was not vicious, and if it was they'had no knowledge of it; that plaintiff was not acting within the scope of his employment when he was injured; and that defendants, in compliance with the mining act of June 30, 1885, P. L. 205, had placed the en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>tire charge of the inside operation of the mine in the hands of a competent boss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-5\">Defendants\u2019 points were among others as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-6\">\u201c1.
