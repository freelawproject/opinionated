He continued in good standing up until the time of his accident. One stipulation of this contract is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-7\">\u201c And I agree that the acceptance of benefits from the said relief fund for injury or death shall operate as a release of all claims for damages against said company arising from such injury or death, which could be made by or through me, and that I or my legal representatives will execute such further instruments as may be necessary formally to evidence such acquittance.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-8\">On April 16,1890, plaintiff received his first payment from the relief department, amounting to $12.00, by reason of his injuries received on March 19th, prior. On May 12th, following, he received a payment of $30.00, and each month thereafter received payment at the rate of one dollar per day until April 7, 1891, at which time the amount of benefits was reduced to one half dollar per day, and he thereafter continued to receive from the said relief department payments at the rate of one half dollar per day until Jan. 18, 1892.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-9\">Plaintiff brought this action Dec. 22, 1891.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-10\">Defendant\u2019s points were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-11\">\u201c1.

R. R. Co., 163 Pa. 127. The essential principle therein established is that a contract between employer and employee which preserves to the latter all his rights of action, in case of negligence, until after the facts have occurred and are known to him, is not against public policy. \u201c There is no waiver of any right of action that the person injured may thereafter be entitled to. It is not the signing of the contract but the acceptance of benefits after the accident that constitutes the release. The injured party therefore is not stipulating for the future, but settling for the past; he is not agreeing to exempt the company from liability for negligence, but accepting compensation for an injury already caused thereby.\u201d Id. 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The facts of that case and this are not materially different. In both the agreement is that the acceptance of benefits, of course after the accident, shall operate as a release. In the present case there is an additional agreement that the plaintiff shall \u201c execute such further instrument as may be necessary formally to evidence such acquittance,\u201d and it is argued that no such release has been executed by plaintiff. But it is not necessary that -it should be. The acceptance of benefits is the substance of the release, and the agreement for a further instrument is by its express terms a mere formality for convenience of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">It is further argued that as the contract is between the relief association and the plaintiff and no evidence that the railroad company defendant has in fact paid anything into the treasury of the association there is no consideration to support a release to the railroad company. It is not however worth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>while to discuss whether the defendant is in position to take advantage of a consideration moving from another party but for its benefit, as the consideration from the defendant itself is abundant. As a member of the association it has assumed obligations to take charge of the administration, and to pay all the operating expenses, to take care of the funds and to be responsible for their safe keeping, to guarantee the obligations of the association, and to make appropriations to supply any deficiencies. These would be ample even if the amount of the consideration could be inquired into.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The release being a complete bar to plaintiff\u2019s right of action it is not necessary to consider the evidence of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">As a matter of practice it may be well to notice an irregularity in the form of the judgment. A point reserved is an authority to the court to enter judgment for the defendant non obstante veredicto. There can be no reservation in favor of the plaintiff, the verdict must be for him, with authority to enter judgment for the defendant against the verdict. Robinson v. Myers, 67 Pa. 9; State Bank v. McCoy, 69 Pa. 204; Morris v. Ziegler, 71 Pa. 450; Glading v. Frick, 88 Pa. 460; Hosler v. Hursh, 151 Pa. 415. If that authority is not exercised the reservation drops out of the ease altogether, and judgment is entered for plaintiff not on the point reserved but on the verdict, as if there had been no reservation at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">Judgment reversed and judgment entered for defendant on the point reserved.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
