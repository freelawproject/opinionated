Sec. 1 of rule 14 of the Board of Trade provides as follows: \u2018 A member of the association may act as a broker only between other members.

To pay this \u00a72,700, and to provide a margin for future deals, F. G. Kammerer &amp; Co. took from Wm. F. Smith a note for \u00a76,500, at 60 days, payable to F. G. Kammerer &amp; Co., with warrant of attorney authorizing the confession of judgment for that sum by an attorney in any court of record, in favor of the holder of the note. At the same time, and to secure the payment of this note, he took from Wm. F. Smith an assignment, first, of a mortgage given byr Wm. Lippencott on a tract of land in Greene county, Pennsylvania, and ten' accompanying notes for about \u00a74,500 ; second, of a judgment note of Adamson and \u2022Hoge for \u00a72,100. The proceeds of this \u00a76,500 note was credited to Smith\u2019s account. On Feb. 2,1887, he paid \u00a7500 on the note, and on Feb. 10,1887, he paid \u00a71,000. On or about March 1, 1887, he stopped dealing with F. G. Kammerer <em>&amp; </em>Co., and they had a final settlement and adjustment of their accounts, which showed that F. G. Kammerer &amp; Co. owed Smith \u00a7487.50; this amount was, on March 8, 1887, credited on the \u00a76,500 note to which we\u2019have referred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-6\">. \u201c (&lt;?)

F. Smith, being in pari delicto with F. G. Kammerer (if the note and assignments were given in a grain gambling transaction), and the contract, so far as the assignment of the mortgage-was concerned, being executed, had no standing in a court of equity. The court'concurred in the recommendation of the master; and decreed the dismissal of the bill. On appeal the Supreme Court affirmed this decree : Smith v.

F. Smith'was examined in his own behalf and testified that he had a contract with Kammerer that he was to trade on margins and was not to take \u2018 the stuff itself; \u2019 that he told him that he did not want to receive or handle any grain, but wished to deal in the differences, the fluctuations of the market, to buy \u2018 risks and margins ; \u2019 that Kammerer said he- would fix that, and that t'hat was the- proper way to. speculate. He says- that he \u2018 told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Hammerer that he did not have enough of money to pay for any quantity of wheat but that he would put up money as margins only.\u2019 He says this is the contract he had with Hammerer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-4\">F. G. Hammerer was examined and positively denied such a contract. He says that he, as Smith\u2019s agent, bought wheat, corn and pork on the Board of Trade, as Smith ordered it bought, that his contract with those from whom he bought, under the rules of the board, was such that the delivery of every bushel and barrel of it was contemplated and could have been demanded when the time for delivery arrived; that all his purchases were for future delivery and that there was no option in the contracts he made except that relating to the time of delivery;\u2014for instance, the seller of May wheat had all the mouth of May in which to deliver it. He said, further, that it is true that no wheat was ever actually delivered, on his purchases, to Smith, because Smith ordered him to sell it before the time of delivery came around. He says that for his purchases and sales he made daily settlements in accordance with the rules of the board, and that none of his transactions on behalf of Smith were in violation of the statutes of Illinois. He testified further that Smith had been furnished a printed copy of the rules and regulations of the Board of Trade and was familiar with the manner of doing business under these rules; that, before the note in question was given, he had been present when some of his deals were made, and gave personal direction in regard to the same; that he knew of the right of brokers to make daily settlement by setting off their purchases against sales and accounting for the differences.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-5\">\u201c [A number of attorneys and business men of Chicago testified that under Hammerer\u2019s statement of the character of his deals for,and with Smith, there was no violation of the rules of the board or the law of Illinois.

C. Champlin when the note is payable to F. G. Hammerer &amp; Co. (2) That the note in question-was given to pay Smith\u2019s losses in a gambling contract, which was against public morals and in violation of the statutes of; Illinois.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>\u201c(5) The respondent claims (1) that the Board of Trade is incorporated under the law of Illinois, that its rules and regulations are in conformity thereto and that his dealings with Smith were bona fide purchases and sales as his agent, of wheat, corn and pork, for future delivery; (2) that the question here in controversy is res adjudicata, and (3) that the petitioner cannot successfully invoke the aid of a court of equity by setting up an illegal act to which he was a party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-5\">\u201cCONCLUSION ON THE FACTS AND THE LAW.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-6\">\u201c [We are of the opinion, and so find, that the deals and settlements made by F. G. Kammerer &amp; Co. (under the orders of Wm. F. Smith) with other members of the Board of Trade for the purchase and sale of wheat, corn and pork, were made in accordance with the rules and regulations of the board, and were not illegal under the law of Illinois: Perm v. Parker, 126 111. 203; Samuel v. Oliver, 13\u00d3 111. 79; Pixley v. Boynton, 79 111. 352; Corbett v. Underwood, 83 111. 326; Wolcott v. Heath, 78 111. 436; Peters v. Grim, 149 Pa. 163; Smith v. Bouvier, 70 Pa. 330; Oldershaw v. Knole, 4 Bradwell, (111. Ap.) 63.] [5, 6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-7\">\u201cWe are of opinion, and find, that, notwithstanding this fact, F. G. Kammerer and Win. F. Smith could have had a contract between themselves that would be illegal. If F. G. Kammex\u2019er agreed with Wm. F. Smith that he would not x-eveal his name on the Boax\u2019d of Trade, but would himself stand as principal in the deals he there made with his fellow brokex\u2019s and would assume all responsibility as to the delivery of the grain, etc., but would allow Smith to have the benefit of the deals he ordered without being bound to receive or deliver any wheat, com or pork, and agreed to pay him all the gains he made oxx sales provided Smith would pay him his commissioxis and make good all losses on sales, and would keep deposited with him sufficient maxgins to protect him against the losses,, then the contract between Kammerer and Smith would be a gambling contract. In such a case Smith would not be ixxtex-ested in the contract of purchases and sales made by Kaxnmerer on the board but would be only interested in the rise or fall of th'e maiket between the time of purchase and sale. The stipulation betweeix them would simply be that Smith would gain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>if the wheat' Kammerer bought from a broker should be sold by Kammerer to some other broker at a higher price, and would \u2022lose if sold for a lower price. In other words, Smith would be betting with Kammerer that purchases and sales that he made with other brokers on the board, at his direction, would be profitable; if Smith won, he took the profits, less Kammerer\u2019s commission; if he lost, he paid Kammerer the loss and commissions. In such a case Kammerer would be dealing with Smith as a principal, and not as his agent: Schneider v. Turner, 130 111. 28; Pearce v. Foote, 113 111. 228; Tenney v. Foote, 4 Bradwell, 594; Fareira v. Gabell, 89 Pa. 89; North v. Phillips, 89 Pa. 250; Brua\u2019s Ap., 55 Pa. 294; Gaw v. Bennett, 153 Pa. 247.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-5\">\u201c(e) We are of opinion, and so find, that if the contract between Smith and Kammerer was of the character that Smith testifies it was, then it was a gambling contract and illegal, and the note upon which judgment was entered in this case was void for want of a legal consideration, notwithstanding Kammerer\u2019s contracts of purchases and sales on the Board of Trade with other brokers were legal; but if Kammerer was not acting under an independent contract such as Smith sets up, wherein they were both principals, but was acting only as Smith\u2019s agent in making bona fide purchases and sales on the \u2022Board of Trade, such as we have found he did make, then the contract between them would not be illegal, and the note in question would not be void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-6\">\u25a0 ' \u201c [ (d) This brings us to the point where we must determine between the credibility of the two principal witnesses, or rather determine whether the petitioner, in the face of the denial of the respondent, has made out such a case as entitles him to equitable relief. Kammerer\u2019s story is consistent with and upholds the legality of the transaction in which he was engaged. Smith\u2019s story brands the transaction in which he was a party as illegal, and necessarily puts him in a position where he must plead his own turpitude. The undisputed facts in the case are as consistent with Kammerer\u2019s stoiy as they are with Smith\u2019s, 'and on the whole testimony we are of opinion that the petitioner has not supported his petition, its material averments being denied by the respondent, with sufficient proof to warrant the court in opening-the judgment and sending the case to a jury-] [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>\u201c (e) We are of opinion that the question here involved is not res adjudieata. The plaintiff\u2019s bill in the equity case, Smith v. Kammerer, 152 Pa. 98, was dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-5\">\u201c (/) Although we are not fully satisfied that the maxim \u2018 No man shall plead his own iniquity in order to obtain equity,\u2019 applies to a case of this kind where a question of public interest is involved, still that fact should have its weight in passing on the petitioner\u2019s prayer for relief. Griffith\u2019s Appeal, 16 W. N. 249, is the only case we have been able to find where a judgment entered on a note given in a wagering contract was opened and the defendant let into a defence. In Ruchizky v. De Haven, 97 Pa. 210, and Stewart v. Parnell, 147 Pa. 527, are dicta which appear to be on the other side of the question. See also Marriam v. Grain and Stock Exchange, 1 Pa.

All the questions involved in the assignments of error have been so fully considered and satisfactorily disposed of by the learned president of the common pleas that little if anything can be profitably added to what is contained in his opinion sent up with the record. On that opinion the-decree discharging the rule to show cause why the judgment-should not be opened and the defendant let into a defence, etc., is affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
