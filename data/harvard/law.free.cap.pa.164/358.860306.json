Plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that the abutment of the bridge on defendant\u2019s side of the Loyalhanna creek was approached by a curve which descended by a considerable grade to the bridge. There was no guard-rail or wall on the lower side of the bridge. There was evidence that the bridge had been in this condition for some time prior to the accident. Plaintiff, in describing the accident, said: \u201c Just when we got over the bridge, barely across the bridge, the horse suddenly shied and just plunged, himself over the abutment.\u201d Steele Mechesney testified: Well, as we drove off through the bridge, as soon as the horse got off the plank of the bridge he frightened at something, and jumped over the side of the abutment.\u201d.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-5\">Plaintiff testified that the bridge was a dangerous one, but qualified this by saying that he meant it was dangerous for persons crossing it into Latrobe.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-6\">It appeared from the evidence that there was another road which plaintiff might have taken to reach his destination, but the evidence as to which of the two roads was\" the safer was conflicting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-7\">The court refused binding instructions for defendant and left the question of defendant\u2019s negligence and plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-8\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $1,770.83.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-9\"><em>JSrrors assigned </em>were above instructions, quoting them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b383-10\"><em>Albert H. </em>Bell, <em>Gr.

In view of the testimony tending to prove negligence of defendant, contributory negligence of the plaintiff, eto., the case involved questions of fact which it was the exclusive province of the jury to determine; and it was submitted to them, by the learned president of the 16th judicial district, who specially presided at the trial, in a clear and comprehensive charge in which there appears to be no substantial error. It would subserve no useful purpose to notice the specifications seriatim. An examination of the record has satisfied us that neither of' them should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
