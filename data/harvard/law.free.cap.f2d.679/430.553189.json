JOHNSON, and GARWOOD, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b527-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">In its petition for rehearing, Louisiana Power &amp; Light Company (LP&amp;L) refers this Court to the opinions in the case of <em>Klohn v. Louisiana Power &amp; Light, </em>406 So.2d 577 (La.1981), 394 So.2d 636 (La.App. 1st Cir. 1980). LP&amp;L argues that <em>Klohn </em>establishes a different test for a statutory employer than the one expressed in <em>Blanchard v. Engine &amp; Gas Compressor Services, Inc., </em>613 F.2d 65 (5th Cir. 1980). The <em>Klohn </em>approach, according to LP&amp;L, \u201celiminates the unduly restrictive and inherently fallacious premise of the \u2018usual and customary practice\u2019 test that to be part of one\u2019s trade, business or occupation, the activity must regularly recur.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">However, nothing in <em>Blanchard </em>or in our prior opinion, 671 F.2d 865 (5th Cir. 1982) (per curiam), requires that the activity regularly recur to be part of the usual or customary practice of the principal or others in the same operational business. While <em>ordinary </em>maintenance and repairs are part of an employer\u2019s regular trade, business, or occupation, the usual or customary practice of the principal is not restricted to such maintenance and repairs but embraces every activity that is an integral and necessary part of the principal\u2019s regular business.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">The <em>Klohn </em>opinions do not address the test for determining whether an activity is part of an employer\u2019s regular trade, business, or occupation. As a result, <em>Klohn </em>does not discredit or eliminate the <em>Blanchard </em>test. <em>Klohn </em>implicitly holds that, because plaintiff\u2019s work in that particular case involved ordinary maintenance and repairs, his activity was an integral and necessary part of the regular trade, business, or occupation of defendant. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>however, LP&amp;L has failed to negate the possibility of a fact issue regarding the question of whether Brown &amp; Root\u2019s work, which entailed conversion of the boiler system, went beyond ordinary maintenance or repair and, therefore, was outside LP&amp;L\u2019s usual or customary practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">Consequently, the district court erred in directing a verdict on the issue of whether LP&amp;L was a statutory employer of plaintiff. <em>See Boeing Company v. Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365, 374 (5th Cir. 1969) (en banc). The petition for rehearing is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
