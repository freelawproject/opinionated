RUBIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b182-13\">Gulf Water Benefaction Co., through Robert E. Pine, seeks to remove from state to federal court its state criminal prosecution for violation of Texas water pollution laws. The district court dismissed the petition for removal because it does not allege a race-based civil rights violation. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-14\">Ordinarily, an order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). However, an exception is made for an order remanding to state court a case removed, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443, on the ground of an alleged civil rights violation. Such a decision is appealable. <em>Id.; see Johnson v. Mississippi, </em>421 U.S. 213, 219, 95 S.Ct. 1591, 1595, 44 L.Ed.2d 121, 128 (1975); <em>Robertson v. Ball, </em>534 F.2d 63, 66 (5th Cir. 1976) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-16\">Gulf Water\u2019s petition for removal is not silent, as Texas contends, concerning an alleged violation of a civil right. The removal petition contends that Gulf Water was \u201crepeatedly subjected to deprivation of its Constitutionaipy] guaranteed Civil Rights....\u201d The district court construed this as invoking 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443 even though Gulf Water did not cite \u00a7 1443 in its petition. Therefore, we have jurisdiction to consider the appeal. We turn to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-17\">Gulf Water had the burden of establishing its right to removal. <em>Albonetti v. GAF Corporation-Chemical Group, </em>520 F.Supp. 825, 827 (S.D.Tex.1981). To gain removal to federal court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443, the defendant must show both that (1) the right allegedly denied it arises under a federal law providing for specific rights <em>stated in terms of racial equality; </em>and (2) the removal petitioner is denied or cannot enforce the specified federal rights in the state courts due to some formal expression of state law. <em>Johnson v. Mississippi, supra, </em>421 U.S. at 219, 95 S.Ct. at 1595, 44 L.Ed.2d at 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-18\">Gulf Water\u2019s removal petition fails to meet either test. Instead, the removal petition merely complains in a conclusory way of deprivations of certain of its non-race-related civil rights, including freedom of speech, freedom of association, and due process of law. Furthermore, its brief likewise fails to show how Gulf Water has met these tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-19\">The district court correctly concluded that Gulf Water\u2019s petition failed to give adequate grounds to invoke removal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443 and that an exami<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>nation of the face of the petition showed that removal should not be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Texas seeks costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, pursuant to Fed.R.App.P. 38,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because of the frivolous nature of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">In <em>Robertson v. Ball, supra, </em>we discussed the relationship between the general prohibition in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) against any review of remands and its exception for remands of removals effected under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">The exception in \u00a7 1447(d)\u2019s prohibition of appellate review for remands of removals effected under \u00a7 1443, taken with the power vested in the state court defendant to effect removal solely on his own motion, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(e), might seem to provide a significant loophole which could undermine the general policy of \u00a7 1447(d). That policy might be stated thusly: once the federal district court considers the proper factors and decides to remand, the action should go forward in state court without the further delay of appeal, and without regard to whether the federal district court was correct or incorrect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">The \u00a7 1447(d) exception, of course, represents another strong policy: removed actions in which federal rights that are based on laws relating to racial equality cannot be adequately protected in state courts should not be remanded to those state courts, and district court orders effecting such remands should be subject to appellate review on the merits. <em>To insure that the \u00a7 1443 exception to \u00a7 1447(d) not be used as a dilatory tactic by recalcitrant state court defendants, we can only suggest that this Court will look with favor upon a summary motion to dismiss, as </em>frivolous,[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] <em>an appeal from a remand when the removal purportedly based on \u00a7 1443 does not even colorably fall within the strict tests set out in Johnson </em>[v. Mississippi, supra]....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-12\"><em>Robertson, supra, </em>534 F.2d at 66 n.5 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">Texas filed a motion seeking to have Gulf Water\u2019s appeal dismissed only on the basis of a lack of jurisdiction. As we have noted, we do not lack jurisdiction of the appeal. But, even though Texas did not move to dismiss the appeal as frivolous, and we dispose of Gulf Water\u2019s appeal \u201con the merits,\u201d the fact is that it patently has no merit. The removal petition \u201cdoes not even colorably fall within the strict tests [for \u00a7 1443 removals] set out in <em>Johnson </em>.... \u201d Therefore, we allow attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">Gulf Water was not represented by counsel, but by Robert Pine, in his capacity as Gulf Water\u2019s \u201cBankruptcy Trustee, Director, Officer, Next Friend and Intervenor,\u201d <em>pro se. </em>(His removal petition was written out in long-hand pencil.) His original removal petition may be sanctioned as the product of lack of legal sophistication. But his appeal was patently without basis. Neither Pine nor Gulf Water as his client were strangers to this court. <em>See Gulf Water Benefaction Co. v. Public Utility Commission of Texas, </em>674 F.2d 462 (5th Cir. 1982). We believe he had ample reason to know that his appeal lacked merit and that it was merely tendentious.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>For these reasons, the judgment of remand is AFFIRMED, and, being in a position adequately to assess the legal services rendered by Texas\u2019s counsel, we award Texas $2,500 as attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-8\">. Rule 38, \u201cDamages for Delay,\u201d provides</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">If a court of appeals shall determine that an appeal is frivolous, it may award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">Fed.R.App.P. 38. Moreover, the Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap\">[wjhile both the statute and the usual rule on the subject by courts of appeal [the Fifth Circuit has no rule precisely on point] speak of \u201cdamages for delay\u201d the courts of appeal quite properly allow damages, <em>attorney\u2019s fees and other expenses </em>incurred by an appellee if the appeal is frivolous without requiring a showing that the appeal resulted in delay. <em>See Dunscombe v. Sayle, </em>340 F.2d 311 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 814, 86 S.Ct. 32, 15 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965) ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap2\">Notes of Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules accompanying Rule 38 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b183-17\">.
