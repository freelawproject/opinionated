Plaintiff Arthur J. McBride\u2019s complaint alleges that Indiana law enforcement officers Gary Soos and Lamar Haney illegally extradited McBride from Missouri to Indiana in violation of the fourth and fourteenth amendments. The district court dismissed McBride\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. On appeal we held that a complaint alleging noncompliance with applicable extradition law states a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. We reversed the district court judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with our opinion. <em>McBride v. Soos, </em>594 F.2d 610 (7th Cir. 1979). Following a bench trial on remand, the district court entered judgment for defendants Soos and Haney. <em>McBride v. Soos, </em>512 F.Supp. 1207 (N.D.Ind.1981). McBride appeals and defendants cross-appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-5\">After we remanded this cause in 1979, Soos and Haney amended their answer to plead the affirmative defense of good faith. McBride filed a rule 38(b), Fed.R.Civ.P.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> motion for a jury trial on the good faith issue and a rule 39(b), Fed.R.Civ.P.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> motion for a jury trial on all other issues. Rule 38(b) provides that a party must make a demand for a jury trial on an issue triable of right to a jury within ten days after the last pleading directed to the issue. In the case of an amended pleading the ten day limit is revived for any factual issue raised for the first time in the amendment. <em>Hostrop v. Board of Junior College District No. 515, </em>523 F.2d 569, 581 (7th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 963, 96 S.Ct. 1748, 48 L.Ed.2d 208 (1976). Rule 39(b) authorizes the district court to grant a jury trial even if the jury demand is untimely. McBride claimed that defendants\u2019 amended answer raised good faith for the first time, and, thus, he was entitled to a jury trial on that issue as a matter of right. He requested the court to exercise its rule 39(b) discretion and grant a jury trial on all the other issues as well. The district court held that the amended answer did not raise a new issue because defendants\u2019 good faith had already been raised by plaintiff\u2019s request for punitive damages. The court denied both motions, and the case proceeded to trial before the Honorable Allen Sharp.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-6\">The evidence adduced at trial showed that Missouri authorities acting on authority of an outstanding Indiana warrant charging McBride with robbery by fear arrested McBride in St. Louis on December 6, 1974. On December 7,1974, McBride refused to waive extradition and return to Indiana voluntarily. He remained incarcerated in Missouri until he was extradited on January 5, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-12\">On December 11, 1974, an Indiana grand jury indicted McBride on charges of robbery by fear and murder. The Indiana authorities then issued a warrant charging McBride with murder. On December 12, 1974, a Missouri magistrate issued a fugitive warrant for McBride\u2019s arrest pursuant to the Indiana charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-13\">On January 7,1975, the Indiana Governor issued an extradition warrant for McBride. The warrant authorized Indiana law enforcement officers Edward N. Robinson and R. Terry Snyder to receive McBride from the Missouri authorities for return to Indiana. After examining the Indiana extradition warrant, the Missouri Governor issued a Governor\u2019s Warrant on January 16, 1975, authorizing McBride\u2019s arrest and extradition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-14\">On January 24, 1975, Soos and Haney were assigned to travel to Missouri to retrieve McBride. Defendants\u2019 superiors informed them that McBride had waived extradition. When the defendants arrived in Missouri, the Missouri authorities also told them that McBride had waived extradition. Soos and Haney returned McBride to Indiana on January 25, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-15\">The gravamen of McBride\u2019s claim against the defendants is that they deprived him of due process by extraditing him to Indiana without first complying with all the requirements of the Missouri extradition laws. McBride\u2019s case consisted of evidence (1) that he was not afforded a post-arrest hearing \u201cwith all practicable speed\u201d as required by Mo.Ann.Stat. \u00a7 548.141,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (2) that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>the December 12, 1974 Missouri fugitive warrant failed to specify a definite period of commitment less than thirty days as required by Mo.Ann.Stat. \u00a7 548.151,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (3) that he was not afforded a pre-extradition hearing as required by Mo.Ann.Stat. \u00a7 548.101.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendants moved for a directed verdict at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case. The district court denied the motion, whereupon the defendants presented their defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-4\">At the close of trial, Judge Sharp reserved judgment and requested that the parties file post-trial briefs. Before Judge Sharp entered any findings of fact or conclusions of law, McBride filed a motion requesting that Judge Sharp recuse himself. Judge Sharp granted the motion, and the parties agreed to submit the case to the Honorable Robert Grant for a decision based on the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-5\">The district court entered judgment in favor of defendants. The court found that the violations of Mo.Ann.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 548.141 &amp; 548.151 occurred weeks before defendants were even assigned to travel to Missouri to retrieve McBride. The court further found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1322-6\">[t]he responsibility and duty to comply with these specific Missouri statutes rested entirely and exclusively with Missouri law enforcement officials. Defendants had no relationship to or involvement with the alleged failure to have taken McBride before a judge or magistrate with \u201call practicable speed\u201d following his warrantless arrest, the failure of the judge to specify a defined period of commitment in the fugitive warrant or the failure of Missouri authorities to have a judge formerly recommit McBride after expiration of the initial 30 day maximum term.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1322-12\">512 F.Supp. at 1211. The court held that Soos and Haney could not be held liable for the alleged violation of \u00a7\u00a7 548.141 &amp; 548.-151 because they neither caused nor participated in the violation of the Missouri statutory provisions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1322-13\">The court, however, did find that defendants were personally involved in causing the violation of Mo.Ann.Stat. \u00a7 548.101. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1322-14\">This Court agrees with the defendants\u2019 basic premise that compliance with \u00a7 548.101 is the primary duty of Missouri law enforcement authorities .... But there existed a separate and independent duty with the defendants to ensure that McBride received the statutory protections available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1322-15\">512 F.Supp. at 1211. Defendants\u2019 failure to ensure that the statutory hearing had been held caused McBride\u2019s deprivation in part. The court, however, did not impose liability against defendants because it found that they acted in good faith. <em>Id. </em>at 1213. The court held, in the alternative, that even if the defendants did not act in good faith, McBride failed to prove any actual damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>On appeal McBride claims that the district court erred in denying his requests for a jury trial. He also claims that the court erred in finding that defendants acted in good faith and that he failed to prove damages. Defendants\u2019 cross-appeal alleges that the court erred in holding that the agents from the demanding state have a duty to ensure that the asylum state authorities have complied with the asylum state\u2019s statutory extradition procedures.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1323-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-6\">A defendant cannot be held liable in a \u00a7 1983 action unless he caused or participated in the alleged constitutional deprivation. <em>Adams v. Pate, </em>445 F.2d 105, 107 (7th Cir. 1971). <em>Accord, Duncan v. Duckworth, </em>644 F.2d 653 (7th Cir. 1981); <em>Fulton Market Cold Storage Co. v. Cullerton, </em>582 F.2d 1071 (7th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1121, 99 S.Ct. 1033, 59 L.Ed.2d 82 (1979). We agree with the district court that Soos and Haney were not personally involved in causing the violations of Mo. Ann.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 548.141 &amp; 548.151 and, thus, could not be held liable for these deprivations. We think the court erred, however, in finding that defendants were personally involved in the violation of Mo.Ann.Stat. \u00a7 548.101. Section 548.101 requires the Missouri authorities to hold a judicial hearing before delivering the fugitive to the demanding state,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but imposes no duty on the demanding state agents to ensure that this pre-extradition hearing is held. It is unreasonable to require the demanding state agents to be familiar with the procedural safeguards enacted in the asylum state\u2019s extradition statutes and then further require them to ensure that the statutory safeguards have been followed. Defendants neither caused nor participated in the failure to hold a \u00a7 548.101 pre-extradition hearing. Therefore, they cannot be held liable for this deprivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-10\">In reaching our decision we have been guided by a recent Eighth Circuit opinion in an analogous case. In <em>Brown v. Nutsch, </em>619 F.2d 758, 765 (8th Cir. 1980), the court held that a complaint alleging that state extradition laws were violated states a cause of action under \u00a7 1983. The court further held, however, that the plaintiff failed to state a cause of action against the named defendants because the defendants, the demanding state agents, had not violated any extradition laws. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants deprived him of due process (1) by failing to determine the validity and authenticity of the papers requesting and granting extradition, (2) by failing to determine that he was actually the person named in the extradition papers, and (3) by failing to determine that he was a fugitive from justice. The court held that because \u201c[t]he police officers of the demanding state, carrying out a facially valid extradition, have no duty\u201d to ensure that the extradition papers are in order and that the individual returned is actually the fugitive named in the papers, the defendants could not be held personally liable. <em>Id. </em>at 765. Any cause of action Brown might have is against those who bore the statutory duty to ensure that the extradition papers were in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-11\">Like the defendants in <em>Brown, </em>Soos and Haney had no duty to determine that the Missouri authorities followed Missouri extradition law. Soos and Haney did all that they were statutorily required to do before accepting custody of McBride from the Missouri authorities and returning him to Indiana. Soos and Haney neither caused nor participated in McBride\u2019s deprivation, and, therefore, McBride has no cause of action against them. <em>Accord, Potter v. Clark, </em>497 F.2d 1206 (7th Cir. 1974).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>McBride failed to prove a cause of action against Soos and Haney, the district court should have granted defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict at the close of McBride\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-5\">McBride claims that the court erred in denying his rule 38(b) motion for a jury trial and requests that we reverse and remand this case for a jury trial on the issue of good faith.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Defendants claim that McBride waived his right to a jury trial by stipulating to submit the case to Judge Grant for a decision based on the transcript. Rule 39(a)(1), Fed.R.Civ.P.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1324-6\">Even if we were to assume that the district court erred in denying McBride\u2019s rule 38(b) motion, any error was harmless. Because McBride failed to prove a cause of action against Soos and Haney, the district court should have granted defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case. Therefore, even if a jury had been empaneled, it should not have been permitted to decide McBride\u2019s claim. Because any error that occurred was harmless, we need not reach the merits of McBride\u2019s claim on this issue.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1324-7\">The judgment from which McBride appeals and defendants cross-appeal is</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1320-20\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1321-7\">.

Such demand may be indorsed upon a pleading of the party.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1321-9\">. The court denied McBride\u2019s rule 39(b) motion because defendants would be prejudiced by a grant of jury trial so late in the proceedings. Rule 39(b), Fed.R.Civ.P., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH-\">Issues not demanded for trial by jury as provided in Rule 38 shall be tried by the court; but, notwithstanding the failure of a party to demand a jury in an action in which such a demand might have been made of right, the court in its discretion upon motion may order a trial by jury of any or all issues.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1321-18\">. Section 548.141 provides, in pertinent part, that a person arrested \u201cwithout a warrant upon reasonable information that the accused stands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>charged in the courts of a state [with a felony] ... must be taken before a jury or magistrate with all practicable speed and complaint must be made against him under oath setting forth the ground for the arrest .... \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1322-9\">. Section 548.151 provides, in pertinent part, that if it appears at the \u00a7 548.141 hearing that the arrestee has been charged with the crime alleged and is a fugitive from the demanding state, the judge may issue a warrant authorizing the arrestee\u2019s commitment for a specified time not to exceed 30 days. Section 548.171 authorizes the judge to recommit the arrestee for an additional 60 days if the Governor\u2019s Warrant authorizing extradition has not been issued before the expiration of the first 30 days. McBride was committed a total of 50 days without a \u00a7 548.171 recommitment being ordered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1322-16\">. Section 548.101 provides in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1322-17\">No person arrested upon such warrant shall be delivered over to the agent whom the executive authority demanding him shall have appointed to receive him unless he shall first be taken forthwith before a judge of a court of record in this state, who shall inform him of the demand made for his surrender and of the crime with which he is charged, and that he has the right to demand and procure legal counsel, and if the prisoner or his counsel shall state that he or they desire to test the legality of his arrest, the judge of such court of record shall fix a reasonable time to be allowed him within which to apply for a writ of <em>habeas corpus.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1322-18\">Mo.Ann.Stat. \u00a7 548.101.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1323-7\">. McBride moved to dismiss defendants\u2019 cross-appeal for failure to state an issue. Defendants have stated an issue they desire us to review.

The district court dismissed the complaint. We affirmed, holding that \u201c[p]laintiff cannot be heard to bring an action against defendant for excessive bail.
