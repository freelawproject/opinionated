The appellants, all of whom are foreign nationals, pled guilty to charges of knowingly possessing with the intent to distribute a controlled substance in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 955a(a) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. The issue they raise on appeal is whether the district court had jurisdiction absent an allegation and proof by the government that they intended to affect the United States in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">Recent decisions of this court lead us to conclude without hesitation that \u201claw of the flag\u201d jurisdiction existed in this case. In passing \u00a7 955a, Congress intended to reach extraterritorial acts of possession aboard American ships under that theory of jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Riker, </em>670 F.2d 987 (11th Cir. 1982). Here, the indictment alleged that the vessel in question was \u201ca vessel of the United States,\u201d and the appellants do not contend otherwise. There is a dispute as to whether the vessel was on the high seas or within the territorial waters of the Bahamas, but that issue is irrelevant. \u201cUnder well established principles of international law, the jurisdiction of the United States to prosecute crimes on board ship is concurrent with the jurisdiction of the nation in whose waters the crime occurs.\u201d <em>United States v. Liles, </em>670 F.2d 989, 992 (11th Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"AXu\">The convictions are</p>\n<p id=\"ATj\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
