Evidence, </em>Relevancy. <em>Equity Jurisdiction, </em>Plaintiff must come into court with clean hands.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b296-9\">Where a master, to whom has been referred a suit in equity, by an employer and two employees against the officers and members of a labor union which was a\" rival to a labor union to which the employee plaintiffs belonged, to enjoin the defendants from interfering with the plaintiffs\u2019 business and employment, found that the defendants by means of banners displayed on streets sought to boycott the employer plaintiff\u2019s business because he refused to discharge the employee plaintiffs and employ members of the defendants\u2019 union, the defendants excepted to the report on the ground that the master refused to hear evidence offered by the defendants \u201cthat the plaintiffs, their agents and employees, addressed profane and obscene language and vile epithets in the public streets to the defendants when said defendants were driving by the . . . [plaintiffs\u2019 place of business] . . . in their automobile\u201d displaying the placards objected to. The defendants contended that the evidence should have been admitted because' it would have'tended to show that the conduct of the plaintiffs was such as to show that they were not entitled to equitable relief. <em>Held, </em>that the exception must be overruled, because, in order to make the evidence admissible, the substance at least of the language alleged to have been used should have been stated.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b296-10\">In the same suit it appeared from the master\u2019s report that one of the banners alleged to have been displayed wrongfully bore a legend: \u201cUnion Men Notice: The . . . [plaintiffs\u2019 place of business] ... is Unfair\u201d to the defendants\u2019 organization. The plaintiffs introduced evidence, which was uncontradicted, tending to show that the usual and ordinary meaning and significance of the word \u201cunfair\u201d among labor men was practically the same as that of the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>\u201cscab\u201d among labor men, and the master made such a finding. The defendants excepted. <em>Held, </em>that the exception must be overruled, because the finding, in so far as it was material to any issue involved at the hearing, was warranted by the evidence, which the defendants had introduced no evidence to contradict or control.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b297-5\">The master in the above suit refused to grant a request of the defendants for a statement in his report that at the hearing he found that one of the plaintiffs, while testifying to a material point, committed perjury. The defendants filed an exception to the report based on an objection to such refusal and also moved that the report be recommitted for the inclusion of such a statement. The exception was overruled and the motion was denied. The defendants appealed. The record did not show any such finding by the master at the hearing nor state the testimony alleged to be perjured nor the point alleged to be material. <em>Held, </em>that the exception must be overruled and the appeal dismissed, because there was nothing to show that the refusal of the master to comply with the defendants\u2019 request was prejudicial to any substantial rights of the defendants.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-6\">Bill in equity, filed in the Superior Court on August 9, 1916, by Raymond W.

Material facts found by the master are described in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-8\">The defendants filed exceptions to the report based on the following objections:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-9\">\u201c1. The defendants object to the master\u2019s report in that at the hearing before said master, the defendants offered proof that the plaintiffs, their agent and employees, addressed profane and obscene language and vile epithets in the public streets to the defendants when said defendants were driving by the Apollo Theatre in their automobile as described in said report, and that the master refused to hear such proof and ruled such evidence inadmissible. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-10\">\u201c2. The defendants further object to that portion of the master\u2019s report . . . which reads as follows: \u2018On evidence introduced by the complainants and which was uncontradicted, I find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>that the usual and ordinary meaning and significance of the word \u201cunfair\u201d among labor men is practically the same as that of the word \u201cscab\u201d among labor men.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-5\">\u201c3.

The defendants then moved for a recommittal of the report and that the master \u201cbe ordered to file a supplementary report therein setting forth the fact that he found that one of the plaintiffs committed perjury at the hearing in this case before him and that . . . the evidence relating thereto be included in said supplementary report.\u201d The motion was denied by <em>Lawton, </em>J., and the defendants appealed from such denial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-8\">A final decree then was entered by order of <em>Jenney, </em>J., restraining the defendants and the officers, members, agents and attorneys \u25a0 of their union \u201cfrom interfering and combining or attempting to interfere with the employment by the plaintiffs, Raymond W. Gammon and Theresa Harkins, of the plaintiffs Harry Martin and Leo Wellbrook, by representing or causing to be represented in express or implied terms to said Gammon and said' Harkins, or either of them, that they, the said Gammon and the said Harkins, or either of them, will suffer or are likely to suffer loss or trouble in their business from employing or continuing to employ said Martin and said Wellbrook, or either of them; and from displaying any banners, signs or cards setting forth directly or indirectly that the Apollo Theatre or its owners, said Gammon and said Harkins, are in any way unfair to the American Federation of Labor, or that they or either of them refuse to employ members of said American Federation of Labor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>The defendants appealed from the final decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-5\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b299-6\"><em>F.

The case was referred to a master who has found that the plaintiffs Martin and Wellbrook are members in good standing of the Knights of Labor, an incorporated labor organization; and that the defendants, with the exception of Rotman and Fox, are officers and members of a local organization composed of moving picture operators which is associated with the American Federation of Labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">The master further found that the defendants Francke and Burke called upon the plaintiff Gammon and requested him to discharge the plaintiffs Martin and Wellbrook and employ operators who were members of the local organization and affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. This Gammon refused to do; whereupon the defendant Francke stated that unless his request was complied with he would boycott the business of the theatre.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">Thereafter the defendant Rotman, as .a result of a conversation with some of the officers and members of the local union of which the other defendants were members, carried a banner along the streets in the vicinity of the theatre, upon which the following words appeared: \u201cUnion men attention! The management of the Appollo Theatre refuses to employ members of the American Federation of Labor.\u201d A few days later the defendants at different times carried in an automobile along the streets a large banner inscribed as follows: \u201cUnion Men Notice The Appollo Theatre is Unfair to the American Federation of Labor.\u201d The master finds that \u201cthe purpose of the defendants in carrying these banners was to cause, if possible, members of the American Federation of Labor and the public to refrain from purchasing tickets of admission to the Apollo Theatre,\u201d that it \u201cwas the intention of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>the defendants in doing the acts hereinbefore described to compel the discharge of the- plaintiffs Martin and Wellbrook by the other two plaintiffs, or to cause the plaintiffs Martin and Wellbrook to join the American Federation of Labor, but they were unsuccessful.\u201d It was admitted at the hearing before the master that there had been no diminution in the attendance at the theatre due to the acts of the defendants or any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">A final decree has been entered in the Superior Court enjoining the defendants from interfering with rights of the plaintiffs respectively; the only questions presented by the appeal arise from three exceptions to the master\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The first exception is based upon an objection to the refusal of the master to hear evidence offered by the defendants \u201cthat the plaintiffs, their agent and employees, addressed profane and obscene language and vile epithets in the public streets to the defendants when said defendants were driving by the Apollo Theatre in their automobile as described in said report,\u201d and to the ruling that such evidence was inadmissible. If, as the defendants contend, the conduct of the plaintiffs was such that they were not entitled to equitable relief, the defendants were required to state the substance at least of the language used. For the defendants merely to characterize it as \u201cprofane and obscene\u201d and \u201cvile epithets\u201d was not sufficient to enable the master to pass upon the question of its admissibility; the exception to its exclusion must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The second exception is to the finding of the master upon uncontradicted evidence \"that the usual and ordinary meaning and significance of the word \u2018unfair\u2019 among labor men is practically the same as that of the word \u2018scab\u2019 among labor men.\u201d If and in so far as the meaning of the word \u201cunfair\u201d was material to any issue involved at the hearing, it was a question to be decided upon the evidence. If the defendants believed that the word \u201cunfair\u201d did not have the significance of the word \u201cscab\u201d they were entitled to introduce evidence to the contrary; if they did not see fit to do so we cannot say that the finding of the master, which was in accordance with the uncontradicted evidence, was not warranted. The exception to this finding cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">The third exception is to the failure of the master to embody in his report a recital to the effect that at the hearing before him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>he found that one of the plaintiffs while testifying to a material point committed perjury. This exception must be overruled. It was the duty of the master to pass upon the credibility of the witness who he found had committed perjury at the hearing, and give his testimony such weight as he deemed it to be entitled, or to disregard it altogether. There is nothing to show that the failure of the master to include a finding in his report to the effect that the witness in question had committed perjury, was prejudicial to any substantial rights of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
