There was evidence that the defendant found fault with certain floors and that the alterations were not completed finally until four or five months after the time required by the contract, that, although the title to the land was in the defendant\u2019s name, the defendant\u2019s wife was the \u201creal owner\u201d of the property, that the defendant, after examining the building, said that, \u201cif his wife would accept he would be satisfied,\u201d that an interview followed between the defendant\u2019s wife and the architect, that the defendant\u2019s wife directed the architect to write to the plaintiff that the building was accepted, and thereupon the defendant\u2019s wife received the keys of the house, and that shortly thereafter she and the defendant moved into the house. A judge, who heard the case without a jury, found that the defendant unqualifiedly accepted the work done and materials furnished by the plaintiff as being a sufficient compliance with the terms of the contract and waived any failure on the part of the plaintiff to perform the contract fully in accordance with its terms. <em>Held, </em>that the finding of the judge was warranted and that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the full amount claimed by him for work and materials without any reduction by way of recoupment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b61-9\">A judge before whom a case is tried without a jury properly may refuse to make a ruling that is a correct statement of the law, if it is inapplicable to the facts of the case as found by him on evidence warranting such findings.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-10\">Contract in three counts, the first to recover a balance of $999.40 alleged to be due on a contract in writing for the alteration of a dwelling house for the defendant, the second to recover a balance alleged to be due for certain extras performed in the alteration of the dwelling house amounting to $22 and the third, for the same cause of action as the first and second, on an account annexed to recover $1,021.40 (with interest) for labor and materials furnished in the alteration of the house.

The bill of exceptions stated that it contained in substance \u201cAll the material evidence bearing upon the question of acceptance or approval of work performed and waiver on the part of the defendant, raised by the defendant\u2019s exceptions.\u201d This evidence is described in the opinion. At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the judge to make certain rulings, the character of which is indicated sufficiently in the opinion. The twenty-third ruling requested, which is referred to in the opinion, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-4\">\u201c23. The plaintiffs, not having fully performed the contract by the completion of the same within the time therein specified, cannot avail themselves of the advantages given the possession of an architect\u2019s certificate under the contract.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-5\">The judge made the following memorandum of decision:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-6\">\u201cThere was an honest intention on the part of the plaintiffs to fairly perform this contract, but they failed in certain material respects to fully perform it in accordance with its terms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-7\">. \u201cThe defendant unqualifiedly accepted the work done and materials furnished by the plaintiffs as being a sufficient compliance with the terms of said contract, and waived any failure on the part of plaintiffs to fully perform the contract in accordance with its terms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-8\">\u201cThe defendant\u2019s requests for findings and rulings which are material, and which conform to the foregoing findings, are granted, and are denied in so far as they are contrary to and at variance with them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-9\">The judge made no further disposition of the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings than that contained in the foregoing memorandum. He found for the plaintiffs in the sum of $1,080.30, which was the full amount claimed by them under the third count of their declaration. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b62-10\"><em>C. N. Barney, (H. A. Murphy &amp; R. T.

And the defendant\u2019s twenty-third request is amply covered by this general finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The record is silent as to any defects, except that the defendant \u201cfound some fault with certain floors,\u201d and introduced evidence tending to show damages \u201cby failure to receive his house\u201d within eight weeks after August 27, 1914, the time named for completion in the contract. The delay seems to have been prolonged, for it was not until February 12, 1915, that the supervising architect wrote to the plaintiffs requiring certain work to be done, \u201cbefore the contract job was completed.\u201d It appears that while the title was in the defendant\u2019s name his wife was the \u201creal owner\u201d of the property, and, if the judge believed the evidence of the plaintiff Hooper and of the architect, the defendant, after examining the building, said that, \u201cif his wife would accept he would be satisfied.\u201d A subsequent interview between her and the architect followed, and upon conflicting evidence the judge further could find, that she directed the architect to write to the plaintiffs that the building was accepted, and that thereupon, having received the keys, she and her husband \u201cmoved into the premises shortly thereafter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">While the defendant undoubtedly could recoup damages for defects from incompleted work, and for any loss as provided in the contract which he suffered by the delay, yet he could waive not only full performance but also whatever loss had been sustained, and accept the building as and when it was left by the plaintiffs. <em>Norcross Brothers Co. </em>v. <em>Vose, </em>199 Mass. 81. <em>Buttrick Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>202 Mass. 413, 419, 420. The questions of waiver and of acceptance were issues of fact. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>212 Mass. 53, 56. The judge on the evidence, that, after the expiration of the time limit for completion, the plaintiffs were permitted to continue work, and that after completion the defendant accepted it and took possession under conditions to which reference has been made, was warranted in finding independently of the architect\u2019s certificate, that the \u201cdefendant unqualifiedly accepted the work done and materials furnished-by the plaintiffs as being a sufficient compliance with the terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>of said contract, and waived any failure on the part of the plaintiffs to fully perforin the contract in accordance with its terms.\u201d <em>Freeland </em>v. <em>Ritz, </em>154 Mass. 257. <em>Metropolitan Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Boutell Transportation &amp; Towing Co. </em>185 Mass. 391, 397. <em>Boyden </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>198 Mass. 477. <em>C. W. Hunt Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>199 Mass. 220, 230. The finding is not equivocal as the defendant contends, but covers any failure of compliance on which the defendant\u2019s right of recoupment depends. <em>Bryne </em>v. <em>Dorey, </em>221 Mass. 399, 405. It follows under the judge\u2019s ruling denying the defendant\u2019s requests in so far as \"contrary to and at variance\u201d with the findings, that the requests regarding the waiver of the right to recoup for delay were denied properly, and the requests concerning the effect of the architect\u2019s certificate had ceased to be material or appropriate. <em>McLauthlin </em>v. <em>Wilder, </em>138 Mass. 393, 397. <em>Shattuck </em>v. <em>Eldredge, </em>173 Mass. 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The requests relating to acceptance are more in the nature of requests for findings than for rulings of law. But, whatever their purport, the judge was not required to rule on part of the evidence or to adopt any of the defendant\u2019s contentions as to its weight. <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>DePeiffer, </em>214 Mass. 52. <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>214 Mass. 323. <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>216 Mass. 200. <em>Seager </em>v. <em>Drayton, </em>217 Mass. 571. <em>Jacobsen </em>v. <em>Simons, </em>222 Mass. 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Nor is it error for a trial judge to refuse a ruling not applicable to the facts of the case as found by him on evidence warranting the findings, even if the ruling requested is a correct statement of legal principles. <em>Doon </em>v. <em>Felton, </em>203 Mass. 267, 271. <em>Coles </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>223 Mass. 408, 416, 417. See <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Second National Bank, </em>177 Mass. 257, 264, 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">The defendant having failed to show that he is aggrieved by any error of law, the exceptions must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
