but it was <em>held </em>that this contention was not correct, because the impairment of the plaintiff\u2019s earning capacity caused by the publication of the libel might be found to have extended beyond the period of the contract; and moreover, that the defendant\u2019s contention wrongly assumed that the plaintiff might have gone back to the defendant\u2019s employ after the publication of the libel, which was not found by the jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b278-5\">Upon the contention mentioned above the judge instructed the jury as follows: \"If you find that contract was still open to him after the libel was published and he reasonably ought to have gone back to that employment after that time, then I am going to permit you to consider his failure to do that, ... if \u2022 that was still open to him then he cannot have damages assessed\u201d and \"unless you find he could have gone back you get to the question whether these publications did prevent him from obtaining employment during part or the whole of the time since.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that this instruction was sufficiently favorable to the defendant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b278-6\">Upon the trial of the same issue of damages, the plaintiff excepted to the admission of evidence in regard to efforts of the plaintiff to get customers of the defendant for his new employer, who was the person named in the libel to whom the plaintiff was charged with having divulged wrongfully the defendant\u2019s trade secrets, and it was <em>held, </em>that, although this evidence appeared to be incompetent as being immaterial to the issue on trial, the error of admitting it did not affect injuriously the substantial rights of the plaintiff and that under St. 1913, c. 716, \u00a7 1, the exception should be overruled.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b278-7\">Upon another exception of the plaintiff taken at the trial of the same issue of damages, it was <em>held </em>that the judge rightly refused to rule as matter of law that the plaintiff could not have returned to his former work, the question whether he could have returned to the defendant\u2019s employ or not being one of fact for the jury.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-8\">Two actions of tort for two libels alleged to have been published by the defendants of and concerning the plaintiff, the first action being against Stone, Timlow and Company, Incorporated, a corporation, and the second action being against Albert W.

This motion was heard by <em>Bell, </em>J., who made the following memorandum of decision:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-11\">\u201cThe answers to the first fourteen questions I cannot disturb as there was evidence to support the findings of the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-12\">\u201cThe answer to the fifteenth I think to be wrong as a matter of law. The contract did not go further than was reasonably necessary to protect the defendant. This answer must be set aside.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-13\">\u201cClause (c) of the answer to the sixteenth question falls with the answer to the fifteenth question and the verdict so far is unsupported and must be set aside.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-14\">\u201cBut I am further of opinion that all the findings as to damages are excessive. The libels had been preceded by a long and bitter controversy between the parties with much ill will and a law suit. I saw during the trial that it would be difficult to keep the jury to the libel alone. After the verdict I was satisfied that the jury gave, without discrimination, damages for what the plaintiff suffered in the whole quarrel. It was difficult to separate the different causes of his mental suffering and of the injury to his character and he was anxious to charge them all up to the libel which was only one incident in the controversy. And the jury did so too.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-15\">\u201cI feel certain that one half the amount allowed would be a very liberal allowance as compensation for the injury caused by the libels.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-16\">\u201cI therefore grant the motion for a new trial on the matter of damages unless within thirty days from the filing of this order, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>plaintiff remits one half of each item of damages found by the jury.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-5\">The plaintiff having failed to make the remission of damages required, there later was a new trial on the matter of damages only before <em>Sanderson, </em>J. At this trial the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $1,250 in each case. Both the plaintiff and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b284-6\"><em>F. W. Fosdick, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b284-7\"><em>F. L. Norton, (M. Jenney </em>with him,) for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b284-8\">De Courcy, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AULC\">These are two actions for libel, one brought against a corporation of which the plaintiff was a former employee, and the other against its president. After a trial of both actions, together, verdicts for the plaintiff were set aside as to damages, and a second trial was had on the question of damages only. The cases are here on exceptions taken by the defendants at both trials, and on the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions taken at the second one. We consider first the exceptions of the defendants at the earlier trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">1. Fourteen of these relate to the admission and exclusion of evidence. The first, third and fourth were to the admission of the published articles containing the alleged libels in the Shoe and Leather Reporter, the Medford Messenger and the Med-ford Mercury. There was ample evidence during the trial connecting the defendants with these publications and the order of proof rested in the discretion of the judge. The conversation between the defendant Stone and the publisher of Medford Mercury (exception second) was admissible at least to show that Stone procured the publications in that paper; and he later admitted that he acted as a properly authorized officer of the defendant corporation in his acts with reference to the case. Exceptions fifth and sixth, to the admission of the plaintiff\u2019s denials of certain alleged libellous statements in the articles were not argued, and are waived. The letters of the defendant corporation to the Medford Mercury (exception eighth) and to the Med-ford Messenger (exception ninth) plainly were admissible in view of the testimony of the stenographer, Miss Morton. <em>Slotnick </em>v. <em>Silberstein, </em>221 Mass. 59. The paragraph in the Shoe and Leather Reporter stating that Stryker had resigned his position with a view of .going into business in Canada (exception tenth) was submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>by the defendant Stone, with an offer of proof that it affected him (Stone) in voluntarily going to Canada. The judge rightly excluded it as immaterial. The five letters of Clarke and Clarke, Ltd. of Toronto to their customers (exception eleventh) were <em>res inter alios, </em>and not relevant to the present actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\">The defendant Stone, called as a witness by the plaintiff, was inquired of as to a letter written by him to Clarke and Clarke, Ltd. containing defamatory statements about the plaintiff, and tending to show actual malice on the writer\u2019s part (exceptions twelfth and thirteenth). It now is arg\u00fced that the written statements were too remote from the date of the alleged libel. Assuming that this ground of objection was called to the attention of the trial judge, we cannot say that his discretion as to the scope of a virtual cross-examination was exercised improperly, especially in view of the charge on this subject. Exception fourteenth, to the admission of the defendant corporation\u2019s letter and inclosure to the Shoe and Leather Reporter has not been argued, and is waived. All the exceptions of the defendant to the admission and exclusion of evidence must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">2. The defendants made eighteen requests for rulings, the first thirteen \u201cseparately as to each count in each case and the remainder separately as to the second and third counts in each case,\u201d and excepted separately to the refusal to make each of said rulings requested. It would serve no useful purpose to discuss these in detail. We have considered all that were argued, and find no merit in them. There was ample evidence of publication and of malice; the questions raised were for the jury, and the libellous character of the articles was determined by considering each article in its entirety. <em>Doane </em>v. <em>Grew, </em>220 Mass. 171. <em>Lothrop </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>133 Mass. 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">3. The exceptions of the defendants to the giving of certain instructions requested by the plaintiff have not been argued, and we treat them as waived. See <em>Howland </em>v. <em>George F. Blake Manuf. Co. </em>156 Mass. 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">4. The same is true as to the exceptions taken to the questions submitted to the jury. It is to be noted that the judge set aside the answer to question fifteen, on the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">5. The defendants excepted to portions of the judge\u2019s charge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Only one is argued; that \u201cto the statement by the court that the defendants stand substantially alike.\u201d On the evidence this statement was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\">As the answers of the jury established all the essentials of liability, there was no error in directing a verdict for the plaintiff. As to damages, the verdicts were set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">6. We next consider the exceptions taken by the defendants at the second trial, which was on damages only. The questions asked of plaintiff in cross-examination as to having shown his business card, while with Clarke and Clarke, Ltd. to people whom he had known as customers of the defendant corporation and as to his employment of an attorney in Canada, were excluded rightly as not material on the issue of damages. We find no error in the ruling, given at the plaintiff\u2019s request, to the effect that the truth or falsity of the charge of disloyalty which was contained in the libellous articles should not be considered, except, as under the evidence properly in the case, such truth or falsity might affect the amount of damages to be awarded by reason of that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The only other exceptions argued by the defendants are those to the admission of certain testimony, and to instructions to the jury, all relative to the plaintiff\u2019s earning capacity. The defendants contend that as the plaintiff had a written contract to work for the defendant corporation until January 1, 1916, and as the jury at the first trial found that this contract was broken by him, therefore he could not recover damages for loss of his earning capacity. But the impairment of his earning capacity might be found to extend in its effects after the date when the contract was to expire. The conclusive answer to the contention of the defendants however is, that it assumes that the plaintiff might have gone back to work for the defendant corporation after it had published these libels. The jury did not so find. The charge on this subject was sufficiently favorable to the defendants in saying, \u201cif you find that contract was still open to him after the libel was published and he reasonably ought to have gone back to that employment after that time, then I am going to permit you to consider his failure to do that, ... if that was still open to him then he cannot have damages assessed;\u201d and \u201cunless you find he could have gone back you get to the question whether these publications did prevent him from obtaining employment during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>part or the whole of the time since then.\u201d <em>Sweet </em>v. <em>Post Publishing Co. </em>215 Mass. 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">All of the exceptions taken by the defendants at the second trial must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">7. As to the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions at the second trial, it is difficult to see how the efforts of the plaintiff to get customers of the defendants for Clarke-and Clarke, Ltd. was competent on the question of damages; but in our opinion the error of admitting it did not injuriously affect the substantial rights of the parties. St. 1913, c. 716, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The question whether the plaintiff might have gone back to work for the defendant corporation was one of fact for the jury on the evidence, and the judge rightly refused to rule as matter of law that he could not have returned to his former work.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">The exceptions to the judge\u2019s refusal to give the rulings he-requested have been waived. No error is shown in the portion of the charge dealing with the plaintiff\u2019s duty to make reasonable efforts to get work and so avoid injurious consequences. <em>Hussey </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>217 Mass. 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">It follows from what we have said that the exceptions taken by the defendants in both trials, and those taken by the plaintiff in the second trial, all must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
