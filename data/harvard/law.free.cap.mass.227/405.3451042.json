Babcock Company was a tenant at will of the defendants, on the eleventh floor of an office building. The plaintiff, after transacting some business with the Babcock Company, left the office and entered a passenger elevator operated by the defendants. The elevator descended to the tenth floor, where a number of passengers entered; when started, it instantly dropped to a point near the third floor, stopped with a loud crash and tilted, so that one side was very much higher than the other. Several of the passengers were injured, including the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">At the close of the evidence the defendants requested the judge to direct a verdict in their favor. This request was refused and the defendants'excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">The plaintiff testified the operator grasped the lever and \u201cslammed it over\u201d in such a manner that his hands left the lever before it \u201carrived at its destination.\u201d Sufficient force was given it so that \u201cit would arrive there\u201d without his assistance, and then the car dropped with terrific speed; \"that he had travelled in that elevator before, and that the elevators there were the fastest in the city of Boston;\u201d that the time which elapsed after the elevator left the tenth floor and before it stopped, seemed to him to be about four seconds. \u201cIt was a very brief time.\u201d There was testimony that the car descended like a flash. A witness who had been carried on this elevator before testified \u201cThe speed at which it came down was much faster than it had come at other times. He always knew they went fast and had a dread of them, but he knew at the time it came down it was falling, it went at such a terrific speed.\u201d He was conscious of a sudden drop, \u201c and it seemed as if everything gave way under the car.\u201d There was other evidence tending to show that the car was started suddenly and moved with unusual and excessive speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">It could have been found that the safety devices designed to catch simultaneously the rails on both sides, caught only on one side; that the safety shoe on this device was worn and its condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>tian was discoverable by proper inspection. There was expert evidence that the accident happened because the safety device caught only on one side. There was also evidence that in the discharge pipe there was a gate valve, which could be so regulated as to render it impossible for the car to descend at undue speed, even if fully loaded and the operator \u201copens his valve as wide as he can,\u201d and if the gate valve had been properly adjusted, it would not have been possible for the accident to have happened in the way it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">The defendants operated the elevator. It was in their exclusive management. On this evidence the defendants\u2019 negligence was plainly a question of fact for the jury and the judge could not direct a verdict in their favor. <em>Ogden </em>v. <em>Aspinwall, </em>220 Mass. 100. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Manice, </em>166 N. Y. 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The plaintiff was upon the premises on a matter of business with the Babcock Company and had at least the rights of the tenant. <em>Domenicis </em>v. <em>Fleisher, </em>195 Mass. 281. There is nothing in <em>Baum </em>v. <em>Ahlborn, </em>210 Mass. 336, <em>Follins </em>v. <em>Dill, </em>221 Mass. 93, <em>Mikkanen </em>v. <em>Safety Fund National Bank, </em>222 Mass. 150, in conflict with what is here stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">As there was evidence of the defendants\u2019 negligence for the consideration of the jury, there was no error of law in refusing the defendants\u2019 request.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
