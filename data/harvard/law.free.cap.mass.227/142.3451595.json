The structure for the remaining two tracks, hereinafter called the subway, shall be begun at such time after the expiration of one year from the completion of the tunnel as the commission and the Boston Elevated Railway Company, hereinafter called the company, may agree upon, or, in case of difference, as the board of railroad commissioners, hereinafter called the board, shall determine that the public interests require. The structure or structures for all four tracks, with the appurtenances, or any part or parts thereof, may be begun at any time after the acceptance of this act by a majority of the voters of the city as hereinafter provided, if and so far as the commission deems it expedient and if the company by its board of directors consents thereto.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-8\">\u201cSection 10. The commission shall within ninety days after the passage of this act execute with the company, in the name of the city, the company consenting thereto, a contract in writing for the sole and exclusive use of the tunnel and subway and appurtenances for the period of twenty-five years from the beginning of the use of the tunnel, at an annual rental equal to four and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>one half per cent of the net cost of the tunnel and subway, respectively, for the running of trains and cars therein, and for such other uses and upon such provisions and conditions, not affecting the term or rental, as the commission and the company may agree upon, or in case of difference, as the board may determine. The provisions of this act, in so far as they declare, define or establish the terms and conditions for the .construction, tenure, maintenance and operation of said tunnel, subway and appurtenances, shall be embodied in and made part of said contract. The use of the tunnel or subway respectively shall begin when, in the opinion of the commission, a reasonable time after completion has been allowed for equipment. The net cost of the tunnel and subway respectively shall be deemed to include all expenditures incurred in acquisition and construction, including damages, expenses and salaries of the commission, and interest at three and one fourth per cent per annum on the debt incurred in construction prior to the beginning of the use. If the contract for the use of the tunnel and subway is executed as above provided the commission, upon the acceptance of this act by the voters of the city as hereinafter provided, shall proceed with the work of construction.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A4R\">\u201cSection 19.

The city shall have, hold and enjoy in its private or proprietary capacity, for its own property, the existing subway, the East Boston tunnel, the Cambridge Street subway and the tunnel and subway built under this act, and all rents, tolls, income and profits from all contracts heretofore or hereafter entered into for the use of saicl subways or tunnels or any part thereof, and the same shall never be taken by the Commonwealth except on payment- of just compensation: provided, however, that so much of such rents, tolls, income and profits as may be necessary therefor shall be paid into the respective sinking funds for the redemption of said bonds and used for the payment of the interest thereon.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b168-3\"><em>M.

St. 1915, c. 293. But while they are directed to construct the tunnel, \u00a7 1 states that the provisions as to construction, payment and use are to be the same as \"provided by law for the construction, payment and use of the present tunnel under Washington Street in the city of Boston.\u201d The St. of 1902, c. 534, in so far as pertinent and material having been thus incorporated by reference, the governing statute is to be read accordingly. See St. 1907, c. 573; St. 1911, c. 741, \u00a7 8. It follows that unless the Boston Elevated Railway Company consented to execute with the commission a contract for the sole and exclusive use of the tunnel or subway for a specified term of years at an annual rental after its construction, and thereupon the voters of the municipality had accepted the Spec. St. of 1915, c. 293, the commission could not have proceeded with the work of construction. <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Talbot, </em>206 Mass. 82. <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>184 Mass. 586. <em>Codman </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>203 Mssa. 146, 153, 154. The material allegations of the answer not having been traversed are to be taken as true, (R. L. c. 192, \u00a7 5,) from which it clearly appears that having been duly requested by the commission to define its position, the company declined to take action, or to enter into any contract as required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\">No failure by the respondents to comply with the act is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">\n<em>Order dismissing petition affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
