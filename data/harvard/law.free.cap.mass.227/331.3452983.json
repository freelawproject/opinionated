The facts are stated in the opinion. The single justice made the following memorandum of decision:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-5\">\u201cMrs. Hill, then Caroline Wright Rogers, on April 6, 1906, in view of her marriage to William H. Hill (which marriage was subsequently solemnized) entered into an antenuptial agreement with him, by which she was to receive on his death the sum of $250,000 'in place of and as a substitute\u2019 for all rights, claims and interests to which she may hereafter be entitled in or to of the property or estate of every kind, real or personal, belonging to him,\u201d in the event that the marriage should take place and she should become his widow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-6\">\u201cMr. Hill died October 14,1913, leaving a will. It seems to me that Mrs. Hill on the death of her husband became entitled to the $250,000 by reason of the marriage settlement or antenuptial agreement and that she did not take the $250,000 and it did not pass to her by the will of her husband or by the laws regulating intestate succession. While Mr. Hill made a will which was duly probated, and the will refers to the antenuptial agreement, I think that her rights under the agreement were independent of the will and that the said amount of $250,000 is not taxable under the statute as it then was. I therefore think that the decree of the Probate Court should be reversed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-7\">By order of the single justice a final decree was entered reversing the decree of the Probate Court and ordering that the petition for the abatement of taxes be granted and that the case be remitted to the Probate Court for further proceedings in accordance with this decree.

By a will made afterwards Mr. Hill first affirmed that agreement and then made this provision: \u201cIt is my wish that said sum of Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) shall be paid unto her within six months of the date of my decease, and when such payment is made, instead of taking cash my said wife may, if she so elects, choose and take from and out of my estate, bonds, stocks or other evidences of value to said amount of Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000), and said Executors are ordered and directed to transfer and deliver the same unto her.\u201d After Mr. Hill\u2019s death \u201cThe executors made up a list of certain securities, the property of the estate, which they desired to turn over to Mrs. Hill in payment of the amount due her under the agreement; that Mrs. Hill looked over this list and also over a list of other securities held by the executors and agreed to accept the securities suggested by the executors in payment of the amount due her.\u201d Later these securities were transferited to her and she gave a receipt \u201cacknowledging full payment of the amount thus due her.\u201d The tax commissioner imposed an inheritance tax upon the property thus transferred to Mrs. Hill. This petition was brought for the abatement of that tax. The Probate Court made a decree dismissing the petition. From that an appeal was taken to this court. The decree was reversed by a single justice of this court and from that decree the appeal was taken which is now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">The petitioners have based an argument on the particular pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>visions of R. L. c. 153, \u00a7 26. Their contention is that the validity of the antenuptial agreement between Mr. and Mrs. Hill depends upon that statute. But the validity of an antenuptial agreement depends upon the rules of the common law, <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>8 Gray, 542, 543, <em>Sullings </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>5 Allen, 187, 190, and not upon that statute. <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Holt, </em>109 Mass. 261. For that reason this argument need not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\">No question arises in this case under the clause in St. 1909, c. 490, Part IV, \u00a7 1 (as amended by St. 1912, c. 678, \u00a7 2) as to property passing \u201cby deed, grant or gift.\u201d The antenuptial contract between Mr. and Mrs. Hill was made April 6, 1906, and by the provisions of \u00a7 25 of the original act, St. 1907, c. 563, (now St. 1909, c. 490, Part IV, \u00a7 25,) it is provided that that clause does not apply where the deed, grant or gift was made prior to the date when the original act went into effect. That date was September 1, 1907.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">It is plain that the assets of a testator or intestate used in paying his debts are not subject to an inheritance tax. See <em>McCurdy </em>v. <em>McCurdy, </em>197 Mass. 248, 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">We are of opinion that by force of the antenuptial agreement Mrs. Hill became a creditor of the estate. That agreement was in terms that she should receive from his estate the sum of $250,000 \u201cas a debt against his estate.\u201d If Mrs. Hill had asked for and received from the executors of her husband\u2019s will $250,000 in cash, no inheritance tax could have been imposed upon the sum so paid. For a decision to that effect see <em>Matter of Baker, </em>178 N. Y. 575, affirming 83 App. Div. (N. Y.) 530, on opinion below.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">But under her husband\u2019s will Mrs. Hill had a right to take the $250,000 in cash or \u201cif she so elects, [she had a right to] choose and take from and out of my [his] estate, bonds, stocks or other evidences of value to said amount \u201d in payment of that debt. Mrs. Hill elected to take \u201cbonds, stocks or other evidences of value\u201d in payment of the debt due her amounting to $250,000. It has been contended that this provision of her husband\u2019s will was nothing more than a direction to the executors as to the way in which he wished this debt of $250,000 to be paid and that the standing of Mrs. Hill as a creditor was not affected by this direction of the testator to his executors nor by the transfer to her of the securities in payment of this debt. But a direction to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>executor to pay a debt in securities specified by the testator or in securities to be selected by the creditor is something more than a direction to the executor to pay the debt. It gives to the creditor (at least at his election) a right to the securities named by the testator or to the securities which the testator has said the creditor shall have a right to select. It is not necessary however to dwell upon this because in the case at bar such a right was given in terms to Mrs. Hill. The transfer and acceptance of these securities by Mrs. Hill was in fact and in law a legacy in payment of a debt. The inheritance tax law of the Commonwealth (St. 1909, c. 490, Part IV, \u00a7 1) applies to all cases where property or an interest therein passes by will. It is not confined to cases where property or an interest therein so passes as a gratuity. It includes cases where property or an interest therein passes by will in performance of an obligation resting upon the testator to devise or bequeath the property in question. <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver General, </em>226 Mass. 301, or where as in the case at bar the legacy is given in payment of a debt. Not only is this plain as matter of construction of the statute but it is established as a matter of authority in all jurisdictions where (so far as we know) the question has arisen. <em>Matter of Gould, </em>156 N. Y. 423. <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Craig, </em>77 N. H. 200. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mollier, </em>96 Kans. 514. For a case in New York reviewing the earlier cases see <em>Matter of Kidd, 188 </em>N. Y. 274. See in this connection <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>7 De G., M. &amp; G. 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">The petitioners\u2019 last contention is that the exaction of a tax under circumstances of this case would be unconstitutional within art. 1, \u00a7 10 of the Constitution of the United States' providing that \u201cNo State shall. . . pass any . . . law impairing the obligation of contracts.\u201d It is plain from what has been said that this contention is without foundation. The obligation of the contract was that Mrs. Hill should receive and Mr. Hill should pay $250,000 in cash. The tax is due because by his will Mr. Hill gave his wife the option of taking a legacy in satisfaction of her rights as a creditor and she elected to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The result is that the decree of the single justice reversing the decree of the judge of probate must be reversed and the decree of the judge of probate dismissing the petition must be affirmed. It is <em>So ordered.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
