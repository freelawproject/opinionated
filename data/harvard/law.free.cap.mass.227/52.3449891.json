There was evidence that the defendant was the general manager and M was the assistant manager of a corporation that conducted \u201clunch rooms\u201d and that the motor car was used both by the defendant and by M for pleasure driving and in connection with the business of the lunch rooms, that M \u201ctook all orders from the defendant and was under his general charge.\u201d The defendant testified that he could not tell whether the car was being used \u201cfor any particular purpose at the time of the accident\u201d and \u201cthat he had no recollection as to what M was using the automobile for on the day of the accident, except what he might infer from the custom between them.\" The defendant then was asked, \u201cBearing in mind his custom, is there any doubt in your mind that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>using it on your account that night?\u201d and answered, \u201cNo doubt whatever in my mind but what that was what he was using it for.\u201d He then was asked, \u201cOn your account?\u201d and answered, \u201cYes, I suppose so.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that there was evidence for the jury that at the time of the accident M-was driving the car in behalf of the defendant.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-5\">Tort for personal injuries sustained by the plaintiff between five and half past five o\u2019clock in the afternoon of April 18, 1913, when the plaintiff on foot was crossing Summer Street in Boston near the corner of Chauncy Street, by being run into by a motor car belonging to the defendant and driven by one Munroe alleged to have been the servant or agent of the defendant. Writ dated June 16, 1913.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-6\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Stevens, </em>J. The bill of exceptions contained the following statements: \"There was evidence tending to show that the plaintiff was lawfully travelling upon the public highway and was at all times in the exercise of due care. There was also evidence tending to show negligence on the part of the person then operating defendant\u2019s automobile and that as a result of the collision the plaintiff sustained bodily injuries.\u201d The defendant was called as a witness by the plaintiff and gave the testimony which is described in the opinion. Munroe was called as a witness by the defendant. The testimony of these two witnesses was all the evidence introduced either by the plaintiff or the defendant upon the question whether at the time of the accident Munroe was operating the motor car as the agent of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-7\">At the close of the evidence the judge ruled that there was not sufficient evidence to warrant the submission of the case to the jury upon the question mentioned above. He ordered a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-8\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b77-9\"><em>W.

It is clear that, if the car was being used for the first purpose, no serviential relation was shown. <em>Trombley </em>v. <em>Stevens-Duryea Co. </em>206 Mass. 516. But the jury further could have found on the defendant\u2019s testimony, \u201cthat Munroe took all orders from the defendant and was under his general charge.\u201d It is true he also testified, that when Munroe \"reported the accident to him, Munroe did not have any collections belonging to the . . . company with him,\u201d and that he \u201ccould not tell whether\u201d the car was being used \u201cfor any particular purpose at the time of the accident,\u201d and \u201cthat he had no recollection as to what Munroe was using the automobile for on the day of the accident, except what he might infer from the custom between them.\u201d If no further evidence had been introduced the plaintiff still had failed to show that the defendant was accountable for Munroe\u2019s negligence. But, having been asked, \u201cBearing in mind his custom, is there any doubt in your mind that he was using it on your account that night?\u201d the defendant replied, \"No doubt whatever in my mind but what that was what he was using it for.\u201d \u201c On your account?\u201d \u201cYes, I suppose so.\u201d If the jury believed these statements, as they were at liberty to do, there was evidence from which in connection with their business relations to each other, and to the company in the transaction of whose business the motor car was used as narrated by the defendant, they could find that Munroe acted, not for his own personal enjoyment or in any affair of his own, but in behalf of the owner, whatever the owner\u2019s purpose then may have been. The case upon these findings would have stood precisely the same as if the defendant himself had been negligently operating the car when the accident occurred, and the verdict in his favor was ordered improperly. <em>Ouimette </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>219 Mass. 466, 470, and cases cited. <em>Niland </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>208 Mass. 476, 478, and cases cited.
