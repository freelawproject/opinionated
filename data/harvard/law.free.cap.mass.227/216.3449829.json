Dimond and Sons, Incorporated, a corporation, to the payment of instalments of money due to the plaintiff by the defendant Dimond under a guaranty in writing which is stated in the opinion, where also are stated the amendment to the bill, the answer of the defendant Dimond and the entry by consent of a decree dismissing the bill as against the defendant corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-13\">The plaintiff filed the following motion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-14\">\u201cNow comes the plaintiff in the above entitled cause and says <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>that since the filing of his bill herein an involuntary petition in bankruptcy has been filed against the defendant L. Dimond and Sons, Incorporated, under which petition an offer of composition in bankruptcy was confirmed by the District Court of the United States for the District of Massachusetts on September 21, 1915, and that in consequence thereof the capital stock of said defendant L. Dimond and Sons, Incorporated, has become worthless; wherefore the plaintiff moves that he may discontinue this cause as against said defendant L. Dimond and Sons, Incorporated, without costs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-5\">Upon this motion were indorsed the words \u201cassented to\u201d signed by the counsel for the defendant L. Dimond and Sons, Incorporated, and also by the counsel for the defendant Dimond over the words \u201cwithout prejudice to the defendant Dimond\u2019s right to dismiss the bill for want of equity.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-6\">The motion was allowed, and a decree was made, \u201call parties agreeing thereto,\u201d that the bill be dismissed as against the defendant L. Dimond and Sons, Incorporated, without costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-7\">Later the defendant Dimond filed a motion that the suit \u201cbe dismissed upon the ground that there is no equitable jurisdiction.\u201d The case was heard by <em>Fox, </em>J., who made the following memorandum of decision:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-8\">\u201cThe execution of the instrument of guaranty concurrently with the promissory note was proved, and the consideration for the guaranty was established. The amount due under the guaranty at the time of the filing of the amendment was $2,307.84.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-9\">\u201cAt the opening of the hearing, the counsel for the defendant objected that after the discontinuance as to Dimond and Sons, Incorporated, the court was without equitable jurisdiction, and renewed his motion at the close of the testimony. I ruled that, since it appeared that Dimond and Sons, Incorporated, was a going concern when the bill was brought, and the answer admitted that the defendant held stock in it, the jurisdiction of the court was not defeated by later discontinuance as to that defendant.\u201d The judge ordered that a decree be entered for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-10\">St. 1910, c. 171, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 14, are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-11\">\u201cSection 13. No attachment or levy upon shares of stock for which a certificate is outstanding shall be valid until such certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>cate be actually seized by the officer making the attachment or levy, or be surrendered to the corporation which issued it, or its transfer by the holder be enjoined. Except where a certificate is lost or destroyed, such corporation shall not be compelled to issue a new certificate for the stock until the old certificate is surrendered to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-5\">\u201cSection 14. A creditor whose debtor is the owner of a certificate shall be entitled to such aid from courts of appropriate jurisdiction, by injunction and otherwise, in attaching such certificate or in satisfying the claim by means thereof as is allowed at law or in equity, in regard to property which cannot readily be attached or levied upon by ordinary legal process.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-6\">St. 1910, c. 531, \u00a7 2, adds to the grounds of equity jurisdiction described in R. L. c. 159, \u00a7 3, cl. 7, as amended by St. 1902, c. 544, \u00a7 23, the following: \u201cAlso suits to reach and apply shares or interests in corporations organized under the laws of this Commonwealth or of the United States, and located or having a general office in this Commonwealth, whether the plaintiff is a creditor or not, and whether the suit is founded upon a debt or not.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-7\"><em>E. C. Stone &amp; G. Gleason, </em>for the defendant Henry J. Dimond, submitted a brief.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-8\"><em>B. A.

Leavitt, \u201cthe full, faithful and prompt payment of each and all weekly instalments set forth in a promissory note of even date made by John E. Brennen for $7500,\u201d which note reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-11\">\u201cBoston, Mass. July 24,1912.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-12\">\u201cFor value received, I promise to pay to Peter M. Leavitt or order Seventy-five Hundred Dollars, payable weekly in instalments of $36.06 per week, the first instalment to be made in one week from the date hereof, with interest weekly at the rate of 6% per annum.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">The bill in equity was brought on April 20, 1915, and alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>that instalments, payable according to the tenor of the note, to the amount of $1,081.80 with interest thereon were due and unpaid. An amendment to the. bill was allowed on December 21, 1915, to the effect that $1,226.04 more had become due and remained unpaid, or in all $2,307.84. <em>*</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">On December 22,1915, the principal defendant filed his answer. He \u201cadmits that he was the owner of certain shares of the capital stock of the defendant corporation . . . but says that said shares are now of no value owing to the fact that the said corporation was duly adjudicated a bankrupt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">On January 24, 1916, by a consent decree, \"without prejudice to the defendant Dimond\u2019s right to dismiss the bill for want of equity,\u201d the bill was dismissed as against the defendant corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">On June 20, 1916, the defendant filed the following motion before taking any evidence: \u201cNow comes the defendant . . . and moves that the above entitled action be dismissed upon the ground that there is no equitable jurisdiction.\u201d This motion was denied and the defendant duly excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">It is the contention of the defendant that the court never acquired jurisdiction because the plaintiff offered no evidence that the stock had \u201ca substantial market value\u201d as alleged in the bill. No provision is expressed or implied in St. 1910, c. 531, \u00a7 2, to limit .the right of creditors to seize and apply only stock of substantial value or of substantial market value. The allegation was surplusage and need not be proven. In his answer the defendant admits that he was the holder of stock in the defendant corporation at the time of the filing of the bill.' This fact, together with the service of process, established jurisdiction in the court which was not lost when the bill was dismissed against the defendant corporation on the ground that the stock became worthless in consequence of the bankruptcy of the defendant corporation. <em>Campbell &amp; Zell Co. </em>v. <em>Barr Pumping Engine Co. </em>182 Mass. 304, 306. <em>Rosen </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>224 Mass. 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">The amendment to the bill to include items of instalments accruing after the filing of the bill, was correct in procedure and the allowance of the items in accord with equity practice. <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Pye, </em>215 Mass. 403. <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>218 Mass. 542, 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
