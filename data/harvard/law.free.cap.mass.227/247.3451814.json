Fenno, which was duly admitted to probate June 15, 1868. At his death he left surviving him a widow, Martha J. L. Fenno, a daughter, Martha A. Upton, and a son, James W. Fenno, who under the will are the beneficiaries for life of the income of the trust property. Martha A. Upton died May 5, 1884, leaving two children, now living, Myra F. Cutler and Isabelle T. Elms. The widow died October 25, 1898. James W. Fenno, the son, is still living.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-7\">\u201cUpon the death of the widow her life estate terminated and ,no further reference to her need be made, except to say that upon that event the income was to be divided into halves, one half to be paid to the daughter and the other half to the son. But as the daughter predeceased her mother her right to any portion of the income ceased. And, it being apparent that the testator intended ' to dispose of the principal as well as of the income and to give the remainder after the life interest of his children to the issue of such as should leave issue, and this intention must control, Myra F. Cutler and Isabelle T. Elms became entitled to one half of the real and personal estate held in trust by the petitioner, and upon a transfer by the trustee the trust as to this portion of the property terminates. The other half is to be held in trust and the income paid to James W. Fenno, the son, during his life. And the reason having ceased'for the payment by him of interest on the $10,000 advanced to him by his father, which was intended to form part of the income to be distributable to the wife and daughter on the basis of equality of division of income, he is no longer required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>to make the payment. It does not appear what payments of income, if any, were made to the children of his daughter from May 5, 1884, to October 25, 1898, or whether after the death of the widow any payments of income were continued until the filing of the petition for instructions, October 11, 1916, and no question being raised as to payments of income under these circumstances, it is not before the court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-5\">By order of the single justice a final decree was entered in accordance with the memorandum of decision.

Fenno, the testator, died in 1868, leaving a widow, Martha J. L. Fenno, a daughter, Martha A. Upton, and a son, James W. Fenno. The trustees were directed to pay to each of these for life one third part of the income. The will then expressly provided: \u201cUpon the decease of either of my children leaving issue of his or her body lawfully begotten then such issue shall inherit share and share alike the portion of said real and personal estate to the income of which their parent was entitled be entitled to partition of the real estate and to the portion set off to them on such partition in fee simple and to their rightful share of said personal estate to their sole use.\u201d Accordingly, when said Martha A. Upton died on May 5, 1884, the trustees should have distributed one third of the principal of the trust to her children Myra F. Upton (now Cutler) and Isabelle T. Upton (now Elms) in equal parts. It is also clear that from the death of the testator\u2019s said daughter in 1884 until the death of his widow on October 25, 1898, the income of the remaining trust estate was payable in equal shares to his widow and son.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">The event which has happened, namely the death of the widow after that of the daughter, is not specifically provided for in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>express terms; but an examination of the whole will discloses quite clearly what was the intention of the testator. <em>Metcalf </em>v. <em>Framingham Parish, </em>128 Mass. 370. That he intended to dispose of his entire estate by the will is agreed by all the parties. The widow was to share in the income only, and the will provided \u201cUpon the decease of my wife then my daughter shall be entitled to one half the income of my real and personal estate and my son to the other half of the same.\u201d His two children also were to enjoy only the income of the trust estate. As the recipients of the principal, the persons the testator had in mind were the issue of these children, and it was only in the event of the death of both children without issue that the remainder was to go elsewhere. A reading of the will as' a whole convinces us that the testator intended to treat his two children alike, and that one half of the principal was to go to the issue of Martha A. Upton eventually. On her death they became entitled to one third (or two sixths) by the express terms of the clause already quoted. On the death of the second life tenant, the widow, they became entitled to the remaining one sixth. <em>Sanger </em>v. <em>Bourke, </em>209 Mass. 481. Admittedly the other one half of the estate is to be held by the trustees during the lifetime of the son, James W. Fenno, and the income paid to him. As the entire income of this half, since the death of the widow on October 25, 1898, belongs to him, we see no occasion for making him contribute toward that income the interest on the $10,000, assuming that this question is now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">It fellows from what has been said that the decree of the single justice must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
