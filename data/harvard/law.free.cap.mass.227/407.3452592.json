Writ dated July 15, 1914.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-6\">In the Superior Court the action was tried before <em>Fessenden, </em>J. It appeared that East Fourth Street runs easterly toward City Point and westerly toward Boston proper and at the point of the accident is a straight street in both directions for many hundred feet. In the centre of it are double tracks of the defendant. P Street crosses East Fourth Street at right angles and upon it also are double tracks, which are connected with the tracks on East Fourth Street. The plaintiff\u2019s house was on the southerly side of East Fourth Street and was the fourth house westerly from the corner of East Fourth Street and P Street. In front of a house on the westerly side of P Street facing East Fourth Street at the corner was a white post of the defendant at which all outbound cars stopped. This was known as a \u201cdead stop\u201d and about opposite this white post were switches by which a car could go either to the north or to the south on P street. There was no evidence that the car which struck the plaintiff had passed the white post before striking him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Other material evidence is described in the opinion. At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the judge to rule that upon all the evidence the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. The ruling was refused and the case was left to the jury, who found for the plaintiff in the sum of $700. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-3\"><em>E. P. Saltonstall, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-4\"><em>D. I. Walsh, T. L. Walsh &amp; J. P. Magenis, </em>for the plaintiff, submitted a brief.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b433-5\">Braley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoMs\">The defendant\u2019s counsel states in his brief, that the plaintiff\u2019s statements as to his movements after he left the sidewalk \"are so conflicting and contradictory on all essential points that it is very difficult to summarize his testimony\u201d given in his direct, cross, redirect and recross examination. But the contradictory statements were for the consideration of the jury unless they rejected his entire evidence, and the verdict in his favor must stand if warranted by any material aspect of his testimony. <em>Tierney </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>216 Mass. 283. <em>Kerr </em>v. <em>Shurtleff, </em>218 Mass. 167, 170. <em>Hooper </em>v. <em>Bay State Street Railway, </em>218 Mass. 251, 255. <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Cavanaugh, </em>219 Mass. 281, 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">We are not concerned with the credibility of witnesses, or the weight of evidence, and the jury on the plaintiff\u2019s direct and redirect examination would have been justified in finding, that on the morning of the accident he left his house intending to take an inbound car, and upon reaching the sidewalk on East Fourth Street looked to his right to see if his car, which would come around P Street into East Fourth Street, had arrived, and then looking to his left saw at the other side of O Street an outbound car about two hundred yards away. He then stepped off the curbstone \u201c leisurely in a kind of curved fashion,\u201d and while in the space between the curb and the nearest rail he looked to the left toward the outbound car which had crossed O Street and was about fifty yards away, while the inbound car had stopped \u201cjust around the corner,\u201d at the white post where all cars \u201calways slow up before coming there at all and always stop.\u201d And as the plaintiff, who knew of this custom and \u201ctook this fact into consideration\u201d and \u201cexpected this car to slow up,\u201d kept on his way turning his \u201chead sideways\u201d to look back, he was struck by the outbound car while \u201cjust stepping over there, the outer track.\u201d A further finding would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>been warranted that after he looked the second time, he looked a third time \u201cwhen he was about to step over the second rail and saw the car, and could not tell how far away it was from him, and at that time he had no apprehension of danger. The car struck him right after that; that he was clearing the rail when the car struck him; that he heard the car coming along but heard no bells; that a bell was not rung.\u201d If when pressed in recross-examination he may have substantially contradicted what he previously had said descriptive of his conduct, upon further redirect-examination he testified, \u201cthat at the time when he last looked he could not tell how far away the car was, he felt he could safely get across and kept going along and got hit by the car while starting to cross the further rail, and at that time he started to look around.\u201d It may be as the event proved that the plaintiff erred in judgment. But the jury could say there was no indifference or willingness to take chances which led him to step in front of an oncoming car and to expose himself to the hazard of serious injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"ABB\">A majority of the court are of opinion that it could not have been ruled as matter of law that a pedestrian who attempts to pass diagonally over the tracks of a street railway where the car is seen by him fifty yards away and is expected to slacken speed preparatory to a full stop when crossing the line of intersection of the track and the course of the traveller, is guilty of contributory negligence. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Lexington &amp; Boston Street Railway, </em>205 Mass. 182, 184, 185. <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Old Colony Street Railway, </em>206 Mass. 11, 13. <em>Albee </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>209 Mass. 6. <em>Lunderkin </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>211 Mass. 144. <em>O\u2019Toole </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>211 Mass. 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
