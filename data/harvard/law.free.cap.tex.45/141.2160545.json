Tried below before the Hon. A. P. McCormick.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-14\">In September, 1871, suits were instituted by C. Olfsen, district attorney of the 18th judicial district, against A. W. and E. P. Clegg, and many others, for taxes due by them for occupation and frontier bond tax, before John DeBruhl, a justice of the peace.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-15\">December 5,1871, the district attorney, in behalf of the State, and B. C. Franlin and L. E. Trezevant, in behalf of the defendants, in the suit against Clegg &amp; Clegg, and twenty-four other suits, made an agreement in writing as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ANL\">\u201cIt is agreed that the justice may enter judgment on the hearing without the necessity of calling a jury; that tire judgments shall be entered <em>itto forma </em>for the amounts claimed for the plaintiff in the several cases; that notice of appeal shall be entered in each case by the party against whom the judgment is rendered; that the. said Franklin and Trezevant, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>behalf of their clients, may, by filing appeal bonds, take up one or more of the cases named as test cases to the District Court; that the other cases shall abide the decision of the eases taken up on the first decision of said cases by the Supreme Court; and, in the meantime, no execution is to issue against the other parties defendant in said schedule of cases to which this agreement applies. * * * Should the final decision of the cases on appeal be in favor of the defendants, then the judgments rendered under the agreement shall be set aside by the justice, and the cases dismissed. In case the judgment on final appeal is in favor of the plaintiff, then the the judgment shall stand as final, and execution shall issue thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-5\">\u201c This agreement is made to avoid unnecessary cost and trouble to the courts, the county, and the parties. It is agreed that the cases taken to the District Court may be filed at the present term, now in session, and, with the consent of the court, may be taken up and disposed of at the present term, in order that the questions involved affecting the public interest may be decided as early as practicable by the District and Supreme Courts \u2014 the defense setting up the illegality, irregularity, and unconstitutionality of the taxes claimed from the defendants in the aforesaid suits, the same defense applying to all.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-6\">\u201c The entries of the several judgments shall each refer to this agreement filed with Justice DeBruhl, J. P. (present) Galveston county.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-7\">Under this agreement judgment was rendered in favor of the State in all the cases, and several of the cases were appealed to the District Court and were not decided when fifis case was tried.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-8\">January 4, 1872, Justice DeBruhl issued execution against Clegg &amp; Clegg for all the costs of the suit incurred by both plaintiff and defendants; and on tire 13th January, P. C. Langville, as constable, levied upon three plows, the property of defendants, and worth $14 each.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>May 25, 1872, Clegg &amp; Clegg brought suit against De Bruhl, justice of the peace, Langville, the constable, and Johnson Reed, surety on Langville\u2019s official bond, for damages for the illegal issuance of the execution and the seizure and wrongful appropriation of the property levied on.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ay0\">The defendants insisted upon the validity of the execution, the legal seizure, and regular sale of the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-8\">The judgment was rendered for the defendants, and Clegg &amp; Clegg appealed. The other facts are sufficiently set out in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b151-9\"><em>L. E. Trezevant, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-10\">The court erred in charging the jury, that if the execution was issued after the expiration of ten days from the rendition of the judgment, the jury should find for the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-11\">Appellants submit, that the justice of the peace had no right or authority to issue execution against the defendants for all the cost incurred by both parties in said suit, even after the expiration of ten days, when by agreement of counsel the judgment was to remain in abeyance, to abide a decision to be rendered in a few cases appealed to the District Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-12\">We could not issue execution by virtue of the judgment rendered against the defendants, for the defendant had not been finally cast in said suit, as the judgment was suspended to abide a decision to be rendered in the District. Court.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY6\">That an appeal would have the effect of suspending the judgment there can be no question, and thereby rendering the statute (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 6352, which counsel for appellees refer to) inoperative, which authorizes an execution against the party cast for all the cost incurred by both parties, and an execution could only be issued by virtue of a statute which says: \u201cEach party shall be responsible to the officers of the court for the cost incurred in any suit by himself.\u201d (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 1486.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-14\">Admitting that execution could issue, it could only be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>against the defendant for the cost he himself had incurred, as he was not liable to an execution for all the cost incurred by both plaintiffs and defendant, unless the judgment was confirmed by the District Court. (Sayles\u2019s Prac., sec. 641.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-5\">Query: Suppose the District Court should reverse the judgment of- the justice\u2019s court in the cases appealed as test eases: how would defendant recover his cost from the State?</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-6\">In respect to the judgment, it is as if there was no judgment subsisting until the decision of the District Court confirming it. (Briggs <em>v. </em>Wardwell, 10 Mass. 356.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-7\">Again, appellants submit, that if the justice of the peace has no jurisdiction to issue said execution, he is liable for damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-8\">The issuing of an execution is a ministerial act, and an action will lie against a judge if he award a process which he has no jurisdiction to award. (2 Hilliard on Torts, 168.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-9\">The issuing of an execution is a ministerial act, for which a justice of the peace is liable to the party injured. (Briggs <em>v. </em>Wardwell, 10 Mass., 356; 2 Gray, 570.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b152-10\"><em>Wheeler </em>and Rhodes, for appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Agj\">cited Paschal\u2019s Dig., arts. 987, 1637, 6352; sec. 21, art. 5, of Constitution of 1869; Legg <em>v. </em>McNeill, 2 Tex., 428; Perry <em>v. </em>Robinson, 2 Tex., 491; Cotton <em>v. </em>Campbell, 3 Tex.,. 495; Alley <em>v. </em>Booth, 16 Tex., 94.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A7n\">Ireland, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqc\">The judgment entered in the justice\u2019s court does-not, on its face, preclude the issuance of an execution for costs. The judgment is, \u201cIt is also ordered that no writ of execution shall issue for the principal of said judgment, except on -the condition set forth in the said agreement; but in case of non-compliance therewith by the defendant, then execution shall issue according to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">There was no atteinpt to prove that execution for costs was to be stayed, and certainly the language of the judgment indicates very clearly that the \u201cprincipal\u201d debt was all that was to be stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>It may well be doubted whether, under our law giving officers the right to issue execution for costs on the adjournment of each term of the court, it is in the power of parties litigant to stay execution for costs. If they may do so by the concurrence of the officers of court, it must not be left in doubt whether such assent was had.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">We therefore conclude, that the court did not err in its charge to the jury with reference to issuing execution after the expiration of ten days.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s own testimony negatives the allegation as to the oppressive conduct of the constable; and the finding of the jury on his branch of the case appears to be sustained. Hor is the allegation about a conversion of the property levied on sustained. It is in proof that the property was sold at the court-house door on the day appointed by the constable.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Plaintiff attempted to prove that he kept watch, and that no sale took place between half-past 9 o\u2019clock a. m. and 4 p. m. But one of the watch says that it was a bitter cold day, and that he frequently went up stairs to warm and to listen to an important criminal trial that was going on. He says he was not away from watch exceeding twenty minutes at any one time. It is not improbable that a fair sale could have taken place in twenty minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">It would not consume a very great while to sell three plows. The general doctrine contended for by appellants is not denied. If an officer act corruptly or without jurisdiction,'he might be held liable in damages to the injured party, but this does not present such a case. The property of appellants seems to have been sacrificed from a mistaken judgment on their part of their liability and duty. There is no error in the judgment and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
