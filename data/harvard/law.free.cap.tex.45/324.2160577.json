M. Frost, her deceased husband \u2014 Franklin Pierce Frost and Harriet Ella Frost being minors \u2014 and against J. E. Pettus, J. C. Williams, Sophia and Hathan Mayblum, W. L. Davidson, and others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Az1J\">The petition set up in substance as follows: That she was the wife of S. M. Frost, deceased; that the minors, John W. and Mary Frost, were the children of herself and said S. M. Frost; that the defendants, Miles, Franklin Pierce, Harriet Ella, Henry IT. and Ada, were the children of said S. M. Frost by a former wife, Harriet Frost, deceased. S. M. Frost died February 6, 1866, leaving a will, which was probated; that by the will Virginia was entitled to three fourths of the separate and community estate of S. M. Frost, defeasible upon her marriage or death, the property in that event passing to her children. John W. and Mary were made joint owners with her of block 502 in Galveston; to Miles, Franklin Pierce, and Ella he bequeathed one fourth of the separate and community estate, and block 113 in Galveston. That S. M. Frost died having real and personal estate worth over $50,000; that he was not indebted beyond $1,000. That William E. Kendall, in March, 1866, was appointed executor of the will, and qualified and acted as such till June, 1867, when he was removed. That at June Term, 1867, Kendall accounted with the County Court; that Kendall had paid all the debts and expenses of administration. That on the \u201c 27th June, 1867, all and singular the property of the estate, both real and personal, vested in the devisees of the said S. M. Frost, under his will aforesaid absolutely, subject to no right, authority, power, or jurisdiction whatever.\u201d That nevertheless, and though there was no necessity for further administration, the County Court (without jurisdiction) appointed John E. Pettus administrator <em>pro tan. </em>at the same June Term, and administrator in chief at the July Term, 1867; that Pettus took possession of the estate, and proceeded to exercise authority over the same as adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>trator; that without any real authority, he sold real and personal property of the estate, which was a sacrifice of plaintiffs\u2019 property; that he received large sums of money, and pretended to disburse them; that he sold the lands on Galveston Island, though specially devised; that he resigned his administration, but failed to return any of the property to the plaintiffs or the devisees; that by his acts the same has become a total loss, except a small amount of property received by Virginia; that he charged a large amount of illegal commissions, and that he is indebted to plaintiffs $3,000, for money and property received; that during his administration she was deprived of the use and enjoyment of the estate, and her rights and those of her children disregarded; that though her husband left her a good home, she was compelled by the County Court to accept another place to live on, and the court appropriated $5,000 for her, for which she took lands at a certain price in part payment, and the special legacy to herself and her children was sold and charged to her in part payment. She alleged that \u201c she was a female, and was unadvised and unable to cope with the said John E. Pettus and the wrongful action of the court.\u201d That the plaintiffs were not bound by their acts, nor debarred of their rights to recover the property so squandered. That at the April Term, 1868, the County Court discharged Pettus from the administration, and afterwards appointed J. C. Williams administrator <em>de bonis non </em>with the will annexed, who, as far as he could, took possession of the property and exercised control over it. That he obtained from the court orders concerning the estate, and pretended to make partition and to sell property to divers persons. That he sold the lands of the estate outside of Fort Bend county, and has made pretended titles to the purchasers. That he sold, under orders of the County Court, lands in Fort Bend county which, by the will, were devised to plaintiffs and others. That Henry H. Frost became the purchaser of the land in Fort Bend county; that Mayblum and Davidson purchased other lands, and that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>all pretend to hold under titles from Williams, which were a cloud upon plaintiffs\u2019 title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-5\">That the minors, \u201c Miles, Franklin Pierce, and Ella, should be plaintiffs in this suit, and that plaintiffs should recover with them, as devisees of S.

They alleged that Virginia and her children had a bequest of $1,000; that the estate was solvent, and that a year having elapsed, it was not competent for the court, to retain jurisdiction to pay them what came to them by will, and to increase the expense of the same, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-8\">They alleged, as to the claims, the want of jurisdiction, and particularly that the claim of $15,000, in favor of the heirs of Harriet Head, was not a valid claim, for want of jurisdiction, and that the heirs and devisees were not made parties thereto; that the Sims claim accrued after the death of S. M. Frost.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-9\">At the March Term, 1872, the plaintiffs filed a motion to review and set aside the orders of the County Court and of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>the District Court in the estate, particularly enumerating fifteen orders and decrees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-5\">To tills motion the defendants excepted, and moved to dismiss it on the following grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-6\">1. That there had been no service of it upon any party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-7\">2.

M. Frost was never fully administered, but was still open; that all the debts had not been paid; that the community estate of S. M. Frost and Harriet Frost had been partitioned by decree of the court; that he was in possession of the land purchased by him in good faith; that he bought it for a valuable consideration, at public sale, under a decree of the court, and that the sale had been approved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-12\">He further amended, alleging that the nine hundred and forty-five acres of land in Fort Bend county he bought at the special solicitation of plaintiff, as the result of a compromise arrangement, whereby she was greatly benefited, and that he satisfied a judgment against the estate of S. M. Frost for more than \u00a715,000, and took land not then worth half that amount in satisfaction of it, to save the estate of S. M. Frost from total wreck. That at the time of the purchase there were many unsettled matter's between himself and the estate of H. H. Frost, which he represented as administrator, and the plaintiff and th\u00e9 estate of S. M. Frost, which would involve expensive and protracted litigation and disturb the peace of the family, and that the compromise and agreement resulting in Ms purchase of said land was made at the solicitation of plaintiff\", who was advised by able counsel, &amp;c., and that it was done as a settlement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>family disputes, to prevent litigation and the ruin of Frost\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-4\">He further alleged that the will of S.

Frost had received his full share, and disclaimed any interest therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-5\">To the motion for revision of the orders in probate, the defendants protesting that they ought not he compelled to answer it, filed an answer. They prayed that if the court proceeded to revise the orders, it might revise also the order admitting the will of 8. M. Frost to probate as a void probate, and because the will was obtained to he executed as the result of the undue influence of the plaintiff and her mother upon an old man of seventy, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-6\">At the July Term, 1872, plaintiffs filed an amended petition, wherein they alleged that prior to Kendall\u2019s discharge all the personal property held in community between Frost and his wife Harriet was distributed by Kendall, although no report of it was ever made; that the lands in Fort Bend county held in community between them were also partitioned, and report made but not acted upon by the court, but that the parties went into possession. \"Wherefore they alleged that all the debts were paid and partition made, and that all orders of the court were void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-7\">The defendants (Mayblums) also amended their answer, setting up title to lot No. 513, on Galveston Island, purchased by L. M. Franklin, at public sale by Pettus, approved by the coui\u2019t, and paid for, and the money turned over to Miles, Frank, and Ella, the minors made plaintiffs, and expended for their maintenance and education; \u201cand they say they ought not to he disturbed in their title, but they pray, in the contingency of the setting aside of the sale, they may recover the money paid ($1,375) and interest.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-8\">In 1872, Henry H. Frost, administrator of the estate of Harriet Frost, made himself party to the suit, and alleged that Samuel M. Frost, deceased, after the death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>of his wife Harriet, sold to Kyle and Terry lands, the property of Harriet\u2019s heirs, and warranted the title; that the heirs of Harriet sued Kyle and Terry for the recovery of the land--., and recovered the same; that Kyle and Terry, making the administrator of the estate of S. M. Frost a party in that suit, recovered a judgment upon Frost\u2019s warranty for-; that then, upon the compromise and agreement of all the parties interested in the estate of Frost, it was agreed that the heirs of Harriet should accept the judgment upon the warranty in discharge of the land, and that the estate of Frost should pay that judgment, and that the land of Frost\u2019s estate should be sold to satisfy the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-6\">It was charged that in pursuance of this agreement, the tract of nine hundred and forty-five acres of the Morton league was sold, and bought in by said Henry, as administrator, to pay the debt; all this with the full knowledge, consent, and procurement of plaintiff, (Virginia,) and the warranty was then satisfied.

The land turned over was sixteen hundred and eight acres, in Fort Bend county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-11\">5. We find that there was personal property turned over to the legatees, consisting in corn, amounting to about seventeen hundred bushels, valued at fifty cents, $850.

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>answer and affidavits accompanying it seemed quite sufficient for a discharge of' the writ, if, indeed, there had been any good ground for iti issuance in the first instance. But so far as the record shows, the writ was neither discharged nor made absolute, and no further action seems to have been taken in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"A1z\">The application, in om\u2019 opinion, however, presents no sufficient cause for issuing the writ, and it should have been refused; for, taking the statements made by appellants\u2019 counsel as entirely accurate in every particular, (though it cannot be controverted that there are manifest discrepancies in their recollection of the matters deposed to, and that of the respondent and the parties whose affidavits are filed with his answer,) and viewing them in the strongest possible light, they can amount to no more than that appellant has been deprived of the benefit of a statement of facts on this appeal, by the unnecessary and intentional wrongful adjournment of the court before there had been time within which the statement of facts could possibly have been prepared; and that the judge, for the purpose of depriving them of the benefit of their appeal, had refused, after the adjournment of the court, and also at its next term, to sign and certify a statement of facts, or to give them a bill of exceptions to his action in refusing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">By the statute regulating proceedings in this court, it is enacted that the trial of all cases on appeal \u201c shall be on a statement of facts as agreed upon by the parties or their attorneys, certified to by the judge of the court below; or should the parties fail to agree, then the judge of the court below shall <em>certify the </em>facts; <em>or on </em>a bill of exceptions to the opinion of the judge; or on a special verdict; or on an error \u25a0in law, either assigned or apparent on the face of the record; and in the absence of all these, the appeal shall be dismissed. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 1871.)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The statement of facts and bills of exceptions are required in plain and unambiguous language, as has been frequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>decided by the court, to be prepared and submitted to the judge and signed by him, and filed as a part of the record during the term of the court at which such bill was taken or when said cause was tried. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., arts. 149 and 217-8-9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">To enable this court to try the case on the statement of facts, bill of exceptions, &amp;c., it is made the duty of the clerk of the District Court, immediately on an appeal being taken, to make out a full and perfect record of all the proceedings in such case. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 1494.) And it is the proceedings had in the cause, as shown by this transcript of the record, to which, evidently, we must look on trying the ea:e on the appeal, and not to proceedings had at a subsequent time, or to extraneous evidence showing that by the erroneous or even corrupt action of tire judge presiding on the trial, the proceedings upon which appellant would try the case in this court were not consummated in the court below, or the evidence of them was not authenticated in the manner directed by the statute, so as to become a part of the record. It may be urged that, if this is the case, a corrupt judge may effectually deprive a party of all chance to correct his erroneous rulings by appeal to this court. We think, however, that this is a mistake, and that a strict and vigilant observance of the statutes regulating the practice of the District .Court will be found amply sufficient to secure the rights of litigants, as well against corruption and a willful abuse of .power as unintentional error. If, however, they are not, the remedy must be supplied by the legislative department of the government, and not by an unauthorized extension by this court of its powers and jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">If the judge before whom the case was tried had, in obedience tti the writ of <em>mandamus, </em>certified a statement of facts which had not been presented to the counsel for appellees during the term at which the case was tried, examined, and signed by the judge, or made out and signed by him, if counsel of the parties could not agree, and filed as a part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>the record of the term at which the case was tried, it could not be considered by us in determining the case on this appeal. It follows that the alternative writ of <em>mandamus </em>was improperly allowed, and must therefore be discharged at the cost of the appellants; and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Though the case comes before us without a statement of facts or bill of exceptions, still, if there is error assigned or apparent on the face of the record, or the special verdict found by the jury does not warrant the judgment, it must be reversed. And we are clearly of the opinion that it will have to be reversed on both of these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">1. It is the general practice of this court, in the absence of a statement of factsj not to review the rulings made during the progress of the trial, or the giving or refusing instructions to the jury. The errors of law to which, under such circumstances, we ordinarily look, are those which arise on the sufficiency of the petition or answer; and we will, in disposing of this branch of the case, confine ourselves to the assignment that the court erred in overruling the exceptions to the petition and amended petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">It would be impossible, without extending our opinion beyond all reasonable limits, to give a condensed statement or intelligent summary of appellee\u2019s original and amended petitions, extending through many pages of this voluminous record. We will remark, however, that in the original petition all the proceedings had in the County and District Courts in administration of the estate of S. M. Frost, deceased, subsequent to the removal of W. E. Kendall as executor, are alleged to be absolutely null and void, because, as it is claimed-, said estate had been fully administered by said Kendall, and that therefore the court had no jurisdiction to grant administration <em>de bonis non </em>upon it. While in the amended petition it is sought merely to review and correct <em>en masse </em>the various and heterogeneous orders made by the court in the course of its administration, from the removal of Kendall up to the bringing of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>If we consider the case as made in the original petition\u2014 and it is upon this aspect of it the judgment of the District Court was rendered \u2014 it will be found that it is a suit by the appellees as heirs and distributees of said estate of S. M. Frost, deceased, against one of the parties, to whom it is alleged administration on said estate had been illegally granted, for damages; against other parties, who are now residents of Fort Bend county, to try title to a number of different tracts of land situated in various localities in the State; against others for the partition of the community estate of S. M. Frost, de ceased, and his first wife, Harriet Frost, deceased, and to recover from another defendant, by whom said estate was being administered, the property of the estate in his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">It is evident, we think, from this mere statement of the objects and purposes sought to be attained by the suit, that there is a misjoinder of parties and causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Hor, if we consider the case as presented in the amended petition, is it free from similar objections; nor does it in any respect pursue or conform to the statutory directions for revising proceedings of the County or District Court in matters of probate. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., arts. 480, 1382, 1384, 5771:) And, taking the original and amended petitions together, they are not only objectionable because of multifariousness, but also because inconsistent and contradictory judgments are asked for against various parties having no joint or common interest in the matters to be litigated.</p>\n<p id=\"AI9\">For these, as well as other grounds apparent upon the record, appellant\u2019s general and special demurrer should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">2. Will the special verdict of the jury support the judgment ?</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">On the trial of the case, the com!, at its, own instance, submitted to the jury eight special issues, and refused to submit all those which were proposed by appellants. Upon the verdict returned by the jury in response to the issues thus submitted, and without a general finding, the court decreed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>the County Com\u2019t of Fort Bend county had no jurisdiction of said estate subsequent to June 27, 1867, the date of the removal of W. E. Kendall, the executor named in the will of S. M. Frost, and that all its orders thereafter were null and void. \u201cInasmuch,\u201d says the court, \u201cas the debts of said estate existing at the date of the death of S. M. Frost had been paid, except a small amount, and inasmuch as the personal property of said estate had been partitioned, and the real estate in Fort Bend county divided and delivered to the persons entitled thereto under said will, by virtue of a decree of said court, made at the October Term, 1866, and inasmuch as there appears to have been funds in the hands of the executor to pay the small debt to Baldwin &amp; Williams.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">It might suffice to say, if the grounds upon which the court rests its judgment had been established by the verdict, they would not justify or warrant the conclusion that the-Probate Court had no jurisdiction to grant letters of administration upon said estate after Kendall\u2019s removal. On the contrary, it would appear therefrom that said estate had not been fully settled and distributed among the parties entitled thereto. And whether it was absolutely essential that further administration should be had upon it, or whether it was for the interest of the heirs or'creditors that the administration should be longer continued, certainly it cannot be said that it was not within the power and jurisdiction of the court to grant letters of administration <em>de bonis \u00f1on </em>to complete its full and final settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">An inspection of the special verdict of the jury will also show that it does not. warrant the deductions which the court has drawn from' it and oh which it renders its judgment. The jury find that at the close of W. E. Kendall\u2019s administration of said estate it' owed \u00e1 small amount to Baldwin &amp; Williams. But they do not say that this was. the only debt existing at the dat\u00e9 of Frost\u2019s death which \u2022 said estate still owed. The 'question' to which this response was made directly excludes from consideration'of the jury-debts which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>may have been in suit at the removal of Kendall and subsequently established by judgment as valid claims against said estate. And while the jury find that there had been personal property, as well as lands situated in Fort Bend county, partitioned among the legatees,-they do not find that all the property belonging to the estate had been partitioned. If or was such a finding within the scope of the questions submitted to them by the court. And although they find that the estate was solvent at the time Kendall ceased to administer it, they do not find that there were funds in Ms hands with wMch to pay the debt of Baldwin <em>&amp; </em>Williams; or if so, that he could have legally appropriated them to its payment after he had been removed as executor of the-estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">It is also plainly manifest, from an examination of the several issues submitted to the jury, that they were altogether insufficient to elicit such a verdict as to authorize or warrant the judgment which -was rendered by the court. The. sole ground upon wMch it is claimed that the court did not have jurisdiction to grant administration <em>de bonis non </em>on the estate of Frost, after the removal of Kendall, is, that it had been fully administered. Yet the court refused to submit to the jury tMs precise issue, although asked by appellants; also whether the debts of said estate were all paid, and whether there were suits pending against it at that time. But it submitted to them the immaterial inquiry whether the estate owed Pettus anything when he was appointed administrator. And from other questions propounded, it evidently seemed to suppose, if the debts existing at the time of Frost\u2019s death, which were not in litigation, had been paid, and a part of the property of the estate had been partitioned with the consent of the executor, tire Probate Court had no jurisdiction over the estate or power to grant letters of administration on it, notwithstanding the fact that smts were pending both for and against it, and that no final partition of the entire estate had or could be made until the conflicting rights and liabilities in regard to the matters then in litigation had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>settled and adjusted. It is needless to say that this was a mistake. Most of the issues submitted to the jury by the court were altogether immaterial, and in no way tended to elucidate or settle the matters in controversy between the parties or furnish the basis for a judgment. And upon the most vital and important of them the verdict of the jury is clearly in favor of appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
