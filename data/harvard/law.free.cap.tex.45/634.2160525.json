Probate Sale \u2014 Irregularities.\u2014At the April Term, 1857, of the Probate Court of Kaufman county, an order was made allowing the application of an administrator to sell \u201c the real estate of the decedent, consisting of four hundred and six acres of land,\u201d fixing the time and place of salo, and directing that the sale be \u201c in accordance with law.\u201d The inventory showed that the only land owned by the estate was a tract of four hundred and six acres. The administrator returned an account of sale of four hundred acres, at $2.35 per acre, amounting to $954.10. At the July Term thereafter the court approved the sale, and ordered that the administrator \u201cmake a good and sufficient deed to the purchaser.\u201d The administrator executed a deed, attempting to give field-notes, but misdescribing the land. The purchase-money was paid by the purchaser: <em>Held, </em>(1) That the absence of particular description in the proceedings ordering and approving the sale was at most an irregularity, and not rendering the proceedings void; (2) that the order of sale, sale, confirmation, and payment of purchase-money constituted an equitable title, without deed; and (3) the execution of an imperfect deed did not affect the rights of the vendor.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b642-12\">2.

McBee, deceased, one of the children and heirs of W. H. McBee at the time of his death; and that the plaintiffs were the heirs of the said William E. McBee, who was dead; and that the defendants were in the possession of the land described in the amended petition and claimed by them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b644-8\">The defendant read in evidence an order of sale, the inventory returned by Henry Scoggins, administrator of the estate of William E. McBee, the return of sale by Scoggins, and order of court confirming sale and ordering deed to be made to the purchasers. These proceedings are given in the opinion. Defendants, over objection, read deed of date July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>31, 1857, of Henry Scoggins, administrator of William ET. McBee, for the land described as in the disclaimer to Robert and Mathew Johnson, the purchasers. Mathew Johnson conveyed to defendant Edmiston.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-6\">Defendant Edmiston testified that on or about the day of the date of- the deed from Scoggins, witness saw defendant Johnson pay the purchase-money to Scoggins, who was then the administrator of William N. McBee\u2019s estate; that soon after the date of the deed, witness and one of the Johnsons went into possession of the land under said purchase, and remained in quiet and peaceful possession of the land up to the trial, knowing nothing of the claim of plaintiffs until the filing of their suit; that witness and Johnson believed they had a good title, and that some of plaintiffs resided in the neighborhood and never set up claim to the land before suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-7\">E. P. Chisolm testified that at the request of the Johnsons he attended the sale and bid off the land for them, they taking the deed and paying therefor, as was understood. It also appeared that William ET. McBee owned no other land than that in controversy at his death. Verdict and judgment for defendants. Motion by plaintiffs for new trial was overruled, and they prosecute error to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b645-8\"><em>Robertson &amp; Herndon, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZx\">It will be found on examination of the record that the evidence relied on by defendants to establish their title to the land in controversy is a record of the Probate Court of Kaufman county, containing an order of sale, a report of sale, and a confirmation of sale of the \u201creal estate\u201d of William E\". McBee, deceased; also a deed from Henry Scoggins, administrator of the estate, to defendants. To all of this testimony, plaintiffs objected, 1st, Because the order of sale contains neither a description of the land nor the terms of the sale; 2d, Because the evidence above named does not describe the land in controversy, and is irrelevant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>By an inspection of the order of sale it will be seen that there is no attempt to describe the land ordered to be sold, neither is there any intimation or mention of the terms upon which the sale was to be made. It was left entirely with the administrator what \u201creal estate\u201d he would sell under that order, and upon what terms he would sell the same. The statute is positive in its requirement of what a probate order for the sale of property shall consist. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 1321.) \u201c Every order of sale of real estate shall be entered on the minutes of the court, describe the property to be sold, and the terms of sale.\u201d These two last were not done: 1st, It shall describe the property; 2d, It shall prescribe the terms of sale. In the probate order in question there has been no attempt to comply with the statute. Eeither of the constituent parts of a'probate order is found in this one. It is therefore a nullity, and the sale made in obedience to it a nullity. An order of court made, contrary to the statute is a nullity. (Rorer oh Judicial Sales, secs. 8 and 479; 7 Tex., 242.) It is not stated in the record for what purpose the \u201c real estate \u201d of William E\". McBee was ordered to be sold. It may have been to \u201craise the amount of allowance that may be made under the provisions of the forty-fourth and forty-fifth sections of this act, or for the satisfaction of a mortgage or other Hen .on said land, in which case such sales shall be made on such terms as the Chief Justice may direct.\u201d (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 1322.) If so, the terms of the sale were to be ordered in the sound discretion of the court, and no general order could confer such discretion upon the administrator. (7 Tex., 242.) This is one reason the statute requires the terms of the sale to be prescribed in the order of the court. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 1321.) The administrator is a mere instrument or organ of the court, and has no discretion, nor can tire court delegate powers to the administrator conferred upon it by statute. (7 Tex., 224.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b646-5\">In this case a general order, such as defendants invoked, would confer upon the administrator power to sell all or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>part of the \u201creal estate\u201d of Ms intestate, and also would leave it in his discretion to fix the terms. The order purports to recite the substance of the application. It does not appear by such recital that the court had jurisdiction to order a sale, no cause for such sale being alleged. The court, therefore, had no jurisdiction. The application would have been bad on general demurrer, and therefore the jurisdiction of tMs court could not have attached (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 1314) for requisites of application. (Rorer on Judicial Sales, sec. 71 and note.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b647-6\">Even admitting the order of court not to be void, still it should have been excluded from the jury, together with the report of sale, confirmation of sale, and admimstrator\u2019s deed, because they do not describe the land sued for. The only attempt to describe the lands claimed by defendants in all their muniments of title is the description contained in the administrator\u2019s deed. If this is to be taken as a means of identifying the lands ordered to be sold, then they have set up a title to another tract of land than that sued for- by plaintiffs. An inspection of the descriptions in connection with the plat in the transcript will show, that the two descriptions, the one of plaintiffs contained in the amended petition, and also in the record of partition, and the one of defendants contained in the admimstrator\u2019s deed, show the same beginning corner. Follow out the description of plamtiffs on the plat, and then follow out the attempted description of defendants, as contained in the administrator\u2019s deed, and they do not correspond. The defendants\u2019 description is unintelligible, it is true, but seems to be an attempt to describe land lying adjacent to that of plaintiffs. This administrator\u2019s deed contains the only description by which the defendants attempt to identify the land sold by order of court as the land sued for by plaintiffs. These records, therefore, of the Probate Court, including the administrator\u2019s deed, should not have been admitted as evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b647-7\">The equitable title sought to be established by proving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>payment of the purchase-money by defendants to the administrator must fall with their legal title. Exclude from consideration the administrator\u2019s deed, and the order of sale stands alone as the means of identifying the land claimed. If the order of sale is void, the administrator\u2019s power to sell was void, and he could convey no sort of title, legal or equitable, to the land. The defendants have set up no equitable title in their pleadings, and there are no allegations to let in the proof, and the court should not have permitted the verbal testimony of the payment of purchase-money and entrance into possession. The legal title was all the defendants could rely on in this.suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b648-5\">The land described in plaintiffs\u2019 petition and his title, and the land set up as purchased at the administrator\u2019s sale by defendants is not the same land. If there was a mistake in the description of the land, it could only be corrected by the records, if there is anything to correct by.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b648-6\">To understand that defendant claims one tract of land and plaintiff another, it is necessary to trace the land described by each, and then it will he found that the lands are not the same.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b648-7\"><em>Ferris &amp; Getzendaner, </em>for defendants in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AK9\">cited Lynch <em>v. </em>Baxter, 4 Tex., 431; Flanagan <em>v. </em>Pierce, 27 Tex., 79; Poor <em>v. </em>Boyce, 12 Tex., 449; Bartlett <em>v. </em>Cocke, 15 Tex., 479.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b648-8\"><em>J.

H. McBee headlight, claimed by the appellants as the heirs of W. H. McBee, deceased, and claimed by the appellees (defendants in the District Court) under a sale by the administrator of the estate of said W. H. McBee. The validity of that sale is the main question in the case, the appellants contending that the order of sale does not \u201c describe the property to be sold and specify the terms of sale,\u201d as required by the statute then in force, (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 1321;) and that therefore the order is a nullity, and was erroneously admitted in evidence over their objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The order of sale was made by the County Court of Kaufman county in April, 1857, and is as follows: \u201cThis day comes into court Henry Scoggins, administrator of the estate of W. H. McBee, deceased, and presents his petition, praying for an order to sell the real estate of said deceased, consisting of four hundred and six acres of land; which petition was allowed by the court. And it is further ordered by the court that said sale take place on the first Tuesday in June, A. D. 1857, at the court-house door, in the town of Kaufman, in accordance with law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">The inventory of W. H. McBee\u2019s estate was in evidence, and shows but one piece of real estate, thus described: \u201c406 acres of land, (valued,) at $10 per acre.\u201d In June, 1857, the administrator reports a sale, had in obedience to the order of the court, on Tuesday, the 2d of that month, at the courthouse door in Kaufman, as follows: \u201c400 acres of land, pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>chased by Enoch P. Chisolm for $2.35 per acre, upon twelve months\u2019 credit, with approved security, and mortgage upon said land for the purchase-money \u2014 making it nine hundred and fifty-four dollars and ten cents, ($954.10.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The mistake in the quantity of land (given only in figures) is evidently clerical, the total price or purchase-money being computed for four hundred and six acres. By an indorsement on this return of sale, signed by the chief justice of Kaufman county, it appears that the sale was approved, as farther appears by the following order, made at the July Term of the Kaufman County Court..- \u201cblow comes into court Henry Scoggins, administrator of the estate of W. H. McBee, and presents his sale bill of certain property belonging to said estate, which is hereby approved and- ordered to be recorded. And be it further ordered, that the administrator be required to make a good and sufficient deed to the purchaser.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">It was proven by Chisolm that he bid off the land as agent for Kobert and Mathew Johnson; and it was also in evidence that the Johnsons paid the purchase-money, and went into possession, receiving from the administrator a deed to four hundred and six acres of the W. II. McBee headright, which deed purports to be made in pursuance of the order confirming the sale, and attempts to give the field-notes of the tract conveyed. The field-notes, as given, in consequence of a clerical omission of a few words, fail to properly describe the land; but by comparing them with the field-notes of that part of the W. H. McBee headright allotted to W. H. McBee, which were in evidence, it is plain that the object was to copy the field-notes of the latter tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Without reference, however, to this deed, we think that the order of sale, taken in connection with the inventory, sufficiently describes the real estate ordered to be sold to admit of its being identified; and further, that taken in connection with the general provision of the law, that sales of land for the payment of debts, (save in certain specified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>eases,) shall he made on a credit of twelve months, the terms of the sale were sufficiently specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">In a recent case which was here decided, following the former rulings of this court, which are there referred to, an order of sale, very similar to this in its description of the property to fie sold, was held to be valid. The failure to give a full description of the land in the orders of the court, where sufficient appears to admit of its identification, and the failure to specify at length the terms of sale, where the intention is plain that the sale should be made on the usual terms, are at most mere irregularities, which cannot be held to make the orders and proceedings nullities.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The order of sale, the sale, the confirmation thereof, and the compliance by the purchaser with the terms of sale, (which last is certainly accomplished by the payment of the purchase-money,) constitute an equitable title, sufficient to protect the purchaser, without a deed from the administrator. (Sypert <em>v. </em>McCowen, 28 Tex., 638; Bartlett\u2019s Heirs <em>v. </em>Cocke, 15 Tex., 477.)</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">It follows, from what has been said, that there was a valid sale, sufficient to protect the defendants, notwithstanding any defects in the administrator\u2019s deed, unless the plaintiffs were right in the further objection made to the admission in evidence of these orders and proceedings, that they were,'under the pleadings, irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">The original petition claimed so much of the W. H. McBee headlight league and labor as was located in Kaufman county. The defendants first answered by a plea of not guilty, and afterwards answered specially, claiming 406 acres of the W. H. McBee survey, named in plaintiffs\u2019 petition, giving the same imperfect field-notes that were given in the administrator\u2019s deed, adding, that it was the same land conveyed to them by the administrator, and disclaiming as to any other part of the W. H. McBee survey. The plaintiffs, by an amendment, recite the disclaimer of defendants, and allege that defendants are in possession of the land claimed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>plaintiffs; \u201cthat is to say, that part of said league, set apart and partition thereof to W. E. McBee, containing 406 acres,\u201d giving the field-notes thereof. These field-notes so far correspond with the field-notes of the tract claimed by defendants as to make it evident that the disclaimer of defendants was not intended to apply to the 406 acres, in controversy. The only intelligible construction of defendants\u2019 disclaimer is, that it applied to all of the \"W. H. McBee survey, except 406 acres sold by the administrator of W. E. McBee\u2019s estate. In fact the plaintiffs, in making out their case, produced in evidence the admission of defendants, that the land in controversy, described in plaintiffs\u2019 amended petition, was the property of William E. McBee, deceased, one of the children and heirs of W. H. McBee at the time of his decease; that plaintiffs were the heirs of said W. E. McBee, and that the defendants were in possession of the land described in plaintiffs\u2019 amended petition. The case was tided under pleadings bringing in issue the plaintiffs\u2019 title to this 406 acres of land, and the evidence offered was certainly relevant to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">There is an assignment of error, that the court erred in its charge to the jury, which might be disregarded, as not sufficiently specific.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Whilst the charge of the com\u2019t may be in some respects open to criticism, as not applicable under the pleadings, we find in it nothing calculated to mislead the jury as to the real issues on which they had to pass. Under the evidence the verdict was the only one which could have been properly returned. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
