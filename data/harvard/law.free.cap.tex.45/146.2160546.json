The verdict of tiie jury was ten years for eacli of the defendants : <em>Held, </em>The charge of the court was erroneous and the verdict unwarranted, as the indictment did not charge that the house was entered by violence of any kind.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b154-6\">Appeal from Limestone.

Prendergast.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-7\">Ho counsel for appellants appeared in this court, but the record shows that motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment were made and overruled by the District Court, and the action of the court in this respect was assigned for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b154-8\"><em>George Clark, Attorney General, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2m\">The double penalty seems to have been inflicted in both cases, under the instructions of the court. This has been held as not permissible in the absence of an allegation as to <em>force </em>in the indictment.

It was held by this court in a similar case that to justify the increased penalty, the fact which authorized it to be assessed must be alleged in the indictment; and it not being done, and the court having given ouch a charge, the verdict of the jury would be set aside on account of the error in the charge. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 2367; Hobbs <em>v. </em>The State, 44 Tex., 353.)</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">This opinion applies equally to No. 496, between the same parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
