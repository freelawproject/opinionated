In connection with the conveyance was read the note described.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-11\">J. C. Carroll testified: \u201cI acted for E. W. Dean in closing his account with E. D. Stewart, which resulted in his execution of the trust deed and note in evidence. Stewart owed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Dean about one hundred dollars gold, for which Dean had sued out an attachment, and on 13th October, 1870,1 went with the deputy sheriff, Q-eorge Eowland, to Wilkinson\u2019s place, where Stewart was living as a tenant, for the purpose of making a levy of the attachment, unless the matter should be arranged by Stewart. * * Stewart agreed to execute the trust deed and note, and the costs of the attachment were charged to Stewart, and were included in the note for $120 to Dean. Up to this time, Wilkinson had no connection with the matter. Stewart was unable to pay the debt in cash, but was satisfied that he could pay it by the first of January, and executed the instrument freely and voluntarily. I told him that if he did not pay the debt to Dean by January 1, Wilkinson would have to pay it, and would then own the property absolutely, and he signed it with that distinct understanding. He made figures of his assets and liabilities, and expressed himself as certain of being able to pay Dean\u2019s debt before January 1. I went over the figures with him, and told him he could not pay the debt as stipulated, and that the result must be that Wilkinson would have to pay the debt and retain the projierty, and he signed it'with that distinct understanding. He insisted that he was to have the use of the wagon and team up to the first of January, and Wilkinson said he would lend him that or another wagon. He was Wilkinson\u2019s tenant, and Wilkinson had an interest in his crop, and the wagon and team were needed to gather the crop and get it to market.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-7\">\u201c Stewart was a- poor man, and had no other wagon and team. I heard that Stewart had another horse, and I had intended, if the debt had not been provided for, to levy on the horse or one of the mules. I knew the wagon and mules, or one mule and the horse, were exempt from execution. The wagon was out of rapair at the time, and was on the prairie, not in sight, but the mules were. The wagon was worth about $80 or $85; the mules about $70 each. They had previously been in Stewart\u2019s possession, and I never heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>his title to them questioned. The use and hire of a wagon and team is reasonably worth from $2.50 to $3 per day. Wilkinson paid for the repairs on the wagon.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-5\">Wilkinson, plaintiff, stated about the same facts as to what transpired when the instrument was executed, and added, \u201c1 had no connection with the matter until the instrument was about to be executed. Both Stewart and I understood its effect to be that if he did not pay the debt to Dean by the first day of January, I should do so, and become the owner of the property. I accepted the trust deed with this understanding. I told him I would let him have the use of this wagon or another of mine, and I did let him have mine until this one was repaired. I paid for the repairs. It was distinctly understood that I loaned him the property on my own responsibility, and I stated -to him at the time that if he attempted to take it out of the county, or to dispose of it, I should take it away from him. I was induced to lend him the wagon and team from the fact that he was a poor man and absolutely needed the property to get out his crop. I was also interested in the crop, and this was an additional inducement to lend him the wagon. About Christmas, hearing that Hudson had bought the wagon and team from Stewart, I went to him (Hudson) and told him I had a mortgage and lien upon it. He answered that he knew all about that, and had seen the instrument. Afterwards, on the same day, under the advice of an attorney, I formally demanded the property of Mm in the presence of witnesses, and he refused to deliver it up, saying at the time that he was not after me, but another party, and that I should not lose anytMng by it. I had cotton in Dean\u2019s hands on the 1st day of January, 1871, and I told him to sell it and apply the proceeds to the payment of the debt, and he expressed himself satisfied with the arrangement. Afterwards, about January 12,1 paid him the gold and took up the note. Stewart had bought another horse from a negro \u2014 my father had a lien on Mm\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>and in Hovember, 1870, Stewart gave up the horse for the debt.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-4\">R. W. Dean testified for plaintiff: \u201c On 13th October, 1870, Stewart owed me about $100 gold. I had sued out an attachment against him, and sent Mr. Carroll, with an officer, to collect the debt and costs of attachment, or get the same secured, or to press the attachment. Under the arrangement made by Mr. Carroll, representing me, and Stewart and Wilkinson, I looked to Stewart for the debt up to January 1, and to Wilkinson after that time. Wilkinson had cotton in my hands on 1st January, 1871, and on that day told me to sell it and pay myself. I was satisfied with the privilege, and considered the debt as paid. Afterwards, however, about the 12th January, and before I had sold the cotton, Wilkinson came in and paid me the gold and took up the note. The hire of the wagon and team is reasonably worth from $2.50 to $3 per day.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-5\">Defendant Hudson, for himself, testified: \u201cI had bought the wagon and team from Stewart on the 29th December, 1870, and allowed him what we considered its full value, $205 in gold, as a credit on his account with me. I paid him no money. I had previously seen the mortgage, and bought with a full knowledge of its existence. I would be willing to hire out wagons and teams (the hirer furnishing drivers and paying for them feed) at $1 per day all the time, and would be willing to sell all I had and invest in wagons and teams to do it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-6\">It was agreed that Stewart was a married man and citizen of Burleson county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-7\">The court, among other charges, gave the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-8\">\u201c 3. In the absence of proof of the contrary intent of the parties to the instrument read by the plaintiff, the court instructs the jury that its legal effect was to bind Wilkinson to pay the debt to Dean, if Stewart did not pay it by the 1st of January, 1871, and to make Wilkinson, from that time on, the absolute owner of the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number><em>\u201c </em>4. There is no evidence before you to show that Stewart had any right whatever to the property, unless he had paid Dean\u2019s debt by the <em>1st </em>day of January, 1871.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-4\">The jury found for Wilkinson, and the wagon, worth $80, and the mules $70 each, and the hire at $1 per day froni January 1,1871, to the day of trial, December 14, 1872, for which judgment was rendered. Hudson appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b458-5\"><em>Broaddus, Thomas &amp; </em>Hill, for appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AU4\">cited, Stephens v.

This is, unquestionably, in conflict with the long train of decisions of this court from its very organization, holding that a trust may be engrafted on a written instrument by parol testimony, unless it could be said, as clearly it cannot, that there was. no testimony of this character before the jury to which they should have given any consideration whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>We make no comment upon the facts or the weight which they might have had with the jury. But certainly, in determining whether an instrument is intended to operate as a sale or a security, the fact that it is given on account of a pre-existing debt, that time of payment is extended, the disparity in the amount of the debt and the value of the property, the relative condition and situation of the parties, and pressure brought to bear to induce its' execution, and although the debtor might have succeeded in paying off almost the entire debt before the time fixed for the default, yet the consequences would be the same as if he had paid no part of it, should be considered in determining the real purpose of the parties and the true object intended to be accomplished by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">As was said in the case of Huffier <em>v. </em>Womack, 30 Tex., 332, \u201c the circumstances from which, such contracts have their origin and the object generally intended to be obtained by at least one of the parties being frequently so nearly similar, it is often a matter of considerable embarrassment to say to which of these different classes of contracts a particular transaction properly belongs. Hor is it material what the papers themselves may say on the subject. The question is, what in fact was the contract and agreement of the parties ? If by it there was a continuing obligation against the appellees for the debt, the transaction must be declared a mortgage, although it was expressly stated in the deeds that the debt was fully satisfied, and that it was expressly understood and agreed that the contract was intended as a conditional sale, and not a mortgage; for, whether it is the one or the other, depends upon the construction placed by the law upon the real agreement between the parties, and not on what they have said about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">As the case must be reversed, it is proper for us to say, in view of another trial, that we do not concur in the conclusion which, as we have said, seems to have been taken for granted by the parties, as well as the court, on the former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>trial, that, unless the conveyance from Stewart was a conditional sale of the property to Wilkinson, he could not maintain an action for its recovery; for, although this may not have been its legal effect, we think, it may be held to be a pledge, accompanied with possession, vesting a qualified property in the wagon and mules in Wilkinson, by virtue of which he could maintain an action for their recovery against the real owner wrongfully detaining them, against Ms consent or against any one coming into possession from the owner with notice. But, in that case, the party making such pledge, or any one he might authorize to do so, could redeem the pledge at any time by tendering the debt and cost and damages incurred by Ms previous wrongful detention of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"AeG\">We may also remark that if Wilkinson had become the absolute owner of the wagon and mules by payment of Stewart\u2019s note to Bean, although he would have been entitled to recover for their hire, it was not proper to estimate the hire by proof of the value of their hire by the day. Such proof furnishes no reasonable criterion for an estimate for the length of time the jury were called upon to assess Mm. The result attained from such evidence glaringly exMbits its impropriety. It would have, been only an exaggeration in degree, but not more objectionable in principle, if the hire by the hour had been proved, and the aggregate amount fixed, multiplying this amount by the number of hours the wagon and mules had been detained.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Appellant, however, made no objection to the character of evidence, and the verdict is even more moderate than it might have been on Ms own testimony; therefore, although it is evidently erroneous, and was clearly calculated to induce an excessive verdict, it can hardly be said to be an error for wMch he could ask a reversal of the judgment, if in all other respects it was free from objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The judgment .is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
