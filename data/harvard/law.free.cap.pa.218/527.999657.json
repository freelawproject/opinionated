If it does anything it tends to open in this indirect way the defense in this case; the fact that twenty years ago there may have been pools of water upon this land cannot be relevant here, the witness having sworn prior to this flood there was no water course there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-7\">Objection sustained and evidence excluded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-8\">To which ruling by the court counsel for the defendant except and at their request this bill is sealed.

We expect to pay you for all the damage we have done \u2014 and we will. Just hold on and don\u2019t be in a hurry, and we will settle with you.\u201d This to be followed by other evidence that this corporation afterwards instructed their trestle gang, or railroad gang, to go to that ground and remove those piles as quickly as possible, as they were liable for the damages sustained by the farmers as long as they were in there. This for the purpose of showing the corporation\u2019s own admission of their negligence. That the officer referred to as meeting Mr. Matteson on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>ground is Mr. Crowley, superintendent of the Pennsylvania division of the New York Central Railroad.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-4\">Counsel for the defendant object to this offer as incompetent and immaterial. \u25a0 It is an effort to show a statement by a subordinate officer, or agent of the company, not shown to have any authority to bind the company for any such purpose, neither is it shown the character of the supervision which the agent or officer had. It is not shown whether he is general superintendent, division superintendent, or. the extent of his authority or that he had any authority whatever to adjust claims or to bind the company in this regard. This offer is further objected to for the reason that in the main it is an effort to show the opinion of some unknown officer or agent of the company as to facts claimed to be irrelevant to this case, and that the evidence offered is incompetent for the further reason that it is an attempt to get the opinion of a witness not shown to have authority to speak.on the subject and not shown to have been on the ground when the damage is alleged to have occurred, and, who, therefore, cannot know of the cause of the damage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-5\">Objection overruled.

The case presents no peculiar features, and does not call for a general review. It is enough to indicate the specific errors committed on the trial which require a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">W. J. Ballou, a witness called by plaintiff, testified as to how the plaintiff\u2019s land was affected by the flooding, which he said was occasioned by the defendant\u2019s structure, and gave his estimate of the damage. He described how it had been washed, and the size and extent of the gullies and depressions which resulted. On cross-examination it was proposed to ask this witness whether, before the building of the bridge complained of, the land was not subject to overflow, and whether there were not at that time depressions on it and ponds four or five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>feet deep. The offer was excluded on the ground that it was an attempt to introduce defendant\u2019s case by way of cross-examination. However much it was in line with what defendant proposed to prove subsequently by way of defense, it was none the less entirely competent by way of cross-examination; and it was error to exclude it.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\">The plaintiff was permitted under objection to testify to certain admissions by the division superintendent of the defendant company at a later day, as to the cause and extent of the damage done to the land. This was not by way of contradiction, but as substantive testimony. \u201c The rule is well settled, \u201d says Sharswood, J., in Penna. Railroad Company v. Books, 57 Pa. 339, \u201cthat what an agent says while acting within the scope of his authority, is admissible against his principal, as part of the res gestae, but not statements or representations made by him at any other time. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Like error was committed in allowing another witness for plaintiff, under objection, to testify to certain directions given by the defendant\u2019s supervisor of bridge work, for the removal of the piles which it is claimed caused the obstruction in the stream and the flooding of plaintiff\u2019s land. While the avowed purpose of the offer was to show admission by the company that the piles were the property of the company, a matter not in dispute, the inference the jury would most likely have derived from it, would have been an implied admission of negligence in having the piles where they had been placed. The evidence was inadmissible for such purpose. Repairs made after an accident do not in themselves give rise to a presumption of negligence: Baran v. Reading Iron Co., 202 Pa. 274. The evidence should have been excluded. The eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Judgment reversed, and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
