J., described the accident as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-12\">The plaintiff was employed by the defendant to operate a machine for the pressing of pieces of leather. The machine was of simple construction, consisting of two metal rolls revolving toward each other in' open view, the motion being-imparted by belt, pulley and cog gearing- operated from a line shaft, a loose pulley being also provided to stop the machine by a shifting belt moved from operating pulley to the loose pulley.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-13\">The machine was also provided with a foot treadle, by which the space between the rolls was so regulated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>they could be made to revolve quite close together, or could be separated as much as an inch. At the time of the injuries complained of the foot treadle was fastened to the floor, and the belt was made to shift on to the loose pulley by the use of a stick or a piece of leather or other substance held in the hand of the operator, or by his hand alone being placed against the belt, and in that way the machine put out of gear and the motion of the rollers stopped.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-4\">The leather was fed into the rollers from a horizontal table by the hands of the operator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-5\">Charles W. E. Best, the plaintiff, had been in the employ of the defendant for some three weeks on this machine; was twenty-three years of age and a person of ordinary intelligence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-6\">When he began his employment he was instructed by the foreman how to operate the machine, but was not instructed how to clean the rolls. During this employment he frequently stopped the motion of the machine by shifting the belt to the loose pulley, at times, by using his hand, or by using a stick or a piece of leather, as most convenient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-7\">The plaintiff, on the day of the injuries complained of, was directed by the foreman to clean the rolls so that russet leather might be rolled without soiling. The plaintiff proceeded to clean the rolls from the front by the use of waste without stopping the motion of the machine. The waste caught in the rolls was pulled in between them and with it the right hand of the plaintiff, whereby his hand was crushed and injured. He was released by the foreman, who was near by, stopping the machine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-8\">The court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-9\"><em>Error assigned </em>was refusal to take off nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b235-10\"><em>II. T. Ames, </em>of <em>Ames &amp; Ilammond, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ACKo\"><em>Olarenee E. Sprout </em>and <em>John E.

The plaintiff\u2019s action in attempting to clean the rolls while they were in motion was an unnecessary and voluntary exposure to manifest danger, for the consequences of which his own negligence is alone responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"Azc\">Judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
