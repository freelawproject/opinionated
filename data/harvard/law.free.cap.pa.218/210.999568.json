Any provision which does that is sufficient, and the inquiry whether large or small, equal or unequal, vested or contingent, present or future, is irrelevant and outside the jurisdiction of the courts except so far as it tends to throw light on the question of intention.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b242-7\">Testatrix after having made provision for her children in the last clause of her will declared as follows: \u201cI declare this to be and contain my last will and testament, and that after-born children are herein provided for.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the provision for after-born children was sufficient.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b242-8\">Argued March 26,1907.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AEd2\">Appeal, No. 120, Jan.

All that the statute requires is that the testator <em>\u201c </em>shall have the child in mind and shall make clear his intention that the will shall apply to it. Any provision which does that is sufficient, and the inquiry whether large or small, equal'or unequal, vested or contingent, present or future, is irrelevant and outside the jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>tion of the courts except so far as it tends to throw light on the question of intention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">In the present case the testatrix prevented all doubt as to her intention by the express declaration in her will that \u201c after-born children are herein provided for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
