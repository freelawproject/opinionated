We affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-22\">The facts as they appear from the government\u2019s case<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> indicate that in March, 1968, the gas station owned by Edward Doran, the government\u2019s chief witness, was robbed and approximately $3500 was taken. Unable to borrow money from commercial lending institutions, Doran, who wanted to replace the money quickly, went to Vincent Zito and obtained a loan of $3500, agreeing to pay $175 per week. It subsequently developed that this $175 represented 5% per week interest alone. Late charges of 1% per day were assessed for delayed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1403\">*1403</page-number>payments, and if an installment was missed, the entire $175 plus accrued late charges was treated as a new loan with a resultant increase in each weekly interest payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-4\">Doran was hard pressed to meet these installments and soon fell behind. In April, 1968, he went to his wife\u2019s parents and they agreed to lend him $1400 to give to Vincent Zito. Later that summer Doran obtained a $4000 second mortgage on his home, the proceeds of which he also gave to Vincent Zito. Nevertheless, by the fall of 1968 Doran told Zito that he was broke and could pay nothing more. Not long after, an associate of Vincent Zito\u2019s named Andy Strauss contacted Doran. Strauss, who had been living in Zito\u2019s house since March, 1968, claimed that \u201cVinnie\u201d Zito had told him to enlist Doran in a planned truck hijacking, which would enable Doran to raise money to help pay off the loan. Doran eventually agreed to participate in this and other illegal ventures for the purpose of raising money to pay to the Zitos.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-5\">Despite these efforts, by February, 1969, Doran\u2019s debt had climbed to $13,000. Unable to make further payments, and afraid for his safety, on March 11, 1969, Doran left New York for Wyoming. While he was thus in hiding, Vincent and Anthony Zito and one Danny Zippfel met with Mrs. Doran, her father and her brother. Mrs. Doran testified that the Zitos told her that her husband \u201cbetter come back because he couldn\u2019t run away from them. No matter where he ran they would find him. And they wanted their money.\u201d Mrs. Doran said that this meeting ma&lt;je her \u201cupset\u201d and \u201cafraid.\u201d She also testified to a later phone conversation with Joey Zito, brother of Vincent and Anthony Zito and an unindict-ed co-conspirator, where Joey said that \u201cthey\u201d would be coming out to see her if her husband did not return. A few days later, after being told of these conversations by his wife, Doran returned home to New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-8\">Doran continued to borrow money from relatives and to work at various jobs until November, 1969, when he learned that a warrant had been issued for his arrest in connection with his part in the robbery of a Long Island bank with Strauss and several others. Doran turned himself in to the police and eventually agreed to work with the FBI by supplying information about his dealings with Anthony and Vincent Zito. Pursuant to this agreement, he subsequently participated in two conversations with Anthony Zito in a Times Square restaurant which were taped by the FBI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-9\">At the trial in addition to Edward Doran the prosecution called Mrs. Doran, Paul Gattus (Mrs. Doran\u2019s brother), Grace Gattus (Mrs. Doran\u2019s mother), Barbara Ahearn (Edward Doran\u2019s sister), Virginia Rogers (Edward Doran\u2019s cousin), and Raymond Rogers (Virginia Rogers\u2019 husband). These witnesses testified to statements made by Doran, paralleling his direct testimony, concerning the nature of his loan from the Zitos, his attempts to repay it, and the Zitos\u2019 threats of what would happen if he failed to make the payments. Appellants assert that this testimony about consistent out of court statements by the government\u2019s chief witness served only to corroborate and bolster his direct testimony. They contend that such statements were inadmissible under the usual rule that prior consistent statements can only be introduced after a charge that a witness\u2019s story is a recent fabrication and where the statements were made before any motive to fabricate developed. Felice v. Long Island Railroad, 426 F.2d 192, 197, 198 (2d Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 820, 91 S.Ct. 37, 27 L.Ed.2d 47; United States v. Fayette, 388 F.2d 728, 735 (2d Cir. 1968); United States v. Sherman, 171 F.2d 619, 622 (2d Cir. 1948), cert. denied sub nom. Gimaldi v. United States, 377 U.S. 931, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1404\">*1404</page-number>69 S.Ct. 1484, 93 L.Ed. 1738; Proposed Federal Rules of Evidence, 801(d)(1) (B) (submitted to the Supreme Court in November 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-4\">Examination of the record convinces us that these statements were admissible. The defense attorney\u2019s opening statement to the jury <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and his persistent inquiries during the cross-examination reflected an intense interest in the fact that Doran had committed many crimes in his attempts to raise money for the Zitos for which he had not been indicted. In this manner \u201cthe defense at least suggested to the jury that [the prosecution\u2019s principal witness] hoped for clemency for himself, and that his trial testimony was a fabrication, as a reward for which he hoped to go unwhipped of justice.\u201d People v. Singer, 300 N.Y. 120, 123, 89 N.E.2d 710, 711 (1949). A trial judge normally has great discretion in determining if a prior consistent statement is authorized to rebut a defense charge of recent fabrication, Felice v. Long Island Railroad Company, 426 F.2d 192, 198 (2d Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 820, 91 S.Ct. 37, 27 L.Ed.2d 47, and we cannot say here, in light of the obvious motive to falsify, that the trial judge erred in drawing the inference that the defense had suggested that Doran had concocted his story to escape punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-11\">Appellants also object to another part of the testimony by Doran\u2019s relatives on a different ground. They claim that the testimony which reflected on Mrs. Doran\u2019s state of mind during the period of her husband\u2019s dealings with the Zitos should have been excluded.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While admitting that where the alleged crime is related to extortion the fearful state of mind of the victim (here Edward Doran) is relevant, Nick v. United States, 122 F.2d 660, 671 (8th Cir. 1941), cert. denied, 314 U.S. 687, 62 S.Ct. 302, 86 L.Ed. 550, they assert that testimony concerning Mrs. Doran\u2019s fear is irrelevant to any issue in the case and should have been excluded because of its purportedly highly prejudicial impact on the jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree with this conclusion. Where an effort has been made to frighten a victim of extortion by intimidating his wife and using her as a conduit through which to pass threats to her husband, we cannot say that the introduction of evidence as to her reactions is error. Mrs. Doran\u2019s state of mind under such circumstances was surely relevant to the state of mind of her husband who was the subject of the extortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1405\">*1405</page-number>Appellants raise two objections based upon the trial court\u2019s allegedly improper admission of evidence concerning Andy Strauss\u2019 activities. They assert that it was error to allow testimony by Edward Doran about statements made by Strauss because there was insufficient independent evidence linking him to the Zitos which would allow the inference that Strauss was their agent or a co-conspirator in the extortion scheme. Because of this asserted failure adequately to connect Strauss\u2019 actions with the Zitos, appellants also contend that Strauss\u2019 illegal activities constituted a separate and distinct conspiracy and that the introduction of evidence concerning this unconnected conspiracy was prejudicial and constituted reversible error. We need not tarry long over these contentions since we find adequate evidence in the record linking Strauss with the Zitos. For example, it appears not only that Strauss lived with the Zitos for much of the period with which we are concerned, but also that he and .Doran met inside Vincent Zito\u2019s apartment on the day of the bank robbery and went from there to join the other robbers. Later, Anthony Zito secured an attorney to represent Doran in defense of the bank robbery charge which grew out of this illegal activity with Struass. Thus, no error was committed in permitting evidence of Strauss\u2019 actions in the Zitos\u2019 trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-5\">As a final matter, appellants claim that the judge committed error in allowing Doran to testify that he was frightened when Anthony Zito mentioned the name of \u201cCarmine\u201d during one of the taped conversations because \u201cCarmine\u201d was reputed to be a tough character. There is no merit to the contention that the government was putting a third person\u2019s reputation in issue or trying to prove guilt by association. We agree that the government was merely attempting to prove that the mention of the name \u201cCarmine\u201d was a veiled threat by Anthony Zito. As such it was certainly admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1464-23\">. The defendants did not call witnesses or testify in their own defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1466-5\">. Defense counsel argued to the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-6\">I think you are going to find Mr. Doran to be a man who committed not one but a number of crimes and when the noose came around Ms neck \u2014 I think we will prove to you that he reached out for assistance, said that he would cooperate with the Government and he chooses [sic] two boyhood friends and ho walked away from a heinous bank robbery, where his co-defendants received 15 years, with a suspended sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1466-7\">. Mrs. Doran was allowed to testify that during her meeting with the Zitos while her husband was in Wyoming she was \u201cupset . . . sick . . . [and] afraid.\u201d She also testified that she had told Joey Zito over the telephone, when talking to him about her husband\u2019s absence, that \u201cI was afraid.\u201d Finally, during Grace Gattus\u2019 testimony about the $1400 loan to the Dorans, she stated that her \u201cdaughter [Mrs. Doran] was very upset; she was crying.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1466-13\">. Appellants also claim that the statements concerning Mrs. Doran\u2019s state of mind involve hearsay and should have been excluded on that basis. Of the examples cited by appellants, only the testimony by Mrs. Doran that she had told Joey Zito during their telephone conversation that she was afraid involved an <em>out </em>of court statement offered for its truth. However, the statement was introduced to show Mrs. Doran\u2019s state of mind at the time and thus falls within the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule so long as her mental condition is a relevant issue.
