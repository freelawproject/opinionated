Levet, <em>District Judge, </em>finding him guilty of accepting a bribe as an IRS agent, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(c) (1970).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal Lipton claims error in the limitation of cross-examination of a codefendant, in the admission of hearsay evidence, in the prosecutor\u2019s reference in summation to the failure of the defense to call witnesses, and in the failure of the prosecutor to produce material claimed to be required by the Jencks Act or Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963). Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-9\">This prosecution, like several others involving corruption among IRS agents in the New York City area, developed from evidence given to federal authorities by William Williams, a corrupt Westchester County taxpayers\u2019 representative.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When arrested by agents of the IRS Inspection Division on January 22, 1970, after an 18 month undercover investigation, Williams confessed to the bribing of various IRS agents and provided authorities with the names of agents involved. Lipton was one of the agents implicated by Williams. He testified as the chief government witness at Lipton\u2019s trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1225-12\">The bribe here involved arose as the result of an examination by the IRS of the 1960-64 corporate tax returns of a family-owned chain of grocery and meat markets controlled by five Shallo brothers, as well as the brothers\u2019 individual returns. In June 1966, after two years of investigation, Walter Haber, the revenue agent who conducted the field audit, disallowed all deductions claimed by the corporations for purchases allegedly made for cash from wholesale suppliers on the ground that such deductions were insufficiently supported. In addition, he rejected the brothers\u2019 explanation as to the source of approximately $10,000 in their bank accounts and attributed that sum as income to the corporations and the brothers. After recomputing the corporations\u2019 and the brothers\u2019 individual returns, Haber assessed deficiencies (hereinafter, \u201cthe deficiency\u201d or \u201cthe deficiency assessment\u201d) totalling $275,000, plus penalties of $4,000, against the corporations and the Shallos.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-13\">In August 1966, the Shallos were introduced by a mutual friend to Williams. At that time he was representing taxpayers before the IRS. The Shallos had become dissatisfied with the accountant who had represented them during the field audit. They retained Williams to represent them in administrative proceedings to reduce the deficiency assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-14\">Williams first filed a protest with respect to the field audit. He claimed that the revenue agent had not allowed deductions for the wholesale purchase of produce by the corporations, but had permitted the corporations to be taxed for income derived from the retail sale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>produce. In addition, acting pursuant to IRS regulations, Williams by-passed a hearing in the conference section and filed a protest with the Appellate Division. Under this procedure the assessment made by the field agent would be reviewed by an Appellate Conferee who had authority to increase or decrease the taxpayers\u2019 deficiency assessment. Sometime thereafter, Williams was informed by the Appellate Division that Joseph Lipton, appellant herein, had been assigned as Appellate Conferee. Although Williams and Lipton had been colleagues for 8 to 10 years while Williams was with the IRS, the record does not indicate that Lipton\u2019s assignment to this case was pre-arranged by Williams or was other than fortuitous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">In January 1967, Williams first met with Lipton to discuss the Shallo case. Williams informed Lipton that the Shal-los were gathering letters from their suppliers to substantiate the deductions for cash payments. There is no evidence that at this first session there was any suggestion of a bribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-5\">Sometime during the spring of 1967, however, Williams\u2019 efforts to reduce the deficiency shifted to illegal means. While there is a conflict between the testimony of James Shallo, the only one of the five brothers who testified, and Williams as to the details of the negotiations <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it is clear that by August 10, Shallo had agreed to pay a bribe of approximately $15,000 to \u201csomeone downtown in the Appellate Division\u201d. While Lipton agreed to accept this sum, it appears that Williams never divulged the corrupt agent\u2019s name to Shallo. Sometime between August 10 and August 15, Williams obtained from Shallo a paper bag containing $13,000. On the afternoon of the same day, Williams met with Lipton at a downtown restaurant and gave Lipton the $13,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-10\">On August 16, Lipton gave Williams a set of forms by which the IRS offered to reduce the deficiency from $279,000 to approximately $20,000, plus $4,000 in interest and penalties. On August 18, Williams returned to Lipton the forms which had -been signed by the taxpayers to indicate their acceptance of the IRS offer. The reduced assessment was paid and the ease was closed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-11\">Following Williams\u2019 arrest in January 1970, the indictment against him and Lipton was returned May 13, 1970. The trial of Lipton began December 7, 1971 and was concluded December 13, 1971 when the jury found Lipton guilty on the bribery count. Lipton did not testify at his trial and did not present any evidence. He was sentenced January 14, 1972 and has been enlarged on bail pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-4\">Lipton contends that the district judge unduly limited his trial counsel\u2019s scope of cross-examination of Williams.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree. Our careful examination of the entire record leaves us with the firm conviction that Lipton\u2019s counsel was given ample opportunity to cross-examine Williams and that Judge Levet\u2019s rulings were well within his discretion as the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">Brief reference to certain of the testimony preceding the cross-examination of Williams will place in context Lipton\u2019s claim that his cross of Williams was unduly curtailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">James Shallo, the government\u2019s first witness, testified on direct regarding the amount of the deficiency assessment and the payment of the bribe.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On cross, Shallo admitted that Williams never named Lipton as the corrupt agent, that he never met Lipton and that he did not see Williams give the $13,000 to Lipton.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-7\">The government next called Williams. On direct, he testified to his version of the bribe negotiations <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the reduction of the deficiency assessment from $279,000 to $24,000. He further testified that for his services the Shallos paid him a fee of $3500 \u2014 one $500 check, a second $1,000 check, and $2,000 in cash. He insisted that this fee constituted the sole payment to him in the case, and that the full $13,000 from the Shallos was given to Lipton. On cross, defense counsel sought to establish that Williams retained the $13,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-15\">It was at this point that the first challenged ruling was made. Defense counsel asked Williams if the cash \u201cyou received from James Shallo was not paid to Mr. Lipton but was retained by you ?\u201d Williams answered in the negative, volunteering that he would not lie because it would subject him to a charge of perjury. Defense counsel then asked him who would decide whether a perjury charge was to be brought. The government objected. Judge Levet sustained the objection as to form and relevancy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1227-16\">Lipton contends that the judge erred in sustaining the objection. He argues that the jury could have inferred from Williams\u2019 answer that he might seek to ingratiate himself with the federal authorities in the hope of leniency, in the six pending bribery cases in which he had pleaded guilty, by testifying falsely against Lipton without risk of prosecution for perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-17\">We appreciate the force of Lipton\u2019s argument that with a witness such as Williams considerable latitude on cross should be permitted to show motive, bias and interest. And we note that the government with commendable candor concedes, Government Brief 7, that \u201cthe answer might have added support for the argument that Williams was beholden to the Government\u201d. But we completely agree with the government\u2019s further ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>servation that \u201cLipton had already made this point ad nauseum\u201d. <em>Id. </em>Cross-examination of Williams covers 68 pages of the trial transcript \u2014 more than a quarter of the total testimony. Lipton\u2019s counsel established over and over again Williams\u2019 interest and motive in cooperating with the government. To have permitted him to testify in substance that it was the United States Attorney who would determine whether he should be prosecuted for perjury, all else aside, would at best have been cumulative on the issue of bias. See United States v. Russo, 442 F.2d 498, 503 (2 Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1023 (1972); cf. United States v. Campbell, 426 F.2d 547 (2 Cir. 1970). In a slightly different context (withholding a portion of an IRS report claimed to be relevant on the issue of the motive and bias of a government witness), Judge Hays in <em>Campbell </em>stated the criteria for the trial judge\u2019s exercise of discretion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApHa\">\u201cIn determining whether the trial judge has abused his discretion in limiting the introduction of such [impeaching] evidence, the issue is whether the jury was otherwise in possession of sufficient information concerning formative events to make a \u2018discriminating appraisal\u2019 of a witness\u2019 motives and bias.\u201d 426 F.2d at 550.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">We hold here that the jury was otherwise in possession of more than sufficient information on the issue with respect to which it is claimed the excluded testimony would have been relevant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">The next challenged ruling on cross of Williams is that the judge sustained an objection to a question as to whether Williams had told an IRS inspector two years earlier that the audit in the Shall\u00bb case was \u201cridiculous\u201d. The judge, in sustaining the government\u2019s objection, stated that \u201c [i]t doesn\u2019t in any way impeach his testimony, nor does it refresh his testimony or anything else\u201d. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-9\">This line of cross was directed at Williams\u2019 initial protest with respect to the field audit based on the claim, referred to above, that the revenue agent had not allowed deductions for the wholesale purchases of produce by the corporations but had permitted the corporations to be taxed for income derived from the retail sale of produce. Defense counsel had already cross-examined Williams at considerable length to establish that the revenue agent disallowed all wholesale cash pureh\u00e1ses of produce. Elsewhere on cross, counsel had established that Williams based his protest on the inconsistency in the agent\u2019s refusal to allow sufficient cash purchases to create the volume of sales on which he based the corporations\u2019 taxable income.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-10\">In the light of this previous testimony by Williams on cross regarding errors allegedly made in the field audit, the exclusion of his characterization of the audit as \u201cridiculous\u201d, even if relevant, surely would have had little if any additional impact on the jury. We hold that the judge\u2019s ruling was well within his discretion in determining the proper scope of cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-11\">Lipton\u2019s final challenge to the judge's rulings on Williams\u2019 cross-examination is an argument \u2014 asserted on appeal for the first time in appellant\u2019s reply brief\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>that the judge erred in sustaining Williams\u2019 claim of privilege against self-incrimination with respect to \u201cmatters not pertaining to this indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">Williams claimed this privilege on cross-examination regarding the amount of the fee he received from the Shallos. Williams had testified, as indicated above, that he received a total fee of $3500: $1,500 in checks and $2,000 in cash. He conceded, however, that he may have told agents of the IRS Inspection Division that he received only $1,500 in cash. Defense counsel then asked Williams if he reported the cash as income. In response to this question, Williams claimed his Fifth Amendment privilege. The judge sustained the claim, stating that \u201cYou have a right to raise the Fifth Amendment here as to matters not pertaining to this indictment.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-6\">We fail to see any probative value to Lipton\u2019s defense in Williams\u2019 answer to this question, had he been directed to answer. Clearly, it is unrelated to the issue for which it is claimed by Lipton\u2019s counsel on appeal, namely, whether Williams passed on to Lipton the $13,000 given him by James Shallo.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> At most, it may be said to relate to Williams\u2019 credibility. But, as we have held above, the issue of Williams\u2019 credibility was exhaustively covered by defense counsel. We therefore hold that there was no error in the judge\u2019s excluding Williams\u2019 answer to the question, \u201cDid you report the cash as income?\u201d This related to a collateral matter bearing at most on the credibility of the witness. Even if relevant, the answer would have been cumulative.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1229-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-11\">Lipton next contends that the district judge erred in allowing in evidence the alleged hearsay testimony of Lawrence Ruggiero, an IRS agent, that in December 1968 and in September 1969 Williams admitted that he had paid a bribe to Lipton on the Shallo case. This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-12\">Defense counsel on cross-examination of Williams asked whether he had ever told certain people prior to his arrest that he had paid off Lipton. Williams replied in the negative. Defense counsel pressed the matter further and obtained an admission from Williams that he had mentioned the pay-off to Rug-giero. The government then called Rug-giero as a witness. He testified that, while posing as a corrupt IRS agent during the investigation of Williams, the latter discussed with Ruggiero other IRS agents who had accepted bribes and who could be consulted on deals. During the course of these conversations, Williams told Ruggiero about the bribe he had paid to Lipton on the Shallo case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-13\">At the outset, we note that Lipton did not object at trial to the admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>sion of Ruggiero\u2019s testimony as hearsay; indeed, he conceded that it was admissible as a prior consistent statement by Williams. It is true that Lipton\u2019s trial counsel did interpose a general objection to the admission of Ruggiero\u2019s conversation with Williams, which objection was promptly overruled; but of course this was insufficient to preserve for appeal the presently asserted hearsay claim. Moreover, Lipton did not request the instructions which he now claims should have been given; nor did he object to the judge\u2019s charge on the subject. Under these circumstances, the short answer to Lipton\u2019s claim is that he is precluded from raising it for the first time on appeal, since it was not plain error. United States v. Indiviglio, 352 F.2d 276, 279-80 (2 Cir. 1965) (en banc), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 907 (1966), and many other cases to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">Even if a proper objection at trial had been made, however, we would find no error in the admission of Ruggiero\u2019s testimony. It was admitted for the limited purpose of rehabilitating Williams by showing that, at a time when he had no motive to lie, he made statements consistent with his testimony at trial. 4 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1128, at 203 (3d ed. 1940). The testimony was admitted, not for the truth of the matter asserted, but simply to show that prior consistent statements were made. United States v. DeLaMotte, 434 F.2d 289, 293 (2 Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 921 (1971); United States v. DiLorenzo, 429 F.2d 216, 220 (2 Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 950 (1971); United States v. Grunewald, 233 F.2d 556, 566 (2 Cir. 1956), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 353 U.S. 391 (1957). Moreover, the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> made without objection by defense counsel, adequately informed it of the limited purpose of such testimony. United States v. DiLorenzo, <em>supra, </em>429 F.2d at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-10\">Lipton further contends that his privilege of not testifying was violated by the prosecutor\u2019s comment in summation upon the failure of the defense to call witnesses to support its theory that agent Haber had maliciously inflated the field audit.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This claim is without merit for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-11\">First, we have held that the prosecutor may comment upon the defense\u2019s failure to call witnesses- to contradict the government\u2019s case. United States ex rel. Leak v. Follette, 418 F.2d 1266, 1268-70 (2 Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1050 (1970). Nor does this case fall within the exceptions to that rule where, for example, the defendant alone has the information to contradict the government\u2019s case, <em>Leak, supra, </em>418 F.2d at 1269-70, or where the jury will \u201cnaturally and necessarily\u201d interpret the summation to be a comment upon the defendant\u2019s silence, <em>Leak, supra, </em>418 F.2d at 1269; United States ex rel. D\u2019Ambrosio v. Fay, 349 F.2d 957, 961 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 921 (1965). Here, the prosecutor specifically referred to the failure of the defense to call Haber or Ragni, without any reference to Lipton\u2019s failure to testify himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-12\">Second, the remark by the prosecutor here in question was fair rejoinder to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>fense counsel\u2019s argument in summation that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-5\">\u201c[T]here is testimony in this record that Mr. Ragni and Mr. Haber didn\u2019t get along. I think the phrases were that Mr. Ragni wouldn\u2019t cooperate in the course of the examination. The result was a whopping deficiency assessment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1231-6\">We have so held. United States v. Tortora, 464 F.2d 1202, 1207 (2 Cir. 1972); United States v. Leeds, 457 F.2d 857, 860 (2 Cir. 1972); United States ex rel. Leak v. Follette, <em>supra, </em>418 F.2d at 1269-70; United States v. Mattio, 388 F.2d 368, 371 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 390 U.S. 1043 (1968); United States v. Feinberg, 140 F.2d 592, 595 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 322 U.S. 726 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-7\">Finally, the instruction given by Judge Levet immediately after the statement in question,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> to which defense counsel did not object, cured any prejudice to Lipton. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Briggs, 457 F.2d 908, 911-12 (2 Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-9\">Lipton\u2019s final contention is that the district judge erred in failing to direct the government to produce certain material required by the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500 (1970), or Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963). We reject this contention as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-10\">At the conclusion of the direct examination of the witness Ruggiero, the government produced, in compliance with the Jencks Act, portions of a transcript of tape recordings of conversations, see page 1167, <em>supra, </em>between Ruggiero and Williams on December 19, 1968 and September 10, 1969 relating to Lipton.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> After Lipton\u2019s counsel cross-examined Ruggiero concerning these documents, they were offered as full exhibits by Lipton\u2019s counsel and were allowed in evidence by the judge. After reviewing these documents, moreover, and at the request of Lipton\u2019s counsel, the judge ruled that they should have been produced while Williams was on the stand. The judge therefore ordered the government to produce Williams the next day for further cross-examination by Lipton\u2019s counsel. When court resumed the next day, however, defense counsel stated that \u201cI [have] reviewed all of the circumstances\u201d and \u201cI withdraw my request for the production of Mr. Williams.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-15\">Aside from the two documents referred to above, defense counsel brought out on his cross-examination of Ruggiero that he had had about 60 recorded conversations with Williams during the 18 month undercover investigation of Williams while Ruggiero was posing as a corrupt agent; that Williams had told Ruggiero about 40 corrupt IRS personnel; and that Williams had said he never held back bribe money from an agent with whom he was dealing. Regarding the latter, defense counsel and, at his request, the judge asked Ruggiero whether that conversation had been recorded; he responded that \u201c[i]t may have been recorded or it may have been the first time that I met him\u201d. Defense counsel then asked the prosecutor \u201cwhether there is a record of that conversation\u201d, to which the prosecutor responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know, Your Honor.\u201d This subject was never thereafter pursued by defense counsel. At no time did he ever ask that a record of such conversation, if there was one, be produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-16\">Under these circumstances, we hold that there is no basis in this record for Lipton\u2019s claim on appeal that his rights under the Jencks Act or under <em>Brady </em>were violated. There was nothing whatsoever in the direct examination of either Williams or Ruggiero which touched upon alleged corruption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>agents other than Lipton. The judge permitted a broad scope of cross-examination of Ruggiero on the basis of the \u00a7 3500 material produced and on the issue of whether any other \u00a7 3500 material existed. Lipton expressly withdrew his request that Williams be recalled for further cross in the light of exhibits D and E in evidence. With respect to the possible existence of the only other recorded conversation about which defense counsel inquired, his failure to demand its production or otherwise to pursue the matter in the trial court precludes his claiming error with respect thereto on appeal. Finally, for aught that appears before us, any record, if there were one, of a conversation in which Williams said he never held back bribe money from an agent can hardly be said to qualify as \u201cevidence favorable to [the] accused\u201d. <em>Brady, supra, </em>373 U.S. at 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-4\">We have considered Lipton\u2019s other claims and find them without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1225-11\">. Lipton also was indicted for accepting a gratuity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 (g) (1970). Pursuant to the judge\u2019s instructions, the jury did not render a verdict on the gratuity count (Count Four), since it convicted Lipton on the bribery count (Count Three). Lipton was sentenced to a one year term of imprisonment and was fined $2500.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1225-15\">. For 20 years prior to his retirement in December 1965, Williams had been an IRS special agent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1225-16\">. Williams was indicted as a codefendant with Lipton. He was charged with giving Lipton a bribe (Count One) and a gratuity (Count Two) in connection with the $13,000 payment at issue here, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201(b) and (f) (1970). Prior to trial, Williams pleaded guilty to the bribery count. His case was severed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1226-6\">. Shallo testified that in the spring of 1967 Williams told him that he could \u201ctake care of [the deficiency] with someone downtown in the Appellate Division\u201d for $5,000 and that the deficiency would be reduced to \u201cpractically nothing\u201d. When Shallo said that he wanted to \u201cgo through the courts and fight it out in the open\u201d, Williams estimated that the legal costs would be $50,000 to $60,000. Sometime in July, Williams returned and told Shallo that the amount required to fix the case had increased to $15,000-$18,000. Shallo indicated a willingness to pay a bribe but objected to the amount. After Williams made a phone call, he told Shallo that for $13,000 the deficiency would be reduced to practically nothing. To this Shallo agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-8\">Williams testified, on the other hand, that Lipton had initiated the bribe attempt in May 1967 when he offered to reduce the assessment from $279,000 to $25,000 in return for a payment to Lipton of $25,000, or approximately 10% of the savings. Williams told Lipton that the Shallos could not afford such a large sum. Lipton insisted that such sum was required because he \u201chad to take care of somebody on the inside\u201d. After several meetings in June, July and August, Lipton agreed to accept $15,000, a figure to which Shallo, after meeting with Williams, also agreed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1226-13\">.

The following is the testimony and colloquy immediately preceding the ruling in question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-12\">\u201cQ. Mr. Williams, isn\u2019t it a fact that the cash which you received from James Shallo was not paid to Mr. Lipton but was retained by you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-13\">A. Definitely not. I, certainly at this stage of the game, wouldn\u2019t get up here and perjure myself. I\u2019m in enough trouble as it is without having a perjury rap on top of a bribery rap.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-18\">Q. Who would make that determination, Mr. Williams?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-19\">The Court: Who would make what determination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-20\">Mr. Fitzpatrick: [Asst. F.S. Atty.l Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-22\">Q. About a perjury rap.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-23\">Mr. Fitzpatrick: I object to the form of the question, Your honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-24\">The Court: Sustained, not merely to the form, but because it is irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-25\">Q. Did an inspector ever say to you, Mr. Williams, that if he believed you weren\u2019t telling the truth, he would cause you to be prosecuted for perjury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-26\">Mr. Fitzpatrick: I object to that, Your honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-28\">The Court: Sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1228-6\">. Lipton also contends that the judge improperly limited his attempts to establish Williams\u2019 bias by asking him whether he had accused other agents of accepting bribes. This claim is wholly without merit. Aside from the fact that the government\u2019s objections and the judge\u2019s rulings were addressed only to the form of the questions, the record shows that this information was fully developed in subsequent questioning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1228-7\">. \u201cA. [Williams] : I caused a protest to be filed based on the fact that the revenue agent hadn't allowed any cash purchases for produce, and if they had sales, they had to have purchases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-14\">Q. [\\V]ere the totals of cash purchases you computed greater than the purchases allowed by the revenue agent in his examination?</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-15\">A. The total of cash purchases as represented by the letters that were sent out and returned by the suppliers was greater; yes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1229-7\">. Lipton\u2019s counsel erroneously contends that this line of cross-examination related to the $13,000 bribe money. As we read the trial transcript, the reference is to the cash \u2014 $1500 or $2000 \u2014 paid as part of Williams\u2019 fee of $3500.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1229-8\">. Lipton claims that AVilliams, by testifying as a government witness, waived his privilege against self-incrimination, specifically with respect to questions regarding his own income tax returns. Appellant\u2019s heavy reliance on Brown v. United States, 356 U.S. 148 (1958), is misplaced. <em>Brown </em>involved a contempt conviction of a <em>party </em>to the suit who, having taken the stand on her own behalf, refused to answer questions on cross-examination. The decision does not stand for the proposition for which it is cited by appellant, namely, that a <em>witness, </em>by giving testimony, waives his privilege against self-incrimination as to any and all questions asked on cross-examination. The Supreme Court specifically held that its decision was not that broad. 356 U.S. at 155-57. See Hett v. United States, 353 F.2d 761, 764 (9 Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 905 (1966); United States v. Coil, 343 F.2d 573, 579-80 (8 Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 821 (1965); Smith v.

Judge Levet charged the jury on this matter as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-6\">\u201cIf you find that the statements by Mr. Williams were also made at a time prior to which a suggested motive would have arisen, particularly here before the arrest, then you may consider these prior statements by Mr. Williams on the question of whether or not he really had any motive to lie in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1230-7\">.
