KAUFMAN, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Kaye, a Yale law school student, instituted this proceeding to recover alleged damages in the amount of $1615.94 for loss of his expected 1970 summer earnings with the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (the Agency). Jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court below granted summary judgment for defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-21\">In the summary judgment context of this case, the following facts are undisputed: In December, 1969, Kaye wrote to the Agency about employment opportunities during the summer of 1970.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The acting personnel officer of the Agency responded on January 23, 1970.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On February 3, 1970, Kaye\u2019s application for a student assistantship was received by the Agency. On April 1, 1970, defendant Zimmerman, assistant personnel officer of the Agency, called Kaye by telephone to inform him that he had been selected to participate in the summer employment program, starting in June. On April 3, 1970, defendant Adams, personnel officer of the Agency, wrote to Kaye, informing him of his selection and en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>closing forms for Kaye to complete and return in connection with security clearance and stating specifically that that clearance was required <em>\u201cprior </em>to appointment\u201d (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The forms were completed by Kaye and received by the Agency\u2019s personnel office no later than April 15, 1970.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> During April and May, Kaye assumed that he had his summer job.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On May 28, 1970, Kaye telephoned the Agency to inquire about when he was to report for duty. He was told that the security investigation had not been completed and that, therefore, the date upon which his employment was to commence had not yet been determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">On June 4, 1970, Kaye moved to Washington, D. C. During June, he several times called the Agency to check on the progress of the security investigation, each time being told that the security investigation had not been completed. Kaye asserts in his affidavit, and appel-lees do not deny, that upon each such occasion Kaye was led by. Mrs. Zimmerman to believe that \u201cstarting arrangements would be finalized within a few days . \u201d and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-13\">[r] dying on the continued assurances . I refrained from seeking or accepting other summer jobs and remained in Washington, D. C., to be in a position to start work immediately upon notification by the Agency that clearance had been secured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-14\">On July 1 or 2, 1970, Mrs. Zimmerman notified Kaye by telephone that the security investigation would take at least another thirty days. Kaye informed Mrs. Zimmerman at that time that he would find other employment. He then contacted the office of his Congressman, the Honorable Claude Pepper. When an administrative assistant to the Congressman inquired of the Agency about the matter, defendant Adams told her that if Kaye\u2019s security clearance were not re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>ceived by July 15, 1970 (or, at the very latest, by July 30, 1970), there would not be sufficient time remaining in the summer for Kaye\u2019s employment to be beneficial either to the Agency or to Kaye. On August 10, 1970, Kaye having been given security clearance, Adams wrote to Kaye, informing him of this fact and asking whether Kaye desired \u201cto accept our offer of employment.\u201d Kaye declined by reply letter dated August 12, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Prior to granting summary judgment for defendants and denying Kaye\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment, the District Court granted a protective order staying discovery by Kaye. The District Court was silent as to the reasons for its discovery or summary judgment rulings. However, its entry of judgment for defendants necessarily rested upon a holding that the Government did not incur any legal obligation to Kaye.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2585 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">No person shall be permitted to enter on duty as such an officer, employee, consultant or member of advisory committee or board, or pursuant to any such detail, and no contractor or subcontractor, or officer or employee thereof shall be permitted to have access to any classified information, until he shall have been investigated in accordance with this subsection and the report of such investigations made to the Director, and the Director shall have determined that such person is not a security risk or of doubtful loyalty. Standards applicable with respect to the security clearance of persons within any category referred to in this subsection shall not be less stringent, and the investigation of such persons for such purposes shall not be less intensive or complete, than in the case of such clearance of persons in a corresponding category under the security procedures of the Government agency or agencies having the highest security restrictions with respect to persons in such category.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Citing that statute the Government contends that the Agency could not have entered into a contract with Kaye prior to his security clearance. But the Government ignores that it is undisputed that authorized governmental officials made a promise, subject only to security clearance, of a summer job to Kaye, a law student, and that Kaye has filed herein a sworn statement that he was told that the \u201cusual starting date for summer students\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was in June; that he turned down other summer employment; and that he made himself available in Washington, D. C. for summer work at the conclusion of his law school work in May-June. Kaye asserts that the Government should reasonably have expected him so to rely and act and that the Government also knew that Kaye planned to return to law school in August-September. \u201cContracts are written, and are to be read, by reference to the norms of conduct and expectations founded upon them.\u201d Greene v. Howard University, 134 U.S.App.D.C. 81, 412 F.2d 1128, 1135 (1969). Viewing the existing record in this case, and reading it most favorably from Kaye\u2019s point of view, as this Court must do in the context of determining whether the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment should have been granted, Kaye was entitled to pursue appropriate discovery and to attempt to prove the existence of a subsidiary promise by the Government to exercise its best efforts in good faith to complete or to have completed the security clearance with regard to Kaye as reasonably promptly as possible. It is true that the Agency\u2019s promise of employment was conditioned upon security clearance, and that therefore performance of the terms of that promise did not become due unless and until such clearance was obtained. But if as Kaye asserts, the Government\u2019s conduct added up to an additional, implied promise to have the security check completed with reasonable speed, then at the time Kaye forwarded the clearance documents on April 15, 1970, the Government would have had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>duty to act with all reasonable speed to complete or to have completed the security check not only before the summer employment period was almost over but, if reasonably possible, before it started. Additionally, Kaye was entitled to the opportunity to establish that the Government induced Kaye\u2019s reliance by its implied promise and that therefore the Government cannot be permitted to avoid its duty to perform under that promise. <em>Cf. </em>Restatement of Contracts \u00a7\u00a790 and 91 (1932); Tentative Draft of Restatement of Contracts 2d (1965); 1 S. Wil-liston, Law of Contracts \u00a7 140 (3d ed. 1957) and (rev. ed. 1936); 1A A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 193-209 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">On remand, Kaye should be permitted to engage in appropriate discovery and otherwise to pursue his quest for relief herein in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-7\">. The Government calis attention to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(d)(2) which provided before its amendment in 1964:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">(d) The district courts shall not have jurisdiction under this section of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-11\">(2) Any civil action or claim to recover fees, salary, or compensation for official services of officers or employees of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-12\"><em>See </em>Gordon v. United States, 126 F.Supp. 847 (E.D.Ark.1954). But 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3346(d) has provided since 1964:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-15\">(d) The district courts shall not have jurisdiction under this section of any civil action or claim for a pension.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-16\">As such it does not derogate from the jurisdiction granted by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346 (a) (2), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-17\">(a) The district courts shall have original jurisdiction, concurrent with the Court of claims, of :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-19\">(2) Any other civil action or claim against the United States, not exceeding $10,000 in amount, founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress, or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.
