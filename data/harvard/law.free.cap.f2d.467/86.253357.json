He also argues insufficiency of the evidence and that collateral use of wiretaps pursuant to an allegedly unconstitutional statute requires reversal of his conviction on Counts One and Three (sale of heroin contrary to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174) and Two and Four (sale of heroin not in a tax paid stamped package in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4704(a)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant had previously been convicted in the Southern District of New York for the illegal transportation of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-17\">Appellant\u2019s insufficiency of the evidence argument is readily disposed of, since it is premised upon our giving no weight whatsoever to the testimony of a paid government informant who testified to sales to him by appellant of 20.78 grams of 98.4 per cent pure heroin on December 3, 1969, and 19.95 grams of 86.5 per cent pure heroin on January 12, 1970, each sale for $1,000. While the sales were not directly observed by any special agents of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, the informant, one Bennett, was searched by them immediately before he entered and immediately after he left appellant\u2019s store, \u201cThe Little 5 &amp; 10,\u201d in Astoria, Queens; in each instance he went into the store with the cash and no heroin and returned with no cash and the above-mentioned drug, the first time in a box of Esquire shoe polish and the second time in a taped-up \u201cNewsweek\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>magazine handed him by appellant. In the case of the first sale, the agents observed appellant in the store speaking to the informant, although the transaction itself was not observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Appellant argues that the evidence of his possession<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was circumstantial only and that we should adopt the Fifth Circuit rule that the inferences to be drawn from that circumstantial evidence must preclude every reasonable hypothesis which is consistent with innocence. United States v. Davis, 443 F.2d 560, 564 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 945, 92 S.Ct. 298, 30 L.Ed.2d 260 (1971); United States v. Casey, 428 F.2d 229, 231 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 839, 91 S.Ct. 78, 27 L.Ed.2d 73 (1970); <em>see </em>Whaley v. United States, 362 F.2d 938, 939 (9th Cir. 1966). However, this court has consistently rejected the reasoning of these cases, most recently in United States v. Taylor, 464 F.2d 240, 244 (2d Cir. 1972), which regarded Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 139-140, 75 S.Ct. 127, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954), as repudiating the Fifth Circuit view. <em>See also </em>United States v. Siragusa, 450 F.2d 592, 596 (2d Cir. 1971); United States v. Grunberger, 431 F.2d 1062, 1066 (2d Cir. 1970). Moreover, in this case, in addition to the circumstantial evidence deriving from the agents\u2019 observations of Bennett\u2019s entering the store only with cash and leaving only with heroin, there was the direct testimonial evidence of Bennett, the informant, himself. Regardless of any unreliability stemming from the informant\u2019s own participation in the drug traffic, or his refusal to testify at appellant\u2019s first trial (which resulted in the reversal referred to in note 1, <em>supra), </em>the jury was entitled to believe him and his testimony is not to be treated as \u201cvirtually useless\u201d in the words of appellant\u2019s brief, or totally to be disregarded in weighing the sufficiency of the evidence. Thus, in any event, we do not have a case calling for a determination of the applicability of the Fifth Circuit standard because the case is not one solely of circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">Appellant makes three arguments concerning his sentence, and were .a panel of this court facing them for the first time, resolution would prove difficult. The first is that the statute in effect at the time of the offense, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237, providing a minimum of 5 years and no parole, was repealed and that accordingly he should have been sentenced under the Act of 1970,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. This contention \u2014 and by implication appellant\u2019s subsidiary equal protection argument<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 has been disposed of by previous decisions of this court. United States v. Ross, 464 F.2d 376, 378 (2d Cir., 1972); United States v. Singleton, 460 F.2d 1148 (2d Cir., 1972); United States v. Fiotto, 454 F.2d 252, 254-255 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 918, 92 S.Ct. 1769, 32 L.Ed.2d 117 (1972).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>But appellant does not rest his sentence arguments on this point alone. Counsel contends that a 20-year sentence without parole \u2014 subjecting appellant to at least 14 years <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in prison \u2014 is violative \u25a0 of the eighth amendment as cruel and unusual punishment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This argument, too, has been dealt with adversely by this court in the past. United States v. Ross, <em>supra, </em>464 F.2d at 381; United States v. Lozaw, 427 F.2d 911, 917 (2d Cir. 1970). <em>See also </em>United States v. Drotar, 416 F.2d 914, 916 (5th Cir. 1969); Sperling v. Willingham, 353 F.2d 6, 7 (7th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 962, 86 S.Ct. 1591, 16 L.Ed.2d 675 (1966); Stewart v. United States, 325 F.2d 745, 746 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 937, 84 S.Ct. 1344, 12 L.Ed.2d 301 (1964). Appellant argues that by repealing the no parole provisions of old \u00a7 7237 of Title 26, Congress indicated that the older statute was arbitrary, excessive and, since serving no useful purpose, unnecessary \u2014 even for a second offender like appellant. But while appellant would find some solace in the language of the opinions of Mr. Justice Brennan <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Mr. Justice Marshall <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972), the other opinions there supporting the majority holding, as well as the dissenting opinions, give no support to appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>claim. . In any event, in light of this court\u2019s previous decisions, appellant\u2019s argument will have to be addressed to other ears than our own.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Appellant also attacks the sentence on the ground that the criteria used by the sentencing judge were insufficient since he said that \u201chis disposition would be to impose the same sentence\u201d that was imposed at the time of appellant\u2019s first trial on. the present charges. The judge added, the complaint runs, \u201cCertainly that is a ceiling on what I can do, and if there is to be an appeal, and there is a possibility of a third trial, I would be limiting the discretion of the next judge by doing anything less.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court also commented to counsel that counsel \u201ccould not commit the defendant at this moment\u201d to not taking an appeal. In connection with taking an appeal, due process requires that a defendant be freed of apprehension of retaliatory motivation on the part of the sentencing judge. <em>Cf. </em>North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 725, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969). The sentencing judge here, however, as the sentencing minutes go on to make plain, was concerned with the seriousness of the offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">And while Juries aren\u2019t infallible, there has been a Jury verdict and we are dealing with a non-addict heroin seller. I think that is one of the most serious crimes there is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">Well, I am inclined to think that the 20 is fair. I gave 30 a while ago on a second offender where it was a two kilo sale. These are smaller sales, but the heroin still goes out in the street to corrupt other people\u2019s children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-10\">I\u2019m sorry, Mr. Fiore, to be harsh, but I am doing what I think is proper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">While the sentencing judge\u2019s reference to an appeal and possibly a second retrial was unfortunate, we take the view that it was not the determining factor in the imposition of the 20-year sentence. Rather, he was sentencing a heroin dealer as at the very least a second offender<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to a harsh sentence because the crime was \u201cone of the most serious crimes there is,\u201d one that \u201ccorrupt[s] other people\u2019s children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">On the basis of United States v. Whitaker, 343 F.Supp. 358 (E.D.Pa., 1972), appellant argues that Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control Act, 18 U. S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-20, is unconstitutional and that since an in-court voice identification (made by Agent Byrne in connection with a tape recording of a December 4, 1969, conversation introduced into evidence) rested in part upon Byrne\u2019s subsequently hearing appellant\u2019s voice on conversations monitored under the Act,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the conviction was invalid, presumably because the exhibit was improperly admitted. The evidence was, however, that Byrne\u2019s identification had an independent origin including four telephone calls in November and December of 1969 on which occasions the informant Bennett was talking to appellant and Byrne was either sharing the receiver or listening with a stethoscope-like receiver. Moreover, the informant also identi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>fied appellant\u2019s voice on the December 4, 1969, tape recording and there is no suggestion that the foundation for his identification was tainted by illegal wiretaps. So saying, we do not reach the question of the constitutionality of Title III here.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b149-12\">. Appellant was sentenced to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment on Counts One and Three and 5 years\u2019 imprisonment on Counts Two and Four, all sentences concurrent with the sentence on Count One. This was his second conviction in connection with the instant charges, the first having been reversed and remanded in United States v. Fiore, 443 F.2d 112 (2d Cir. 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b150-6\">. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 requires, <em>inter alia, </em>proof of receipt, concealment, purchase or sale <em>and </em>possession. <em>See </em>Turner v. United States, 396 U.S. 398, 90 S.Ct. 642, 24 L.Ed.2d 610 (1970) (statutory inferences of unlawful possession and of knowledge of illegal source upheld).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b150-7\">.

That as opposed to persons convicted for crimes after the effective date of the repealing act, who are eligible for parole after serving one-third of their sentences, appellant is denied equal protection of the law. <em>Cf. </em>Furman v.

(1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b150-16\">. The Supreme Court has granted certiorari in United States v. Bradley, 455 F.2d 1181 (1st Cir.) cert. granted, 407 U.S. 908, 92 S.Ct. 2438, 32 L.Ed.2d 682 (1972), and presumably will answer appellant\u2019s argument, for which there is support in the Ninth Circuit, United States v. Stephens, 449 F.2d 103 (9th Cir. 1971), one way or the other.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b151-6\">. The 20-year sentence would be reduced by credit for time already served, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3568, and for good time credits earned, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4161.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b151-7\">. Appellant\u2019s counsel was successful in persuading two members of this court sitting en banc that Martin Sostre\u2019s solitary confinement was cruel and unusual punishment. See Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178, 206, 207 (2d Cir. 1971) (en banc), cert. denied, Oswald v. Sostre, 405 U.S. 978, 92 S.Ct. 1190, 31 L.Ed.2d 254 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b151-8\">. In determining whether a punishment comports with human dignity, we are aided also by a second principle inherent in the Clause \u2014 that the State must not arbitrarily inflict a severe punishment. This principle derives from the notion that the State does not respect human dignity when, without reason, it inflicts upon some people a severe punishment that it does not inflict upon others. Indeed, the very words \u201ccruel and unusual punishments\u201d imply condemnation of the arbitrary infliction of severe punishments.</p>\n<p id=\"A0e\">408 U.S. at 274, 92 S.Ct. at 2744.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">The final principle inherent in the Clause is that a severe punishment must not be excessive. A punishment is excessive under this principle if it is unnecessary: The infliction of a severe punishment by the State cannot comport with human dignity when it is nothing more than the pointless infliction of suffering. If there is a significantly less severe punishment adequate to achieve the purposes for which the punishment is inflicted, cf. Robinson v. California, <em>supra, </em>[370 U.S. 660] at 666, [82 S.Ct. 1420, 8 L.Ed.2d 758]; id., at 677 [, 82 S.Ct. 1417] (Douglas, J., concurring); Trop v. Dulles, <em>supra, </em>[356 U.S. 86] at 114 [79 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 630] (Brennan, J., concurring), the punishment inflicted is unnecessary and therefore excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-15\">408 U.S. at 279, 92 S.Ct. at 2747.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b151-16\">. Perhaps the most important principle in analyzing \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishment questions is one that is reiterated again and again in the prior opinions of the Court; <em>i. e., </em>the cruel and unusual language \u201cmust draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\u201d Thus, a penalty which was permissible at one time in our Nation\u2019s history is not necessarily permissible today.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-17\">408 U.S. at 329, 92 S.Ct. at 2772.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-18\">Third, a penalty may be cruel and unusual because it is excessive and serves no valid legislative purpose. Weems v. United States, <em>supra. </em>The decisions previously discussed are replete with assertions that one of the primary functions of the cruel and unusual punishments clause is to prevent excessive or unnecessary penalties, <em>e. g., </em>Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U.S., [130] at 134 [25 L.Ed. 345]; O\u2019Neil v. Vermont, 144 U.S., [323,] at (339-340, 12 S.Ct. 693, 36 L.Ed. 450) (Field, J., dissenting); Weems v. United States, 217 U.S., [349] at 381, [30 S.Ct. 544, 54 L.Ed. 793]; Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459 [, 67 S.Ct. 374, 91 L.Ed. 422] (1947); these punishments are unconstitutional even though popular sentiment may favor them.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-19\">408 U.S. at 331, 92 S.Ct. at 2773.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b152-7\">. Of course, if United States v. Bradley, note 5 <em>supra, </em>is reversed on the grant of certiorari, the eighth amendment question may not be reached.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b152-8\">. This was apparently a reference to the doctrine established by North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969), that following conviction on a retrial sentence may not be greater than on the first trial, so as to free a defendant of any apprehension of retaliatory motivation on the part of the sentencing judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b152-13\">. The judge noted that the presentence report revealed that appellant was in prison on a state narcotics charge from 1957 to 1965 and that in fact he had two state convictions and served the sentences simultaneously.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b152-14\">.
