F.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2) and (3); Gaito v. Ellenbogen, 425 F.2d 845 (3d Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">The broad and conclusory statements made in plaintiff\u2019s complaint are not supported by specific factual allegations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, the complaint fails to meet the test set forth in Ne-grich v. Hohn, 379 F.2d 213 (3d Cir. 1967), that a complaint must specifically state facts in support of its conclusions in order to avoid a motion to dismiss. See Kauffman v. Moss, 420 F.2d 1270 (3d Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">The order of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1012-16\">. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint contains the allegation that \u201cDefendant . . . took away plaintiff\u2019s Legal-document (Notes of Testimony), for same was in plaintiff\u2019s personal belongings prior to plaintiff sitting on the bench in the Guard-Room.\u201d This may have occurred on or about May 2, 1971, when plaintiff was being \u201ccom-mittecl to the punishment block.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
