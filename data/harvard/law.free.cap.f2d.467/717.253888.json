Gordon, father of a mentally retarded son, is a Government employee and, as such, is insured under a group accident and health policy issued by the defendant Aetna Life Insurance Company, extending coverage for Civil Service employees and their dependents. The policy provides, in part, coverage for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-6\">\u201cMental and nervous disorders. In addition to other covered services and supplies, charges for the following services, including group therapy and collateral visits with members of the patient\u2019s immediate family, are allowable expenses when rendered in accordance with specific instructions by a doctor specializing in neurosurgery or psychiatry who has charge of the overall psychiatric care of the patient:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-7\">\u2022Day care in a qualified day care center</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-8\">\u2022Night care in a qualified night care center</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-9\">\u2022Services of a qualified psychologist</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-10\">\u2022 Services of a psychiatric nurse (R.N.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-11\">\u2022Services of a qualified psychiatric social worker\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"amj-dedup-0\">but excludes charges for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Arm\">\u201cCustodial care. Custodial care is the provision of room and board \u2014 with or without routine nursing care, training in personal hygiene and other forms of self-care, or supervisory care by a doctor \u2014 for a person who is mentally or physically disabled as a result of retarded development or body infirmity and who is not under specific medical, surgical, or psychiatric treatment to reduce his disability and to enable him to live outside an institution providing custodial care. This exclusion applies even when the custodial care is provided by a hospital. However, if confinement in a hospital is required because of a concurrent condition (whether related or not) which does require medical or surgical treatment by a doctor, the difference between the normally allowable hospital expenses and the customary charge for custodial care will be considered as allowable expenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-14\">Anticipating the placing of his son under specialized residential care, Gordon inquired of the defendant as to coverage for expenses incurred in connection with possible institutionalization of his son at three designated institutions. The defendant replied, in part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-15\">\u201cThe Devereaux School is most familiar to us since we pay a substantial amount of claims to them. It has been our experience that half of the monthly charge is covered as medical treatment, and half of the charge is not covered as education and training. Of the half that is covered, we pay 60% of that as room and board and 40% under other hospital services. So, in the final analysis, we pay about 40% of the total monthly charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-16\">\u201cEach claim from the Woods School is handled separately depending on the treatment rendered each child. However, I would say that generally we pay about 50% of the total monthly charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-17\">\u201cThe Vineland School we know the least about. About the only fact we do know is that it is a covered institution, and that our benefits would be comparable to the Woods and Dever-eaux schools.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-18\">\u201cSo you can see from the above, Mr. Gordon, that the amounts we would pay on these three institutions are approximately the same, and I would not allow this factor to affect your decision on where to send your child. The pre-admission evaluations would be covered at all three schools.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Alx\">Approximately five months later the defendant again contacted Gordon and informed him that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-19\">\u201cWe have just received the results of the investigation of Vineland Training School by our Philadelphia office and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>our Home Office in Hartford. The decision is, unlike the Devereaux Foundation and the Woods School, we will not be able to pay any of the room and board or educational charges. However, all expenses for medical and psychiatric treatment including prescription drugs, lab work, and X-rays would be covered expenses. Therefore, we would need a breakdown of the charges each month in order to determine the covered expenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">Thereafter Gordon placed his son in Elwyn Institute, Elwyn, Pennsylvania, and filed a claim for all expenses incurred in connection with the services rendered therein to his son. The defendant rejected the claim, indicating that it failed to disclose a need for treatment of a medical or psychiatric nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Gordon then commenced an action in the District of Columbia Court of General Sessions (now Superior Court) to recover the expenses incurred as the result of his son\u2019s institutionalization, alleging that his son was suffering from a <em>nervous disorder. </em>Discovery proceedings directed to the defendant disclosed that the allegation had been denied upon the grounds that \u201cmental retardation is not a nervous disorder\u201d; that the son was an eligible dependent under the policy; and that certain of the expenses incurred might be allowable upon a proper showing. Relying on the theory that this information revealed a basis for the commencement of a class action on behalf of those Civil Service employees covered under the policy who had eligible dependents that were mentally retarded, the plaintiff secured a stay of the Court of General Sessions\u2019 action and instituted a class action, pursuant to Rule 23, Fed.R.Civ.P., in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia seeking, after amending the complaint to include the individual action of the plaintiff to recover $6,000 in expenses allegedly incurred as the result of relying on the defendant\u2019s representation and promise that Vineland Training School was a covered institution, a declaratory judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-8\">\u201c1. That mental retardation is a <em>mental and nervous </em>disorder, as such term is used within the policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-9\">\u201c2. That <em>where mental retardation exists, expenses incurred </em>by plaintiff Gordon and other members of the class <em>for treatment </em>rendered to eligible dependents (in accordance with specific instructions by a doctor specializing in neurosurgery or psychiatry, who has charge of the overall psychiatric care of the patient) <em>are allowable expenses </em>under the policy, when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-10\">(a) Such treatment is rendered by a member of the healing arts specializing in such treatment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-11\">(b) Such treatment is rendered by a member of the healing arts at institutions specializing in such treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-12\">\u201c3. Such damages as will fully compensate plaintiff Gordon and other members of the class.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-13\">\u201c4. Such other relief as the Court may deem just and proper.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-14\">Plaintiff subsequently moved to amend the amended complaint to include as an additional party plaintiff the Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children, Inc. and the defendant moved to dismiss the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-15\">In ruling on the respective motions the District Court (1) denied the motion of the plaintiff to further amend the first amended complaint; (2) granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the first amended complaint only insofar as the complaint sought to allege a class action on the grounds that the class action could not be maintained as the complaint failed to comply with Rule 23, Fed.R. Civ.P.; (3) denied the motion to dismiss insofar as it alleged the individual action of Harvey J. Gordon; and (4) certified the matter to the District of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Columbia Court of General Sessions on the grounds that it did not appear the first amended complaint would justify a judgment in excess of $10,000. It is from this order that the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">The principal issue presented is whether the District Court properly dismissed that part of the complaint which sought to commence a class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The record discloses (1) that the plaintiff\u2019s son is an eligible dependent under the terms of the policy; (2) that plaintiff\u2019s son is suffering from mental retardation; (3) that plaintiff\u2019s son was placed in Elwyn Institute, an institution specializing in the care and treatment of children suffering from nervous disorders; (4) that the plaintiff submitted a claim to the defendant for the $100.00 admission fee to Elwyn Institute and for the first month\u2019s charge of $415.00; (5) (a) that the claim, as such, was denied by the defendant on the basis that mental retardation is not a nervous disorder and (b) that no coverage was afforded under the facts set out in the claim; and (6) that a portion of the claim might be allowable upon a proper showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">It is plaintiff\u2019s contention that denial of his claim would warrant the conclusion that any claim submitted by a Civil Service employee covered under the policy who had eligible dependents who were mentally retarded for expenses allegedly incurred under <em>the </em>mental and nervous disorders portion of the policy would automatically be denied by defendant on the grounds that mental retardation is not a mental and nervous disorder. Such an assumption is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">The real issue revolves around whether the plaintiff has incurred allowable expenses on behalf of his son in accordance with specific instructions by a doctor specializing in neurosurgery or psychiatry who has charge of the overall psychiatric care of the patient (mental and nervous disorders coverage) or has incurred expenses on behalf of his son for one who is mentally or physically disabled as a result of retarded development or body infirmity and who is <em>not </em>under specific medical, surgical or psychiatric treatment to reduce his disability and to enable him to live outside an institution providing custodial care (custodial care exclusion). This issue is obviously one of an individual nature and must be decided upon a case by case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-13\">One of the prerequisites to a class action under Rule 23 is that there be \u201c(a) (2) questions of law or fact common to the class.\u201d Attempting to meet this requirement plaintiff seeks to have the issue decided on the basis that mental retardation <em>is </em>a mental and nervous disorder<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that the defendant\u2019s denial of his claim creates a question of fact common to the class. Assuming that the issue would be decided affirmatively, we must again return to the issue as first posed. It thus becomes apparent that the label (mental retardation or mental and nervous disorders) placed upon the eligible dependent is irrelevant. The plaintiff thus has failed to meet one of the prerequisites to a class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-14\">Neither has the plaintiff met the additional requirements set forth in Rule 23(b) (1) by showing that prosecution of individual actions by members of the alleged class would create a risk of (A) inconsistent or varying adjudications which would establish incompatible conduct for the party opposing the class, or (B) adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would as a practical matter be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the adjudications or substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests. Nor has the plaintiff shown that the defendant has acted or refused to act on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>grounds generally applicable to the alleged class, thereby complying with Rule 23(b) (2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It necessarily follows that the class action portion of the amended complaint was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">In determining whether the Court below abused its discretion by certifying the individual action of Harvey J. Gordon to the District of Columbia Court of General Sessions, D.C.Code \u00a7 11-962 (1967), it would have been beneficial for the Court to have set forth reasons for its conclusion that it did not appear that the first amended complaint would justify a verdict in excess of $10,000, Hughes v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, 133 U.S.App.D.C. 174, 409 F.2d 460 (1969). However, its decision does not appear to us to be arbitrary or an abuse of discretion. Hughes v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, supra; Gray v. Evening Star Newspaper Company, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 292, 277 F.2d 91 (1960); Davis v. Peerless Insurance Co., 103 U.S.App.D.C. 125, 255 F.2d 534 (1958); Barnard v. Schneider, 100 U.S.App.D.C. 152, 243 F.2d 258 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Whether or not the Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children would or would not have been a proper plaintiff, if this were a maintainable class action, is rendered moot by the disposition of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-8\">. No claim has ever been presented by tiie plaintiff, or denied by the defendant, either that mental retardation is a <em>mental and </em>nervous disorder, or that the care and services being received are or are not custodial care as defined in the exclusions portion of the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-10\">. Supp. Joint App., p. 38.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b783-8\">WILKEY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A8SB\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">With all deference to my two colleagues, I must dissent simply because the majority opinion misses the primary issue presented by this appeal \u2014 whether or not mental retardation qualifies as a \u201cnervous disorder\u201d and thus falls within the \u201cmental and nervous disorders\u201d coverage of the policy<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 and is deflected by a secondary issue \u2014 whether or not the. appellant has incurred allowable expenses on behalf of his son in accordance with specific instructions by a doctor and which are not excluded as expenses merely for \u201ccustodial care.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Logically, this question of individual expense should follow only <em>after </em>the primary issue of coverage has been resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-14\">\n<em>I. The Class Action Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ABas\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-15\">The appellant has a valid class action here since the determination of whether or not mental retardation qualifies as a \u201cnervous disorder,\u201d and thus is covered by the \u201cmental and nervous disorders\u201d section of the policy, does not affect his individual action alone. The resolution of this issue is decisive on the coverage for <em>all </em>mentally retarded dependents of policyholders. There may be other issues in individual cases, particularly on the fact questions of expenses actually incurred, but <em>no </em>claimant can recover on the basis of mental retardation unless mental retardation is found to fall within the \u201cmental and nervous disorders\u201d coverage of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-16\">By its response to the appellant\u2019s written Interrogatory No. 1, that \u201c[m]en-tal retardation is not a nervous disorder,\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Aetna denies appellant and all those similarly situated the opportunity of seeking to recover their expenses incurred in obtaining treatment for their mentally retarded dependents. The majority themselves recognize this as the basic ground for the denial of appellant\u2019s claim by Aetna:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-17\">The record discloses (1) that the plaintiff\u2019s [appellant\u2019s] son is an eligible dependent under the terms of the policy; (2) that plaintiff\u2019s son is suffering from <em>mental retardation; </em>(3) that plaintiff\u2019s son was placed in Elwyn Institute, an institution specializing in the care and treatment of children suffering from <em>nervous disorders ; </em>(4) that the plaintiff submitted a claim to the defendant [Aetna] for the $100.00 admission fee to Elwyn Institute and for the first month\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>charge of $415.00; (5) (a) <em>that the claim, as such, was denied by the defendant on the basis that mental retardation is not a nervous disorder </em>and (b) that no coverage was afforded under the facts set out in the claim. * * * <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Provision (5) (a), then, is the basic issue in this case, while provision (5) (b) can only be relevant if mental retardation <em>is </em>covered under the \u201cmental and nervous disorders\u201d section of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Aetna has tried to avoid a direct confrontation on this issue by claiming that the exclusion for \u201ccustodial care\u201d expenses<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> applies here, that this particular child is merely receiving \u201ccustodial care,\u201d not specific treatment for mental retardation, and therefore that Aetna is liable only for certain nominal expenses covered under sections of the policy other than the \u201cmental and nervous disorders\u201d section. The effort of Aetna to escape liability for this individual child by urging the \u201ccustodial care\u201d exclusion represents much more than an attempt simply to avoid reimbursing this particular appellant. If the \u201ccustodial care\u201d exclusion is held to apply to mental retardation cases, then the dominant issue in every case will be the individual facts of whether the child is receiving-specific treatment, the type of institution \u2014 and therefore this appellant has no valid grounds for a class action. Thus it was that Aetna\u2019s brief, and counsel's oral ar-' gument, attempted to place the issue on the detailed minutiae of this appellant\u2019s individual expenses and care, details which would obviously vary with every individual policyholder, and slide by the basic question of whether <em>any </em>policyholder can claim coverage under \u201cmental and nervous disorders\u201d for a mentally retarded dependent. Unfortunately, my two colleagues seem not to have perceived Aetna\u2019s finesse.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">On the other hand, if mental retardation is found to lie within the \u201cmental and nervous disorders\u201d coverage of the policy, then the \u201ccustodial\u201d versus noncustodial care\u201d exclusion issue would fade, if not disappear altogether, since under the \u201cmental and nervous disorders\u201d section, appellant and all others similarly situated are entitled to reimbursement for their expenses for, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-11\"><em>Mental and nervous disorders. </em>In addition to other covered services and supplies, charges for the following services * * * are allowable expenses * * *:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-13\">\u2014Day care in a qualified day care center</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-14\">\u2014Night care in a qualified night care center. * * *<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ayr-dedup-0\">I would hold, and the majority does not decide differently, that the exclusion of recovery under the policy for \u201ccustodial care\u201d expenses <em>cannot </em>be held to exclude recovery of expenses for \u201cday care in a qualified day care center\u201d and \u201cnight care in a qualified night care center\u201d as the equivalent of \u201ccustodial care.\u201d Both parties apparently recognize this, hence the effort by Aetna to avoid coverage under the \u201cmental and nervous disorders\u201d section of the policy. But whether or not the Elwyn Institute qualifies as a hospital and whether or not the appellant\u2019s son is getting purely \u201ccustodial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>care\u201d are thus <em>not </em>relevant issues at this stage, since <em>the question of payment or amounts owed to each individual can only arise after the individual is determined to have coverage. </em>This becomes evident from the argument of appellant\u2019s counsel in his rebuttal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The appellant originally filed his action as an individual action, since he did not realize that he had the grounds for a class action until after Aetna responded to his written Interrogatory No. 1. This response \u2014 that \u201c[m]ental retardation is not a nervous disorder\u201d \u2014 told appellant for the first time that if he were denied coverage for his expenses incurred in obtaining treatment for his son\u2019s mental retardation, then <em>all </em>other policyholders seeking reimbursement on similar grounds under the \u201cmental and nervous disorders\u201d section of the policy would likewise be denied coverage. This clearly suffices for appellant to bring a class action on his own behalf and on behalf of all other policyholders similarly situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">The majority, while stating that the appellant\u2019s \u201cassumption\u201d \u2014 -that denial of his claim here would mean denial of the claims of all those similarly situated on the grounds that mental retardation does not qualify under the \u201cmental and nervous disorders\u201d <em>coverage </em>\u2014 \u201cis not warranted,\u201d observes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-14\">The real issue revolves around whether the plaintiff [appellant] has incurred allowable expenses on behalf of his son in accordance with specific instructions by a doctor * * * for one who is mentally or physically disabled as a result of retarded development or body infirmity * * * This issue is obviously one of an individual nature and must be decided upon a case by case basis.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUS-\">A determination of this issue, which is of course of an individual nature, first requires, however, the resolution of another question, this one not of an \u201cindividual\u201d nature. That is, if the appellant (and all those similarly situated) is to be able to attempt to recover his expenses incurred in the treatment of his son\u2019s mental retardation under the \u201cmental and nervous disorders\u201d section of the policy, by showing that such expenses were incurred in accordance with specific instructions by a doctor specializing in neurosurgery or psychiatry who has charge of the overall psychiatric care of his son, he must be able to make such allegations in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-16\">This, however, he cannot do here under the majority opinion\u2019s interpretation. Aetna, by its answer to the appellant\u2019s Interrogatory No. 1 below \u2014 that \u201c[m]ental retardation is not a nervous disorder\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u2014 blocks the appellant and all other policyholders similarly situated, who might seek to recover their ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>penses under the \u201cmental and nervous disorders\u201d section of the policy, from showing that such expenses were incurred for treatment of mental retardation in accordance with specific instructions by a doctor specializing in neurosurgery or psychiatry who has charge of the overall psychiatric care of the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">At the same time as it denies the appellant\u2019s principal contention \u2014 that mental retardation qualifies under the \u201cmental and nervous disorders\u201d section of the policy' \u2014 Aetna also seeks to avoid a resolution of this issue by labelling it as \u201cirrelevant\u201d :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-5\">This question [whether or not mental retardation qualifies for \u201cmental and nervous disorders\u201d coverage] is totally <em>irrelevant </em>[emphasis added] to recovery under the policy, for the phrase \u201cmental and nervous disorders\u201d is merely a general heading in the policy. The issue is not what the insurance company chose to title this section of the policy, but: has Harvey Gordon incurred expenses for the specific services provided for under this heading? Specifically, does Jeffrey Gordon (or any other member of the proposed class) receive \u201cservices of a qualified psychologist, services of a psychiatric nurse or services of a qualified psychiatric social worker\u201d under the terms and conditions of the policy ?<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">However, by Aetna\u2019s own theory, and sustained by the majority here, this question could never be reached, since the appellant is dismissed at the start if mental retardation is held not to fall under the \u201cmental and nervous disorders\u201d coverage. Clearly then, both by denying and citing as \u201cirrelevant\u201d appellant\u2019s primary contention that mental retardation qualifies under the \u201cmental and nervous disorders\u201d section of the policy, Aetna succeeds, with the majority\u2019s approval, in having appellant\u2019s case dismissed even before any proof has been offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">The manner in which the contentions of the two parties have slid by on the oblique is illustrated by the Aetna brief here. In trying to evade the class action, Aetna states: \u201cIn the present case the duty is an individual contract duty dependent by its very nature upon the expenses incurred by each individual.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If we focus on hospital expenses, whether or not Elwyn Institute is a hospital, and whether or not \u201ccustodial care\u201d is involved, then Aetna may be right. But if we focus on the question of whether or not mental retardation falls within the \u201cmental and nervous disorders\u201d coverage of the <em>policy </em>\u2014 which <em>is what Aet-na said was its reason for denying coverage in answer to appellant\u2019s Interrogatory No. </em>1 \u2014 then obviously \u201cthe duty is a [group] contract duty\u201d because the clause is contained in a large group policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">The determination of this basic issue, which Aetna itself gave as its reason for denying coverage, will determine coverage not_only for appellant\u2019s son but also for all other mentally retarded children of families covered by this group policy. Therefore, there is no individual contract duty here; there is instead a <em>group </em>contract duty, where the issue is coverage. This certainly gives the appellant a justifiable basis for bringing a class action, since there do exist, as required by Rule 23(a) (2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \u201cquestions of law or fact common to the class.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Appellant also meets, contrary to the majority opinion\u2019s interpretation, the requirements of Rule 23(b) (1), since the prosecution of his individual action alone would create a risk of (A) inconsistent or varying adjudications which would establish incompatible standards of conduct for Aetna, and (B) adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would as a practical matter be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the adjudications, or substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests. In addition, the requirements of Rule 23(b) (2) are satisfied since the appellee has refused the appellant coverage under the \u201cmental and nervous disorders\u201d section of the policy on grounds generally applicable to the class \u2014 that \u201c[m]ental retardation is not a nervous disorder,\u201d thereby giving rise to the necessity for declaratory relief for the entire class.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">\n<em>11. Jurisdictional Requirement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">Insofar as the other issues raised on this appeal are concerned, the remand to the District of Columbia Court of General Sessions (now the Superior Court) was erroneous since the appellant\u2019s respective claims, when aggregated, well exceeded the $10,000 minimum jurisdictional requirement for an individual action <footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and for a class action<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> in the District Court. Appellant\u2019s first claim, in Count I of his Amended Complaint, covered the expenses incurred in the treatment of his mentally retarded son. These were of an ongoing nature and thus, on the date of dismissal (31 December 1970), amounted to $9,636.16. However, as Aetna notes, the policy prescribes a coverage limitation of 80%, which would result in an amount in controversy of $7,708.93 (80% x $9,636.16). Aggregating this amount with appellant\u2019s claim under Count II of his Amended Complaint for $6,000.00 results in a total of $13,708.93, well above the jurisdictional minimum required for bringing an action in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-16\">The $6,000.00 claim is not merely an alternate claim for reimbursement by the appellant of his expenses incurred in obtaining treatment and care for his son; rather, it represents damages due to the appellant for his reliance on Aet-na\u2019s promise and representation of coverage under the policy, and subsequent breach thereof prior to the institutionalization of appellant\u2019s son.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As the appellant states in his Amended Complaint, the damages sought under Count II on the basis of a promissory estoppel theory consist of \u201c * * * substantial expenses [incurred by appellant] in contacting and visiting institutions and in providing for the supervision, care and special schooling of his child <em>pending institutionalization </em>[emphasis added], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>which institutionalization was delayed, as a direct result of [Aetna\u2019s] actions, from January 1968 to May 1969, all to the damage of [appellant] in the amount of $6,000.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, by aggregating this claim with the claim in Count I, the District Court\u2019s minimal jurisdictional requirement of $10,000.00 was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">Certification of this case by the District Court to the Court of General Sessions was therefore erroneous and constituted an abuse of discretion, since the appellant by aggregating his two claims was also claiming damages well in excess of the $10,000.00 jurisdictional ceiling imposed by statute on the Court of General Sessions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The damages here were not of an uncertain nature but liquidated in form, and when aggregated were well above the $10,000.00 jurisdictional maximum of the Court of General Sessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The exception to certification provided by D.C.Code \u00a7 11-962 (1967) applies here since the principal relief being sought by appellant is partially equitable in nature \u2014 a declaratory judgment that mental retardation qualifies under the \u201cmental and nervous disorders\u201d section of the policy. This statute provides that all cases <em>except those seeking equitable relief </em>may be certified for trial to the Court of General Sessions, if the District Court finds to its satisfaction that the action will not justify a judgment in excess of $10,000.00.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus, the exercise of the District Court in certifying this case to the Court of General Sessions constituted an abuse of discretion and may be upset on appeal.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-13\">\n<em>III. Joinder of the Pennsylvania Association of Retarded Children</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b788-14\">The remaining issue raised by this appeal, whether or not the Pennsylvania Association of Retarded Children should be added as a party plaintiff, is within the discretion of the trial court and its refusal may be correct. Rule 23(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides in relevant part that \u201cOne or more <em>members </em>[emphasis added] of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of [a class] * * While the Second Circuit in Norwalk CORE v. Norwalk Redevelopment Agency, 395 F.2d 920 (1968), did consider that there can be exceptions to this requirement of membership in the class in order to sue or be sued in its behalf,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the rationale for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>such an exception does not necessarily apply here. The Second Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqr-dedup-0\">We do not decide, however, whether the association plaintiffs have standing. The answer to that question depends on whether there is a compelling need to grant them standing in order that the constitutional rights of persons not immediately before the court might be vindicated. See NAACP v. State of Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 458-460, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488 (1958). It appears to us that the individual plaintiffs can adequately represent the interests of all members of the relevant class, but we will not preclude the plaintiffs from trying to show to the District Court\u2019s satisfaction that it is only the association plaintiff which can perform this function.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"atn-dedup-0\">However, since there is a valid class action here, it would appear beneficial to the trial court to permit the Association to appear as amicus curiae. This, however, is within the discretion of the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b783-11\">. <em>Id., </em>at 41.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b783-18\">. <em>Id., </em>at 53.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b784-6\">.
