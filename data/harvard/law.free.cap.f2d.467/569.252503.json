Citizens Casualty Company of New York et al., 5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b632-9\">JOHN R. BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">It is exceedingly rare that the same direct appeal from a criminal conviction is twice before the Court, but this is such a case. On direct appeal from a conviction based on a guilty plea appellant charged that the conviction was invalid because the plea was induced by certain \u201cmisrepresentations\u201d of the Government. We remanded for full development of the facts. A supplemental evi-dentiary hearing was held and the District Court has filed formal findings of fact and reaffirmed his earlier sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">The earlier opinion in this case succinctly defined the crucial issue. \u201cThe legal principles in this instance are fairly clear \u2014 a plea cannot be vacated because the defendant anticipated that by pleading guilty he would get a lighter sentence. On the other hand, the Government ought not be allowed to lure the defendant into a plea on false information.\u201d United States v. Battle, 5 Cir., 1971, 447 F.2d 950, 951. The transcript of the evidentiary hearing held after the prior remand and the Judge\u2019s findings thereon convinces us that the former is the situation here. It now seems clear that the only \u201crepresentation\u201d made by the Government was that no one in the United States Attorney\u2019s Office would recommend a particularly severe penalty. The Government kept that assurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-13\">The crux of the controversy seems to be that the United States Attorney had expressed to defense counsel the <em>belief </em>that the District Court would <em>probably </em>mete out a minimal sentence if the defendant pleaded guilty. The United States Attorney ventured a conjecture that the two-year statutory minimum would be appropriate, and perhaps part of that would be suspended. The United States Attorney was not much of a prognosticator, since the District Court sentenced the defendant to a term of eight years imprisonment. However, as defense counsel readily conceded at the evidentiary hearing, the United States Attorney\u2019s remarks were by no means promises. The attorney recognized that the United States Attorney had no authority to guarantee a particular sentence, and the defendant\u2019s testimony indicates that this information was relayed to him in equivocal terms such as \u201ccould\u201d and \u201cperhaps\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-14\">Regarding the allegation that the unexpected sentence resulted from erroneous information in the presentence report, the Trial Court\u2019s findings of fact affirmatively establish that the District Court was \u201cwell aware before sentencing of the errors in the presentence investigation report, and the Court knew that the defendant was not a \u2018kingpin\u2019 in the narcotics trade.\u201d Any suggestion that the sentence was based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>on incorrect facts is therefore clearly rebutted.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">On findings which are unassailable, it is clear that there was no bargain, promise, agreement or other understanding reached here. From our vantage everybody \u2014 which included everyone but the most important one \u2014 just guessed wrong about what sentence the trial judge would think appropriate. Since, as the Judge found, \u201cthe government did not lure the defendant into a plea of guilty by false information\u201d but rather the defendant simply had hopes which were not realized, we find no basis for setting aside the plea of guilty or the conviction which resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
