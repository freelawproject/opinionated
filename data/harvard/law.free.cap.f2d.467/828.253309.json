In accordance with the jury\u2019s special finding that the stolen property in question exceeded $100 in value, Payne was sentenced to a seven year prison term on each count, the sentences to run concurrently. On this appeal, Payne seeks either a new trial or resentencing under the misdemeanor provisions of \u00a7 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-18\">Payne alleges the following errors: (1) that the evidence was insufficient to show that the stolen goods in his possession were in excess of $100.00 in value; (2) that the evidence adduced with respect to the second count was insufficient to show that he had knowledge that the Philco television described in the indictment was stolen; and (8) that he was deprived of a fair trial because evidence directed to the issue of knowledge was admitted to show that he had recently possessed other stolen property. Finding no merit in any of these contentions, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-19\">The government presented several witnesses who testified concerning the ownership and value of the property found in Payne\u2019s possession. Government agents recovered ten pairs of slacks from Payne. Four pairs had their original tags still attached and were positively identified as a part of the interstate shipment that was stolen. Although the remaining six pairs had no tags when recovered, the evidence indicated that they were also a part of the stolen ship<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>ment. These slacks were made of the same material and had the same lot identification numbers as the tagged slacks. The retail value of the slacks was at least $20.00 per pair for a total value of $200.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">The Philco television found in Payne\u2019s possession was positively identified as having been stolen from an interstate shipment between Atlanta, Georgia and Dallas, Texas. Its retail value was set at $109.95 and the dealer price was estimated to be $84.00. While under investigation, Payne attempted to explain his possession of the television to F.B.I. Agent Coward by producing a receipt showing that he had purchased it for $35.00 from a man named Walter G. Big Man Brown. At trial, however, Payne offered no evidence to corroborate this story.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Agent Coward testified that in his first search of Payne\u2019s house he recovered an electric typewriter along with the slacks. This typewriter was identified by its owner as one which had been recently stolen from the office of his local business. Payne has never been prosecuted or charged criminally for the possession of the stolen typewriter.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Payne presented no countervailing testimony to support any of his contentions He relies on what he contends to be in-sufficiencies in the government\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">We deal first with Payne\u2019s contention that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that the value of the stolen property described in each count exceeded $100.00. At the outset, we note that Payne\u2019s eonviction must be sustained if, taking the view most favorable to the government, the evidence was sufficient to withstand a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-13\">There is no dispute about the value of each pair of slacks ($20.00) involved in count one. The sole question is whether the evidence showed that the six pairs of untagged slacks were stolen from the interstate shipment. If the government had failed entirely to link those slacks with that shipment, the jury clearly could not have concluded that the value of the property described in count one exceeded $100.00. There was, however, no such omission in the government\u2019s proof.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A number of similarities were established between the tagged and untagged slacks which suggested that both came from the stolen shipment. While this evidence may have been susceptible to opposing inferences, we think that it was legally sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s determination that the stolen slacks exceeded $100.00 in value.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-14\">Likewise without merit is Payne\u2019s argument that the value of the Philco television did not exceed $100.00. Although one witness estimated that the television\u2019s dealer price was $84.00, the testimony also showed undisputedly that its retail price was $109.95. We do not think, as Payne apparently contends, that the jury was bound to accept the $84.00 figure as being the television\u2019s value for \u00a7 659 purposes. The jury was properly instructed that value means \u201cface, par, or market value, or <em>cost price, wholesale or retail, whichever is </em>greater.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>It appears that the jury faithfully complied with these instructions and the evidence, we think, supported their conclusion as to the value of the television.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Payne\u2019s second contention is that the evidence was insufficient to prove he had knowledge that the television was stolen. It is well settled law that the unexplained possession of recently stolen property will sustain an inference of knowledge that the property was stolen.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Despite the government\u2019s carefully laid foundation, it is claimed that this inference was destroyed because of the evidence introduced by the government with reference to Payne\u2019s explanation of his possession of the television. Payne claims that this result follows since such evidence was contrary to the inference of knowledge that the government desired to have the jury to draw. We disagree. Although some aspects of the government\u2019s evidence conceivably may have been inconsistent with its overall theory of the case, we think that the jury was still authorized to conclude that Payne knew the television was stolen. Even Payne\u2019s own authority betrays his argument on this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArrI\">\u201cWe do not mean that in every case where some of the government\u2019s evidence is arguably contrary to an inference that it wishes to have the jury draw from <em>other evidence, </em>the inference may not be drawn.\u201d (Emphasis added) Rodgers v. United States, 402 F.2d 830, 834 (9th Cir. 1968).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avuq\">Moreover, even if Payne\u2019s contentions with respect to the value of the television set and his lack of knowledge that it was stolen should be sustained, it would avail him nothing in view of our conclusion, which is amply supported by the record, that the evidence adduced to support the charge in count 1 was sufficient. Such being the case, since the sentences imposed under counts 1 and 2 are to run concurrently, the judgment should be affirmed under the concurrent sentence doctrine. Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 63 S.Ct. 1375, 87 L.Ed. 1774 (1943); United States v. Dumenigo, 444 F.2d 253 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\"> We turn now to Payne\u2019s final contention that the trial court committed prejudicial error by admitting into evidence testimony that a recently stolen typewriter was found in his possession during the same time period the slacks and television were recovered. Payne points out that he has never been prosecuted or charged criminally in connection with the stolen typewriter. Within the last year, this court has restated the rule that evidence of other criminal acts \u201c \u2018will be received for the purpose of showing knowledge, intent, motive, design or scheme where such element is an essential of the commission of the offense.\u2019 \u201d United States v. McGlamory, 441 F.2d 130, 137 (5th Cir. 1971). We think that the testimony adduced at trial was admitted for the proper purpose of showing Payne\u2019s knowledge that the slacks and television were stolen. Payne\u2019s argument on this point is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">Finding that there was ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict and that the trial court\u2019s actions were free from error, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-14\">.
