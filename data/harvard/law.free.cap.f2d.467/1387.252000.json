Enright, United State District Judge, San Diego, California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1450-6\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1450-7\">O\u2019Day was convicted of having robbed a bank on February 10, 1972, and a federal savings and loan association on February 13, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-8\">Immediately prior to the commencement of O\u2019Day\u2019s trial, he filed a motion wherein he requested the District' Court to rule, in advance, that the prosecution would not be permitted, in the event O\u2019Day testified in his own behalf, to inquire of O\u2019Day as to whether he had been previously convicted of a felony. The judge reserved his ruling, and, after the prosecution had presented its case in chief, announced his decision that should the accused testify, the prosecution would be permitted to make limited inquiry of a prior felony conviction of O\u2019Day that was not remote.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1450-9\"> O\u2019Day offered no testimony in his own defense, and he now urges that the court\u2019s ruling improperly chilled him from exercising his privilege of testifying in his own behalf. We reject the argument. It appears to us that the District Court fairly and conscientiously exercised sound discretion, following the approach endorsed in Gordon v. United States, 127 U.S.App.D.C. 343, 383 F.2d 936 (D.C.Cir.1967); Luck v. United States, 121 U.S.App.D.C. 151, 348 F.2d 763 (D.C.Cir.1965), and some of the District Courts of our own Circuit. <em>See, e. g., </em>Burg v. United States, 406 F.2d 235, 238 (9th Cir. 1969) (concurring opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1450-12\">. The colloquy between the court and counsel reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: I am going to state on the record here that as far as the prior convictions on O\u2019Day are concerned, Mr. Hawes has stated to the court in chambers that he does not intend to offer the \u2014 was it 1960?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-14\">\u201cMR. HAWES: \u201965 or \u201968, the one he was convicted on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: You do not intend\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP2r\">\u201cMR. HAWES: I don\u2019t intend to offer the 1960 conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: You do intend to offer the 1965 or 1966 conviction\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-17\">\u201cMR. COLLINS: Only\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-28\">\u201cTHE COURT: \u2014only on the basis that the defendant was convicted of a felony. That is the only question, have you ever been convicted of a felony. He says, yes, and that\u2019s it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-29\">\u201cMR. HAWES : Yes, but if he testified that he never robbed a bank before and that opens the door, I can ask him what the felony conviction was for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-30\">\u201cTHE COURT : Sure, sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-31\">\u201cMR. COLLINS: There\u2019s no question that the law has been very clear on that particular point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-32\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right, fine.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
