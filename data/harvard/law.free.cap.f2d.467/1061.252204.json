Each had been employees of Sandia Corporation, \u201cformed at the instance of the United States of America, through its agency, the Atomic Energy Commission.\u201d Each plaintiff alleged he called certain matters involving a breach of security to the attention of Sandia Corporation, and to the United States of America; that the Sandia Corporation \u201ctransmitted and disseminated untrue, derogatory and scandalous information about plaintiffs to their fellow employees\u201d; attempted to transfer plaintiffs to other jobs which they were not equipped to perform, and finally fired them; that the United States knew, or should have known of Sandia Corporation\u2019s acts, and \u201cnegligently and carelessly failed to make San-dia Corporation cease its action.\u201d Thus the action is one in tort against the sole defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-17\">The United States moved to dismiss, or require the plaintiffs to make their claims more definite and certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-18\">The trial court was of the opinion that the complaint did not allege that the Sandia Corporation \u201cwas an instrumentality of the United States,\u201d and therefore \u201cdoes not state a claim against the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-19\">Appellant and plaintiffs were granted leave to amend; and added to their original complaint the following two conclusions: (a) \u201cSandia Corporation at all times material herein <em>primarily acted as an instrumentality or agency of the United States.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) No detail was supplied, (b) \u201c[t]hat the defendant had a duty to plaintiffs to protect them from the tortuous conduct alleged.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No detail was supplied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-21\">Upon a second motion by the United States to dismiss, the action was dismissed with prejudice. Defendants appeal. We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1124-22\">As stated above, each of the amendments added to the original complaint were conclusionary in form, and added no facts to the original pleading. Appellants suggest that their pleadings \u201cshould be liberally construed to do substantial justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>When a sovereign is sued, it can determine for what it may be sued, how far that right may be restricted, and how far the government will waive its sovereign immunity, if at all. United States v. Shaw, 309 U.S. 495, 500-501, 60 S.Ct. 659, 84 L.Ed. 888 (1940); Munro v. United States, 303 U.S. 36, 41, 58 S.Ct. 421, 82 L.Ed. 633 (1938); Reid v. United States, 211 U.S. 529, 538, 29 S.Ct. 171, 53 L.Ed. 313 (1909).</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">\u201cAny government, being sovereign, can be sued only in cases in which consent has been given.\u201d Neff v. United States, 81 F.Supp. 234, 113 Ct.Cl. 1 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">Plaintiffs have been careful not to say the Sandia Corporation <em>is </em>an instrumentality or agency of the United States government. This is significant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1125-7\">But if such a bare allegation were sufficient to come within the definition of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b) and \u00a7 2671, this litigation would be subject to the \u201cexclusive remedy\u201d statute (28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2679); and the \u201cexceptions\u201d statute (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680). The latter states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1125-8\">\u201cThe provisions of this chapter [171] and section 1346(b) of this title [28] shall not apply to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1125-9\">\u201c(a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an employee of the Government, exercising due care, in the execution of a statute or regulation, whether or not such statute or regulation be valid, or based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1125-20\">\u201c(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1125-21\">Thus, claims based on discretionary acts involving an agency or its employees are excluded, as are claims for <em>libel, slander, </em>misrepresentation, deceit, or <em>interference with contract rights.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1125-22\">To state a cause of action in a suit against defendants, plaintiffs must bring themselves <em>within </em>the sovereign grant of permission to sue, and <em>without </em>the statutory exceptions retained. Kessler v. General Services Administration, 341 F.2d 275 (2d Cir. 1964); Smith v. United States, 333 F.2d 70 (10th Cir. 1964); Dupree v. United States, 264 F.2d 140 (3rd Cir. 1959); cert. denied, 361 U.S. 823, 80 S.Ct. 69, 4 L.Ed.2d 67 (1959); Dupree v. United States, 247 F.2d 819, 824 (3rd Cir. 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-23\">As to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(a), and \u201cdiscretionary functions,\u201d <em>see </em>Blaber v. United States, 212 F.Supp. 95, 99 (E.D.N.Y.1962), aff\u2019d 332 F.2d 629 (2d Cir. 1964); Irzyk v. United States, 412 F.2d 749 (10th Cir. 1969)\u2014\u201cWhere there is room for policy judgment and decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>there is discretion.\u201d; Dalehite v. United States, 346 U.S. 15, 36, 73 S.Ct. 956, 968, 97 L.Ed. 1427 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-4\">As to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h) [libel, slander and interference with contract rights], <em>see </em>Kessler v. General Services Administration, supra; Teplitsky v. Bureau, United States Dept. of Labor, 288 F.Supp. 310 (S.D.N.Y.1918), aff\u2019d 398 F.2d 820 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied 393 U.S. 943, 89 S.Ct. 311, 21 L.Ed.2d 280 (1968); Ruderer v. Meyer, 413 F.2d 175 (8th Cir. 1969), cert. denied 396 U.S. 936, 90 S.Ct. 280, 24 L.Ed.2d 235 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1124-15\">. We note a total absence of any allegation that the United States or the Atomic Energy Commission at any time or in any way supervised or exercised managerial responsibility over Sandia Corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1125-10\">. We perhaps could take judicial notice of the common knowledge that Sandia Corporation is a <em>contractor </em>with the Atomic Energy Commission, operating facilities at Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico, Livermore, California, and Tonopah, Nevada (1971 Report \u2014 \u201cMajor activities in the Atomic Energy Program,\u201d p. 215) <em>Cf. </em>Aleut League v. Atomic Energy Comm., 337 F.Supp. 534, 538 (D.Alaska 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-15\">Were we to do so, we would be going no further than many other courts have gone, See: Sarner v. Mason, 228 F.2d 176, 179 (3d Cir. 1955), cert. denied 351 U.S. 924, 76 S.Ct. 781, 100 L.Ed. 1454 (1956); Interstate Nat. Gas Co. v. Southern California Gas Co., 209 F.2d 380, 385 (9th Cir. 1953); Terminal R. Ass\u2019n. of St. Louis v. Kimbrel, 105 F.2d 262, 263 (8th Cir. 1939); People v.

Union Pacific R. Co., 77 F.Supp. 613, 614 (N.D.Ill.1948); Oil Workers International Union v. Elliott, 73 F.Supp. 942, 943 (N.D.Texas 1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-25\">However, it is not necessary to do so in deciding the issues in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
