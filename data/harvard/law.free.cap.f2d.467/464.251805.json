Appellants alleged pain and suffering, physical handicap, and loss of employment by Mrs. Miller, and medical expenses and loss of consortium by Mr. Miller.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By answer appel-lee noted that suit was brought more than one year after Mrs. Miller\u2019s injury and pleaded affirmatively the limitation in the \u201cPassenger Contract Ticket,\u201d which provides that \u201cCarrier shall have no liability for loss of life or bodily injury unless . . . suit on such claim is begun not later than one year from the day when such death or injury shall have occurred.\u201d The District Court found this contractual provision binding on appellants. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-16\">The \u201cPassenger Contract Ticket\u201d is a one page form with provisions on both front and reverse sides. The first half of the first page consists of spaces for notation of passengers\u2019 names, place of issuance, date of issuance, etc. Above the space for passengers\u2019 names the form provides, in bold face print, \u201cThis Passage is subject to terms printed, typed, stamped, or written below and on back hereof.\u201d The various contractual provisions, consisting of twenty-seven paragraphs of fine print, begin on the second half of the first page and continue on the reverse side. These contractual provisions are preceded by the following statement, in bold face print: \u201cBy acceptance of this Contract Ticket, whether or not signed by him or on his behalf, or of passage on the ship, the passenger named herein agrees that the following terms and conditions, which are incorporated herein as part hereof, shall govern the relations between and be binding upon the carrier and the passenger in every possible contingency.\u201d At the end of the contractual provisions, on the reverse side, are spaces for passengers\u2019 signatures, above which is the following statement, in bold face print: \u201cReceipt of this Contract Ticket is acknowledged and terms and conditions hereof are accepted.\u201d The Millers signed the ticket at the designated space, but the record indicates that they did not retain a copy of it or examine closely its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>A line of cases stemming from The Majestic, 166 U.S. 375, 17 S.Ct. 597, 41 L.Ed. 1039 (1897), establish the general rule that mere notices insufficient to bring the passenger\u2019s attention to restrictions set forth on the reverse side of tickets do not incorporate the restrictions into the contract of passage. See, e. g., Silvestri v. Italia Societa Per Azioni Di Navigazione, 388 F.2d 11 (2d Cir. 1968); Maibrunn v. Hamburg-American S.S. Co., 77 F.2d 304 (2d Cir. 1935); Baer v. North German Lloyd, 69 F.2d 88 (2d Cir. 1934); cf. The Kungsholm, 86 F.2d 703 (2d Cir. 1936). Were this a standard Majestic-type case, we would meticulously compare the ticket here with tickets at issue in prior cases to determine the sufficiency of the notices to effect incorporation by reference. This is not, however, a typical \u201cnotice-incorporation\u201d case. The limitation provision, embodied within the general contractual provisions beginning on the first page of the ticket and culminating just prior to the space for signatures, was an integral part of the contract of passage. Murray v. Cunard S.S. Co., 235 N.Y. 162, 139 N.E. 226, 26 A.L.R. 1371 (1923). As part of the contractual tissue the provision was binding on appellants irrespective of their failure to read it. \u201c[P]revisions that appear on the ticket as part of the contract of passage embodied in the ticket are binding regardless of whether they were read by the passenger, provided they are not unlawful in content.\u201d Baron v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 108 F.2d 21, 23 (2d Cir. 1939). Accord, Rogers v. Furness, Withy &amp; Co., 103 F.Supp. 314, 316 (W.D.N.Y.1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Our conclusion accords fully with Sil-vestri v. Italia Societa Per Azioni Di Navigazione, <em>supra, </em>in which the Second Circuit analyzed the <em>Majestic </em>line of cases and concluded: \u201c[T]he thread that runs implicitly through the cases sustaining incorporation is that the steamship line had done all it reasonably could to warn the passenger that the terms and conditions were <em>important </em>matters of contract affecting his legal rights.\u201d <em>Id., </em>388 F.2d at 17 (emphasis added). By this statement the Second Circuit arguably meant that restrictions on form tickets, including restrictions concededly a part of the contract, are binding only if the carrier warns the passenger of their importance as well as of their existence. The precise issue before the Second Circuit, however, was whether the lower court \u201cerred in ruling that the conditions were incorporated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13. Therefore, <em>Silvestri </em>was clearly a \u201cnotice-in corporation\u201d case that at most only glossed the <em>Majestic </em>doctrine <em>o\u00ed </em>incorporation by reference; it did not alter the rule that provisions appearing as integral parts of the contract of passage are binding on the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The contractual bar to Mrs. Miller\u2019s claims operates equally to bar Mr. Miller\u2019s claims for loss of consortium and medical expenses, even though his losses, at least conceptually, may have occurred at a date substantially subsequent to the date of Mrs. Miller\u2019s injury. The contract unambiguously provides that claims for \u201cbodily injury\u201d shall be \u201cbegun not later than one year from the day when such death or injury shall have occurred.\u201d Such limitations are sanctioned by 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 183b(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">It shall be unlawful for the . owner of any sea-going vessel . . transporting passengers . from or between ports of the United States and foreign ports to provide by ... contract . a shorter period for giving notice of, or filing claims for loss of life or bodily injury, than six months, and for the institution of suits on such claims, than one year, such period for institution of suits to be computed from the day when the death or injury occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">We cannot hold that the contractual provision, and the statute after which it is patterned, countenance a limitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>period for bodily injury different from the limitation period for such derivative claims as loss of consortium. Such a holding would burden the contract with a technical meaning at variance with its plain import. By a common-sense reading, the contract provides that claims for bodily injury, as well as claims derivative of that bodily injury, must be filed not later than one year from \u201csuch injury,\u201d and it is this effect that we give the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">In other contexts courts have found the husband\u2019s claim for loss of consortium to be separate from the wife\u2019s claim for her own physical injury. Thus, in Milde v. Leigh, 75 N.D. 418, 28 N.W.2d 530, 173 A.L.R. 738 (1947), the North Dakota Supreme Court held that a husband\u2019s claim for loss of consortium occasioned by personal injury to his wife is a distinct cause of action, against which the statute of limitations does not commence running until he has suffered the loss of services. Although Milde v. Leigh accords with the weight of authority, see Annot., 173 A.L.R. 750 (1948), we are not here concerned with a statute of limitations that commences running when the cause of action accrues. Rather, we are concerned with a contractual provision, sanctioned by statute, providing that the limitation period commences when bodily injury occurs. Fine distinctions between claims for bodily injury and claims for loss of services caused by the injury only obscure the plain meaning of the contract and leave the parties in doubt as to their contractual rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">In a case analogous to the one before us, the Second Circuit analyzed the relationship between claims for bodily injury and claims for loss of consortium. In Burstein v. United States Lines Co., 134 F.2d 89 (2d Cir. 1943), defendant carrier argued that claims for loss of consortium were not claims for bodily injury within the meaning of 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 183b(a), and thus not protected by the statute\u2019s restriction on limitation periods. Reading the statute\u2019s reference to \u201cclaims for . . . bodily injury\u201d to mean \u201c \u2018claims for damages legally recoverable by reason of bodily injury sustained by a passenger,\u2019 \u201d 134 F.2d at 91, the court overruled the carrier\u2019s contention, concluding that \u201cthere seems to be no reason for such a distinction as is here urged and the curious consequences which it would produce,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 92. The <em>Burstein </em>court\u2019s preference for common-sense statutory interpretation is equally applicable to interpretation of contractual provisions ' patterned after the statute. Like the <em>Burstein </em>court, we opt for the construction urged by Coke\u2019s maxim: \u201cThe Office of Judges is always to make such Construction as to suppress the Mischief and advance the Remedy; and to suppress subtle Inventions and Evasions for Continuance of the Mischief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93, quoting from Heydon\u2019s Case, 3 Co. 7a, 7b, Magdalen College Case, 11 Co. 66b, 73b. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Abd\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-17\">. Suit was brought in state court and removed on diversity grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b529-5\">. As a further argument, appellants contend that paragraph twenty-one of the contract provides for a shorter limitation period in the event of death than is permitted by 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 183b (c). We find it unnecessary to rule on the validity of paragraph twenty-one simply because this appeal concerns bodily injury, not death. Compare Barrette v. Home Lines, Inc., 168 F.Supp. 141 (S.D.N.Y.1958), with Schwartz v. S. S. Nassau, 345 F.2d 465 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 919, 86 S.Ct. 294, 15 L.Ed.2d 234 (1965), and Foster v. Cunard White Star, 121 F.2d 12 (2d Cir. 1941).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
