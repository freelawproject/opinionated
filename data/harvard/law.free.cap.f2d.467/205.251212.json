A U-Haul was coming and going during all hours of the day and night. Once a car was seen going into the garage but never came out. The lower level garage windows were painted over.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The police responded that day, by climbing a ladder to an upper level window and peering inside where they saw dismantled new automobile bodies, a motor hanging on a hoist, a number of tools and three cutting torches. The lessor requested an investigation and the police learned that the address given by the lessee to the lessor was actually an empty lot.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The next day, the gas station operator notified the police that the U-Haul had again entered the garage. The police went to the garage. The door was locked. The police identified themselves and asked for admittance. No response. Making sure neither the U-Haul nor any person had left the garage, the police went to a broken window pane and inside saw the U-Haul backed up to a chain hoist from which an engine hung. They again sought admittance and tried without success to have the persons come out of the garage. The police threatened to use tear gas if the occupants did not emerge. Some person inside then handed keys out of the window to the police and \u201cinvited\u201d the police to enter. The occupants were told by the police to come out through the overhead door.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">The overhead door was opened from inside, and Gardner and another person emerged. They were arrested and informed of their rights and the police \u201cimmediately\u201d entered the garage \u201cto investigate.\u201d Inside, the police found three vehicle identification numbers (VINs) on three cars which state police later identified as stolen. This evidence was admitted at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-13\">We hold that the warrantless search conducted by the police after the arrest of Gardner was unreasonable in violation of Gardner\u2019s Fourth Amendment right; that the admission of the fruits of the unlawful search (three VINs) at his trial unconstitutionally tainted his conviction; and that reversal of the conviction is compelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-14\">Gardner\u2019s consent to the search cannot be gleaned from the testimony. Neither the keys nor the invitation to enter were given the police voluntarily. On the contrary, the threat of the tear gas produced both. \u201cWhere there is coercion there cannot be consent.\u201d Bumper v. North Carolina, 391 U.S. 543, 550, 88 S.Ct. 1788, 1792, 20 L.Ed.2d 797 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-15\">Furthermore, assuming but not deciding, that the warrantless arrest of Gardner after he emerged from the garage was lawful, the search inside the garage cannot be justified as incidental to the arrest. There is no showing here, as required by Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969), that the evidence seized was within the area of Gardner\u2019s \u201cimmediate control\u201d <em>(i. e., </em>the area from within which Gardner might have gained possession of a weapon or destructible evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>dence). And we think that since the arrest took place <em>outside </em>of the garage, the subsequent complete search <em>inside </em>the garage clearly cannot be upheld in view of Vale v. Louisiana, 399 U.S. 30, 33-34, 90 S.Ct. 1969, 26 L.Ed.2d 409 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\"> We are not persuaded by the government\u2019s arguments to validate the search. There is no testimony, despite a leading question, that the police entered to check the garage for dangerous persons. And when they \u201cdiscovered\u201d the vehicle numbers they were not where they had a right to be, nor had they done so inadvertently. Dombrowski v. Cady, 471 F.2d 280 (7th Cir., 1972). They did not know the three automobiles in \u201cplain view\u201d were stolen until the numbers unlawfully seized were checked by state police. And the fact that three partly disassembled automobiles were in \u201cplain view\u201d from the outside of the garage provided probable cause for a search warrant, but not an excuse for a warrantless entry into the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b268-8\">. 18 U.S.O. \u00a7 2313.
