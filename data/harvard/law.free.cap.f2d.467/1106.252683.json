Valdovinos-Torres then brought proceedings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, contending that the recommendation denied him due process of law by inhibiting his chances for parole. The district court denied relief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-15\">The appellant has cited no constitutional or statutory provision that would deny the district judge the advisory role contemplated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208. Indeed, the entire section, taken as a whole, exhibits a congressional intent to afford the sentencing judge a wide range of discretionary recommendations, most of which, like the one made in this case, are advisory only. Under Section 4208(a)(1), however, the sentencing judge could have specified that parole not be favorably considered until after one third of the sentence had been served.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
