Subsequently, with plaintiff\u2019s consent, the injunction was dissolved; thereafter only plaintiff\u2019s claims for compensatory and punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees remained. Defendants\u2019 request for a jury trial of those issues was denied, D.C., 312 F.Supp. 1008. After trial, the court found that plaintiff had suffered no actual damages but assessed punitive damages of $250; the prayer for attorney\u2019s fees was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-17\"> On appeal defendants contend that the finding of discrimination is clearly erroneous, that it was error to award punitive damages, and that they were entitled to a jury trial. We shall not describe the evidence of discrimination except to note that it was marginal; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>whichever way the trial judge had ruled, his determination of that issue would not have been clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We are also satisfied that if his finding of discrimination is accepted, an award of punitive damages was authorized by the statute notwithstanding the absence of any actual loss to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We shall confine our analysis to the jury trial issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">The district court held that a jury trial was not required by the Seventh Amendment<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or by a fair interpretation of the statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-5\">The court rejected the constitutional claim on the grounds (1) that the cause of action was created by statute and not recognized at common law; and (2) that the statutory claim invoked the equitable powers of the court and the amendment has no application to the recovery of money damages as an incident to complete equitable relief. Both propositions are supported by N. L. R. B. v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1, 48-49, 57 S.Ct. 615, 81 L.Ed. 893.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-15\">The district court also considered the award of damages in a housing discrimination case arising under the 1968 Act analogous to an award of back pay in an employment discrimination case under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and therefore relied on cases holding that there is no right to a jury trial in such litigation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In its opinion the district court placed no reliance on the argument, sometimes advanced by proponents of civil rights legislation, that allowance of a jury trial might undermine effective enforcement of the statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-16\">Our study of the issue persuades us that (1) the constitutional right to trial by jury applies in at least some judicial proceedings to enforce rights created by statute; (2) this action for damages is \u201cin the nature of a suit at common law\u201d;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (3) the nature of the claim is \u201clegal\u201d within the test identified in Ross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>v. Bernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 538, 90 S.Ct. 733, 24 L.Ed.2d 729; (4) the right to a jury trial may not be denied on the ground that the damage claim is incidental to a claim for equitable relief; (5) cases involving an award of back pay pursuant to the 1964 Act are inapplicable; and finally (6) in view of our grave doubts as to the constitutionality of a denial of the right to a jury trial and the failure of Congress expressly to indicate that the traditional procedure for litigating damage claims should not be followed, the statute should be construed to authorize trial by jury. Accordingly, we have decided to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\"> The Seventh Amendment preserves the substance of the right to a jury trial which existed under English common law when the amendment was adopted.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It has never been suggested that the application of the amendment is narrowly confined to such common law writs as might be enforceable in a federal court. On the contrary, since the bulk of the civil litigation in the federal judicial system involves the assertion of a federal right derived either from an act of Congress or the Constitution itself, necessarily the principal significance of the Seventh Amendment has been in such cases.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is perfectly clear that the fact that a litigant is asserting a statutory right does not deprive him or his adversary of the protection of the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-6\">In Parsons v. Bedford, 28 U.S. (3 Pet.) 433, 7 L.Ed. 732, Mr. Justice Story, writing for the Court, rejected the contention expressed by Mr. Justice M\u2019Lean in dissent that the amendment was inapplicable because the claim arose not under the common law but rather under the statutes of Louisiana.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Mr. Justice Story focused on the character of the claim as a \u201clegal right\u201d and eloquently described the purpose of the amendment :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1175-16\">\u201cThe trial by jury is justly dear to the American people. It has always been an object of deep interest and solicitude, and every encroachment upon it has been watched with great jealousy. The right to such a trial is, it is believed, incorporated into, and secured in every state constitution in the union; and it is found in the constitution of Louisiana. One of the strongest objections originally taken against the constitution of the United States, was the want of an express provision securing the right of trial by jury in civil cases. As soon as the constitution was adopted, this right was secured by the seventh amendment of the constitution proposed by Congress; and which received an assent of the people so general, as to establish its importance as a fundamental guarantee of the rights and liberties of the people. This amendment declares, that \u2018In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved; and no fact once tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examinable in any Court of the United States, than according <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>to the rules of the common law.\u2019 At this time there were no states in the union, the basis of whose jurisprudence was not essentially that of the common law in its widest meaning; and probably no states were contemplated, in which it would not exist. The phrase \u2018common law,\u2019 found in this clause, is used in contradistinction to equity, and admiralty, and maritime jurisprudence. ... By common law, they meant what the constitution denominated in the third article \u2018law;\u2019 not merely suits, which the common law recognized among its old and settled proceedings, but suits in which legal rights were to be ascertained and determined, in contradistinction to those, where equitable rights alone were recognized, and equitable remedies were administered; or where, as in the admiralty, a mixture of public law, and of maritime law and equity was often found in the same suit. Probably there were few, if any, states in the union, in which some new legal remedies differing from the old common law forms were not in use; but in which, however, the trial by jury intervened, and the general regulations in other respects were according to the course of the common law. Proceedings in cases of partition, and of foreign and domestic attachment, might be cited as examples variously adopted and modified. In a just sense, the amendment then may well be construed to embrace all suits, which are not of equity and admiralty jurisdiction, whatever may be the peculiar form which they may assume to settle legal rights.\u201d 28 U.S. at 445-446, 7 L.Ed. 732.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\">In an unbroken line of cases involving enforcement of statutory rights, the Supreme Court has treated the right to a jury trial as a matter too obvious to be doubted. Thus, in a civil action to recover a statutory penalty for a violation of the immigration laws, the first Mr. Justice Harlan, speaking for the Court, said that the \u201cdefendant was, of course, entitled to have a jury summoned in this case.\u201d Hepner v. United States, 213 U.S. 103, 115, 29 S.Ct. 474, 479, 53 L.Ed. 720. In an action for treble damages under \u00a7 7 of the Sherman Act, Mr. Justice Holmes, also speaking for a unanimous Court, considered it plain that \u201cthe statute should not be read as attempting to authorize liability to be enforced otherwise than through the verdict of a jury in a court of common law.\u201d Fleitmann v. Welsbach Street Lighting Co., 240 U.S. 27, 29, 36 S.Ct. 233, 234, 60 L.Ed. 505. In a case alleging violation of the Safety Appliance Act of 1910, which did not expressly authorize a private remedy, the Court found an implied right to recover damages in a jury trial \u201caccording to a doctrine of the common law.\u201d Texas &amp; Pacific Ry. v. Rigsby, 241 U.S. 33, 39, 36 S.Ct. 482, 484, 60 L.Ed. 874. In a case involving an ambiguous claim for damages, either as an amount due under a contract or as a statutory claim for damages for trademark infringement, the Court held that the claim was \u201cwholly legal in its nature however the complaint is construed\u201d and that the \u201cconstitutional right to trial by jury\u201d was applicable to the claim. Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369 U.S. 469, 477, 82 S.Ct. 894, 899, 8 L.Ed.2d 44. And in an action brought under \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act, the Court has expressly characterized the right to a jury trial as \u201cconstitutional.\u201d Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 510, 79 S.Ct. 948, 3 L.Ed.2d 988.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>N. L. R. B. v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1, 48-49, 57 S.Ct. 615, 81 L.Ed. 893, does not hold \u2014 as is sometimes assumed \u2014 that no jury trial is required in a cause of action created by statute since any such action would have been unknown to the common law and therefore beyond the reach of the Seventh Amendment. The <em>Jones &amp; Laugh-lin </em>opinion expressly recognizes that the amendment is applicable not only to a suit at common law, but also to a judicial proceeding \u201cin the nature of such a suit.\u201d The distinction drawn in the opinion is not between substantive rights derived from the common law as opposed to those created by statute; it is the difference between a proceeding \u201cin the nature of a suit at common law\u201d and a \u201cstatutory proceeding.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1177-4\">The Court\u2019s reference to a \u201cstatutory proceeding\u201d rather than to a judicial proceeding brought to redress a right created by statute is important. Cases such as Parsons v. Bedford and Fleit-mann v. Welsbach Street Lighting Co. were such judicial proceedings, and their teaching is not undermined in the slightest by the <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin </em>holding. The procedure approved by <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin </em>was, of course, fundamentally different from a common law trial. It was administrative rather than judicial and did not invoke the original jurisdiction of a court in determining factual issues or fashioning a remedy. The initial case was not \u201ctried\u201d in a court of law or equity; it was \u201ctried\u201d in a separate <em>proceeding </em>created by statute.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1177-8\">Here there is no statutory <em>proceeding. </em>The statute authorizes a \u201ccivil action\u201d in the courts of the United States. The rights protected and the relief available are set forth in the statute, but the proceeding is not statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>in the <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin </em>or Guthrie<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> sense.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The issue we must consider, therefore, is whether an action for damages authorized by the Civil Rights Act of 1968 is, in the language of <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin, </em>\u201cin the nature of a suit at common law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">There are three reasons why this action is the kind of case which is appropriately described as in the nature of a suit at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-6\">First, the tribunal whose jurisdiction is invoked is a court created pursuant to Article III of the Constitution. Unquestionably, congressional power to prescribe the procedures to be employed in such a court is limited by the Constitution and specifically by the Seventh Amendment.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The proceeding is judicial in character rather than administrative or \u201cstatutory.\u201d In all respects \u2014 at least all except the right to a jury trial if our appraisal of that right is not correct \u2014 it is clear that the procedure to be followed in this case is precisely that which is applicable to suits at common law which are tried in the federal judicial system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-12\">Second, the remedy sought, including both compensatory and punitive damages, is the relief most typical of an action at law. If, as the scholars have consistently indicated, we should look to history for guidance in determining whether or not a claim is of the kind which is triable to a jury,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> unquestionably the prayer for damages points to that result.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>Finally, the nature of the substantive right asserted, although not specifically recognized at common law, is analogous to common law rights. An English innkeeper who refused, without justification, to rent lodgings to a traveler was apparently liable in an action at law triable to a jury.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Refusing to rent an apartment on the false ground that an applicant is an unfit tenant, when race is the real motivation, is a species of defamation; libel and slander, of course, are common law causes of action. Discrimination might involve mental distress or other emotional harm, and the developing common law of torts recognizes a cause of action for the intentional infliction of emotional harm.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">We therefore conclude that a suit for damages for discrimination in the sale or rental of housing facilities is sufficiently analogous to a suit at common law to be appropriately characterized as a \u201clegal\u201d claim triable to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-15\">Although the full implications of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Ross v. Bernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 90 S.Ct. 733, 24 L.Ed.2d 729 have yet to be determined, it is clear that mere analogy to history may not be sufficient to define the scope of the Seventh Amendment. In that case the constitutional right to a jury trial was held to encompass at least some claims in litigation which historically had been the exclusive province of equity. That was a derivative action brought by a shareholder in the name of a corporation. The shareholder\u2019s standing to litigate was governed by equitable principles; the corporate claim which he asserted was, at least in part, legal.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-16\">History was unquestionably relevant to the Court\u2019s analysis of the question whether a jury trial was required in such a case. But, following the lead set in <em>Beacon </em>and <em>Dairy Queen, </em>the traditional treatment of the entire litigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>was subordinated to the traditional characterization of particular claims. Thus, the Court had \u201cno doubt\u201d that a claim for money damages predicated on breach of contract or gross negligence was legal in character.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">This conclusion did not rest, as it might, simply on the fact that such a claim was enforceable at common law in England in 1791. Instead, the Court identified history as only one of three criteria that should be considered in determining the \u201clegal\u201d nature of an issue. The other two were: \u201csecond, the remedy sought; and, third, the practical abilities and limitations of juries.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Indeed, not only did the Court identify these two additional criteria; it also implied, without expressly stating, that history may be a less reliable guide than the other two.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We have already concluded that under an historical analysis a jury trial is required in the present case; we proceed to consider the other two criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">Under the second and third criteria identified in Ross v. Bernhard, the civil rights claim asserted in this case was certainly appropriate for determination by a jury. The relief sought was actual damages and punitive damages. Both the determination of the amount which would adequately compensate a litigant for an unliquidated claim and the punitive element of the award are appropriate for jury determination. As we have already discussed, juries historically have been required where the remedy sought was damages, either compensatory or punitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-6\">The \u201cpractical abilities and limitations of juries\u201d obviously present no obstacle to their determination of the issues presented in these civil rights cases. Typically, the facts are not complex and decision turns on appraisals of credibility and motive. Certainly such matters are far more suitable for jury determination than complicated commercial issues that routinely arise in derivative and antitrust litigation. Thus, the third as well as the second criterion identified in Ross v. Bernhard strongly militates in favor of recognition of the right to a jury trial in a case of this kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-9\">History indicates that a jury trial is required. And if the Supreme Court adheres to its identification of two additional criteria in Ross v. Bernhard, both the damage relief sought and the character of the issue to be tried compel the conclusion that the litigants are entitled to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-11\">The <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin </em>holding that the Seventh Amendment is inapplicable to an N.L.R.B. proceeding terminating in the entry of an order directing reinstatement and awarding back pay was supported not only by the Court\u2019s characterization of the proceeding as statutory, but also by reference to chancery practice in which damages could be awarded as an element of complete equitable relief.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In this case the district' court also regarded the relief authorized by the 1968 Act as primarily equitable and considered it appropriate to award damages as incident to such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-12\">As the case developed, the defendant\u2019s right to demand a jury was not determined until after plaintiff\u2019s claim for equitable relief had been abandoned. Nevertheless, we share the district court\u2019s view that the right to a jury trial in this kind of case may properly be tested by the character of the relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>requested in plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Our decision is not predicated on the special circumstance that only the damage claims remained when defendant\u2019s demand for a jury was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">At common law, a court of equity, in a proceeding properly before it, would hear and determine any legal issues incidental to the equitable issues and award any legal relief which might be incidental to equitable relief.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Multiplicity of suits could thus be avoided. And if equitable relief were no longer appropriate, the chancellor might nevertheless award damages or, in his discretion, permit the complaint to be amended to state only a legal claim which would then be triable to a jury.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">Today, however, legal and equitable issues can both be raised in one \u201ccivil action\u201d under the Federal Rules. Thus, the avoidance of a multiplicity of suits and the desire to afford a complete remedy in one proceeding are no longer justifications for the \u201cincidental\u201d power of an equity court to award money damages. The right of the court, without a jury, to award \u201cincidental\u201d legal relief was nevertheless thought secure under the Federal Rules until the Supreme Court indicated differently in Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 79 S.Ct. 948, 3 L.Ed.2d 988, and Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369 U.S. 469, 82 S.Ct. 894, 8 L.Ed.2d 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">In <em>Beacon, </em>the Court upheld the petitioner\u2019s right to a jury trial of his counterclaim for treble damages under the antitrust laws which he had asserted in response to a complaint seeking, in part, equitable relief. In <em>Dairy Queen, </em>plaintiff sought injunctive relief against use of a trademark and an accounting to determine the amount due under a contract deemed breached. The district court held that the proceeding was either \u201cpurely equitable\u201d or that any legal issues were \u201cincidental\u201d to the equitable issues. Mr. Justice Black, speaking for the Court, disposed of the \u201cincidental\u201d issue quite bluntly: \u201c[N]o such rule may be applied in the federal courts.\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Referring to <em>Beacon, </em>he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1181-10\">\u201cThe holding in <em>Beacon Theatres </em>was that where both legal and equitable issues are presented in a single case, \u2018only under the most imperative circumstances, circumstances which in view of the flexible procedures of the Federal Rules we cannot now anticipate, can the right to a jury trial of legal issues be lost through prior determination of equitable claims.\u2019 That holding, of course, applies whether the trial judge chooses to characterize the legal issues presented as \u2018incidental\u2019 to equitable issues or not. Consequently, in a case such as this where there cannot even be a contention of such \u2018imperative circumstances,\u2019 <em>Beacon Theatres </em>requires that any legal issues for which a trial by jury is timely and properly demanded be submitted to a jury. There being no question of the timeliness or correctness of the demand involved here, the sole question which we must decide is whether the action now pending before the District Court contains legal issues.\u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>It would appear that <em>Beacon </em>and <em>Dairy Queen </em>have mandated that once any claim for money damages is made, the legal issue \u2014 whether defendant breached a duty owed plaintiff for which defendant is liable in damages\u2014 must be tried to a jury whether or not there exists an equitable claim to which the damage claim might once have been considered \u201cincidental.\u201d <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that the right to a jury trial of a claim for damages under the Civil Rights Act of 1968 may not be denied on the ground that such damages are merely incidental to the prayer for injunctive relief.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">Since the district court relied on several cases<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> holding that in an employee\u2019s suit for reinstatement and back pay under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the employer is not entitled to a jury trial, we should briefly indicate why we think the reasoning of those cases is inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-6\">First, insofar as the cases hold that back pay is a legal remedy which may be recovered as incidental to equitable relief, we believe they cannot stand in the face of <em>Beacon </em>and <em>Dairy Queen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1183-7\">Second, to the extent that they hold, relying on N. L. R. B. v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1, 48-49, 57 S.Ct. 615, 81 L.Ed. 893, that a jury trial is not required because the right vindicated is a statutory right, we reject the conclusion because it fails to differentiate between a statutory proceeding and the enforcement of a statutory right in an ordinary \u201ccivil action\u201d in the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-15\">Third, an acceptable rationale for awarding back pay in a non-jury judicial proceeding is consistent with our analysis of the damage claims asserted in this ease. It is not unreasonable to regard an award of back pay as an appropriate exercise of a chancellor\u2019s power to require restitution.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Restitution is clearly an equitable remedy. As Professor Moore put it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-16\">\u201cIn equity, restitution is usually thought of as a remedy by which defendant is made to disgorge illgotten gains or to restore the status quo, or to accomplish both objectives.\u201d <footnotemark>36</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"APv\">The retention of \u201cwages\u201d which would have been paid but for the statutory violation (of improper discharge) might well be considered \u201cill-gotten gains\u201d; ultimate payment restores the situation to that which would have existed had the statute not been violated.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>The payment of compensatory damages in a housing discrimination case, however, is not a return to plaintiff of something which defendant illegally obtained or retained; it is a payment in money for those losses \u2014 tangible and intangible \u2014 which plaintiff has suffered by reason of a breach of duty by defendant. Such damages, as opposed to rent overcharges,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> unpaid overtime wages,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> or back pay, cannot properly be termed restitution.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">Whether or not the jury trial issue was correctly resolved in the back pay cases arising under the 1964 Act,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> we are satisfied that they are not applicable to the question presented to us under the 1968 statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-6\">As the district court correctly emphasized, there are persuasive reasons for interpreting \u00a7 812 to authorize \u201cthe court\u201d but not a jury to award damages to an injured party. When those words are used in connection with the allowance of fees, they clearly describe the judge rather' than the jury.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Therefore, it is argued that the same words in the clause providing that the \u201ccourt\u201d may award damages must also refer to the trial judge rather than the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-11\">The argument is persuasive but not compelling. The \u201caward\u201d may refer to the entry of judgment by the court just as the amount which a plaintiff may \u201crecover\u201d in antitrust litigation is finally determined by the court\u2019s judgment rather than the verdict of a jury, which is unmentioned in the Clayton Act but is undeniably required if demanded by either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-12\">Other language in the statute implies, without expressly stating, that a jury\u2019s participation is appropriate. The statutory reference to \u201cdamages\u201d and also to \u201cpunitive damages\u201d would normally contemplate a jury verdict as an element of the judicial process leading up to the fi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>nal award.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Certainly it is highly unusual for a federal statute to authorize a court to impose punishment, even if limited to $1,000, without according the defendant the right to a jury trial.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">The term \u201ccivil action\u201d in legislation enacted since the merger of law and equity in 1938 is comparable to the words \u201caction at law\u201d or \u201csuit in equity\u201d which were used previously.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The words \u201caction at law\u201d implied a right to jury trial. The words \u201ccivil action,\u201d as <em>Beacon, Dairy Queen </em>and <em>Ross </em>make clear, do not in any sense imply that there is no right to a jury trial \u2014 a \u201ccivil action\u201d asserting a legal claim is triable to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">' The legislative history of the 1968 act is silent on the question. There is no evidence that the proponents of the legislation expressed fear that the right to a jury trial would undermine the statute\u2019s effectiveness, or conversely, that opponents accepted any compromise in reliance on an assurance that juries could be demanded. The policy considerations which prompted the legislation probably favor a denial of the right; on the other hand, the more basic constitutional considerations which surround the right to a jury as a protection against the over-zealous judge, point the other way. Nor, if the right to have a jury represent a fair cross section of the community and the desirability of broadening lay participation in judicial implementation of civil rights are kept in mind, can one assert that policy considerations unequivocally favor one view rather than the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-11\">In the end, we look to another canon of construction as controlling in this case. As Mr. Justice Holmes stated in United States v. Jin Fuey Moy: \u201cA statute must be construed, if fairly possible, so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional, but also grave doubts upon that score.\u201d 241 U.S. 394, 401, 36 S.Ct. 658, 659, 60 L.Ed. 1061. See also United States v. Campos-Serrano, 404 U.S. 293, 92 S.Ct. 471, 30 L.Ed.2d 457.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>Even if our discussion of the Seventh Amendment is deemed inadequate to overcome an unambiguous statutory denial of a jury trial in an action to recover compensatory and punitive damages, there are certainly enough \u201cgrave doubts upon that score\u201d that we should place an interpretation on the statute which will avoid the constitutional issue. We therefore hold that it was error for the district court to refuse defendants\u2019 request for a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1173-19\">.

The Court said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-11\">\u201cThe Amendment thus preserves the right which existed under the common law when the Amendment was adopted. Shields v.

While a court became involved in approving or disapproving the recommendations of the commission, it is clear that the <em>proceeding, </em>and not merely the right to relief, was statutory.

If the Congress makes a judgment that a comprehensive scheme of administrative adjudication is required, the Court will be willing to find that it is a \u2018statutory proceeding\u2019 to which the seventh amendment has no application. If, however, a statutory claim is entrusted to court decision, where there is no functional justification for not granting a jury trial, and the claim is for the type of relief normally awarded by a court of law, as would be the case in an action for compensatory damages under Title VII, the similarity to common law forms of action will require a jury trial.\u201d Developments, <em>supra, </em>note 9, 84 Harv.L.Rev. at 1267-1268.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1178-10\">.

Warner Holding Co., 328 U.S. 395, 66 S.Ct. 1086, 90 L.Ed. 1332, the Court recognized that in the government\u2019s suit for an injunction to enforce the emergency Price Control Act of 1942, the government might recover overcharges as restitution. The court thought the equitable remedy of restitution appropriate \u2014 oven though not not specified in the statute \u2014 because it was incidental to other equitable relief and because its use would be appropriate to the enforcement of the statute. But these were justifications for the awarding of relief concededly equitable. The statute also permitted a private suit for damages and a government suit for damages (in the nature of penalties as the Court described them) ; in either case the damages might be trebled. The Court noted that restitution \u201cdiffers greatly from the damages and penalties which may be awarded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 402, 66 S.Ct. at 1093. These remedies were expressly identified as legal in nature, and hence a jury trial would have been required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b1182-11\">. It seems quite clear that the punitive damages in this case cannot be considered \u201cincidental\u201d to equitable relief. See note 44, <em>infra. </em>See also Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U.S. 395, 66 S.Ct. 1086, 90 L.Ed. 1332, in which the Supreme Court viewed the government\u2019s right to sue for damages under the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 ns an action at law for \u201cpenalties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401-402, 66 S.Ct. 1086. See also United States v. Jepson, 90 F.Supp. 983 (D.N.J.1950). But <em>cf. </em>United States v. Shaughnessy, 86 F.Supp. 175 (D.Mass.1949). The <em>Hhaughncssy </em>court held that the government could recover statutory penalties along with an injunction under the Housing and Rent Act of 3947. One basis for the decision, that the damages could be considered \u201cincidental\u201d to equitable relief, is now obsolete in view of <em>Beacon </em>and <em>Dairy Queen. </em>The other basis was that the \u201cdamages sought are in the nature of a penalty when sued for by the United States, and this right to sue exists only where the tenant himself has failed to bring his action. It is essentially what would be an old action in equity and, as such, is triable before a court without a jury.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Professor Moore is critical of this decision. 5 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice If 3S.37 [3] at 307. The court failed to mention either the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Poiier </em>or the general proposition that equity will not avoid damages penal in character. To the extent that it may have viewed the suit as one in equity because the government stood in the shoes of the individual tenant, Ross v. Bernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 90 S.Ct. 733, 24 L.Ed.2d 729 (discussed in the text, <em>supra), </em>has clearly eliminated that basis for denying a jury trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b1183-8\">.

Similarly, rent overcharges might be termed \u201cill-gotten gains.\u201d Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U.S. 395, 66 S.Ct. 1086, 90 L.Ed. 1332, discussed in note 32, <em>supra. </em>Attempts have been made to distinguish private actions and actions intended to correct an offense against the public interest, with the conclusion that a jury trial need not be afforded in the latter situation. In addition to the analytic difficulty with this public-private distinction, see Note, The Right to Jury Trial Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 37 U.Chi.L.Rev. 167, 175-176, we fail to see how this makes any difference in the application of the Seventh Amendment. Whether a purely private wrong or a wrong somehow associated with the public interest is to be vindicated, if Congress chooses to permit its vindication by a \u201ccivil action\u201d in the courts, it must respect the commands of the Seventh Amendment. Suits to collect statutory penalites \u2014 clearly suits brought to redress offenses against the public interest \u2014 have long been considered suits to collect a debt which are triable to a jury. See Hepner v. United States, 213 U.S. 103, 29 S.Ct. 474, 53 L.Ed. 720, and cases there cited. See also Fleitmann v. Welsbach Street Lighting Co., 240 U.S. 27, 29, 36 S.Ct. 233, 60 L.Ed. 505; Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 510, 79 S.Ct. 948, 3 L.Ed.2d 988. This \u201cpublic interest\u201d concept might appropriately be used as a persuasive justification for the use of the equitable remedy of restitution. See Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U.S. at 402, 66 S.Ct. 1086. The court in Wirtz v. Jones, 340 F.2d 901, 905 (5th Cir. 1965) referred to the fact that the suit was \u201cto redress a wrong done to the public good\u201d when it denied a jury trial in a suit by the government to enjoin violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>of the Fair Labor Standards Act and to compel payment of withheld wages. However, the opinion makes it clear, citing as it does the <em>Porter </em>case, that the court was speaking of the equitable power to order restitution. If the remedy cannot fairly be characterized as restitution, however, the fact that the recovery sought is to redress a wrong done to the public good should not affect the. right to a jury trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b1184-8\">.

See cases cited in <em>IYirtz </em>at p. 904. The employee's action is generally viewed as analogous to a common law action of debt or assumpsit. The liquidated damages available to an individual plaintiff would not be recoverable in equity as restitution. In any event, the same recovery available as restitution in equity might also be available in the common law action for general assumpsit.

One commentator\u2019s observation in the Title VII situation might apply equally well to other instances of restitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1184-14\">\u201cHowever, it is important to note that the highly subjective questions of damages, which are often felt to be particularly appropriate for jury determination, are not present in Title VII cases. Back pay awards usually involve a definite amount for a definite period of time, and the total amount in controversy often can be stipulated by the parties. Most problems in determining the amount of a back pay award would be ones of computation rather than subjective evaluation.\u201d Comment, The Right to Jury Trial Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 37 U.Chi.

A court of equity would not enforce a penalty or forfeiture absent a specific statutory authorization. See Livingston v. Woodworth, 56 U.S. (15 How.) 546, 559-560, 14 L.Ed. 809; Stevens v. Gladding, 58 U.S. (17 How.) 447, 453-454, 15 L.Ed. 155. (Except in admiralty, forfeiture cases are triable to a jury. C. J. Hendry Co. v. Moore, 318 U.S. 133, 153, 63 S.Ct. 499, 87 L.Ed. 663; 5 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice H 38.12 [7], subdivision 1 at p. 135.) <em>Cf. </em>Decorative Stone Co. v.

Furthermore, it appears that the few cases which have held that a court may decide if punitive damages shall be awarded have all been patent cases in which a jury trial was available on the issues of infringement and actual damages and the court merely decided, pursuant to unequivocal statutory language, whether the damages should be increased (up to a maximum of three times the actual damages). See Seymour v. McCormick, 57 U.S. 480, 488-489, 16 How. 480, 14 L.Ed. 1024; Swofford v. B. &amp; W., Inc., 336 F.2d 406 (5th Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 962, 85 S.Ct. 653, 13 L.Ed.2d 557; Kennedy v. Lasko Co., 414 F.2d 1249 (3rd Cir. 1969). Those cases indicate that the jury shall determine the issue of actual damages ; the latter two cases find that <em>Beacon </em>and <em>Dairy Queen </em>compel a jury trial on the actual damage question. It is one thing to permit a judge to increase the damage award after a jury trial in which a statutory violation has been found and actual damages awarded (the trial judge\u2019s right to set the amount of a fine in a criminal case <em>after </em>a jury trial on the factual issues is somewhat analogous) ; it is quite another thing to permit the imposition of punishment when there is no jury trial as an element of the judicial process leading up to that result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b1185-14\">.
