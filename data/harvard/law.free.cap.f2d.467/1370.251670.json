Boyd appeals his conviction for assaulting a federal officer (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111). He argues that due process was violated when the trial judge failed to hold a hearing after learning at the time of sentencing that Boyd\u2019s court-appointed attorney had once worked as a federal marshal and was acquainted with two prosecution witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-25\">Boyd admitted that he knew these facts before his trial. Boyd has not suggested any failure of his trial counsel, either in preparation or presentation. None is pointed out to us by Boyd\u2019s new counsel on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-26\">The district judge, in rejecting Boyd\u2019s contentions, stated that defense counsel had done a \u201cvery, very good\u201d job. The trial judge is in the best position to pass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>on the sufficiency of counsel. We decline to hold that the trial judge must hold a sufficiency-of-counsel hearing upon the assertion of facts as flimsy as those put forth here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
