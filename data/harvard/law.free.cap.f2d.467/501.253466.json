Appellee also has pending Application Serial No. 282,991 filed on October 20, 1967, to register the same trademark for laundry starch.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-18\">These are the registrations appellant seeks to cancel and the application which it opposes. They are not in the transcript of record, but we deem their presence unnecessary to decision of the issues on appeal. Compare In re Locher, 455 F.2d 1396, 1400-1401, 59 CCPA (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-19\">Appellant owns trademark registration No. 837,049 of the word-mark RAG<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>GEDY ANN for \u201cStuffed Rag Dolls\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and a <em>copyright </em>registration<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of a \u201cStuffed Rag Doll\u201d entitled \u201cRaggedy Ann.\u201d The controversy before us concerns appellant\u2019s right, in proceedings before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, to rely on its copyright property in the doll. This is thus one of those often perplexing cases involving the interrelationship between various forms of intellectual property. Cf. Mazer v. Stein, 347 U.S. 201, 74 S.Ct. 460, 98 L.Ed. 630 (1954) (copyrights and design patents); In re Mogen David Wine Corp., 328 F.2d 925, 51 CCPA 1260 (1964); id., 372 F.2d 539, 54 CCPA 1086 (1967) (trademarks and design patents); and In re Thorington, 418 F.2d 528, 57 CCPA 759 (1969) (design patents and utility patents).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">This controversy arises because appel-lee moved to strike those portions of appellant\u2019s pleadings pertaining to appellant\u2019s copyright and damage thereto, which damage appellant alleged it would suffer from appellee\u2019s registrations of its marks. The motions to strike were based on the grounds (1) that the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter of those portions of appellant\u2019s pleadings and (2) that they consist of immaterial and impertinent matter. The damages which appellant alleged in those portions of its pleadings with which we are now concerned were (1) that appellee\u2019s publication of representations of appellant\u2019s copyrighted doll, \u201cincluding publication in the Official'Gazette of the Patent Office,\u201d without authorization and without the statutory copyright notice would, if not stopped, \u201cdestroy * * * [appellant\u2019s] entire right, title and interest in and to the copyright in said work,\u201d (2) that appel-lee\u2019s publication of representations of appellant\u2019s copyrighted doll would \u201cdeprive * * * [appellant] of the exclusive use of said copyrighted work, infringe said copyright, violate * * * [appellant\u2019s] rights therein, and expose * * * [appellant] to further violation thereof by others,\u201d and (3) that ap-pellee\u2019s publication of representations of appellant\u2019s copyrighted doll would \u201c[diminish] the commercial value of the copyright to * * * [the appellant]\u201d in various ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-14\">Appellee did not move to strike the following two paragraphs from appellant\u2019s pleadings:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-15\">25. Appellee\u2019s use of a copy or representation of appellant\u2019s copyrighted Raggedy Ann doll as a trademark for laundry products constitutes unfair competition with appellant, calculated to cause confusion in the marketplace with respect to origin of the goods, the relationship of appellee to appellant\u2019s goods, and the relationship of appellant to appellee\u2019s goods, there being no way for consumers to determine whether there is or is not any connection or relationship between appellant and appellee or between their respective Raggedy Ann goods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-16\">26. The confusion which is likely to be caused in the marketplace as between appellant\u2019s Raggedy Ann goods and appellee\u2019s Raggedy Ann goods will be highly injurious to appellant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-17\">The board granted appellee\u2019s motions in their entirety.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It started from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>the proposition, which it termed \u201cwell settled\u201d though it cited no authority, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">* * * [Trademark Trial and Appeal] Board has no jurisdiction to determine the validity of or infringement of a copyright. That authority rests with the federal courts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">The board then stated that the \u201csole question\u201d before it was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">* * * [j-j whether the averments sought to be stricken comprise a claim of copyright infringement and [2] whether such a question can be determined by the Board as a collateral matter to the question of damage within the meaning of the Trademark Act of 1946.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">It answered the first question in the affirmative and the second in the negative, apparently in considerable part because it feared that an affirmative answer to the second question would have required it to \u201cadjudicate the validity of the pleaded copyright,\u201d appellee having stated in its motions to strike that, if its motions were not granted, it \u201cwould be obliged to plead that * * * [appellant\u2019s] purported copyright is invalid<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that it has not infringed the same.\u201d The board also relied on Merrick v. Sharp &amp; Dohme, Inc., 185 F.2d 713, 717, (7th Cir. 1950), cert. den. 340 U.S. 954, 71 S.Ct. 573, 95 L.Ed. 687 (1951), which it characterized as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-17\">* * \" holding that * * * [a trademark infringement action] involves private litigation whereas <em>* </em>* * [a trademark opposition] is an administrative matter that is held in the interest of the public with the Patent Office as the public\u2019s representative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-21\">The board stated its belief that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-22\">* * * the claim against Faultless predicated on the adverse party\u2019s alleged copyright falls in the category of a private matter because the objected [to] averments and exhibits are, in essence, directed to a claim of misuse of the subject matter of the pleaded copyright.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-23\">It therefore concluded that it was \u201cprecluded from considering this question either directly or otherwise\u201d and granted appellee\u2019s motions to strike.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">I. <em>Jurisdiction of This Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">At oral argument, we asked the parties to brief the question of jurisdiction of this court over an appeal from a decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board granting a motion to strike some, but not all, of a party\u2019s pleadings. Up to that time the parties had assumed we had jurisdiction. We referred them to United States Treasury v. Synthetic Plastics Co., 341 F.2d 157, 52 CCPA 967 (1965); Seamless Rubber Co. v. Ethicon, Inc., 268 F.2d 231, 46 CCPA 950 (1959); and Master, Warden, etc. v. Sheffield Steel Corp., 215 F.2d 285, 42 CCPA 726 (1954), all of which stand for the general proposition that this court does <em>not </em>have jurisdiction over <em>interlocutory </em>appeals from the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Neither party has asked us to overrule the above cases, but both have asked us to decide this appeal despite them. Ap-pellee has asked us to do so because the board\u2019s decision \u201cfinally disposed of and eliminated from consideration the major portion of the matters in dispute, both in terms of the pleadings and the issues.\u201d Appellant, for the stated purpose of \u201crendering said [board] decision final\u201d by removing from the case all issues other than \u201cthe issues raised by this motion to strike\u201d moved under Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to amend by cancelling those portions of its pleadings dealing with its <em>trademark </em>registration of the word-mark RAGGEDY ANN. The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board granted appellant\u2019s motion March 10, 1972,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and appellee has not questioned the method by which or the late .date at which the cancellation was accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">The portions of appellant\u2019s pleadings which have not been struck pursuant to either party\u2019s motion recite appellant\u2019s name and address and appellee\u2019s ownership of its registrations and its application, describe appellee\u2019s mark, and conclude with amended paragraphs 25 and 26 set forth supra. Appellant concedes that its \u201camendments to the pleadings leave certain portions of paragraphs 25 and 26 [supra] intact and that these portions have not technically been adjudicated.\u201d It argues, however, that the logic of the board\u2019s opinion \u201cencompasses these non-adjudicated portions fully as well as the adjudicated paragraphs\u201d and that, practically speaking, it has transformed the interlocutory decision into a final adjudication by deleting all references to its trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">Appellee, while arguing that the court would have had jurisdiction to decide the appeal even if appellant had not can-celled the above-mentioned portions of its pleadings, contends that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-13\">* * * if the decision from which the instant appeal was taken lacks sufficient finality to be appealable at this time, then the amendments to the pleadings which appellant proposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>are not sufficient to give it the requisite finality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Appellee\u2019s alternative position is based primarily on .the remaining portions of paragraphs 25 and 26, which it contends raise issues which still have not been adjudicated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Appellee refers us to Gillespie v. United States Steel Corp., 321 F.2d 518 (6th Cir. 1963), affirmed, 379 U.S. 148, 85 S.Ct. 308, 13 L.Ed.2d 199 (1964), where the Court of Appeals had before it an appeal from an order of the District Court striking two of the three grounds upon which plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was based. After discussing the difficulties of determining what constitutes a \u201cfinal\u201d order, appealable without the benefit of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) (which provides for interlocutory appeals in certain cases), and noting appellant\u2019s argument that the rule was frequently bent if not broken to allow the appellate courts to grant early review of claims \u201cfairly severable from the context of a larger litigious process,\u201d the court concluded that, while the question before it was a close one, \u201cin the interest of the due and proper administration of justice,\u201d it would be preferable to decide the appeal on the merits rather than dismissing the appeal as premature. The Supreme Court affirmed, stating that \u201cthe requirement of finality is to be given a \u2018practical rather than a technical construction\u2019 \u201d and noting that the questions presented were \u201cfundamental to the further conduct of the case.\u201d 379 U.S. at 152-154, 85 S.Ct. at 311-312. See also Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, 370 F.2d 119 (2d Cir. 1966), and Collins v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corp., 106 F.2d 83 (2d Cir. 1939). In <em>Gillespie </em>the Supreme Court said (379 U.S., pp. 152-153, 85 S.Ct. p. 311):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">Dickinson v. Petroleum Conversion Corp., 338 U.S. 507, 511, 70 S.Ct. 322, 324, 94 L.Ed. 299, pointed out that in deciding the question of finality the most important competing considerations are \u201cthe inconvenience and costs of piecemeal review on the one hand and the danger of denying justice by delay on the other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">Appellee argues that our final judgment rule should be given a \u201cpractical construction\u201d and that the decision which is the subject of the instant appeal should be considered final both because \u201cthe cause of action left unadjudi-cated is by comparison insubstantial\u201d and because \u201cthe cause of action left un-adjudicated is separate and distinct from the cause of action which was decided.\u201d While we do not believe that the cause of action left unadjudicated is inconsequential or frivolous, we do agree that, at the very least, our final judgment rule should be given a \u201cpractical construction\u201d and that the cause of action left unadjudicated in this case is sufficiently separate and distinct from the cause of action which was decided that, in the interests of the due and proper administration of justice, we should reach it now. We therefore hold that the decision appealed from in this case is final and that we have jurisdiction to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">II. <em>Appellee\u2019s Motion to </em>Strike<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A8S\">Section 13 of the Trademark Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1063) provides (our emphasis) that \u201cAny person who believes that he would be damaged <em>by the registration </em>of a mark upon the principal register may * * * file a verified opposition in the Patent Office,\u201d and section 14 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064) provides (our emphasis) that \u201cA verified petition to cancel a registration of a mark * * * may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>* * * be filed by any person who believes that he is or will be damaged <em>by the registration </em>of a mark on the principal register * * The statute does not expressly define damage or state in what way a person must believe himself to be damaged <em>by the registration, </em>actual or potential, in order to have standing to maintain an opposition or cancellation proceeding. Appellee\u2019s strongest argument in support of its motion proceeds as follows: Section 2 of the Trademark Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052) in effect specifies the grounds upon which the belief of damage must be based. Section 2 provides that \u201cNo trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature unless it\u201d falls within certain prohibited categories. Only two of these categories are possibly relevant here. The first category is (d) \u201ca mark which so resembles a mark registered in the Patent Office or a <em>mark </em>or <em>trade name </em>previously used in the United States by another and not abandoned, as to be likely, when applied to the goods of the applicant, to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive * * (Emphasis ours.) The other category is (e) \u201ca mark which * * * when applied to the goods of the applicant * * * is merely descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive <em>of them </em>* \u2022* (Emphasis ours.) Neither of these categories is squarely applicable to this situation. The stricken portions of appellant\u2019s pleadings do not allege prior use of its Raggedy Ann doll per se as a trademark or as a trade name or that appellee\u2019s mark is descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of <em>appellee\u2019s </em>goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-14\">If we were writing upon a clean slate, this argument might have persuasive force. However, we are not, and it has long been the law that, in an opposition based on likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception, \u201cIt is sufficient if an opposer establishes \u2018priority of use analogous to a trade-mark use\u2019 of a trade-name, and the \u2018likelihood of damage to him <em>by the registration </em>of such mark to another.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis ours.) Lever Bros. Co. v. Nobio Products, Inc., 103 F.2d 917, 919, 26 CCPA 1253, 1255 (1939). We see no reason why a different rule should obtain in cancellations. This court has held that a party to a trademark opposition may rely on advertising and promotional use of a term or slogan, Lever Bros. Co. v. Nobio Products, Inc., supra,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and grade-or model-mark use of a word, John Wood Mfg. Co. v. Servel, Inc., 77 F.2d 946, 22 CCPA 1370 (1935),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to establish superior rights over a subsequent trademark user of the term, slogan, or word. We now hold that a party to such a proceeding can similarly rely on the copyrighted appearance of its goods, per se.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>This result is, we think, as much \u201csupported * * * by reason and common sense,\u201d John Wood Mfg. Co. v. Servel, Inc., 77 F.2d at 949, 22 CCPA at 1374, as were the results in the previous cases. Certainly the probability of confusion, mistake, or deception can be equally high in cases such as this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\"> What appellant seems to have lost sight of in its pleadings in the opposition and two cancellations is that in the Patent Office it can properly attack <em>only </em>appellee\u2019s right <em>to register </em>and that the Patent Office is not the place to complain about appellee\u2019s <em>conduct </em>in <em>using </em>representations of the Raggedy Ann doll or <em>publishing </em>representations of it. Such conduct is no concern of the Patent Office, and allegations thereof are truly immaterial if not impertinent also. The allegations of the pleadings should be restricted to matters bearing on appellee\u2019s <em>right to register </em>and actual or potential damage to appellant <em>from registration. </em>The existence of copyright, copyright registration, and property rights derived therefrom may be relevant to these matters, but allegations of copyright infringement and unfair competition, which are intermingled with such statements of fact and law in the present pleadings, are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">In this case appellant\u2019s pleadings go far beyond allegations of likelihood of confusion, etc., bearing on the issue of likelihood of damage, or actual damage, from registrations of appellee's trademark, and we agree with the board that it has no jurisdiction over the issues raised by appellant\u2019s pleadings insofar as they allege copyright <em>infringement, unfair competition, </em>and the like. The latter was expressly held with respect to our jurisdiction in a trademark opposition, White Co. v. Vita-Var Corp., 182 F.2d 217, 221-222, 37 CCPA 1039, 1044 (1950), and the former is clearly the intended meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338 (a). However, we do not wish to be read as holding that the board is thereby precluded from passing on the validity of a copyright if it is necessary to do so in the course of the exercise of its statutory jurisdiction, as it may very well be in this ease. Compare American Novawood Corp. v. U. S. Plywood-Champion Papers, Inc., 426 F.2d 823, 827, 57 CCPA 1276, 1280-1281 (1970) (\u201cBecause one decision the board must make is the same as would be made by a court of general jurisdiction in an infringement suit does not mean it is precluded from making it.\u201d). Although 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(a) provides that the federal district courts\u2019 original jurisdiction over copyright actions \u201cshall be exclusive of the courts of the states,\u201d the state courts clearly may pass on the validity of a copyright if it is necessary to do so in the course of deciding a ease over which they do have jurisdiction. Nimmer on Copyright \u00a7 131.11, \u201cJurisdiction of Claims Based Upon or Relating to Statutory Copyright\u201d (1971); Amdur, Copyright Law and Practice, Chapt. XXV, \u201cThe Proper Tribunal,\u201d \u00a7 11, \u201cState jurisdiction: Incidental question of statutory copyright\u201d (1936). The Bureau of Customs, another federal administrative agency, apparently has similar authority in the exercise of its statutory authority. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 106-109.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the board that appellant\u2019s pleadings raise issues over which the board has no jurisdiction and that the portions relating thereto should be stricken. However, appellant has also alleged that use of appellee\u2019s mark sought to be registered and registered is \u201ccalculated to cause confusion in the marketplace with respect to origin of the goods, the relationship of appellee to appellant\u2019s goods, and the relationship of appellant to appellee\u2019s goods\u201d (paragraph 25, as reproduced supra). We have held that appellant may rely on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>copyrighted appearance of its goods as the basis for this assertion, and much of the stricken pleadings is relevant to that assertion. Accordingly, we <em>reverse </em>the board insofar as it held that portions of the pleadings relevant to the likelihood-of-confusion issue should be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">\n<em>Summary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">I. Though the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board finally disposed of less than all of the pleaded bases for relief, the issues decided were substantial and separate and distinct from those remaining. The decision appealed from was, therefore, a final decision, and this court has jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">II. We <em>affirm </em>the decision of the board insofar as it struck portions of appellant\u2019s pleadings charging copyright infringement and unfair competition, but <em>reverse </em>the decision of the board insofar as it struck portions of appellant\u2019s pleadings relating to its charges that confusion, mistake, or deception is likely to result from appellee\u2019s alleged use of a representation of appellant\u2019s copyrighted doll as its trademark or that registration of the mark may otherwise damage appellant. Because portions of appellant\u2019s pleadings relating to these three separate issues are hopelessly intermingled, we remand to allow appellant to replead in light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Modified and remanded</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-10\">. The petition of appeal states that appellant \u201chas complied with the requirements of Title 35, United States Code,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 142 and 143. Title 35 pertains to patents, and \u00a7\u00a7 142 and 143 pertain to appeals in patent cases. However, we have construed the appeal as if filed pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071(a), the provision governing appeals to this court in trademark cases.

Section 17 of the Trademark Act (15 TJ.S.C. \u00a7 1067) requires that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>\u201cBach case shall be heard by at least three members of the Board,\u201d and no doubt the reference in section 21(a) (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071(a)) to \u201cthe decision of the * * * Trademark Trial and Appeal Board\u201d is to the decision of such a panel of at least three members of the board. Thus, if it were established that only one member of the board made the decision in this case (cf. Buie 2.127(c)), our jurisdiction over this appeal would at least be questionable, since it would not be from the decision of an entity authorized by statute to make decisions in the name of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. However, in an appeal from the Tariff Commission, this court faced a similar question, which was argued by the parties, and the court indicated that it would <em>presume </em>that the proper number of commissioners had participated in the decision, despite the absence of one commissioner\u2019s signature on the commission\u2019s report, in the absence of proof to the contrary. Frischer &amp; Co. v. Bakelite Corp., 39 F.2d 247, 255-256, 17 CCPA 494, 506 (1930), cert. den. 282 U.S. 852, 51 S.Ct. 29, 75 L.Ed. 755. We follow that course here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b567-25\">. The board was apparently thinking of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(a), referred to in the motions, which states that:</p>\n<p id=\"b567-26\">The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to * * <em>* </em>copyrights * * *. Such jurisdiction shall be exclusive of the courts of the states in * * * copyright cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b567-27\">. The relevance of the validity of appellant\u2019s copyright is that, if the copyright is not valid, appellant may have no protectable interest in the appearance of its dolls. Cf. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Stiffel Co., 376 U.S. 225, 84 S.Ct. 784, 11 L.Ed.2d 661 (1964), and Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting, Inc., 376 U.S. 234, 84 S.Ct. 779, 11 L.Ed.2d 669 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b567-29\">. As a matter of interest, we note that another panel of the board (presumably; see n. 8, supra) recently denied a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>to dismiss an opposition based on the opposer\u2019s utility patent rights. Bell v. B-I-W Group Inc., 174 USPQ 254 (TTAB 1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b568-8\">. The rationale of the board\u2019s decision to do so appears in the following paragraph from the opinion accompanying its decision on appellant\u2019s motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Ordinarily, when an appeal is taken, jurisdiction in the appealed matter is transferred to the Court and the Board can proceed no further with respect to the \u201csubject matter of the appeal\u201d until the appeal has been terminated. See: Loshbough v. Allen, 359 F.2d 910, 53 CCPA 1214, (CCPA, 1966) and In re Allen, Jr., 115 F.2d 936, 28 CCPA 792, (CCPA, 1940). In the instant controversy, however, it appears that the matter sought to be stricken from the-pleadings bares no relationship to the subject matter of the appeal; and hence, the general rule is not applicable. Moreover, since under Rule 15(a) a motion to amend submitted prior to the filing of an answer must be entered \u201cas a matter of course\u201d, such an action requires only the exercise of a \u201cpurely ministerial function\u201d, as to which, the Board has no discretion. See: Loshbough v. Allen, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b569-7\">. This section might be thought to go somewhat beyond the issues which are technically before us at the present time insofar as it treats paragraphs 25 and 26 of appellant\u2019s pleadings, as amended, which were neither stricken by the board nor cancelled by appellant. However, the parties\u2019 arguments have made frequent references to these paragraphs, and we have concluded that the propriety of the striking of the other paragraphs cannot be considered in a vacuum, but must be considered against the background of the remaining paragraphs in appellant\u2019s pleadings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b570-9\">. Lever Bros. Co., the manufacturer of \u201cLifebuoy\u201d soap, successfully opposed registration of a mark used on deodorants the dominant feature of which was the word NOBIO on the basis of its <em>advertising </em>use of the slogan \u201cNo B.O.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b570-10\">. There a manufacturer of electric refrigerators who had used the word HOSTESS to designate a particular model successfully opposed its registration as a <em>trademark </em>for the same goods.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b570-11\">. Appellee argues that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-12\">If appellant\u2019s claims of infringement of its purported copyright in \u201cthe Raggedy Ann doll\u201d, as set forth in paragraphs 2 to 23, inclusive, of the notice of opposition and the petitions for cancellation, were to be permitted to serve as the basis for opposing or can-celling appellee\u2019s registration of its trademark consisting of a representation of a rag doll for laundry products, then appellant\u2019s purported copyright would in effect create in appellant trademark rights in the subject matter thereof which would extend through all sixty Patent Office classes of goods and services irrespective of the likelihood of confusion, i. e., a \u201cuniversal trademark\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-16\">We think that appellee\u2019s fears are unfounded. On remand the board will still have to determine whether or not appellant\u2019s factual allegations concerning the identity of appearance between appellant\u2019s copyrighted dolls and appellee\u2019s trademark is supported by the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>and, if so, whether appellee\u2019s use of its mark on the goods recited in its application and registrations is likely to cause confusion, mistake, or deception. While we intimate no opinion on the latter issue, it is certainly not a foregone conclusion that the board will find in appellant\u2019s favor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b572-8\">BALDWIN, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Aey\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">I am in full agreement with the foregoing opinion. With regard to the question involving our jurisdiction over this appeal, I further note that Rule 2.117(a) of the Trademark Rules of Practice adopts the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \u201cwherever considered applicable and appropriate\u201d in inter-partes cases. The case before us seems to present a classic situation for invoking F.R.Civ.P. Rule 54(b), since it involves a final, substantive decision on fewer than all of appellant\u2019s claims, and there is no apparent reason for delay. I think that a decision by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board as to whether a particular issue is ripe for appeal would be highly desirable. In view of the great progress that Rule has engendered in dealing with the problems of \u201cfinality,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> no reason is apparent why it could not be adopted in the type of case before us.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b572-18\">.
