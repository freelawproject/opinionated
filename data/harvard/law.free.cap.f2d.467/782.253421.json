Edgar, deceased, appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut granting the government summary judgment on the Bank's claim for a refund of federal estate taxes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court below concluded that a split-interest trust created by the decedent's will does not define a standard governing the trustee\u2019s power of invasion that is \u201cpresently ascertainable, and hence severable from the noncharitable interest,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> within the meaning of the applicable regulations and case law. We disagree, reverse the judgment below, and remand for further proceedings to determine the value of the charitable deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">The decedent died on February 2, 1965, in New London, Connecticut. Her will, executed on August 3, 1961, was probated in New London.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Article Fifth of her will provides that the residue of her estate is to be given to the Bank as trustee for specified purposes. After enumerating specific bequests to be made from the net yearly income of the trust, the Article directs the trustee to pay the balance of the income to one Janet Clarke and her three children, share and share alike, for the t\u00e9rms of their natural lives, with right of survivorship. In connection with these payments the trustee is empowered to invade the corpus of the trust \u201cas it feels necessary for the physical welfare of said Janet Clarke and her said children and the survivor of them.\u201d Upon the death of the survivor of the beneficiaries, the Article directs the trustee to manage the trust funds as a permanent and perpetual trust the income from which is to be paid equally to the Lawrence and Memorial Hospitals and the Second Congregational Church of New London. The gross estate of the decedent as disclosed by the inventory filed in the appropriate Probate Court was $875,002.89, and for purposes of the federal estate tax, $656,989.63. On April 29, 1966, the Bank filed a federal estate tax return showing a federal estate tax liability of $162,088.91. In this return, the Bank had deducted an amount as a charitable deduction. After an audit, the District Director of the Internal Revenue Service informed the Bank of his intention to assess a deficiency in the amount of $19,716.50 plus interest because of his belief that the charitable deduction taken by the Bank was invalid. The Bank paid the deficiency plus interest ($1,215.40) on July 12, 1967, and thereafter filed a claim for a refund. The claim was not granted, and this suit followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-13\">In deciding for the government on cross-motions for summary judgment, Judge Clarie concluded (1) that the word \u201cphysical\u201d in the instruction to the trustee on when to invade the corpus of the trust is not relevant in determining whether the charitable remainder interest is \u201cpresently <em>ascertainable,\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and (2) that the word \u201cwelfare,\u201d thus left standing alone, is not sufficiently precise to qualify the remainder bequest for the charitable deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-15\">Section 2055 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 permits a deduction in computing the value of a taxable estate for, <em>inter alia, </em>bequests made to charitable organizations. Before amendment by the Tax Reform Act of 1969,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the section provided that where the bequest was a remainder interest in trust properties, the corpus of which was subject to invasion for the benefit of noncharitable income beneficiaries, the bequest was deductible only if the amount of the bequest was \u201cpresently ascertainable, and hence severable from the noncharita-ble interest.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Determining what lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>guage created a presently ascertainable interest and what language did not proved a most difficult task. Often the amount of the deduction taken bore only a rough correlation to the amount of the bequest actually made to the charity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">The central inquiry in determining whether the language of split-interest trusts creates a presently ascertainable charitable remainder interest is whether the principal can be invaded only for purposes the determinants of which are known or known to be remote. Where invasion of the trust principal is permitted as \u201cmay be necessary to suitably maintain [the income beneficiary] in as much comfort as she now enjoys\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the charitable remainder interest is considered to be presently ascertainable because under these instructions the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAP\">principal that could be used was only so much as might be necessary to continue the comfort then enjoyed. The standard was fixed in fact and capable of being stated in definite terms of money. It was not left to the widow\u2019s discretion, .... There was no uncertainty appreciably greater than the general uncertainty that attends human affairs.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u25a0</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-14\">Safely falling within the rubric of \u201cpresently ascertainable\u201d are also split-interest trusts the corpus of which can only be invaded for the \u201ccomfort and convenience\u201d or \u201cconvenience\u201d or \u201cmaintenance\u201d or \u201csupport\u201d of the income beneficiary or to maintain him in his \u201cstation in life.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> So too where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>trust corpus can be invaded only for demands arising from emergency, sickness, or accident, the courts have concluded under the lead of <em>Ithaca </em>that the charitable remainder interest is \u201cpresently ascertainable.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> These courts would undoubtedly agree with this court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Lincoln Rochester </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-4\">it was the purpose of the testator herein merely to insure that his wife would continue to enjoy her accustomed standard of living appears evident from the clear effort demonstrated in the will to disabuse anyone of the notion that the widow\u2019s mere whims would suffice to require an invasion of principal. Patently subjective criteria such as \u201chappiness\u201d and \u201cpleasure,\u201d which would render the standard too indefinite, . . . are noticeably absent here. . . . Instead, the criterion employed is one of \u201cneed\u201d resulting from limited kinds of externally caused emergencies of such a nature as would diminish the widow\u2019s income or increase her expenses so that invasion of principal would be required to maintain her customary standard of living.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHo\">On the other hand, where the trustee is empowered to invade the trust corpus for the \u201chappiness\u201d or \u201ccontentment\u201d of the income beneficiary, then the charitable remainder interest is perceived as not presently ascertainable.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>words, it is believed, permit too much speculation and are too subjective to permit the value of the charitable remainder to be ascertained with any degree of accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">We conclude that the power of invasion granted to the trustee by the testatrix in this case is sufficiently objective under current doctrine to permit the charitable remainder interest to be presently ascertained. While the word \u201cwelfare\u201d does refer to an individual\u2019s well-being not only in terms of his health but also in terms of his happiness,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> we cannot agree with the court below that the modifying adjective \u201cphysical\u201d should be disregarded in construing the limitation on the trustee\u2019s power of invasion.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The word\u2019s natural meaning limits the trustee to invading the trust corpus only for the material, as opposed to the mental or spiritual, well-being of the income beneficiaries.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus we have no difficulty in concluding as did the courts in <em>Ithaca </em>and its progeny that the testatrix has manifested an intent by her will to insure that the income beneficiaries continue to enjoy their accustomed standard of living free from the vicissitudes of sickness, accident, or other, foreseeable but unexpected emergencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">Given that the split-interest trust created by the testatrix\u2019 will does create a presently ascertainable charitable remainder interest, it now becomes necessary to consider all extrinsic factors to determine the value of this interest.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The testatrix was obviously a person of substantial means. The income from her estate might well be sufficient to support Janet Clarke and her children for their lives, providing them with whatever their \u201cphysical welfare\u201d requires \u2014 without need for any invasion of principal. However, the question of the pattern and style of living of the Clarke family is one of fact. Only upon such facts can a reasonable determination of their prospective physical welfare be made. Obviously there is no indication that the testatrix intended this life style to change as a result of her largesse. In fact, her will directs that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>except for this particular life interest, the income from her estate, in such perpetuity as may exist, be given to the hospital and the church.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">We thus remand for further proceedings devoted to this issue.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-15\">.
