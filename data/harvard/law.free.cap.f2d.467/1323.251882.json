This concession-type arrangement did not require the Council to pay Macke; rather, the latter agreed to perform in the expectation of making a profit and promised to pay the Council approximately five percent of the total receipts from its operations at the Center. However, the venture did not prove profitable (as the parties had anticipated) and in this suit plaintiff claims recoupment of losses, price relief, or other adjustments, from June 1965 until the termination of the contract in the spring of 1967.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1386-13\">The gist of the complaint is that, when it became clear that the contractor continued to suffer unreasonable losses not of its own making, the Exchange Council failed to allow cafeteria and food prices to be raised, or to make sufficient reduction in the payments to be made by Macke to the NASA Council, so as to wipe out or alleviate these losses. For the period through June 1965, an adjustment along these lines, satisfactory to plaintiff, was made, but no similar agreement could be reached for the later time. Plaintiff then made the controversy an issue under the \u201call disputes\u201d clause of the contract, the contracting officer decided adversely, and the agency\u2019s Board of Contract Appeals upheld that determination (in the main), with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>one member dissenting. The board ruled that plaintiff should be paid for losses stemming from the Government's actual fault, but not for those unexpected losses intrinsic to the operation. 67-1 BCA 5[6156 (1967), motion for reconsideration denied, 68-1 BCA 5J7041 (1968). The case is before us, through cross-motions for summary judgment, on that decision and the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-5\">The questions are largely legal, as the parties recognized when they stipulated the issues before the Board.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The primary one is whether the contractor was entitled to be compensated for losses which turned out to be inherent in the provision of food service at the unique Kennedy Center under the special system established by the contract. In this inquiry, the greatest help comes, not from the bare text of the original contract, but from external indications of the parties\u2019 joint understanding, contemporaneously and later, of what the contract imported. The ease is an excellent specimen of the truism that how the parties act under the arrangement, before the advent of controversy, is often more revealing than the dry language of the written agreement by itself. We are, of course, entirely justified in relying on this material to discover the parties\u2019 underlying intention. <em>See, e. g., </em>Topliff v. Topliff, 122 U.S. 121, 181, 7 S.Ct. 1057, 30 L.Ed. 1110 (1887); Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. United States, 444 F.2d 547, 551, 195 Ct.Cl. 21, 30 (1971); Franklin Co. v. United States, 381 F.2d 416, 418, 180 Ct.Cl. 666, 670 (1967); Williamsburg Drapery Co. v. United States, 369 F.2d 729, 735, 177 Ct.Cl. 776, 786 (1966); Universal Match Corp. v. United States, 161 Ct.Cl. 418, 422 n. 4 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-10\">As initially framed, the contract did not deal directly with the problem of whether Macke was to bear the full risk of unreasonable losses inherent in this special undertaking at an exceptional installation. There was nothing explicit on that point in the contract form. But the terms of the agreement did make clear that food prices were not irrevocably fixed as of the time the pact was entered into, and also that there was to be a continuing relationship between prices and plaintiff\u2019s operating costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-11\">The fixing of prices, portions, and quality was to be controlled by the contracting officer, a member of the Exchange Council. Paragraph 3 says that prices charged, equipment used, and all other phases of the operation should be subject to his review and approval.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Paragraph 9e requires the contractor to submit monthly reports to the contracting officer \u201cas to costs of operation which may affect the maintaining of sales price at a satisfactory level.\u201d An<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>other provision, 8, remits approval of sales prices to the contracting officer, directing his exercise of this power by the guidelines of operating costs, on the one hand, and prevailing area prices on the other: \u201cAlthough sales prices should be reasonable in relation to prevailing prices for similar service in the surrounding area, which shall be approved by the Contracting Officer and shall in no case exceed prevailing area prices, due consideration shall be given to prospective operating costs.\u201d This provision was amplified by the contracting officer\u2019s letter transmitting the signed contract in January 1964, admitted on both sides to be an integral part of the contract, which said that \u201cParagraph 8 * * * provides for change in food prices as may be required by operational costs or other conditions\u201d and \u201cprices, portions, and variety are subject to .the approval of the Contracting Officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-4\">One permissible explication of these somewhat amorphous and open-ended provisions is that the agency would be sensitive to the contractor\u2019s need for adjustments to allow it to make a profit and avoid a loss. The pre-bid conference, attended generally by potential bidders, expressed exactly this understanding. Defendant\u2019s authorized representative told those at the meeting that \u201cYou are expected to make a profit,\u201d and promised that the contractor could negotiate with the contracting officer were no profit realized. As we have recently emphasized, such official statements can and should be taken into account in ascertaining the parties\u2019 joint understanding. <em>See </em>Manloading <em>&amp; </em>Management Associates, Inc. v. United States, 461 F.2d 1299, 198 Ct.Cl. \u2014 (1972); Sylvania Elec. Products, Inc. v. United States, 458 F.2d 994, 1008, 198 Ct.Cl. \u2014 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-9\">Apparently Macke, when it became the contractor at the beginning of 1964, expected a loss of some $55,000 for its first year, but it was anticipated that a profit would be realized overall during the life of the contract. However, disappointment soon succeeded hopeful anticipation. In the middle of July 1965, after a year-and-a-half of performance, plaintiff wrote the contracting officer complaining that its losses through June 1965 exceeded $117,000, much more than the $55,000 loss foreseen for the first year. Its request for relief included a report of operating costs and a projection of profit as of September 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-11\">After confirmation of these expenses and losses through June 1965, the parties negotiated Modification #4, which reduced the commissions the plaintiff was required to pay the Exchange Council from 5.1% downward to 2.1%, until such time as $60,000 of losses had been recouped. Modification #4 contained the following recital in explanation of the parties\u2019 supplemental agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag-l\">Whereas the parties hereto by numbered paragraphs 8 and 9c of Additional Provisions of the Contract and by Contracting Officer\u2019s letter dated January 16, 1964, contemplated and provided a relationship between operational requirements and prices to permit a profit to the Contractor and payment of commissions to the Council, and whereas the parties further understood and agreed that some losses would be incurred by the Contractor initially but that any unreasonable losses flowing from operational requirements and other conditions would be recouped under the contract, and whereas the parties have now agreed that the Contractor has suffered unreasonable losses and that the unreasonable portion of the losses should be recouped.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1388-12\">This Modification #4, in our view, clearly exposed and confirmed what the parties\u2019 actual understanding had been from the beginning \u2014 first, \u201cthat any unreasonable losses flowing from operational requirements and other conditions would be recouped under the contract,\u201d and, second, that the contract \u201ccontemplated a relationship between operational requirements and prices to permit a profit to the Contractor and payment of commissions to the Council.\u201d At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>same time, the supplemental agreement definitively determined that, through June 1965, Macke had in fact suffered such unreasonable losses, not its fault or responsibility, which were to be recognized and recouped. The compensated losses were due to factors for which the Government was directly responsible and also to expense-inducing elements inherent in the project, for which neither party bore responsibility \u2014 such things as slippage in construction through bad weather and strikes, training of an unskilled labor force, and placing of vending machines at locations with insufficient volume.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-5\">That Modification #4 reflected the format of the actual joint agreement, as originally made, is shown, conclusively we think, by elaborate written comments of the Exchange Council urging (over the opposition of others) the Director of the Space Center to approve the Modification. The Council\u2019s first paper<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> observed that \u201c[t]he parties realized that some losses would be experienced initially due to overall facility availability schedule including slippage and operational requirements not originally known and not yet subject to determination with certainty as to exact scope or detail [,]\u201d and then went on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-6\">The parties at time of contract execution and since have contemplated and understood that at a subsequent date when past, current and, to a degree, future loss potential were determined and could be effectively related to continuing operational requirements, an equitable adjustment would be made to offset the unreasonable losses incurred by Macke as a result of factors not completely within the previously existing knowledge or control of the parties. Operational service requirements, not initially determined, contemplated or foreseen by the parties have been required by the Council in the exercise of its broad right to dictate changing/expanding requirements. The effect of compliance therewith coupled with prices permitted to be charged has resulted in an operational loss to Macke in excess of $117,000 during the past two years of operations. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1389-8\">The subsequent memorandum repeated that \u201cprices are related to (and governed by) operational costs thus providing for an operation (profitable to both the Contractor and the Council) during the term of the contract.\u201d Confirming that the contractor had been requested by the contracting officer not to submit price increase requests, the document pointed out that since all the parties intended from the inception of the contract,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201ca profitable operation under the Contract within a reasonable price structure considering operating costs,\u201d continued failure to make monetary adjustment would \u201cbe considered by * * * contract authorities as a breach of contract by the Council.\u201d Losses were attributed not to plaintiff\u2019s inefficiencies but were \u201cdirectly related to Council failure to permit increased prices in relation to operating cost.\u201d \u201cThe contract here however was not in any sense of the word \u2018a fixed price con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>tract\u2019 with the risk of loss on the Contractor for arbitrary action or failure of the Council to give effect to a specific contract provision expressly providing for price change related to operating costs.\u201d \u201cThe question is should the Contractor be reimbursed for the unreasonable portion of unusual losses incurred over a period of two years through no fault of his own. The answer to this question is \u2018yes\u2019 for reasons stated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-4\">These formal statements <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the Exchange Council, the Government\u2019s contracting party, as to what occurred prior to award, together with the Council\u2019s view of the joint understanding, stand unrefuted on the record. Along with the other materials which we have mentioned \u2014 the terms of the original contract, the pre-bid conference, the recitals and contents of modification #4<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2014 they demonstrate that the contractor was not expected to bear the risk of unreasonable losses due to difficulties inherent in the food operations at the Space Center. Unlike the normal fixed-price contractor who shoulders the responsibility for unexpected losses, as well as for his failure to appreciate the problems of the undertaking, this plaintiff had the right to expect relief from the Government if things went awry without fault. The unusual circumstances at the Space Center obviously led to this special and unique arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-5\">It is immaterial whether we formulate this conclusion as an interpretation of the existing written contract or as a reformation of the written agreement to reflect the parties\u2019 actual understanding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On either basis we must accept Macke\u2019s contractual right of compensation for unreasonable losses as extending beyond those caused directly by the Government. In ruling otherwise, the majority of the Board of Contract Appeals erred as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-11\">We are told, however, that, in any ease, plaintiff cannot prevail because the only contractual method of relief from such losses was through a rise in food prices which could not exceed the level prevailing in the area \u2014 and that plaintiff has not shown under that standard that food prices could have been increased at the Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-12\">Modification #4 and its history prove that a price increase was not the sole and exclusive method of adjustment. That supplemental agreement, expressly made for recoupment of such unreasonable losses, was accomplished, not via a price rise, but through a substantial reduction in the concession payments by Macke to the Exchange Council. The Council\u2019s two written recommendations for the adoption of this Modification\u2014 to which we have already referred\u2014 make it clear that this adjustment was in lieu of a price increase (direct, or concealed through decrease in portions or services) which the agency was unwilling to permit. The first memorandum said: \u201cReduced service requirements to preclude the incurrence of or price increases to offset such losses [i. <em>e., </em>the $117,000 loss suffered by plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>tiff through June 1965] were not possible. Such actions were not acceptable to prevent subject losses and likewise are not now acceptable as a basis for equitable adjustment currently required. Consequently, the equitable adjustment negotiated and agreed upon is founded in other considerations * * The second, more extensive, memorandum repeats several times that management would not countenance a price increase, and therefore that the other method of loss-recoupment was being adopted.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This contemporaneous, specific, practical interpretation carries the day over efforts at lace-work exegesis drawing on the thin words of the original contract, separated from their implementation during performance. The parties\u2019 practice, embodied in a formal amendment to the contract, has established that one acceptable remedy for unreasonable contractor losses would be a reduction in the commissions payable to the Exchange Council. It is natural that this type of relief would be used; if the contractor suffered a loss not through its fault, the Government could be expected to waive all or part of its own profit in order to diminish or obviate the other side\u2019s loss. The contract documentation, including the original text, shows that the parties consistently viewed the profits of the two sides as on a par, so that, if Macke had a loss instead of a profit, it would then be reasonable for the Government to forego its gain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-12\">The board, especially in its opinion on reconsideration, seems to assume that the Government may have failed in its obligation to consider price increases, but nevertheless shuts plaintiff out because, it says, customer resistance would have prevented Macke from reducing its losses even if it had been permitted the 20% rise it sought for the period after June 1965. We by-pass plaintiff\u2019s insistent objection that this factual finding, related to the amount of possible recovery, was beyond the liability issues stipulated as before the board <em>(see </em>note 2, <em>supra) </em>because we are satisfied that, on the whole record, there is in any event no substantial support for the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-13\">The documentary evidence for plaintiff is strong; the Exchange Council\u2019s two memoranda, from which we have quoted, say flatly that the losses through June 1965 were caused by the Government\u2019s failure to permit price rises. Those admissions, made before the dispute arose, are persuasive that the same is true for the following period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-14\">The administrative finding to the contrary rests solely on a statement in a letter by Macke\u2019s senior vice-president <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>(dated October 25, 1965, after the negotiation of Modification #4) that \u201cit was not feasible to prevent the losses by increasing prices\u201d. In context,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> this remark was not a concession that price increases would cause losses, but instead a simple recognition that top management at the Center would not countenance a price increase \u2014 or at most an agreement that morale would probably suffer from higher prices and smaller portions, so that, at the time of Modification #4, the more tolerable route to recoupment of the $60,000 in losses was to cut commissions to the Council rather than to antagonize the employees or to reduce necessary services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-4\">This reading comports fully with Macke\u2019s continuous and vigorous effort to secure various kinds of relief, including a price adjustment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Indeed, only a day after the senior vice-president\u2019s letter, the Council issued its second memorandum, exposing both its failure to discuss the price increases Macke sought and its admission that the firm lid on prices, imposed by management, had seriously contributed to plaintiff\u2019s losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-5\">The record before the Board suggests that the oral testimony most directly in point is that of the then Chairman of the Council (Mr. Roten), who stated directly that losses resulted from low food prices. The board may not have credited Mr. Roten, but if so it had no other evidence on which it could reasonably rely. Although there was extensive testimony by Government witnesses as to complaints by the employees about the prices and the service, and thus as to the undesirability from the point of view of morale of charging more, there was no assertion that a price rise, however unpopular, would not have helped reduce losses. No evidence was introduced as to the alternatives available to disgruntled employees (e. <em>g., </em>the chance to patronize other cafeterias or restaurants, or the practice of \u201cbrown bagging\u201d). It may be that customer resistance to higher prices would have induced a grave boycott and increased Macke\u2019s losses still further, but there was absolutely no evidence to that effect. Accordingly, we find no evidence in the existing record to support the board\u2019s conclusion that a price increase would not have helped plaintiff.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1392-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-11\">We still have to grapple with the separate problem of whether an adjustment-for-losses (after June 1965) was nevertheless barred because the established food prices were already at the level of prevailing rates in the area, and therefore could not be substantially raised under the contract, no matter what plaintiff\u2019s difficulties. Defendant maintains that, for the period after June 1965, the only rise which could be allowed was 5% (which the agency offered) and not 20% (as plaintiff demanded) .</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>The first answer is that, as we have gauged the parties\u2019 agreement-in-practice, a reduction in the commissions paid to the Council was permissible even though prices could not be increased because they had already attained the maximum level. At least two methods of responding to unreasonable losses were available \u2014 raising prices (together with a rollback of services) and reducing Macke\u2019s commission payments to the Council. Even if the first alternative could not be used because of the limitation to \u201cprevailing prices for similar service in the surrounding area,\u201d the second would still be open.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-5\">In Modification #4, without lifting prices, the defendant reduced the payments from 5.1% of all food sales to 2.-1% until $60,000 was recouped. There was nothing to prevent the agency from continuing this diminution for a longer period or from reducing the commissions still further \u2014 even to the point of abolishing them altogether. The terms of the written contract nowhere tie the commissions to \u201cprevailing area prices,\u201d and there was no contractual barrier to use of this independent avenue of loss-relief. Having undertaken to protect plaintiff against unreasonable losses <em>(see </em>Parts I and II, <em>supra), </em>the defendant could have decreased its commissions even if prices were frozen because the stage of \u201cprevailing area prices\u201d had already been reached. As we have indicated, the agency did not restrict its obligation to permit loss-recoupment to the single channel of price raises. The responsibility to compensate for unreasonable losses extended beyond the price provisions of the arrangement. The Government could, as we have pointed out, forego its own profit in order to help the contractor avoid or recoup unreasonable losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-6\">A second solution to the problem of \u201cprevailing area prices\u201d is to weave that particular part of the contract into the fabric of the agreement as a whole. On its face, paragraph 8 of the original writing points in two different directions : prices are to be increased according to operating costs but prices are also to be stabilized according to prevailing area prices. Both factors must be considered in the light of the whole transaction. On that view, we see the provision as requiring, first, that to the extent that the Government called for services and operations with requirements similar to those which would be normal in other area food establishments, prices would have to be comparable; but, second, to the extent that the Government required uneconomic services or arrangements in view of the obviously unique characteristics of the work at Kennedy Space Center, there would be no \u201csimilar service\u201d to which the Government could refer as a standard for setting prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-8\">In 1964, when this contract was made, the difficulties of operating at the unique installation which is the Kennedy Space Center, as well as many of the loss-inducing services which the Government would require, could not be completely foreseen by either side for lack of any comparable experience. It would be sensible to provide that, if the Government directed the contractor to build a cafeteria, similar in all pertinent requirements to an ordinary local cafeteria, and to serve there the number of people for which the cafeteria was designed during the usual hours, prices should not exceed the area level. However, when the agency directed food services at a remote missile launch in the middle of the night to serve a small number of dignitaries or employees during space shots, or imposed other requirements which a normal food operator would not have to meet, it was ordering a service or creating conditions which, however vital to the Center, would be unprofitable or lead to a loss \u2014and very unlikely to be acceptable to the normal commercial enterprise. Since in that setting there is no similar service, the comparison to area prices is not a meaningful concept. It is true that some of these services were specified in the contract <em>(e. g. </em>V.I.P. cafeteria, Saturday cafeteria service), but nei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>ther party anticipated the extent to which the uneconomical nature of these operations would make losses inevitable, no matter how efficiently the contractor performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-4\">The parties\u2019 situation at the time the agreement was made suggests this reading of paragraph 8 to permit price increases above prevailing rates if conditions are not comparable. This was to be a unique facility without precedent, and the contingencies would be very great. It was practical for the Government to assure the contractor of adequate price levels as a quid pro quo for the latter\u2019s agreement to perform additional services, to offer large portions, to do whatever the contracting officer might direct. On the other hand, a prudent contractor would not likely undertake to perform such open-ended requirements without provision for some relief from the clamp of the \u201cprevailing area prices\u201d provision; there was no fee to compensate the contractor if loss-producing services or conditions of operation were required. <em>Cf. </em>Franklin Co. v. United States, 381 F.2d 416, 419, 180 Ct.Cl. 666, 672 (1967); Deloro Smelting &amp; Ref. Co. v. United States, 317 F.2d 382, 387, 161 Ct.Cl. 489, 497 (1963). In allowing exceptions to the maximum price provision, the Government would gain flexibility for the new and sprawling Center, where food needs and operating costs could not be accurately detailed in advance and where certain uneconomic services would be demanded for the smooth running of the complex. At the same time, the plaintiff would be given the chance to make a profit by price levels which took into account the unusual location and service requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-9\">For each of these separate reasons, we conclude that the \u201cprevailing area prices\u201d restriction does not preclude relief here even if defendant is correct that plaintiff\u2019s prices were already as high as the retail food prices in the general locality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-10\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-11\">The last question is whether plaintiff is entitled to any profit, as well as to recoupment of its unreasonable losses. From the statement at the prebid conference (see Part I <em>supra), </em>the recital in Modification #4<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the Exchange Council\u2019s two memoranda to which we have referred<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> it is plain that the parties contemplated a relationship between operating costs and prices (or whatever other relief was necessary) so as to assure plaintiff a profit \u2014 were it an efficient, careful manager (and apart from general difficulties facing all food service activities). Although a loss of approximately $55,000 was foreseen by Macke for the first year, a profit was expected to be realized within the lifespan of the contract. Plaintiff was not guaranteed a profit regardless of its own efficiency or of the normal risks incident to all food-service enterprises\u2014 but otherwise it was entitled to a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>profit on its undertaking. In particular, it was not to be disadvantaged by the location, special requirements of, or the unusual operating conditions at the Space Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-5\">There may seem an apparent inconsistency between the recital in Modification <em>#4,</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>stating that the parties contemplated a profit, and the content of the Modification, which permits only re-coupment of losses. The explanation lies, we think, in the events of mid-summer 1965. At the time of Modification #4, Macke told the Government that a break even point was anticipated as of August 1965 and that a profit was projected as of September 1965. The initial draft of Modification #4, which was accompanied by the Council\u2019s first memorandum, contained provisions providing for margin of profit ceilings of 8% (in those years in which gross sales were less than $1.5 million) and 7% (in those years in which gross sales were equal to or greater than $1.5 million). In accordance with Macke\u2019s projections, those provisions were to become effective as of September 1965. A Council memorandum for the record (dated November 26, 1965) and a letter of the contracting officer (dated December 7, 1965) explain the ultimate deletions of these 7% and 8% profit ceilings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1395-6\">You will note also that the provisions for maximum profit ceilings of 8% and 7% respectively have also been deleted. The reason for these deletions is that such could be interpreted as guarantees which as such would exceed the normal 6% profit on food service ventures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1395-7\">In other words, the parties thought at that time that it was necessary only to reduce the commissions for Macke to recoup the $60,000 of unreasonable losses suffered beyond the $55,000 of expected losses. Macke\u2019s figures showed that a profit would be realized by September 1965, well before the expiration of the contract term. The defendant considered a 6% profit customary in food service ventures and plaintiff was expected to earn that amount, beginning in September.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-11\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-12\">Our conclusion is that plaintiff is entitled to recover, for the period after June 1965, not only the losses specified by the Board of Contract Appeals <em>(i. e., </em>those for which the defendant was directly responsible) but also losses inherent in operating at the Kennedy Space Center and beyond plaintiff\u2019s control. Losses due to the contractor\u2019s ineffien-cy,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> other fault within its control, or of the kind that any food service enterprise would incur, are to be excluded. The plaintiff is also entitled to recover a reasonable profit, not in excess of 6%, taking into account the compensable losses as calculated under this standard. The amount of recovery will have to be determined administratively if the parties cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-13\">Accordingly, the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Count I of the petition is granted, and the defendant\u2019s is denied (except with respect to Count II), as indicated in this opinion. Pursuant to Rule 167, proceedings in this court are stayed for a period of six months to permit the plaintiff to seek a determination by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the amount to which plaintiff is entitled.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>Count II of the petition, stating a breach claim, is dismissed as redundant and subsumed in Count I (defendant\u2019s cross-motion is granted to that extent) .<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1396-4\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-5\">\n<em>Contract Provisions Involved</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-6\"><em>A. </em>Paragraph 3(a) of Additional Provisions of the contract provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1396-7\">Subject to the detailed provisions stated hereinafter, menus, recipes, the quality of food and service, prices charged, the type, quantity, and condition of equipment, and all other phases of operation shall be subject to the review and approval of the Contracting Officer at all times.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1396-8\">B.

This admonition was given to the Council on a continuing basis and the Contractor was requested by the Contracting Officer not to submit price increase requests and to delay submitting any request for equitable adjustment on any other basis until requested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-8\">\u201c * * * The price increases contemplated for have not been effected due to Management\u2019s position/reasons stated above. * * * The Council has been admonished by Management to accomplish an equitable adjustment on a basis other than price increase or reduction in support requirements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-16\">\u201c * * * price increases or reduction of service requirements were not acceptable to prevent the losses and not acceptable to prevent their occurrence in the future and that equitable adjustment would have to be based on other grounds.

We agreed with the Council that it was not feasible to prevent the losses by increasing prices, decreasing portion sizes or reducing services. We then entered into an agreement with the Council to put a ceiling on our profits in return for the Council\u2019s agreement to reimburse us for the unreasonable losses which we suffered in operating the food and vending service amounting to $60,000.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1392-8\">.

The board also seems to have placed upon plaintiff the burden of showing affirmatively that a price increase would have benefited it. We think this was erroneous, particularly in view of the Exchange Council\u2019s express admissions, but in any case it is clear that plaintiff sufficiently bore whatever burden could be imposed on it at the stage of determining liability (a stage which did not involve calculation of the amount of recovery) .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1394-5\">. \u201c * * * Whereas the parties hereto by numbered paragraphs 8 and 9(e) of Additional Provisions of the Contract and hy Contracting Officer\u2019s letter dated January 16, 1964, contemplated and provided a relationship between operational requirements and prices to permit a profit to tiie Contractor and payment of commissions to the Council [.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1394-7\">. \u201cThe Request for Proposal and the resulting contract for Food Services entered into on 15 January 1964, with Macke provided a relationship between Service requirements, including related operational costs and food prices, and contemplated a profit to the Contractor along with commissions to the Council.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-12\">\u201cMoreover, for the record the contract specifically provides for Council control of prices through its Contracting Officer and that prices are related to (and governed by) operational costs thus providing for an operation (profitable to both the Contractor and the Council) during the term of the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-13\">The second memorandum also states: \u201cThe Contracting Officer, the Exchange Council and Management intended and the Contractor contemplated a profitable operation under the Contract within a reasonable price structure considering operating costs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1395-8\">.
