Appellant was specifically informed by the court that he could be sentenced \u201cfor a period of five years in prison, a $10,000 fine or both.\u201d He indicated that he understood</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-17\">The record also indicates that the trial judge asked appellant whether he had read the Count II charges, to which he replied affirmatively. Furthermore, the trial judge made an extensive inquiry as to appellant\u2019s understanding of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-18\">Appellant\u2019s strongest support for his insistence that he was promised leniency is presented in affidavits submitted by his wife and son, taken one year after sentencing, alleging that an agreement was in fact entered into. But communications occurring between the Assistant U.S. Attorney, appellant\u2019s counsel and appellant, all occurring shortly after sentencing, fail to mention or suggest any promise of leniency, other than that appellant was to receive \u201can official government letter indicating [his] cooperation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-19\">The allegations cannot be described as other than \u201cvague\u201d and \u201cconclusionary.\u201d Reed v. United States, 441 F.2d 569, 572 (9th Cir. 1971); Meeks v. United States, 427 F.2d 881, 883 (9th Cir. 1970). They were properly refuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
