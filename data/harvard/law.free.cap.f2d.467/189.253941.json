Appellant does not deny that he wrote and mailed the letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-13\">We conclude that the instructions were erroneous and that the court failed to comply with Rule 30. Accordingly, we reverse the conviction and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-14\">Appellant is a man of below average intelligence, and an avowed homosexual. It is undisputed that he has a history of mental disorders and that he was under emotional stress and was deeply disturbed at the time he wrote these letters. He also has a history of repeated criminal activity. He was previously convicted in North Carolina of writing a threatening letter to the President, and as a result of that conviction, he was transferred from a state prison to a federal prison. At the time he wrote the letters for which he was indicted here, he was confined by the United States Army in the stockade at Fort Knox, Kentucky, for having been absent without leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-15\">During his incarceration at Fort Knox, he was confined, for a period, to a psychiatric ward in Ireland Army Hospital because he had intentionally cut his own wrists three times in the stockade. He characterizes these incidents as suicide attempts, but appellee contends that the cuts were superficial and were intended only to procure his release from the stockade.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-16\">The letters were written during June 1971. The first letter, dated June 18, 1971, was addressed to the Vice President and stated that Huffman would kill him if the Vice President did not have Huffman released from the Army within 14 days and did not provide him with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>$100,000 in 20 and 50 dollar bills.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The second letter, dated June 21, 1971, was addressed to the President. It informed him that Huffman had made plans to kill the Vice President and that he had decided to kill the President two days before killing the Vice President.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The third letter, dated June 27, 1971, was addressed to the President and stated that Huffman had \u201cmade up his mind\u201d to kill the President pursuant to a plan whereby Huffman would become the owner of \u201cat least one-half of the United States.\u201d The letter also threatened the lives of the President\u2019s daughter, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Interior, J. Edgar Hoover (the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation), and the Vice President. It further stated that Huffman intended to undergo a sex change and to become the first woman President of the United States.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-26\">At trial, Huffman\u2019s only defense was that he was suffering from a mental disturbance at the time he wrote the letters, and that it was so serious that he did not know what he was doing and could not conform his conduct to the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>quirements of the law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In support of this defense, he submitted the testimony of a psychologist, Dr. Curtis L. Barrett, Jr., who had administered several tests of different types to Huffman and had interviewed him twice, on one occasion for about four hours. In rebuttal, the Government submitted the testimony of a psychiatrist, Dr. John D. Trawiek, Jr., who had interviewed Huffman at the Jefferson County Jail on August 25, 1971, for a period of \u201csomewhat over an hour.\u201d The principal purpose of Dr. Trawick\u2019s interview with Huffman was to determine competency to stand trial, but Dr. Trawiek testified that he was also able to form some conclusions about Huffman\u2019s mental state two months earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Both parties submitted written requests for jury instructions on insanity as a defense. In his written request, the Assistant United States Attorney asserted that he followed our decision in United States v. Smith, 404 F.2d 720 (6th Cir. 1968). In that case we expressed approval of the standards of the American Law Institute stated in its Model Penal Code \u00a7 4.01 (Official Draft, 1962)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-5\">We now elect generally to adhere to the test of criminal responsibility [stated in] the Model Penal Code. We believe it to be a test which a jury will readily comprehend; one which comports with and makes available modern scientific knowledge and one which may serve to aid the continuing development of the federal law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-13\">The questions for jury consideration pertaining to criminal responsibility when defendant offers an insanity defense are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-14\">1. Was he suffering from a mental illness at the time of the commission of the crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-15\">2. Was that illness such as to prevent his knowing the wrongfulness of his act ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-16\">3. Was the mental illness such as to render him substantially incapable of conforming his conduct to the requirements of the law he is charged with violating ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-17\">A negative finding as to the first question or negative findings as to both the second and third questions would require rejection of the insanity defense. An affirmative finding as to the first question, plus an affirmative finding as to either the second or the third question, would require a jury verdict of \u201cnot guilty\u201d because of defendant\u2019s lack of criminal responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-18\">If in the judgment of the court the lay and psychiatric testimony provides no issue in relation to the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>question, there is no need to submit it to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-5\">We emphasize that by approving the ALI standard and by setting forth the questions above we are not seeking to require judicial instructions in these specific words.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">But we specifically stated in a footnote that we did not adopt an additional definition endorsed by the ALI:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">We do not, however, adopt the following additional definition endorsed by the ALI: \u201cAs <em>used in this Article, the terms \u2018mental disease or defect\u2019 do not include any abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise anti-social conduct.\u201d </em>Model Penal Code \u00a7 4.01(2) (Official Draft, 1962). The purpose of this definitional sentence was obviously to exclude from the definition of insanity \u201cpsychopathic personalities\u201d who demonstrate mental abnormality principally by habitual violation of the law. The ALI commentators argue that to date mental health facilities in this nation offer little hope for curative treatment of these persons, and that mental health facilities are already overburdened by patients as to whom the prospects for successful treatment are considerably brighter. There is, however, great dispute over the psychiatric soundness of section 4.01(2). See Overholser, Criminal Responsibility: A Psychiatrist\u2019s Viewpoint, 48 A.B.A. J. 527, 530 (1962); Diamond, From M\u2019Naghten to Currens, and Beyond, 50 Calif.L.Rev. 189, 193-194 (1962).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWq\"><em>Smith, supra, </em>404 F.2d at 727 n.8 (emphasis added). <em>Cf., </em>United States v. Brawner, 471 F.2d 969 at 992-994 (D.C.Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Nevertheless, the Assistant United States Attorney\u2019s request included this rejected definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-9\">As used in these instructions, the terms \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d do not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">And the court erroneously delivered this instruction to the jury. This was plain error which requires reversal of the conviction and remand for a new trial despite appellant\u2019s failure to state distinctly his objection to it. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). <em>See </em>Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 107, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 89 L.Ed. 1495 (1945); United States v. Krosky, 418 F.2d 65, 66 (6th Cir. 1969). This is so because the instruction foreclosed the jury from considering whether Huffman\u2019s homosexuality and anti-social behavior were manifestations of a mental disease or defect which might have prevented him from knowing the wrongfulness of his act or have rendered him substantially incapable of conforming his conduct to the requirements of the law. It is clear that this was a theory of the defense, because defense counsel\u2019s closing argument to the jury included the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-11\">Now, you heard Doctor Barrett\u2019s testimony. . . . And his opinion was, as you heard, that this man, because of the circumstances he was in at the time the letters were written, did not have the mental capacity necessary to form this intent which the Government must prove.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-13\">Doctor Trawick admitted that the acts that you\u2019ve heard here during the day were the acts of a deeply disturbed person. And, believe me, I think that common sense will dictate to all of us that you don\u2019t have to be either a psychologist or a psychiatrist to figure out that a man who does the things that this man has done is in any respects a normal individual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-14\">We observe that compliance with Rule 30 might have made reversal unnecessary because it would have afforded the trial court the opportunity of correcting this error in its charge before the jury began its deliberations. The rule provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-15\">No party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>therefrom unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection. Opportunity shall be given to make the objection out of the hearing of the jury and, on request of any party, out of the presence of the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">In this case, the following proceedings occurred after the court delivered its instructions :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">BY THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">Now, any \u2014 any request for any further instructions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">All of the jury must agree \u2014 any objections or exceptions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">MR. WARNER [defense counsel] : May I approach the bench? I\u2019ve got one or two points. Are we going to argue that now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-9\">BY THE COURT: We can go ahead and take them up while they\u2019re out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH_\">MR. WARNER: All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">The court then gave the jury forms on which to return its verdicts, and proceeded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-12\">BY THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-13\">You may take them to their room, Mr. Marshal. And you may adjourn court till the jury returns.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-14\">(WHEREUPON, AT ABOUT THE HOUR OF 4:30 P.M. THE JURY RETIRED TO BEGIN ITS DELIBERATIONS AND THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS OCCURRED IN CHAMBERS).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-15\">MR. WARNER: Judge, I\u2019ve got one \u2014two specific objections to the instructions as given.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-16\">The other objection I have, sir, is again based on our discussion in chambers previously that I don\u2019t feel that the instructions which were given relative to the mental issue adequately covered the related issue of diminished capacity. I think there is too much in there about sanity and insanity, and I feel that we were entitled, or we are entitled, to have the jury instructed specifically on that issue as tendered in my instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-18\">MR. TOWNES: I disagree. As I said earlier, I think that it was redundant. I feel that the instructions set out the issues that were presented to the jury, and I feel they were in accordance with the procedure set out by the Sixth Circuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-19\">BY THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-20\">MR. WARNER: That\u2019s all I have, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-21\">BY THE COURT: Okay. Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-22\">(WHEREUPON, AT ABOUT THE HOUR OF 4:50 P.M. THE JURY RETURNED TO THE COURTROOM AND THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS OCCURRED IN OPEN COURT).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-23\">[The jury returned its verdicts of guilty.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-24\">This procedure frustrated the purpose of the rule to provide an opportunity for the court to make corrections before the jury begins deliberations. <em>See </em>2 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 484, at 284 n.35 &amp; n.36; 8 J. Moore, Federal Practice P0.04, and cases cited therein. Since the jury had already begun to deliberate, counsel may have considered the opportunity to make objections meaningless because the court would have been understandably reluctant to recall the jury to amend or correct its instructions. It is also possible that any correction would have come too late \u2014 after the jury had reached a conclusion about the issue affected by the erroneous instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-25\"> The judgment of conviction is vacated, and the case is remanded for retrial in accordance with this opinion. Upon retrial, after the jury has been instructed, and before it begins deliberating, counsel must be permitted to object on the record, to the instructions, &lt;xs <em>given, </em>out of the hearing of the jury. Upon request, counsel must be permitted to make objection out of the presence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>the jury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> One preferred procedure for a District Court to follow after completing its instructions is to excuse the jury with the admonition not to begin its deliberations until it is instructed to do so. Then, in the absence of the jury, counsel may be asked to state any objections and to make any requests for corrections or additional instructions. With the jury absent, counsel may argue for suggested changes without risking alienation of the jury. When the judge has decided the matter, he may direct the jury to begin its deliberations either with or without supplemental instructions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AZd\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-10\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 871(a) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">Whoever knowingly and willfully deposits for conveyance in the mail or for a delivery from any post office or by any letter carrier any letter, paper, writing, print, missive, or document containing any threat to take the life of or to inflict bodily harm upon the President of the United States, the President-elect, the Vice President or other officer next in the order of succession to the office of President of the United States, or the Vice President-elect, or knowingly and willfully otherwise makes any such threat against the President, President-elect, Vice President or other officer next in the order of succession to the office of President, or Vice President-elect, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b253-5\">.

Edgar Hoover, and making demands for the payment of large sums of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Huffman's only defense was insanity, and the proof on this issue was sharply in dispute. A psychologist testified for Huffman, and a psychiatrist testified for the Government. Huffman was an admitted homosexual and had a criminal record, but this does not constitute proof of insanity. The District Court properly submitted to the jury the issue of insanity. The jury was not impressed with Huffman\u2019s insanity defense, and found him guilty on all three counts of the indictment. The Court does not question that the verdict is supported by substantial evidence. Huffman had been convicted previously and had served a prison sentence for threatening the life of the President of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">This Court nevertheless is reversing the judgment of conviction and is granting a new trial on two grounds, each of which, as I will point out, is purely technical and has no substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">First, the majority opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-14\">\u201c . . .

United States, 210 F.2d 49 (6th Cir. 1954), cert. denied, 347 U.S. 978, 74 S.Ct. 790, 98 L.Ed. 1116 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-14\">Counsel did make known to the Court his acquiescence in and agreement with the action which the Court was taking by replying, \u201cAll right.\u201d He never made an objection thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-15\">The second alleged error is that the Court in giving an otherwise perfect instruction on insanity under the ALI rule adopted by a panel of this Court in United States v. Smith, 404 F.2d 720 (6th Cir. 1968), instructed the jury further as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-17\">\u201cAs used in these instructions, the terms \u2018mental disease or defect\u2019 do not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise anti-social conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-18\">This instruction correctly embodied Section 4.01(2) of the Official Draft of the ALI Model Penal Code, (1962). However, in <em>Smith, </em>after adopting the Code, the panel in footnote 8 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-19\">\u201c<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We do not, however, adopt the following additional definition endorsed by the ALI: \u2018As used in this Article, the terms \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d do not include any abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise anti-social conduct.\u2019 Model Penal Code \u00a7 4.01(2) (Official Draft, 1962). The purpose of this definitional sentence was obviously to exclude from the definition of insanity \u2018psychopathic personalities\u2019 who demonstrate mental abnormality principally by habitual violation of the law. The ALI commentators argue that to date mental health facilities in this nation offer little hope for curative treatment of these persons, and that mental health facilities are already overburdened by patients as to whom the prospects for successful treatment are considerably brighter. There is, however, great dispute over the psychiatric soundness of section 4.01(2). See Overholser, Criminal Responsibility: A Psychiatrist\u2019s Viewpoint, 48 A.B.A.J. 527, 530 (1962), Diamond, From M\u2019Naghten to Currens, and Beyond, 50 Calif.L.Rev. 189, 193-94 (1962).\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 727).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-21\">The defendant did not call to the attention of the District Court at any time the fact that footnote 8 of <em>Smith </em>did not adopt Section 4.01(2) of the ALI Model <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Penal Code, and the Court was given no opportunity to correct the instruction which he had given to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Rule 30 is clear that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">\u201cNo party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Defendant made no such objection, either before or after the jury returned to conduct its deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">While the jury was still deliberating, the following did take place, as quoted in the Court\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-9\">\u201cMr. Warner: Judge, I\u2019ve got one \u2014two specific objections to the instructions as given.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-10\">The other objection I have, sir, is again based on our discussion in chambers previously that I don\u2019t feel that the instructions which were given relative to the mental issue adequately covered the related issue of diminished capacity. I think there is too much in there about sanity and insanity, and I feel that we were entitled, or we are entitled, to have the jury instructed specifically on that issue as tendered in my instructions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-17\">It is clear that these objections did not call to the Court\u2019s attention anything concerning the instruction on Section 4.01(2) of the ALI Model Penal Code. Defendant was complaining only that the Court did not give his special requests, and he was asking the Court to give them. The Court previously had refused to give such requests in the language employed by defendant, although part of them were given in the general charge. These requests are contained in footnote <em>2.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>In his brief, counsel for appellant 'states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Are\">\u201cFinally, while the Court discussed both sets of tendered instructions with counsel during a recess in the trial before the jury was instructed, and indicated that the defendant\u2019s instructions, as tendered, were to be rejected, counsel for defendant was given no opportunity to state or argue his objections to the instructions as <em>actually given by the Court, </em>before the jury began its deliberations, as required by Rule 30, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure [T. of E., pp. 208-210].\u201d (Brief, p. 17).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">It is clear from this statement that counsel was fully advised by the Court that his requests for instructions were rejected, but he is now complaining that he was given no opportunity to again argue th\u00e9m before the jury began its deliberations. As I have previously pointed out, he consented to argue the matter after submission. None of the requests dealt with Section 4.01(2) of the Model Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">In his brief, in stating the issues presented for review as required by Rule 28(a)(2) Federal R.App.P., appellant stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">\u201cI. Did the trial court err in failing and refusing to give an instruction with respect to specific intent as requested by the defendant-appellant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-14\">\u201cII. Did the trial court err in failing and refusing to give an instruction with respect to diminished capacity or irresistible impulse as requested by the defendant-appellant ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-15\">\u201cIII. Was the evidence presented to the jury sufficient, as a matter of law, to permit the jury reasonably to have found the defendant-appellant criminally responsible ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-16\">It is submitted that none of these issues relate to Section 4.01(2) of the Model Code and the defendant made no such claim in his brief as ground for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-17\">A brief comment on footnote 8 in <em>Smith. </em>The footnote states: \u201cThere is, however, a great dispute over the psychiatric soundness of section 4.01(2).\u201d In support of this statement two articles by psychiatrists are cited. No legal authority is cited holding that this ALI section is not a sound statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-18\">I hope the day has not yet arrived when any abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct will be considered as a mental disease or defect, proof of which will be a defense to a criminal charge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>If such were ever permitted, a rapist, a burglar, robber, thief, molester of children, and a murderer would have a complete defense merely by proving that he committed such antisocial acts in the past to establish his insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Footnote 8 in <em>Smith </em>does not hold that it is prejudicial error for a Court to charge on Section 4.01(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">In my opinion, it was proper and was not plain error to charge on Section 4.-01(2). The rule which permits but does not require the Court to notice plain errors not brought to the attention of the District Court, was not intended to destroy Rule 30. United States v. Graydon, 429 F.2d 120 (4th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">I would affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-17\">. Rule 30, Fed.R.Crim.P. provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-18\">\u201cAt the close of the evidence or at such earlier time during the trial as the court reasonably directs, any party may file written requests that the court instruct the jury on the law as set forth in the requests. At the same time copies of such requests shall be furnished to adverse parties. The court shall inform counsel of its proposed action upon the requests prior to their arguments to the jury, but the court shall instruct the jury after tire arguments are completed. No party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless lie objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection. Oppor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>timity shall be given to make the objection out of the hearing of the jury and, on request of any party, out of the presence of the jury.\u201d As amended Feb. 28, 1966, eff. July 1, 1966.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b259-11\">. Comes now the Defendant, Marvin Ray Huffman, by his counsel, and, pursuant to Rule 30, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, requests tlie Court to instruct the jury on the law in this ease as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">1. \u201cTo constitute the crime charged in the indictment, there must be a joint operation of two essential elements, an act forbidden by law and an intent to do the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-13\">\u201cBefore Defendant may be found guilty of a crime the prosecution must establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that under the Statute described in these instructions, Defendant was forbidden to do the act charged in the indictment, and that he intentionally committed the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-14\">\u201cThe crime charged in this case is a serious ci'ime which requires proof of specific intent before the Defendant can be convicted. Specific intent, as the term implies, means more than the general intent to commit the act. To establish specific intent, the Government must prove that Defendant knowingly did an act which the law forbids, purposefully intending to violate the law. Such intent may be determined from all the facts and circumstances surrounding the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-15\">\u201cAn act or a failure to act is \u2018knowingly\u2019 done, if done voluntarily and intentionally, and not because of some other reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-18\">\u201cIf the evidence in the case should leave you with a reasonable doubt, whether at the time and idace of the alleged offense, the accused acted, or failed to act, was forced, in effect, to commit the crime charged in the indictment by coercion or compulsion, then you should acquit the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-19\">2. \u201cUnder the Defendant\u2019s plea of \u2018not guilty\u2019 there is an issue as to his sanity at the time of the alleged offense. The law does not hold a person criminally accountable for his conduct while insane, since an insane person is not capable of forming the intent essential to the commission of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-20\">\u201cThe sanity of the Defendant at the time of the commission of the alleged offenses, is an element of the crime charged and must be established by the Government beyond reasonable doubt, just as it must establish every other element of the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-21\">\u201cA Defendant is insane within the meaning of these instructions, if, at the time of the alleged criminal conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the lawfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-22\">\u201cNotwithstanding the fact that one accused of committing a crime may have been able to comprehend the nature and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>consequenees of his act, and to know that it was wrong, nevertheless, if he was forced to its execution by an impulse which he was powerless to control, in consequence of a mental disease or defect, he will be acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">\u201cA person accused of a crime is not responsible unless he had sufficient will power to control his impulse to commit the act charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">\u201cFor the purpose of throwing light upon the mental condition of the accused at the time of the alleged offense, the Jury may consider evidence of his mental state both before and after the time. The material issue, however, is whether the Defendant was sane or insane at the time of the alleged criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">\u201cTemporary insanity, as well as insanity of longer duration, is recognized by the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">\u201cIf the evidence in the case leaves you with a reasonable doubt as to whether the Defendant was sane at the time of alleged offense, you will find him not guilty, even though it may appear that he was sane at earlier and later times.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-20\">3. \u201cWhere a Defendant has raised the issue of his insanity, and the jury finds from the evidence in the case beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was not insane at the time of the alleged offense, it is still the duty of the jury to consider all the evidence in the case which may aid determination of state of mind, including all evidence offered on the issue as to insanity, in order to determine whether the Defendant acted or failed to act with specific intent, as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-21\">\u201cIf the evidence in the case leaves the jury with a reasonable doubt whether the mind of the accused was capable of forming, or did form, specific intent to commit the crime charged, the jury should acquit the accused.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
