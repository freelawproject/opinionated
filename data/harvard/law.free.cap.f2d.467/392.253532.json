We affirmed the Board\u2019s factual determinations and its conclusion that the floor covering installers in question are \u201cindependent contractors,\u201d but remanded the case to the Labor Board \u201cfor a re-examination of the question of Sears\u2019 neutrality\u201d for section 8(b)(4)(B) purposes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In our written opinion, we suggested the possibility that \u201cthe relationship between Sears and the installers might so resemble that of employer and employee that a labor dispute with the installers could justifiably include Sears.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-16\">Upon remand, in accordance with this court\u2019s instructions, and following the submission of briefs from all interested parties and the holding of oral argument, the Labor Board reconsidered its prior decision, and in April of 1971, it issued a Supplemental Decision in which it reaffirmed its original determination and order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter, the Union petitioned this court for review of the Board\u2019s Supplemental Decision and Order, and the Labor Board cross-applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>for enforcement thereof.

CONGRESSIONAL PURPOSE IN PROHIBITING SECONDARY BOYCOTTS</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The prohibition against secondary boycotts, set forth in section 8(b)(4)(B) of the N.L.R.A., was originally enacted in 1947 as one of the Taft-Hartley amendments to the National Labor Relations Act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and \u201cmust be construed in light of [its underlying] congressional purpose, which [was] \u2018to confine labor conflicts to the employer in whose labor relations the conflict had arisen, and to wall off the pressures generated by that conflict from unallied employers.\u2019 Miami Newspaper Pressmen\u2019s Local No. 46 v. NLRB, 116 U.S.App.D.C. 192, 197, 822 F.2d 405, 410 (1963).\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 8(b)(4)(B) evidences \u201cthe dual congressional objectives of preserving the right of labor organizations to bring pressure to bear on offending employers in primary labor disputes and of shielding unoffending employers and others from pressures in controversies not their own.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This goal was made quite explicit in the legislative history which surrounded the enactment of this section in 1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-15\">B. LEGISLATIVE HISTORY.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-16\">In 1947, Congress was very desirous of protecting secondary employers from labor disputes with which they were not directly concerned.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This was due in large part to the fact that \u201c[m]ore often than not the [secondary] employers are powerless to comply with demands giving rise to the [secondary] activities, and many times they and their employees as well are the helpless victims of quarrels that do not concern them at all.\u201d H.Rep.No.245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 23 (1947), in I Legislative History at 314. Although such secondary parties had previously been protected under the common law conspiracy doctrines, Congress believed that recent court decisions had eroded much of this protection and it wished to reestablish the traditional principles. To accomplish this desired result, Congress enacted a broad provision which prohibited <em>all </em>secondary boycott activity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-17\">Courts are beginning to turn from the practice of considering secondary boycotts in terms of common law conspiracy doctrine, and are determining the legality of particular factual situations on the basis of tort doctrine. On this basis there is a growing acceptance of certain forms of action directed against parties who are not immediately involved in a labor dispute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>when (1) such parties are found to possess \u201cunity of interest\u201d with the disputing employer, and (2) such action is found to be necessary in order to promote the legitimate interests of the labor union.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-4\"><em>This bill </em>[will] <em>reverse that trend. </em>* * * <em>This bill ignores * * * distinctions between justified and unjustified boycotts based on the objectives of the union in carrying on such a boycott and the relationship of the boycotted employer to the disputing employer. It indiscriminately bans all such boycotts </em>* * *<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Under the secondary boycott provision enacted by Congress, the Senate Report stated that \u201cit would not be lawful for a union to engage in a strike against employer A for the purpose of forcing that employer to cease doing business with employer B; nor would it be lawful for a union to boycott employer A because employer A uses or otherwise deals in the goods of or does business with employer B (with whom the union has a dispute).\u201d S.Rep.No.105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 22 (1947), in I Legislative History at 428. <em>See </em>H.Conf.Rep.No.510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 43 (1947), in I Legislative History at 547, 1947 U.S.Code Cong.Serv., p. 1135.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus employer A, as a \u201csecondary\u201d employer, would be entitled to the protection of the N.L.R. A.\u2019s secondary boycott provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">With the above-mentioned congressional objectives and legislative history in mind, it becomes necessary to determine whether Sears is a true \u201csecondary\u201d employer which has the right to the Act\u2019s protection from secondary boycotts under section 8(b)(4)(B), or a \u201cprimary\u201d employer which does not.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">C. INDEPENDENCE AS EVIDENCE OF \u201cSECONDARY\u201d STATUS.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">A secondary boycott involves union pressure directed at a \u201csecondary\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>party, where <em>an </em>objective<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is to induce or coerce it to cease doing business with the \u201cprimary\u201d employer <em>or </em>person,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> with whom the union is engaged in a labor dispute. <em>See </em>National Woodwork Manufacturers Association v. N. L. R. B., 386 U.S. 612, 622 &amp; n.8, 87 S.Ct. 1250, 18 L.Ed.2d 357 (1967). Although this definition of secondary boycott appears on the surface to be quite straight-forward, it is deceptive. As important as the distinction between legitimate \u201cprimary\u201d activity and proscribed \u201csecondary\u201d activity is, \u201cit does not present a glaringly bright line.\u201d Local 761, International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers v. N. L. R. B., 366 U.S. 667, 673, 81 S.Ct. 1285, 1289, 6 L.Ed.2d 592 (1961). While \u201cthere are many situations in which the answer to a dispute under [section 8(b)(4)(B)] is easily derived by the application of such legalistic formulae as \u2018independent contractors\u2019, \u2018co-employers\u2019, or \u2018allies\u2019 * * * it is * * * clear that there is a zone of dispute in which such formulae are useless, and the answer must be derived by applying the intent of the statute to the facts in the case.\u201d Local No. 24, International Brotherhood of Teamsters etc. v. N. L. R. B., 105 U.S.App.D.C. 271, 276, 266 F.2d 675, 680 (1959). <em>See </em>Building Service Employees International Union, Local 32-J v. N. L. R. B., 114 U.S.App.D.C. 199, 202, 313 F.2d 880, 883 (1963). Where, as in the instant case, the economic interrelationship between the parties is of such complexity that the exclusive reliance upon glib formulae or pat phrases would be improper, it is apparent that the Labor Board may not base a determination of \u201csecondary\u201d employer status <em>wholly </em>upon the finding of an independent contractor relationship. <em>See </em>Local No. 24, International Brotherhood of Teamsters etc. v. N. L. R. B., <em>supra, </em>105 U.S.App.D.C. at 276, 266 F.2d at 680; Building Service Employees International Union, Local 32-J v. N. L. R. B., <em>supra, </em>114 U.S.App.D.C. at 202, 313 F.2d at 883; Local 282, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, 155 NLRB 973, 989 (1965).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, this does <em>not </em>mean that such an independent contractor determination may not be of significance with respect to the resolution of the section 8(b)(4)(B) question.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">The finding of an independent contractor relationship, while not always conclusive, is nevertheless of great importance in determining the issue of \u201csecondary\u201d/\u201cprimary\u201d status under section 8(b)(4)(B), if for no other reason than the fact that the factors on which the independent contractor finding rests demonstrate that one party does not exercise control over the other in significant respects.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It therefore follows that such a determination may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>well indicate that one party does not exert such influence over the employment policies of the other, that a union\u2019s labor dispute with one of the independently contracting parties should be permitted to legally involve the other party, through means prohibited by section 8(b)(4)(B). Support for this conclusion that an independent contractor relationship is not to be generally regarded as analogous to a \u201cprimary\u201d \u201cemployer\u201d\u201cemployee\u201d relationship finds strong support in the 1947 congressional action.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">In N. L. R. B. v. Hearst Publications, Inc., 322 U.S. 111, 64 S.Ct. 851, 88 L.Ed. 1170 (1944), decided three years before the Taft-Hartley amendments, the Supreme Court agreed with the Labor Board\u2019s extremely expansive interpretation of the statutory definition of the term \u201cemployee,\u201d as it affirmed the Board\u2019s decision that independent newsboys were \u201cemployees\u201d who were entitled to N.L.R.A. coverage. The Court approved of the Board\u2019s rejection of the application of the traditional common law standards and its adoption of a novel economic and policy considerations approach. <em>See </em>322 U.S. at 128-129, 64 S.Ct. 851. However, in 1947, Congress amended the Act so as to expressly overrule the principles upon which the <em>Hearst </em>decision was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">This result was accomplished by the Taft-Hartley amendments to the National Labor Relations Act which amended the statutory definition of \u201cemployee\u201d to expressly exclude \u201cany individual having the status of an independent contractor.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This alteration in the law was intended to make it clear that Congress only contemplated the ordinary meaning of the term \u201cemployee\u201d in the Act, and the legislative history unambiguously indicates that this change was intended to overrule the broad meaning that the <em>Hearst Publications </em>economic and policy considerations analysis gave to the term \u201cemployee.\u201d <em>See </em>H.Rep.No.245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 18 (1947), in I Legislative History at 309; H.Conf.Rep.No.510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 32-33 (1947), in I Legislative History at 536-537; II Legislative History at 1537 (comments of Senator Taft). <em>See also </em>Boire v. Greyhound Corp., 376 U.S. 473, 481 &amp; n.10, 84 S.Ct. 894, 11 L.Ed.2d 849 (1964); N. L. R. B. v. United Insurance Co., 390 U.S. 254, 256, 88 S.Ct. 988, 19 L.Ed.2d 1083 (1968).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">The congressional rejection of the decision in <em>Hearst </em>has significant implication with respect to secondary boycott cases. It demonstrates a clear intention on the part of Congress to require the utilization of traditional concepts and common sense when applying and interpreting the relevant statutory provisions. It further indicates that the mere fact that the relationship between two parties involves some economic interdependence is not sufficient in and of itself to cause one of the parties to lose its \u201csecondary\u201d status, for section 8(b) (4)(B) purposes, <em>vis-a-vis </em>the other party. This conclusion is dictated by the very nature of secondary boycotts. It is intuitively obvious that a union which is engaged in a labor dispute with one party will not endeavor to enlist the support of another party, <em>unless </em>there is some relationship present, direct or indirect, between the two parties. This most frequently involves an economic relationship. Without the presence of <em>some </em>interrelationship between the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>parties, it would be an exercise in futility for the union to seek the aid of the second party, since it would necessarily have no possible means of providing meaningful support for the union. It is therefore logically apparent that something more than mere economic interdependence between two parties is required before one loses its \u201csecondary\u201d status with respect to the labor disputes of the other.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">This reasoning has been well recognized by both Labor Board and court decision. For example, it has been held that corporate entities of the same parent corporation are separate persons, each entitled to the secondary boycott protection of the N.L.R.A. concerning the labor disputes of the other, in the absence of some common control or special entanglement which justifies widening a dispute beyond its initial limits to involve the other corporate entity. <em>See </em>American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, Washington-Baltimore Local v. N. L. R. B., 149 U.S.App.D.C. 272, 462 F.2d 887 (Decided April 17, 1972); Los Angeles Newspaper Guild, Local 69, 185 NLRB No. 25, 1970 CCH NLRB \u00b6 22,255 (1970), aff\u2019d., 443 F.2d 1173 (9th Cir. 1971); N. L. R. B. v. General Teamster, Warehouse and Dairy Employees, Local No. 126, 435 F.2d 288 (7th Cir. 1970). Yet it is readily apparent that such related corporate entities are at least somewhat economically interrelated.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Although the mere finding of an independent contractor relationship might not be sufficient in some cases to establish the requisite \u201csecondary\u201d status of the parties <em>vis-a-vis </em>each other, for section 8(b)(4)(B) purposes, it is clear that the mere presence of some economic interdependence between the two will not automatically cause one to lose its secondary boycott protection with respect to the labor disputes of the other.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The appropriate result must necessarily depend upon the particular facts of each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">As we have noted, it is sometimes very difficult to delineate between lawful \u201cprimary\u201d activity and unlawful \u201csecondary\u201d activity.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Nevertheless, \u201c[h]owever difficult the drawing of lines more nice than obvious, the statute compels the task,\u201d Local 761, Interna<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>tional Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers v.

B., 366 U.S. 667, 674, 81 S.Ct. 1285, 1290, 6 L.Ed.2d 592 (1961), and it is principally the function of the Labor Board, as the agency established by Congress and entrusted with the major task of interpreting and applying the N.L.R.A.,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> to make the required determination in a particular case. <em>See </em>N.

In summary, the installers perform no work at Sears\u2019 locations beyond picking up carpet and installation orders; operate out of their own homes; utilize their own trucks, tools, and equipment ; hire their own employees, where necessary, at rates of pay which are not determined by Sears; are responsible for repair or [sic] damage which may be caused during installation; establish their own hours and schedules; schedule and reschedule jobs directly with the customers without notice to Sears; subcontract jobs without prior approval or knowledge of Sears; in practice do extra *work for customers without Sears\u2019 approval; generally perform work without instructions or guidelines; and, if a job is more difficult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>or time consuming then estimated by Sears, change the prices quoted by Sears to the customer. In addition we note the following circumstances established by the evidence before us. The installers here work for firms other than Sears who sell installed carpet and at least to that extent are in competition with Sears; the installers can and do turn down work for Sears;<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and there are no employees of Sears performing functions which are the same as or similar to those of the installers.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A45\">The Board then proceeded to succinctly set forth its conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-4\">While we accept the view of the [remanding] court, we are convinced that this case falls within the ambit of <em>Denver Building and Construction Trades </em>Council.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> It is unquestionably true, as the court suggest [ed], that Sears has a competitive interest in the amounts charged by the installers for their services, and that Sears is thus concerned with whether those installers join a labor organization, insofar as such circumstances might affect the fees charged by the installers. However, * * * we do not believe that such an economic interest requires a conclusion that a firm is not neutral for the purposes of Section 8(b)(4)(i)(ii)(B) where, as here, the record so clearly shows the independent contractor status of the installers,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <em>and the manner in which they secure and perform their work for Sears; the absence of Sears\u2019 employees doing the same work;</em><footnotemark><em>31</em></footnotemark><em> the fact that the installers can and do turn down work offered by Sears; and the fact that they work for other </em>companies.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">For the reasons set out below, we affirm the Labor Board\u2019s Supplemental Decision and enforce its Order in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">2. <em>The Law of the Case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-14\">Morand Brothers Beverage Co. v.

Federal Communications Commission v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U.S. 134, 140, 60 S.Ct. 437, 84 L.Ed. 656. That is to say, it is the \u201cinferior\u201d tribunal, whose decisions, both substantive and, in some instances, adj'ective, are subj'ect to review and consequent approval or disapproval by the review<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>ing body. The full implication of this relationship is realized when, as here, the occasion [has arisen] for the reviewing court to state what it believes to be the substantive law applicable to a particular controversy but [has found] that the lower tribunal has not conclusively found the facts to which this law should be applied. The result then, in view of the rule that a reviewing court shall not enter initial findings of fact, [was] an order remanding the cause \u201cfor further proceedings in conformity with the decision of this court.\u201d The pronouncements of the reviewing court are then known in the vernacular as \u201cthe law of the case\u201d, <em>i. e., </em>they are the rules to govern the particular dispute at hand, unless, of course, the decision of the reviewing court [has been] declared erroneous by a tribunal of competent jurisdiction holding a still more superior position in the judicial pyramid. In such a situation it behooves the inferior arbiter to exercise great care that \u201cthe law of the case\u201d is applied to the facts of the case when they have been precisely determined by it.

In this regard, it is imperative that we recognize the full import of our prior decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">In our previous opinion in this case, we indicated the necessity for reconsideration by the Labor Board of its determination of Sears\u2019 \u201csecondary\u201d status, due to the fact that it had apparently relied <em>exclusively </em>upon the finding of an independent contractor relationship in factual circumstances of extreme economic complexity. <em>See </em>Carpet, Linoleum, Soft Tile and Resilient Floor Covering Layers, Local Union No. 419 v. N. L. R. B., 139 U.S.App.D.C. 68, 70-72, 429 F.2d 747, 749-751 (1970). It is clear that the Labor Board was therefore foreclosed upon remand from placing controlling reliance upon the independent contractor status of the installers. However, this was the only \u201claw of the ease\u201d enunciated by us which was wholly binding on the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">Although our previous opinion discussed various factors which we believed might be worthy of consideration by the Labor Board on remand,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> in such instances we clearly did not intend to bind the Board. They were merely suggested as possible aids to the Board, and we did <em>not </em>contemplate that their mention would derogate from the broad adjudicatory discretion which we recognized the Labor Board would have a statutory obligation to exercise on remand. Thus, contrary to the assertion of the Union, the Board was clearly <em>not </em>under a binding duty to evaluate and consider <em>each and every </em>one of the factors suggested by us. So long as the Board\u2019s reconsideration did not place controlling weight on the independent contractor relationship, and has appropriate factual support in the record as a whole and an adequate basis in law, the Board\u2019s opinion is entitled to be accepted by us.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>3. <em>The Rationale of the Labor Board Decision on Remand.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">In its Supplemental Decision, the Labor Board did not rely exclusively upon the independent contractor status of the installers as it reaffirmed its prior section 8(b) (4) (i) and (ii) (B) determinations. Although the Board emphasized the independent contractor relationship between Sears and the installers, it also emphasized (1) the manner in which the installers independently secure and perform their contracted work for Sears; (2) that no Sears\u2019 employees perform the same or similar floor covering installation work; (3) that the independent installers can and do turn down work offered by Sears; and (4) that the installers work for other companies which may be in direct competition with Sears. <em>See </em>Carpet, Linoleum, Soft Tile and Resilient Floor Covering Layers, Local Union No. 419, AFU-CIO, 190 NLRB No. 28, 1971 CCH NLRB ff 22,984 (1971), slip op. at <em>5-6. We </em>find that the findings of the Board in its Supplemental Decision have substantial support in the record considered as a whole,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and have sufficient basis in law and policy to warrant acceptance by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">In our previous decision, we indicated that a situation might arise where the continuing economic interrelationship between parties having an independent contractor relationship with one another might be so inextricably intertwined that one might reasonably be eon-sidered to be related to the other in a \u201cprimary,\u201d rather than a \u201csecondary,\u201d fashion for secondary boycott purposes.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Carpet, Linoleum, Soft Tile and Resilient Floor Covering Layers, Local Union No. 419 v. N.L.R.B., 139 U.S.App.D.C. 68, 73-75, 429 F.2d 747, 752-754 (1970). <em>See </em>Local No. 24 International Brotherhood of Teamsters, etc. v. N.L.R.B., 105 U.S.App.D.C. 271, 266 F.2d 675 (1959). However, while the relationship between Sears and the independent floor covering installers might be considered to be more integrated and economically interrelated than the relationships which generally exist between a retailer and/or manufacturer and those who contract to perform required services for it, due to the fact that the installers perform a very important service for Sears\u2019 custo<em>mers </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>they install the floor covering purchased from Sears<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> \u2014 we find that the Board reasonably concluded on remand that the relationship is not such that Sears should be held to have lost its \u201csecondary\u201d status for section 8(b)(4) (B) purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-13\">The independent contractor/installers exercise extremely broad discretion concerning the manner in which they perform work for Sears, and as set forth above, in actual practice they occasionally turn down work offered by Sears. Furthermore, they can and do perform work for competitors of Sears. Therefore, if they were ever dissatisfied with the relationship between themselves and Sears, they could, on appropriate written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>notice, terminate it entirely, if they preferred to work exclusively for other companies, or, as a practical matter, they could alter their business arrangements in such a manner that they would perform less work for Sears and more work for other parties. Under these circumstances, it is clear, as the Board recognized in its Supplemental Decision, that the separate instances of Sears control over the independent operations of the installers are not so pervasive,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> nor is the economic interdependence such, that Sears should be regarded as a \u201cprimary,\u201d rather than a \u201csecondary,\u201d party with respect to a labor dispute between the Union and the installers. <em>See </em>International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 501 v. N.L.R.B., 181 F.2d 34, 37 (2nd Cir. 1950), affd., 341 U.S. 694, 71 S.Ct. 954, 95 L.Ed. 1299 (1951); N.L.R.B. v. Wine, Liquor and Distillery Workers Union, etc., 178 F.2d 584, 587 (2nd Cir. 1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">In the instant case, the \u201cprimary\u201d labor dispute concerns the Union and the independent contractor/installers. The Union would like to force the installers to become Union members, and it wants to require them to negotiate more lucrative installation contracts so that they will not undercut established Union standards that are alleged to exist. Since the character of the dispute between the Union and the installers is such that Sears could meaningfully accede to all of the Union\u2019s demands only by ceasing to do business with the installers, it is apparent that the Union\u2019s coercive action toward Sears has been violative of section 8(b)(4) (i) and (ii) (B) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-13\">B. OTHER UNION ARGUMENTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-14\">The Union makes several misconceived arguments which warrant brief discussion. It asserts that Sears plays such a dominant role in the determination of the compensation received by the installers and has such an interest in their economic affairs that the Union should have the right to demand collective bargaining with Sears concerning the installers. However, since the statutory term \u201cemployee\u201d expressly excludes \u201cany individual having the status of an independent contractor,\u201d <footnotemark>40</footnotemark> and an employer is only under the statutory obligation to negotiate with the chosen representative of its <em>own \u201cemployees\u201d,</em><footnotemark><em>41</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is clear that Sears was and is under no statutory obligation to negotiate with the Union over the installers, who are \u201cindependent contractors.\u201d <footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-15\">The Union erroneously relies upon Carpet, Linoleum, and Soft Tile Layers, Local No. 1238 (Arnold\u2019s Carpet), 175 NLRB 332 (1969), and Local No. 2265, United Brotherhood of Carpenters and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Joiners of America, AFL-CIO (Carpet Center), 170 NLRB 633 (1968). In those cases, unlike the instant one, \u201cemployer\u201d-\u201cemployee\u201d relationships, rather than \u201cindependent contractor\u201d relationships, were found, thereby rendering the employers concerned \u201cprimary\u201d parties. However, in its original decision in the case at bar, the Labor Board appropriately distinguished the <em>Arnold\u2019s Carpet </em>and <em>Carpet Center </em>decisions, on the ground that those cases clearly evidenced far more indicia of control by the employers over the persons performing the installation work than does the instant case with respect to Sears. <em>See </em>Carpet, Linoleum, Soft Tile and Resilient Floor Covering Layers, Local Union No. 419, AFL-CIO, 176 NLRB No. 120, 1969 CCH NLRB fl 20,964 (1964), slip op. at 2-3 &amp; n.3. Because of these differences concerning the amounts of exercised control, it was therefore completely logical and consistent for the Board to have determined that the installers in the present case are \u201cindependent contractors,\u201d while those in <em>Arnold\u2019s Carpet </em>and <em>Carpet Center </em>were \u201cemployees,\u201d thereby rendering those decisions inapposite to the Sears-installers situation.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">The Union also contends that the economic interrelationship between Sears and the independent contractor/installers is sufficiently intertwined that Sears should not be provided with secondary boycott protection under section 8(b) (4) (B), with respect to the labor dispute between the Union and the installers. We however, must reject this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The Union\u2019s economic and policy arguments closely resemble those which were accepted by the Supreme Court in N.L.R.B. v. Hearst Publications, Inc., 322 U.S. 111, 64 S.Ct. 851, 88 L.Ed. 1170 (1944), but were later expressly overruled by Congress in 1947, mandating a return to the traditional, common law analysis.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The ramifications of this unmistaken congressional attitude for secondary boycott purposes has been recognized in two important decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">In International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 501 v. N.L.R.B., 181 F.2d 34 (2nd Cir. 1950), a Second Circuit majority rejected the arguments of dissenting Judge Clark, who favored the utilization of the <em>Hearst </em>approach to secondary boycott cases, and its decision, which followed the traditional approach, was affirmed by the Supreme Court. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers v. N.L.R.B., 341 U.S. 694, 71 S.Ct. 954, 95 L.Ed. 1299 (1951). The Supreme Court reaffirmed its compelled rejection of its earlier <em>Hearst </em>approach to secondary boycott situations in N.L.R.B. v. Denver Building and Construction Trades Council, 341 U.S. 675, 71 S.Ct. 943, 95 L.Ed. 1284 (1951). In light of these unambiguous Supreme Court pronouncements, it would clearly not be appropriate for this court to accept the Union\u2019s arguments which would lead us back to the congressionally rejected <em>Hearst </em>approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">The type of situation with which we are herein concerned was expressly discussed on the Senate floor by Senator Taft in 1947:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-15\">Take a case in which the employer is getting along perfectly with his employees. * * * Someone else says to those employees, \u201cWe want you to strike against your employer because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>he happens to be handling some product which we do not like [or is doing business with someone we do not approve of]. * * * Of course if that sort of thing is encouraged there will be hundreds and thousands of strikes in the United States. There is no reason that I can see why we should make it lawful for persons to incite workers to strike when they are perfectly satisfied with their conditions. * * * The Senator [Mr. Pepper] says they must be encouraged to strike because their employer happens to be doing business with someone the union does not like or with whom it is having trouble or having a strike.

Since the position of Senator Taft, rather than that of Senator Pepper, prevailed, as evidenced by the enactment of the pervasive anti-secondary boycott section by Congress,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> it is apparent that the decision of the Labor Board on remand must be affirmed.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The Union\u2019s petition for review is denied, and enforcement of the Labor Board\u2019s order, as reaffirmed in its Supplemental Decision and Order, is hereby granted in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b458-7\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(4)(B) (1970) provides :</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">(b) It shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">(4) (i) to engage in, or to induce or encourage an individual employed by any person engaged in commerce or in an industry affecting commerce to engage in, a strike or a refusal in the course of his employment to use, manufacture, process, transport, or otherwise handle or work on any goods, articles, materials, or commodities or to perform any services ; or (ii) to threaten, coerce, or restrain any person engaged in commerce or in an industry affecting commerce, where in either case an object thereof is'\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b458-14\">(B) forcing or requiring any person to cease using, selling, handling, transporting, or otherwise dealing in the products of any other producer, processor, or manufacturer, or to <em>cease doing business with any other person, </em>or forcing or requiring any other employer to recognize or bargain with a labor organization as the representative of his employees unless such labor organization has been certified as the representative of such employees under the provisions of section 159 of this title: <em>Provided, </em>That nothing contained in this clause (B) shall be construed to make unlawful, where not otherwise unlawful, any primary strike or primary picketing; [emphasis supplied]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b458-19\">.

However, this fact strongly supports our present decision to affirm the Labor Board\u2019s Supplemental Decision, since it is readily apparent from the legislative history and congressional objectives surrounding the enactment of the N.L.R.A.\u2019s secondary boycott provisions <em>[see </em>Parts 1(A) and (B) of this opinion, <em>supra], </em>as well as from the congressional rejection of the <em>Searst </em>economic and policy considerations approach [see Part 1(0), <em>supra], </em>that such relationships were ordinarily intended to be considered \u201csecondary\u201d for section 8(b)(4)(B) puposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b468-5\">. <em>Cf. </em>Local No. 24, International Brotherhood of Teamsters etc. v.

Section 8(a)(5) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(5) (1970), makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer \u201cto refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of <em>his employees, </em>* * * \u201d (emphasis supplied) <em>See, e. g., </em>Allied Chemical and Alkali Workers of America, Local Union No. 1 v.

Sears, on the other hand, has <em>no </em>statutory employees, whom the Union could represent, who perform any floor covering installation work. The Union\u2019s reliance upon American Federation of Musicians v. Carroll, 391 U.S. 99, 88 S.Ct. 1562, 20 L.Ed.2d 460 (1968), is similarly misplaced, since that decision only concerned the scope of labor\u2019s exemption from the federal antitrust laws.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b469-6\">. We similarly believe that the rationale of our decision in Local No. 24, International Brotherhood of Teamsters etc. v. N.L.R.B., 105 U.S.App.D.C. 271, 266 F.2d 675 (1959), is inapplicable to the present situation. In that case, the motor carrier being picketed by the union extensively participated in the employment relationship between the striking drivers and their lessor-owner/employers, thereby rendering the carrier ineligible for secondary boycott protection. Sears is clearly not so involved with its contract installers. The two cases are therefore distinguishable on the amount of control exercised.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b469-17\">. <em>See </em>discussion in Part 1(C) of this opinion, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b470-9\">. <em>See </em>discussion in Part 1(B) of this opinion, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"AvyD\">. That portion of the Labor Board\u2019s decision in Local 282, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, 155 NLRB 973 (1965), upon which the Union relies, is clearly distinguishable from the case at bar, since the dispute in that case was <em>directly </em>between the union in question and those employers against which it directed its economic pressure. Here, on the other hand, the dispute is primarily between the Union and the independent contractor/installers, with Sears being only a \u201csecondary\u201d party thereto. Furthermore, in the situations referred to by the Union in the <em>Local 282 </em>case, the employers which were the objects of the collective activity controlled the \u201cmanner and means\u201d of job performance to a far greater extent than does Sears with respect to the installers with whom we are herein concerned. <em>See </em>155 NLRB at 988 \u2014 990.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b470-7\">FAHY, Senior Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">I concur in the result reached in the carefully considered opinion of Judge MacKinnon, but since I do not feel so clearly as to the result I briefly state separately my position.
