The appeals have been consolidated by order of this court. The issues considered relate to, and this opinion applies to, these three appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-20\">This action is brought by a plaintiff, who alleges that he is a stockholder of Coburn Corporation of America (Co-burn), and brings the action for the benefit of Coburn. On information and belief Segal alleges (1) that \u201cin or about early 1970 Colonial . . . threatened to obtain control of Coburn and oust management of Coburn from control of it,\u201d (2) that the defendants \u201cpursuant to a common plan, scheme, and conspiracy directly and indirectly through the use of the mails and other instrumentalities of interstate commerce . . . engaged in artifices, schemes, and devices to defraud Coburn and its stockholders in connection with the purchase and sale of securities,\u201d and (3) that pursuant to the conspiracy Coburn sold securities to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Colonial for less than adequate consideration. Damages \u201cin excess of $5,-000,000\u201d are claimed. A plethora of specified sections of the Securities Acts are cited as the bases for his claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Solely at issue on appeal are (1) the sufficiency of the complaint and (2) the granting of summary judgments in favor of Linden, Gordon and Colonial under motions to dismiss as converted by the parties themselves by their numerous affidavits and memoranda into summary judgment motions. Narrow issues are thus presented on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">This case (and appeal) must be considered in the light of the individual calendar system in effect in the Eastern District of New York (as in many other districts) whereby the case, as soon as filed, is placed under the complete control of a particular judge, who is responsible for it from filing to ultimate disposition. By this efficient system the judge is in a position at all times to observe the status of each case, proeedurally as well as substantively. The system also permits conferences, formal and informal, and the submission of such motions, affidavits and memoranda as may be appropriate and as the court may permit. As a result, the stage at which disposition of the pending proceedings can be made should be largely within the Court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Prior to the time the motions now on appeal were made, a complaint had been filed. The defendant Coburn and other defendants had answered. The court had held a conference and had filed a \u201cConference Memorandum.\u201d On November 30, 1970, the court held a pre-trial conference. Thereafter, on December 28, 1970, defendants Linden and Gordon moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) (\u201cfailure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted\u201d) together with required memoranda.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, in addition to the motion, the defendants Linden and Gordon submitted affidavits in support thereof wherein they asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that they were residents of Puerto Rico, that they had become directors of Co-burn on August 15, 1969, that they had resigned on May 13, 1970, that they had not participated in any proposed transaction with Colonial as alleged in the complaint, that they were never members of Coburn\u2019s executive committee, never voted for any proposed sale to Colonial of Coburn\u2019s accounts receivable, that they were never officers of Coburn, and had voiced their opposition to any sale until further information was furnished to enable a proper evaluation thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-12\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel submitted an affidavit in opposition and a supplemental memorandum. In an endeavor to substantiate the allegation that Colonial threatened to \u201coust\u201d Coburn\u2019s management, plaintiff\u2019s counsel in an affidavit sworn to on January 12, 1971, refers to, and places reliance on, an affidavit of Bernard Korn (President of Colonial), dated November 2, 1970, apparently served in support of a motion to dismiss an action entitled Marino v. Coburn Corporation of America et al., Civ. No. 70C960 (E.D.N.Y.). To the Korn affidavit is attached a press release dated January 19, 1970, wherein Korn is pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>ported to have announced that \u201cpreliminary discussions have been held with such [various members of Coburn\u2019s Board] directors looking towards the acquisition by Colonial of approximately 51% of the outstanding shares of Co-burn common stock.\u201d * * * \u201cThe making of such an offer was contingent [Mr. Korn stated] upon general market conditions, the respective prices of Colonial and Coburn stock and other factors which Colonial believed relevant being satisfactory to Colonial.\u201d Korn \u201ccould not reasonably predict future developments\u201d and cautioned \u201cagainst present trading in anticipation of the making of any exchange offer by Colonial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel in his affidavit of January 12, 1971, states that these \u201cpreliminary negotiations\u201d form the basis for his allegation in the complaint wherein \u201cColonial had threatened to obtain control of Coburn and oust the management of Coburn from control of it.\u201d Thus, the trial court was advised of the proof upon which plaintiff\u2019s counsel relied and was able to draw its own conclusions as to the information which the release conveyed rather than accept counsel\u2019s unwarranted intimations and inferences. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel avers that he has examined Colonial\u2019s Form 8-K for the month of April, 1970, which shows the financial transaction between Colonial and Coburn of which plaintiff complains in his complaint dated June 1, 1970.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">In addition there was an affidavit of counsel for Linden and Gordon setting forth copies of relevant minutes of Co-burn.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Thus, although the motion had originally been cast as a motion to dismiss the complaint, by the actions of the parties, it had been converted into a summary judgment motion and Judge Pooling so regarded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">Sufficiency of the Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">The complaint against Linden, Gordon and Colonial is clearly deficient. The allegations are wholly conclusory in nature and, in addition, fail to comply with Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure: \u201cIn all avernments of fraud . . ., the circumstances constituting fraud . . . shall be stated with particularity.\u201d However, this fatal deficiency becomes somewhat academic \u2014at least as to Linden and Gordon \u2014 in the light of the undisputed material facts which formed the basis for the trial court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Only the distorted inferences and speculations of plaintiff\u2019s counsel supply the grounds for his countervailing hypotheses.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-13\">\n<em>A. The Rationale for Rule 9(b)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b668-14\">One of the concerns behind the specificity requirement of Rule 9(b) has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>succinctly articulated by Professors Wright and Miller:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-5\">When the pleader is asserting that third persons have been defrauded, he may be unable to detail the claim and less particularity should be required. Thus, simple allegations should suffice for claims of fraud in an informer\u2019s action or a derivative suit and primary reliance should be placed on the discovery process for uncovering factual details. However, since \u201cstrike suits\u201d are especially common in these two contests, the desire to be assured that the action has some merit has motivated the courts to insist on a reasonably high level of specificity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ah-\">Rule 9(b)\u2019s specificity requirement stems not only from the desire to minimize the number of strike suits but also more particularly from the desire to protect defendants from the harm that comes to their reputations or to their goodwill when they are charged with serious wrongdoing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-6\">It is a serious matter to charge a person with fraud and hence no one is permitted to do so unless he is in a position and is willing to put himself on record as to what the alleged fraud consists of specifically.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">In response to these considerations this Court and our lower courts have been sensitive to the requirement that the circumstances constituting fraud be alleged with particularity. \u201cMere conclusory allegations to the effect that defendant\u2019s conduct was fraudulent or in violation of Rule 10b-5 are insufficient\u201d Shemtob v. Shearson, Hammill &amp; Co., 448 F.2d 442, 444 (2d Cir.1971); \u201c. . . there must be allegation of facts [in a complaint under Rule 10b-5] amounting to deception in one form or another; conclusory allegations of deception or fraud will not suffice\u201d O\u2019Neill v. Maytag, 339 F.2d 764, 768 (2d Cir.1964); \u201c [i]t is now quite clear in this Circuit that allegations with respect to 10b-5 violations will not pass scrutiny if they do not allege with some specificity the statements allegedly constituting the fraud. Mere conclusory allegations to the effect that defendant\u2019s conduct was fraudulent or in violation of 10b-5 are insufficient\u201d Matheson v. White Weld &amp; Co., 53 F.R.D. 450, 452 (S.D.N.Y.1971); \u201c[m]ere general allegations that there was fraud, corruption or conspiracy or characterizations of acts or conduct in these terms are not enough no matter how frequently repeated\u201d Chicago Title &amp; Trust Co. v. Fox Theatres Corp., 182 F.Supp. 18, 31 (S.D.N.Y.1960). <em>See </em>American Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Barad Shaff Securities Corp., 335 F.Supp. 1276, 1281-1282 (S.D.N.Y.1972). <em>See also </em>Kellman v. ICS, Inc., 447 F.2d 1305, 1309-1310 (6th Cir. 1971); Perma Research and Development Co. v. Singer Co., 410 F.2d 572, 576 (2d Cir.1969); Robison v. Caster, 356 F.2d 924-925 (7th Cir.1966); Reiver v. Photo Motion Corp., 325 F.Supp. 214 (E.D.Pa.1971); Tryforos v. Icarian Development Co., 47 F.R.D. 191, 195-196 (N.D.Ill.1969). <em>Cf. </em>Heart Disease Research Foundation v. General Motors Corp., 463 F.2d 98, 100 (2d Cir.1972) (\u201c[e]ven under the liberal Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, there is a limit to how much a court may be called upon to divine in assessing the sufficiency of the complaint before it, particularly when the plaintiff is represented by counsel. Although the Federal Rules permit statement of ultimate facts, a bare bones statement of conspiracy or of injury under the antitrust laws without any supporting facts permits dismissal\u201d). A complaint alleging fraud should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>be filed only after a wrong is reasonably believed to have occurred; it should serve to seek redress for a wrong, not to find one.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">B. <em>Application of Rule 9(b) to these Complaints</em></p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s complaint and his proposed amended complaint do not meet the requirements of Rule 9(b). The first complaint was obviously filed on the basis of little investigation or research.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The nature of the businesses of Coburn and Colonial, their places of business, the exchanges on which their shares are traded, the periods during which the directors served on the Co-burn board, the nature and amount of the securities exchanged, or the dates of the transaction \u2014 none is disclosed. The allegations violate the general rule that Rule 9(b) pleadings cannot be based \u201con information and belief.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While the rule is relaxed as to matters peculiarly within the adverse parties\u2019 knowledge, the allegations must then be accompanied by a statement of the facts upon which the belief is founded.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Plaintiff\u2019s conspiracy claims are obviously founded more on an examination of Rule 10b-5 than on an investigation of the facts of the alleged fraud. The word \u201cconspiracy\u201d does not alone satisfy the specificity requirement of Rule 9(b).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A complaint cannot escape the charge that it is entirely conclusory in nature merely by quoting such words from the statutes as \u201cartifices, schemes, and devices to defraud\u201d and \u201cscheme and conspiracy.\u201d While plaintiff was asked both by the court and by the defendants Linden and Gordon to specify his claims, no such particularization came forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-13\">The amended complaint, which we consider only as to Colonial,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> suffers from the same defect \u2014 lack of specificity. In this complaint plaintiff shifts his focus to sections 13(d) and 14(e) of the 1934 Act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The claim is that Colonial formed a \u201cgroup\u201d with the directors of Coburn to \u201cdispose\u201d of the shares of Coburn and therefore should have filed a Schedule 13D statement with the SEC. Alternatively, plaintiff claims that Colonial violated section 14(e) in announcing in its January press release an intention to make a tender offer to Coburn\u2019s shareholders when it had no such intention. There is no support for these assertions. That Colonial formed a group is founded on unmitigated speculation, and there is no basis for doubting that the release was meant to mean what it said: that the viability of the proposed offer was dependent in part on the reception given to the proposed offer by Coburn\u2019s management.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-14\">C. <em>Linden and Gordon</em></p>\n<p id=\"b670-15\">These two defendants presented sufficient evidence as to their non-participation in the transaction complained of. No evidence to the contrary was tendered. As the trial court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-16\">. a point is reached at which when a plaintiff in such a case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>presented with specific evidence of the defendants\u2019 non-participation the plaintiff must come forward with some indication of the source from which he can with reasonable confidence expect to produce proofs to meet the defendants\u2019 specific points and the general nature of such proofs. That has not been done here.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afn\">Although these undisputed facts were sufficient to support the judgments appealed from as to Linden and Gordon, the trial court proceeded to analyze the facts put before him in \u201caffidavit, memorandum and exhibit material made available in this and the related case * * * \u201d [70 C. 82 \u2014 still pending before the court]. From this material the court concluded that \u201cit is only too apparent that the action does not have its genesis in any reasonable quantity of evidence that the wrong charged ever actually took place\u201d and that with respect to Linden and Gordon \u201cthe affirmative evidences of their positive transactions, are more than adequate in this posture of the record to entitle them to a dismissal of the complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel clamors for an opportunity to have \u201cdiscovery\u201d. He has read in the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>of \u201cpreliminary discussions\u201d between certain directors who \u201csupposedly\u201d were parties thereto and, although admittedly \u201cnothing had been finalized\u201d according to the press release, would have discovery \u201cof the reasons and motivations for the announcement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The courts should not lend themselves to this sort of pseudo-legal harassment. Were they to do so almost every announcement of corporate matters under discussion could be forced by Procrustean means into a lawsuit under the Securities Acts to inquire into the state of mind of every director exercising his individual judgment as to the problem before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">Plaintiff produced nothing to counterbalance the scale so heavily weighted in favor of dismissal with respect to Linden and Gordon.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">D. <em>Colonial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">After judgment of dismissal had been entered (April 9, 1971) in favor of Linden and Gordon, Colonial also moved to dismiss the complaint (June 1, 1971). Plaintiff\u2019s counsel responded with his affidavit entitled \u201cAffidavit in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss the Complaint.\u201d The affidavit was also submitted \u201cin support of the application of the plaintiff for leave to amend the complaint.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-11\">\n<em>The Proposed Amended Complaint</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9A\">The proposed amendment [as characterized by Judge Dooling in his opinion granting Colonial's motion to dismiss] reflects the persistent illusion that a complaint becomes a good complaint in the federal court if it cites enough sections of the '33 and '34 Acts and if supported by the statement that for all plaintiff\u2019s counsel knows discovery <em>might </em>disclose a state of facts upon which could be supported a reading that <em>for all plaintiff\u2019s counsel knows </em>discovery <em>might </em>disclose a state of facts upon which could be imposed a reading that <em>might </em>come into register with an arguable interpretation of at least one section of the '33 or the \u201934 Act, or [a Rule drawn thereunder], (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">Although the trial court\u2019s opinion, citing our decisions in Superintendent of Insurance of State of New York v. Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co., etc., 430 F.2d 355, and Drachman v. Harvey, 453 F.2d 722 (2d Cir. 1971), was delivered prior to the reversal by the Supreme Court of <em>Superintendent, </em>404 U.S. 6, 92 S.Ct. 165, 30 L.Ed.2d 128 (1971), and this court\u2019s reversal <em>en banc </em>of <em>Drachman </em>453 F.2d 736 (2d Cir. 1972), the proposed amendment fails to comply with Rule 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-13\">The inadequacy of the complaint as to Linden, Gordon and Colonial under Rule 9, and the uneontroverted proof as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Linden and Gordon of non-participation call for affirmance of Judge Dooling\u2019s decision to dismiss as to these three defendants. If there be any substance to the charge that certain directors wrongfully allowed assets of Coburn to be sold for an inadequate consideration, any such wrong can be righted in an action properly pleaded in an appropriate forum.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b666-11\">.

Linden and Gordon also based their motion to dismiss on the grounds that there was no jurisdiction over the subject matter (12(b)(1)), that venue was improper (12(b)(3)), and that service of process had been insufficient (12(b)(5)). The basis for these latter two grounds was that Linden and Gordon were no longer directors of Coburn and were presently residents of Puerto Rico, and that service on them had been effected by mail. Judge Dooling denied the motion on these grounds while deploring the informality of the service of process. <em>See Segal, supra </em>note 1, at 90,720-21.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b668-6\">. This form disclosed that Colonial had purchased from Coburn retail installment credit contracts with an aggregate \u201cdebit\u201d balance of about $8,000,000, as well as receivables having a \u201cdebit\u201d balance of $5,000,000 that had been previously written off as uncollectible. The form indicated that Colonial purchased the receivables for $1,000,000 in cash and $4,000,-000 in notes. The discrepancy between the debit value of the receivables sold ($13,000,000), and the face value of the consideration received by Coburn ($5,-000,000), is claimed to have served as the basis of the damage claim in the complaint. There is no mention of whether the \u201cdebit\u201d balance of $8,000,000 was offset by any credits for bad debts, or whether the $5,000,000 written off as un-collectible had any market value. The sale to Colonial was made up of receivables, some of which apparently had maturities of three years, and the stock of two wholly-owned subsidiaries of Coburn, Coburn Credit Co. of New Jersey, Inc. and Coburn Credit Co. of Pennsylvania, Inc. Plaintiff makes no allegation as to the value of the stock sold and, indeed, we are not even clear as to whether the $13,000,000 of receivables referred to constitutes some, any, or all of the assets of the two wholly-owned subsidiaries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b668-16\">.
