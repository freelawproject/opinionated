During the course of the plaintiff's employment by Safeway there was filed, on August 9, 1968, a charge made by a Commissioner of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> with said Commission that Safeway had violated and continued to violate the Act by discriminating against Negroes and Spanish-sur-named Americans because of their race or national origin, with respect to hiring and recruitment in Clovis, New Mexico. Such charge was served upon Safeway on August 30, 1968, and in accordance with the Commission\u2019s procedures, was thereafter investigated. On September 30, 1969, the Commission rendered its decision that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-4\">\u201cReasonable cause exists to believe that Respondent Employer [Safeway] is committing an unlawful employment practice in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by refusing or failing to hire Negroes and Spanish Surnamed Americans because of their race and national origin respectively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-17\">\u201cReasonable cause exists to believe that Respondent Employer [Safeway] has committed an unlawful employment practice in violation of Title VII of the Act by maintaining disparate and less favorable conditions of employment for its Negro employees because of their race.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1008-18\">Attempts to eliminate the alleged unlawful employment practices by informal methods, as provided in \u00a7 2000e-5(a), failed. On December 1, 1970, the Commission notified plaintiff of his right to sue, and on December 30, 1970, plaintiff commenced this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-19\">At the beginning of the trial, counsel for the plaintiff took the position that the action brought by Washington was a class action. We set out in note 5 hereto all of the allegations of the complaint, except the jurisdictional allegations in paragraph 1, the alleged exhaustion of administrative remedies in paragraph 4, that the court authorized the commencement of the action without payment of costs or giving security for costs in paragraph 5, and an allegation in paragraph 2 that plaintiff is a black man.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>At the beginning of the trial, counsel for Washington took the position that the action was a class action. The court observed that such position \u201cdoes not square with your complaint,\u201d and in effect said the plaintiff sought to recover $1500 damages for himself and an injunction restraining Safeway from discriminating against this particular plaintiff. Counsel for the plaintiff then said, \u201cThat is true, but it is brought as a member of a particular class which Commissioner Ximenes says has been discriminated against in employment practices by Safeway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">The court held it was not a class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">Notwithstanding the opening sentence of paragraph 3 of the complaint; that each of the subdivisions thereof from (a) through (h), except subparagraph (f), charged alleged unfair employment practices by Safeway solely against the plaintiff, and that his prayer for relief was solely for himself; and notwithstanding his total failure either to allege or show the prerequisites to the maintenance of a class action, as prescribed by amended Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, effective July 1, 1966 (Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. Rule 23, 28 U.S.C.A.), counsel for plaintiff persisted in his contention that it was a class action. During the trial, he introduced evidence that would only be admissible in a class action, because of the wide latitude accorded him by the court in the introduction of evidence. And he still insists in this court that it was a class action. Such claim is so obviously baseless, we think it sufficient to say we agree with the holding of the trial court that it was only plaintiff\u2019s individual action. We set forth in note 6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>hereto the findings of fact made by the trial court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">The findings negate every unfair employment practice alleged in the complaint to have been practiced by Safeway against plaintiff, with one possible exception. The court did not in specific language find that Safeway failed to discipline fellow employees who indulged in racial slurs directed to the plaintiff. However, plaintiff requested the court to make the following finding of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-5\">\u201cPlaintiff was subjected in his employment to harassment, including insults and racial slurs on account of his race by white employees and management failed to discipline for such harassment and insults, notwithstanding its declared policy that the same would not be tolerated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">The court refused to make such finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">The slurs and harassment were predicated on the alleged use of the word \u201cnigger.\u201d The evidence was in sharp dispute as to whether such slurs were made in the presence of or directed toward plaintiff, and as to whether the word \u201cnigger\u201d was used frequently or not in the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-17\">There was evidence of one instance when the word \u201cnigger\u201d was used in the hearing of Wilkie McCoy, a black employee, by Harold Knox, a laboratory technician. Knox was in his office, which was in disarray, and he made the following remark: \u201cThis is a big enough mess for ten little niggers to clean up.\u201d McCoy was waiting to punch in at the time clock and heard the remark. He approached Knox and asked him if he was in the bad habit of using words like that. Knox replied that it was just a word he used. McCoy then got Richard Schwank, the plant foreman, and they talked to Knox. Knox apologized to McCoy and said he was sorry. McCoy said that settled the matter to his satisfaction; that he had no hard feelings toward Knox, and he did not think Knox had any toward him. He also testified that the remark was not directed to him. Knox was not disciplined for his remark. Surely, under the circumstances, no discipline was called for.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-19\">McCoy also testified that Safeway never discriminated against him in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>The remark of Knox was not made in the presence or hearing of the plaintiff. It shows the length to which plaintiff went to try to prove his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">We are of the opinion that the refusal of the court to make such finding, requested by the plaintiff, showed affirmatively that the court did not believe the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses with respect to racial slurs, and the evidence afforded substantial and ample support for the court\u2019s conclusion. While there were conflicts in the evidence, it was the function of the trial court, not this court, to pass on the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">After a careful examination of the evidence adduced at the trial, reflected in the record, we are firmly of the opinion that each of the court\u2019s findings are amply supported by competent evidence and are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">We are also of the opinion: That the findings and the refusal to give the finding requested by plaintiff negate every alleged claim of violations of the Act by Safeway against plaintiff; that plaintiff was given every possible opportunity to prove his case and failed so to do-; and that no prejudicial error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1007-25\">.
