The District Court held that the compromise agreement between General Electric and the trustee, in relegating General Electric\u2019s claim to the status of \u201cunsecured claim,\u201d forecloses this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-16\">In our judgment this was error. \u201cUnsecured claim\u201d could encompass senior indebtedness as well as other indebtedness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Indeed, the parties seem deliberately to have fixed on language that would reserve their differences upon the question of the right of General Electric to claim \u201csenior indebtedness\u201d status and thus to avoid the necessity of either party conceding the position of the other.) Accordingly, the phrase is ambiguous and requires construction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-17\">Two issues appear to require attention:</p>\n<p id=\"b283-18\">1. Whether it was the intent of the parties that General Electric\u2019s claim (absent its security) should have the same status (as senior indebtedness or not) that it occupied before compromise.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-19\">2. If so, what that status was.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-20\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-21\">.
