The NLRB further ordered Sitton to bargain with the Union and to make whole four employees unlawfully discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-25\">Sitton rested its case before the Trial Examiner without offering any evidence and defended on the basis that (1) the General Counsel had not made a prima facie case and (2) that the Union had never made a proper demand for recognition by demonstrating majority representation in an appropriate unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>Sitton now asserts that there is not substantial evidence in the record as a whole supporting the Board\u2019s findings and that a bargaining order is not appropriate for the reason the company\u2019s conduct, if unlawful, did not tend to undermine the union\u2019s majority and make a fair election unlikely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-4\">A thorough review of the record convinces us there is substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings of \u00a7\u00a7 8 (a)(1) and (3) violations of the National Labor Relations Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-5\">We also find that the Board\u2019s bargaining order was appropriate. See NLRB v. Gissel Packing Company, 395 U.S. 575, 614, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969) and Arbie Mineral Feed Company v. NLRB, 438 F.2d 940, 944-945 (CA8 1971). The surest method of undermining a union\u2019s majority or impeding an election process is to discharge all the pro-union employees, as Sitton did here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-6\">Enforced.
