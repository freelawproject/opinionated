It contemplated each of the changes that are now being undertaken. While in some eases one might turn a sympathetic ear towards a contention that certain requirements of the national environmental protection act have retroactive application, it does not seem appropriate in a case like the present, as to which all standards required to be complied with had been completed when this specific project was originally approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-22\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
