Following the jury verdict and judgment of conviction the trial court sentenced appellant to two concurrent one year and one day confinement sentences, and this appeal followed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">The sole issues raised on appeal are closely related: (a) asserted error by the trial court in overruling appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, and (b) the insufficiency of the evidence to justify conviction. The evidence at trial was conflicting. The government\u2019s case consisted in the main of the testimony of three revenue agents who observed enough activities of the defendant with respect to an illict distillery to establish guilt. The defense centered around a claim of alibi, that the defendant was working in the woods cutting pulpwood some miles away at the time of the officers\u2019 observation. The government\u2019s evidence, if believed by the jury, was amply sufficient to justify conviction, and of course to survive motion for judgment of acquittal. The disputed questions of fact were resolved adversely to appellant by the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty. See United States v. Gainey, 1965, 380 U.S. 63, 69-70, 85 S.Ct. 754, 759, 13 L.Ed.2d 658, 664; Holland v. United States, 1954, 348 U.S. 121, 75 S.Ct. 127, 99 L.Ed. 150; McFarland v. United States, 5 Cir. 1960, 273 F.2d 417, 418-419.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-14\">The judgment of conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"b273-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-11\">. The other two counts charged possession of a still and distilling apparatus set up without being registered as required by law, in violation of Title 26, U.S.O., Sections 5179(a) and 5601(a), and possession of non-taxpaid distilled spirits in violation of Title 26, U.S.C., Sections 5205(a)(2) and 5604(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
