He argues that his sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. Finding no error in the district court\u2019s sentence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-18\">First, Andrade-Mora challenges the district court\u2019s assessment of an eight-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) based on his 1994 Washington conviction for delivery of a controlled substance as \u201cpatently unfair\u201d because that conviction was too stale to receive criminal history points. Andrade-Mora does not meaningfully explain this argument or support it with authority, however, and he has therefore forfeited this issue. <em>See United States v. Charles, </em>469 F.3d 402, 408 (5th Cir. 2006) (\u201cInadequately briefed issues are deemed abandoned.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-23\">Second, Andrade-Mora contends that the presentence report (PSR) was \u201ccompletely wrong and misleading\u201d in its description of his 1994 Washington conviction because the state court departed downward in sentencing him and because the offense was assigned no criminal history points. This assertion is baseless, as the PSR provided the actual sentence imposed by the state court and noted that no history points were assigned for this offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-24\">Third, Andrade-Mora maintains that he wrongly received criminal history points for his 2001 Washington conviction for unlawful possession of a firearm because the conviction took place more than fifteen years prior to the commission of the instant offense. This contention is plainly untrue, as Andrade-Mora committed the instant offense in 2015, less than fifteen years after his state conviction for unlawful possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-25\">Finally, Andrade-Mora argues that the district court erred in denying a downward variance. He notes that while the district court based its decision on his \u201cextensive immigration history,\u201d he only had two pri- or convictions for illegal reentry. We review Andrade-Mora\u2019s sentence for reasonableness, under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). His within-guidelines sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonable<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>ness. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir. 2010). The record reflects that the district court made an individualized assessment of the facts of the case in light of the sentencing factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586. This individualized assessment properly included consideration of Andrade-Mora\u2019s prior convictions. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.4. We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s refusal to apply a downward variance in imposing a sentence for Andrade-Mora\u2019s third illegal reentry conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir, R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
