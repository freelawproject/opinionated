We review de novo the district court\u2019s authority to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Jones, </em>596 F.3d 273, 276 (5th Cir. 2010); <em>see also Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-23\">Maxwell argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion without stating reasons and that his case should be remanded for such a statement. \u201c[A] court is not required to state findings of facts and conclusions of law when denying a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.\u201d <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 674 (5th Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks and footnote citation omitted). Even assuming that the district court was required to state its reasons for denying Maxwell\u2019s motion, any error is harmless since, as' addressed below, Maxwell is clearly ineligible for relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111; Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>A defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction if the applicable guidelines range is lowered by an amendment to the Guidelines listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(d), p.s., such as Amendment 484. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(a), (d). A defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduction if the listed amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the applicable guidelines range.\u201d \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Maxwell\u2019s sentence was not based on the drug quantity table in \u00a7 2D1.1 that was amended by Amendment 484. His sentence was based on the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G \u00a7 4B1.1 (Nov. 1, 1987). When Maxwell was sentenced, the career offender guideline provided (as it does now) that if the career offender offense level is greater than an \u201cotherwise applicable\u201d offense level,. the career offender offense level \u201cshall apply.\u201d \u00a7 4B1.1. Thus, he was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir. 2009). Maxwell has cited no precedential or persuasive authority that <em>Anderson </em>is no longer the applicable law in this circuit. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Maxwell\u2019s motion. <em>See Dillon, </em>560 U.S. at 826, 130 S.Ct. 2683; <em>Jones, </em>596 F.3d at 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is not the proper vehicle for Maxwell to challenge the application of the career offender guidelines, either because he does not have a qualifying offense, as addressed on direct appeal in <em>United States v. Hinkle, </em>832 F.3d 569 (5th Cir. 2016), or because the career offender guideline is constitutionally infirm in light of <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), as may be addressed by the Supreme Court in <em>Beckles v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 2510, 195 L.Ed.2d 838 (2016) (granting petition for writ of certiorari).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47,5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
