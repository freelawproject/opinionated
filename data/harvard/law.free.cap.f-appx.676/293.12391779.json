Henderson, on behalf of the estate of Nolan Ryan Henderson, III and wrongful death beneficiaries of Nolan Henderson, has appealed from the district court\u2019s order dismissing her complaint for failure to state a claim and denying her motion for reconsideration. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-16\">Nolan Ryan Henderson was killed on March 25, 2012, while on the premises of an apartment complex, Palisades @ E-City. At the time of Nolan Henderson\u2019s death, Palisades was under the receivership of Campus Advantage, Inc., pursuant to an order entered by the Southern District of Mississippi in July of 20\u00cd1 (Appointment Order).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As Receiver, Campus Advantage was authorized to manage, maintain, and operate Palisades. The Appointment Order provided that Campus Advantage had \u201cno personal liability\u201d \u201c[ejxcept in the event of gross negligence, willful misconduct or actions in violation of orders of the Court.\u201d Campus Advantage\u2019s receivership over Palisades was subsequently terminated at the request of the parties by court order on November 28, 2012 (Termination Order). The Termination Order contained a clause providing that Campus Advantage \u201cshall be fully and forever released and discharged from any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>and all liability as Receiver of [Palisades].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">On November 12, 2013\u2014nearly a year after Campus Advantage was terminated as Receiver over Palisades\u2014Sonja Henderson, on behalf of the estate and wrongful death beneficiaries of Nolan Henderson, brought suit in state court against Campus Advantage, three of its employees<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (collectively, Campus Advantage), and various other defendants, alleging that defendants had negligently failed to provide adequate security at Palisades and had negligently failed to warn of foreseeable dangers on the premises. Henderson also asserted that these alleged failures amounted to gross negligence. Campus Advantage subsequently removed the case to federal district court<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and moved to dismiss the complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">In its motion to dismiss, Campus Advantage argued that the release in the Termination Order barred Henderson\u2019s claim. In response, Henderson offered two arguments. First, she argued that enforcing the Termination Order to bar her claim would violate procedural due process because Campus Advantage did not \u201cmail to Plaintiffs a notice of the receivership, how to file claims against the subject property of the receivership, and date that claims would be barred.\u201d Second, Henderson argued that, because the Appointment Order exempted claims of \u201cgross negligence\u201d and because she alleged that Campus Advantage had been grossly negligent, the suit could proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">The district court granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice as to all claims against Campus Advantage and its three employees. The court first rejected Henderson\u2019s due process argument, concluding that she had not identified any authority mandating that Campus Advantage provide notice to non-party potential claimants regarding the receivership\u2019s creation or termination. The court then rejected Henderson\u2019s argument that the Appointment Order, rather than the subsequent Termination Order, determined the scope of Campus Advantage\u2019s liability exposure. Henderson filed a motion for reconsideration reasserting the same arguments previously made, which the district court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">We review a district court\u2019s motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) <em>de novo, U.S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number><em>ex rel. Grubbs v. Kanneganti, </em>565 F.3d 180, 185 (5th Cir. 2009), and a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>Briddle v. Scott, </em>63 F.3d 364, 379 (5th Cir. 1995). On a motion to dismiss, we accept all well-pleaded facts as true, but \u201ccourts are not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (quotation marks and alterations omitted). To overcome a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a plaintiff must plead \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955. \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">We first address Henderson\u2019s claim that the district court erred in concluding that the Termination Order\u2019s release clause bars her claims against Campus Advantage. Henderson provides two arguments to support this position. First, relying on out-of-circuit precedent, Henderson argues that Campus Advantage is not entitled to judicial immunity where the receiver has acted contrary to the court\u2019s directives. Here, the Appointment Order required Campus Advantage to \u201ctake reasonable actions to ensure that it complies with all laws applicable to the possession, use, occupancy, management, operation and maintenance of the Property as provided under any laws of the United States, the State of Mississippi, and otherwise....\u201d Henderson argued that Campus Advantage contravened the court\u2019s order by violating Mississippi law through the negligence alleged in the complaint. Second, Henderson argues that the district court wrongly concluded that the Termination Order, rather than the Appointment Order, determines Campus Advantage\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">We reject Henderson\u2019s first argument because it has been forfeited. \u201cGenerally, \u2018this Court will not consider an issue that a party fails to raise in the district court absent extraordinary circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Black v. N. Panola Sch. Dist., </em>461 F.3d 584, 593 (5th Cir. 2006) (alterations omitted) (quoting <em>Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir. 1999)). As Henderson admits, Campus Advantage- relied on the doctrine of judicial immunity in its motion to dismiss. Henderson, however, never argued to the district court that judicial immunity was unavailable to Campus Advantage because it had failed to comply with the Appointment Order\u2019s directives. Nor did Henderson ever rely on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 959. Instead, Henderson relied entirely on the portion of the Appointment Order that authorized claims for gross negligence to rebut Campus Advantage\u2019s immunity argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">In her briefing to this court, Henderson tries to make up for her failure to brief this issue, asserting that she \u201cclearly set forth allegations in the Amended Complaint that [Campus Advantage] ... did not comply with the laws or standards of care of the State of Mississippi.... \u201d The Appointment Order says nothing about \u201cstandards of care\u201d; it refers only to \u201claws.\u201d We cannot agree that an allegation of negligence, even if sufficient facts were pleaded, plausibly states that Campus Advantage violated the \u201claws\u201d of Mississippi. <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955. Indeed, Henderson\u2019s attempt to revise the Termination Order to include the phrase \u201cor standards of care\u201d confirms our conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>sion that Henderson\u2019s allegations of negligence do not plausibly allege a violation of \u201claws\u201d within the meaning of the Termination Order. Thus, Henderson never argued, and did not plausibly allege, that Campus Advantage contravened the district court\u2019s Appointment Order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">We also reject Henderson\u2019s argument that the district court wrongly concluded that the Termination Order, rather than the Appointment Order, determines Campus Advantage\u2019s liability. Henderson argues essentially that the Appointment Order\u2014along with its exception for claims of gross negligence\u2014controls because the asserted claims accrued before the Termination Order was entered.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But as the district court noted, Henderson has not provided any authority for the counterin-tuitive claim that a superseded order governs over the order that did the superseding. In her opposition to the motion to dismiss, Henderson agreed that courts have authority to define the scope of a Receiver\u2019s immunity. If a court has discretion to define a Receiver\u2019s immunity in the first instance, we see no logical reason why it may not adjust that immunity through a subsequent order. The district court did precisely that by releasing Campus Advantage \u201cfrom any and all liability as Receiver of Receivership Property.\u201d Given that Henderson has offered no authority to support her position, we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Henderson argues next that the district court erred in rejecting her due process argument. As the district court noted, Henderson has provided no relevant support for the argument that Campus Advantage, as Receiver, was required to provide notice to Henderson\u2014a non-party to the receivership action\u2014either of the existence of the receivership or its termination. The first case that Henderson relies <em>on\u2014Miller v. FDIC, </em>738 F.3d 836 (7th Cir. 2013)\u2014is not a due process case and instead interprets provisions of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989. <em>Id. </em>at 838, 840-43. The second case Henderson relies on\u2014<em>Garcia v. Federal Nat\u2019l Mort. Ass\u2019n, </em>782 F.3d 736 (6th Cir. 2015)\u2014held that Michigan\u2019s \u201cforeclosure-by-advertisement statute\u2019s notice requirement\u201d was consistent with due process. <em>Id. </em>at 740-42. <em>Garda </em>has nothing to do with whether a receiver must provide notice of the existence of the receivership, its termination, or how to file claims against the receivership property. Otherwise, the only law Henderson cites merely states the general principles of procedural due process. We are therefore unpersuaded by Henderson\u2019s argument.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b318-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
