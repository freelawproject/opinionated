Turner procured a Miller Act payment bond from Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of America, Federal Insurance Company, Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland/Zurich American Insurance Company, and Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (\u201cthe Sureties\u201d). Bolena and RMP Capital Corp., as assignee of South-wick, brought this suit in district court under the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3131-34, seeking to collect against a Miller Act payment bond.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the first day of trial Bolena and RMP jointly filed a motion to dismiss their Miller Act claims. The Magistrate Judge dismissed the federal claims but exercised supplemental jurisdiction over the issue of any fees and costs related to the federal litigation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">Turner\u2019s and the Sureties\u2019 appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of their motion for attorney\u2019s fees is the only issue remaining in federal court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court held that general contractors and sureties cannot collect attorney\u2019s fees in a case originally brought under the Miller Act. We reverse and remand to the district court to interpret the contract provision at issue and award attorney\u2019s fees if they are merited.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">Turner contracted with the Department of Veterans Affairs on a federal project and, pursuant to the Miller Act, obtained a bond from the Sureties. Bolena entered into a subcontract agreement with Turner, and Southwick entered into a sub-subcontract agreement with Bolena. Southwick then assigned the rights to its accounts receivable to RMP. In 2011 Bolena and RMP filed separate lawsuits to collect against Turner\u2019s payment bond, and their lawsuits were then consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">On the first day of trial Bolena and RMP moved to dismiss with prejudice their Miller Act claims. The district court granted the motion and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Bole-na\u2019s two remaining state claims. It only \u201cretain[ed] jurisdiction to decide any motion for fees and costs.\u201d Bolena then assigned its rights in the lawsuit to RMP.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">Turner and the Sureties moved for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The district court granted some of the costs but denied attorney\u2019s fees. With regard to attorney\u2019s fees, the distinct judge first observed that the Miller Act does not explicitly provide for attorney\u2019s fees. The court then determined that there is precedent for awarding attorney\u2019s fees in Miller Act cases where a contract provides for fees to be awarded to the prevailing party and when that party is a subcontractor. But there is no precedent governing the award of attorney\u2019s fees to a general contractor or a surety when the subcontractor voluntarily dismisses a Miller Act claim. The district court thus denied the motion for attorney\u2019s fees based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>on this lack of precedent, reasoning that awarding attorney\u2019s fees to a general contractor or surety would be in tension with the Miller Act\u2019s express purpose of protecting subcontractors and suppliers on federal projects. The district court did not interpret the contract provision at issue. This denial of attorney\u2019s fees is the sole issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">The Miller Act does not mention attorney\u2019s fees. See F.D. Rich, 417 U.S. at 126, 94 S.Ct. at 2163 (\u201cNor does the Miller Act explicitly provide for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees to a successful plaintiff.\u201d). But under our precedent, \u201cattorney\u2019s fees are a recoverable item under [a] Miller Act bond\u201d when provided for in a contract. United States ex rel. Carter Equip. Co. v. H.R. Morgan, Inc., 554 F.2d 164, 166 (5th Cir. 1977)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> accord United States ex rel. Se. Mun. Supply Co. v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburg, 876 F.2d 92, 93 (11th Cir. 1989); see also F.D. Rich, 417 U.S. at 126-30, 94 S.Ct. at 2163-66 (applying, under the Miller Act, the \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d providing for attorney\u2019s fees if the parties contract for them). Several circuit courts agree. See, e.g., GE Supply v, C <em>&amp; </em>G Enterprises, Inc., 212 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir. 2000) (collecting cases from the 4th, 5th, 8th, and 9th Circuits). The district court was right that all our precedent governing the award of attorney\u2019s fees in Miller Act cases addressed subcontractors claiming attorney\u2019s fees. But the court was wrong in holding that general contractors and sureties are barred from receiving attorney\u2019s fees in any case originally brought under the Miller Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">This error stems from the court\u2019s misreading of the Miller Act cases. The cases do not state a general principle that only subcontractors and sub-subcontractors who contract for attorney\u2019s fees can receive them in cases brought under the Miller Act. Rather, they stand for the more limited principle that subcontractors and sub-subcontractors may recover contracted-for attorney\u2019s fees from the Miller Act payment bond. See, e.g., H.R. Morgan, 554 F.2d at 166 (\u201c[Attorney\u2019s fees are a recoverable item under [a] Miller Act bond.\u201d); see also F.D. Rich, 417 U.S. at 128, 94 S.Ct. at 2164 (discussing \u201cthe award of attorneys\u2019 fees in suits on construction bonds\u201d). In light of this limited principle, the lack of precedent allowing for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees in Miller Act cases by general contractors and sureties makes sense. Miller Act payment bonds are procured by general contractors from sureties for the protection of subcontractors and sub-subcontractors. See supra note 1. General contractors or sureties would not seek to recover against their own bond. Thus, the district court erred in deriving a broad principle from this absence of precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-14\">Like all other parties to contracts, general contractors on federal projects and their sureties can recover attorney\u2019s fees where a contract allocates attorney\u2019s fees to them. See, e.g., Travelers Cas. <em>&amp; </em>Sur. Co. of Am. v. Pac. Gas &amp; Elec. Co., 549 U.S. 443, 448, 127 S.Ct. 1199, 1203, 167 L.Ed.2d 178 (2007) (The American Rule can \u201cbe overcome by an enforceable contract allocating attorney\u2019s fees\u201d (quotation omitted)). Here the contract that Turner and the Sureties claim entitles them to an award of attorney\u2019s fees was between Southwiek and Bolena. We remand to the district court to interpret that contract in the first instance, so as to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>whether it entitles Turner and the Sureties to an award of attorney\u2019s fees, and if so how much.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b956-10\">. \"[T]he Miller Act establishes the general requirement of a payment bond to protect those who supply labor or materials to a contractor on a federal project.\u201d F.D.
