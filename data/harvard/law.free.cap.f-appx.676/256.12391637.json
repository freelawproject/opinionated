He argues that the written judgment should be amended to accurately reflect the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement at sentencing that it would recommend that Taylor participate in the 500-hour Residential Drug Abuse Treatment Program (RDAP) offered by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The written judgment recommends only a non-specific drug treatment program. Taylor contends that the BOP has several drug treatment programs but that only the RDAP can result in a sentence reduction. The Government agrees that the oral and written judgments are in conflict and that a remand for correction of the written judgment is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Accordingly, the written judgement is AMENDED to conform to the court\u2019s oral pronouncement recommending that Taylor participate in the RDAP specifically. <em>See United States v. Wheeler, </em>322 F.3d 823, 828 (5th Cir. 2003); <em>United States v. Castaneda, </em>494 Fed.Appx. 484, 485 (5th Cir. 2012) (unpublished); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106. In all other respects to the judgment is AFFIRMED as amended. <em>See Wheeler, </em>322 F.3d at 828; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b281-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
