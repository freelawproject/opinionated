King argues that the district court erred in applying a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) for possessing a firearm \u201cin connection with another felony offense.\u201d The fact that he sold a pistol and methamphetamine in the same transaction, King contends, is insufficient to show he possessed the pistol \u201cin connection with\u201d the sale of methamphetamine. The government responds that the enhancement was appropriate because the pistol had the potential to facilitate the methamphetamine sale. Even if the district court erred in applying \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B), however, the error was harmless because the district court expressly stated that it would have imposed the same total sentence regardless of the enhancement, and because the sentence, absent the enhancement, is substantively reasonable. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">We generally review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 693 (11th Cir. 2002). A district court\u2019s finding that a defendant possessed a firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d another felony offense is generally reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Whitfield, </em>60 F.3d 947, 947 &amp; n.8 (11th Cir. 1995) (reviewing the district court\u2019s finding that the defendant used a gun in connection with two burglaries for clear error); <em>see also United States v. Carillo-Ayala, </em>713 F.3d 82, 88 (11th Cir. 2013) (\u201c[W]e generally review a district court\u2019s application of [a legal] standard to \u2018a detailed fact pattern\u2019 for clear error.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a four-level enhancement to the base offense level of an illegal firearm conviction if the defendant possessed the firearm \u201cin connection with another felony offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B). The phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d is not defined in \u00a7 2K2.1, but the commentary to that section explains that the enhancement applies \u201cif the firearm ... facilitated, <em>or had the potential of facilitating,\u201d </em>the additional offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n.l4(A) (emphasis added). The commentary further states that the enhancement applies \u201cin the case of a drug trafficking offense in which a firearm is found in close proximity to drugs, drug-manufacturing materials, or drug paraphernalia ... because the presence of the firearm has the potential of facilitating\u201d the drug offense. <em>Id. </em>cmt. n.l4(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">Similarly, this Court has indicated that the phrase \u201cin connection with,\u201d as used in \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) and other sections of the Guidelines, should be given an \u201cexpansive interpretation.\u201d <em>Rhind, </em>289 F.3d at 695 (stating that \u201cthe firearm does not have to facilitate the underlying offense\u201d); <em>see United States v. Smith, </em>480 F.3d 1277, 1280 (11th Cir. 2007) (noting that \u201cwe have expressly rejected a more restrictive interpretation\u201d). We have also determined that \u201c[a] firearm found in close proximity to drugs or drug-related items simply \u2018has\u2019\u2014 without any requirement for additional evidence\u2014the potential to facilitate the drug offense.\u201d <em>Carillo-Ayala, </em>713 F.3d at 92 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">At sentencing, King argued that the pistol he sold to a confidential infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>mant did not facilitate or have the potential to facilitate the sale of methamphetamine. King noted that the two sales were separately arranged and that, because he had a well-established relationship with the confidential informant, he never anticipated using the pistol during the transaction. The government responded that the pistol nonetheless had the potential to facilitate the drug sale because of the close proximity of the pistol and the drugs. The district court overruled King\u2019s objection to the application of the four-levpl enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B),' concluding that the pistol\u2019s close proximity to the drug sale was sufficient to support the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">The district court\u2019s conclusion is consistent with this Circuit\u2019s precedent and the commentary to \u00a7 2K2.1. <em>See Carillo-Ayala, </em>713 F.3d at 92 (\u201cA firearm found in close proximity to drugs or drug-related items simply \u2018has\u2019\u2014without any requirement for additional evidence\u2014the potential to facilitate the drug offense.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 98 (\u201cA defendant drug dealer who knows he is selling both drugs and guns to a person he believes to be another drug dealer possesses the firearms he sells \u2018in connection with\u2019 his drug offense, even if the guns and drugs are \u2018sold separately.\u2019 \u201d); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>276 F.3d 1231, 1234 (11th Cir. 2001) (\u201c[A] defendant possesses a firearm \u2018in connection with\u2019 possession with intent to distribute heroin where he possesses both the gun and the narcotics on his person at the same time.\u201d); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n.l4(B). Given this precedent, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred in finding that King possessed the pistol in connection with the drug sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">In any case, even assuming, <em>ar-gmndo, </em>that the district court erred in applying \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B), we will not reverse a sentence based on an erroneous calculation of the guideline range if the error is harmless. <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>787 F.3d 1329, 1341 (11th Cir. 2015). A calculation error is harmless when (1) the district court clearly indicates that it would have imposed the same sentence regardless of the enhancement and (2) the sentence imposed is substantively reasonable even if the guideline issue had been decided in the defendant\u2019s favor. <em>United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347, 1349 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">Here, the district court expressly stated that it would have imposed the same 70-month total sentence of imprisonment regardless of how it resolved the guideline issue. Thus, remand for correction of the error would be unnecessary because we know what sentence the court would impose on remand. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b974-10\">Our inquiry, therefore, turns to whether the sentence would be reasonable even if the guidelines issue had been decided in the defendant\u2019s favor. <em>Id. </em>Had the court not applied \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B), King\u2019s advisory guideline range would have been 46 to 57 months, rather than 70 to 87 months. Accordingly, the question is whether the total 70-month sentence is substantively reasonable using the lower range.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b974-11\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1188 (11th Cir. 2010) <em>(fin banc). </em>In conducting our review, we consider the totality of the circumstances and whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir. 2008). The party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">A district court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not'greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing its sentence, the district court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, any pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">The court must consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but it may, in its discretion, give greater weight to some factors over others. <em>United States v. Rosales-Bruno, </em>789 F.3d 1249, 1254 (11th Cir. 2015). We will overturn a sentence, however, if \u201cwe are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190 (internal quotation marks omitted). A sentence well below the statutory maximum penalty is an indicator of reasonableness. <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the 70-month total sentence. The court expressly mentioned several of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and then concluded that the sentence, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, was \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing.\u201d King has pointed to- nothing in the record to indicate that the court committed a clear error of judgment and imposed a sentence outside the range of reasonable sentences based on the facts of this case. <em>See Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190; <em>Rosales-Bruno, </em>789 F.3d at 1254. His two offenses were serious, <em>see United States v. Jones, </em>601 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir. 2010) (\u201c[Possession of ammunition by a convicted felon and drug user are clearly serious crimes\u201d), and, despite his relatively young age (27 at the time of sentencing), King still scored into criminal history category V, indicating the need for the sentence to afford adequate deterrence. That the 70-month total sentence was well below the statutory maximum of 120 months for both counts is a further indicator of reasonableness. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). Accordingly, we affirm the total sentence as substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b974-6\">. The judgment reflects that King\u2019s total sentence was 29 months of imprisonment, as he received credit for the 41 months he had already served in state custody for relevant conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
