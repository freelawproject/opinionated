According to Dominguez-Alfaro, the district court committed procedural error by failing to recognize that it had the authority to grant his motion for a downward variance, based on then pending amendments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-22\">In reviewing Dominguez-Alfaro\u2019s unpre-served claim of procedural error we consider first whether the district court erred, whether the error was clear or obvious, and whether the error affected Dominguez-Alfaro\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Narez-Garda, </em>819 F.3d 146, 150 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 137 S.Ct. 175, 196 L.Ed.2d 145 (2016). If we find in the affirmative as to the these three factors, then we have the discretion to correct the error, but will only exercise our discretion \u201cif the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-25\">According to Dominguez-Alfaro, the district court\u2019s statement that it \u201cshould sentence pursuant to the Guidelines in existence of as of the date [of] sentencing,\u201d shows that the district court believed it lacked the discretion to sentence him below the guideline range. The district court, however, additionally considered the particular facts of his case, the arguments he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>presented in favor of a downward variance, the advisory guidelines range, and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a); <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Moreover, the district court specifically noted that it was applying the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 as modified by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which rendered the Guidelines advisory only. Dominguez-Alfaro has failed to show that that the district court committed reversible plain error. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Narez-Garcia, </em>819 F.3d at 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
