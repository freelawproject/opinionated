In 2014, he moved, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 782 to Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2D1.1. In deny-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>mg the motion, the district court ruled: \u201cHaving carefully considered all of the information submitted, including the defendant\u2019s [presentence investigation report], the sentence imposed was fair and reasonable.\u201d Dillon contends the court abused its discretion in considering the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir. 2011). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion if it bases its decision on an error of law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 486-87 (5th Cir. 2005)). In short, Dillon was entitled to adequate consideration of his motion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672-73 (5th Cir. 2009). We will generally assume a court has complied with the two-step inquiry applicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions by (1) determining defendant\u2019s eligibility for a reduction, and (2) considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Henderson, </em>636 F.3d at 717-18; <em>United States v. Larry, </em>632 F.3d 933, 936-37 (5th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The record, however, undermines that assumption: the \u201cAmendment 782 Eligibility Information Sheet\u201d prepared by the United States Probation Office, and presumably considered by the district court, pertains to an unrelated defendant, coincidentally with the same last name as appellant, Accordingly, we are unable to rule out the possibility that the court inadvertently considered clearly erroneous facts of no relation to Michael Dillon,, or failed to consider whether a sentence reduction was \u201cwarranted in whole or in part under the particular circumstances\u201d of <em>his </em>case. <em>Henderson, </em>636 F.3d at 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Neither side has noted this error. And, although Dillon failed to brief this issue, \u201c[i]n exceptional circumstances, especially criminal cases, we can, in our discretion, take <em>sua sponte </em>notice of errors not presented in either the district court or the appellant\u2019s initial brief\u2019 if \u201cfairness and the public interest\u201d so dictate. <em>United States v. Broussard, </em>669 F.3d 537, 552 &amp; n.10 (5th Cir. 2012). \u2018We exercise this discretion with the greatest prudence, recognizing that it is only the extraordinary case which will excuse an appellant\u2019s failure to make an argument in his initial brief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 552-53. This is such an instance. While we, of course, express no opinion regarding the merits of Dillon\u2019s motion, fairness and the public 'interest dictate we vacate the court\u2019s order and remand for reevaluation on the basis of a clarified and complete record. <em>See Broussard, </em>669 F.3d at 552-53; <em>Henderson, </em>636 F.3d at 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b391-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
