We join the first three tribunals that denied West\u2019s claim by affirming the judgment of the district court issued following its rife <em>novo </em>review of the entire case by affirming the final decision of the Commissioner based, as it was, on the ruling of the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-17\">We have painstakingly reviewed the parties\u2019 contentions on appeal as set forth in their briefs, as well as West\u2019s record excerpts and the carefully explicated Report and Recommendation of the United States magistrate judge; and we have independently reviewed the facts and the law to the extent of our authorization to do so. As a result, we are satisfied that the ALJ, the Appeals Council, the magistrate judge and the district judge uniformly and consistently \u201cgot it right\u201d in their rejections of West\u2019s Social Security claims. For the reasons patiently set forth by those who heard this case before we did, the Order of the district court affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of West\u2019s requested relief is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b338-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
