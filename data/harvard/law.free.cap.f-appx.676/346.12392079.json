Broadway, Louisiana prisoner # 99478, appeals the dismissal, for failure to state a claim, of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint against William R. Jones, the district attorney of Louisiana\u2019s Thirty-ninth Judicial District. The complaint alleges that Jones refused to release biological evidence for DNA testing and opposed Broadway\u2019s postconviction application for DNA testing, thereby violating Broadway\u2019s right to due process. Additionally, the complaint alleges that the trial court and the Louisiana Second Circuit Court of Appeal, which were not joined as defendants, violated Broadway\u2019s due process rights by not ordering DNA testing. Because the district court dismissed the case for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, our review is de novo. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-22\">We reject Broadway\u2019s conclusory assertions that the state courts did not provide a fundamentally fair procedure and that the Second Circuit misapplied Louisiana law and erred in holding that, given his guilt under Louisiana\u2019s law of principals, Broadway failed to establish an articulable doubt as to his innocence that could be resolved by DNA testing. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir. 1993); <em>Ross v. Estelle, </em>694 F.2d 1008, 1012 (5th Cir. 1983); Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8)(A); 5th Cir. R. 28.2.2. Taking judicial notice of the jury charge from Broadway\u2019s trial, <em>Landry v. Lynaugh, </em>844 F.2d 1122, 1124 n.8 (5th Cir. 1988) (taking judicial notice of state-court trial records), reveals that the jury was instructed on the law of principals. Furthermore, it is well settled under Louisiana statutory law that this doctrine is applicable to rape charges, <em>see, e.g., State v. Vaughn, </em>431 So.2d 358, 364 (La. 1982) (citing La. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 14:24), including aggravated rape, <em>see, e.g., State v. Rash, </em>444 So.2d 1204, 1205-06 (La. 1984) (\u201cLouisiana has long since abolished the common law distinctions between principals and accessories before the fact. ... As such, defendant was subject to conviction on the charge of aggravated rape.... \u201d (citing La. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 14:24)). Accordingly, the DNA testing alone could not resolve an articulable doubt as to Broadway\u2019s innocence of aggravated rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-23\">Even if the law of principals was inapplicable, Broadway would still fail to establish an articulable doubt as to his innocence that could be resolved by DNA testing because under Louisiana law, in the ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>sence of scientific evidence, testimony alone is sufficient to establish penetration. <em>State v. Rives, </em>407 So.2d 1195, 1197 (La. 1981) (\u201cDespite the absence of scientific evidence of sexual intercourse, the testimony of the victim was sufficient to establish \u2018sexual penetration.\u2019 \u201d). Furthermore, Louisiana statutory law \u201cprovides that \u2018emission is not necessary\u2019 and that \u2018any sexual penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting La. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 14:41). At Broadway\u2019s trial, the victim testified that Broadway \u201cgot on top of [her]\u201d and made penetration, and then she was raped again by Broadway\u2019s accomplice. The doctor who examined her on the night of the incident described abrasions around her vagina and testified that sexual intercourse had occurred. Therefore, even if the DNA testing excluded Broadway as the \u201csource of the semen,\u201d as Broadway contends, it would still fall short of resolving doubt as to his innocence of aggravated rape. <em>See Rives, </em>407 So.2d at 1197; <em>State v. Mitchell, </em>453 So.2d 1260, 1265 (La. Ct. App. 1984) (affirming aggravated rape conviction where \u201c[t]he victim admitted that there was no emission and only a slight penetration\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Broadway does not show by what authority we may second-guess a state court on a matter of state law. <em>See Seaton v. Procunier, </em>750 F.2d 366, 368 (5th Cir. 1985). Nor does he show that the Second Circuit was incompetent to adjudicate the issues presented in his state court application or that the question of his guilt under the law of principals may otherwise be relitigated. <em>See Arizona v. California, </em>460 U.S. 605, 619, 103 S.Ct. 1382, 75 L.Ed.2d 318 (1983). We also reject Broadway\u2019s argument regarding executive clemency. <em>See Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Osborne, </em>557 U.S. 52, 67-68, 129 S.Ct. 2308, 174 L.Ed.2d 38 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Broadway has not shown that his complaint contains \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007); <em>see Morris v. Livingston, </em>739 F.3d 740, 745 (5th Cir. 2014). Therefore, the judgment is AFFIRMED. Broadway\u2019s motion to add attachments to the brief is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b360-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm, R, 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
