The bankruptcy court determined that 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) rendered the debt non-dischargeable. The Bandis appealed this determination to the Eastern District of Louisiana, and, subsequently, the Fifth Circuit, both of which affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">The Bandis then sought a panel rehearing and a rehearing en banc. While these motions were pending before this court, the Bandis filed a motion with the bankruptcy court for an indicative ruling pursuant to Rule 62.1,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seeking a \u201cstatement, included with the reasons why, that the issue raised [in the motion] is substantial or not.\u201d After the bankruptcy court denied this motion, the Bandis filed a motion for writ with this court to compel the bankruptcy court to hold a hearing on the motion for an indicative ruling and to issue \u201cOrders and Reasons.\u201d We denied the Bandis\u2019 petitions for a panel rehearing and a rehearing en banc, and the Clerk for the Fifth Circuit advised the Bandis that, because \u201cthere [was] no further relief available,\u201d the court would take no action on the motion for writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">Over two years later, the Bandis moved to compel this court to resolve the motion for writ, and the Clerk for the Fifth Circuit again advised the Bandis that the court would take no action. Nevertheless, the Bandis filed a motion to reopen the case, arguing that the motion for writ was actually a notice of appeal. The court denied the motion to reopen,</p>\n<p id=\"b315-14\">The Bandis then moved to reopen the case in bankruptcy court, again arguing that the motion for writ was actually a notice of appeal requiring resolution. Shortly after filing this motion, the Bandis filed an independent action in equity for relief from judgment with the bankruptcy court, requesting a new trial, along with four motions for summary judgment and a motion to disqualify. The bankruptcy court denied the motion to reopen, dismissed the complaint, and dismissed the other motions as moot. After the district court affirmed, the Bandis appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-15\">We review a bankruptcy court\u2019s refusal to reopen a proceeding for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Bandis have premised their motion to reopen on the theory that the motion for writ was actually a notice of appeal that requires action. Although we \u201cmay accept a notice of appeal which \u2018substantially\u2019 complies with the technical requirements of [Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure] 3(c), or is the \u2018functional equivalent\u2019 of a notice of appeal, this does not mean [we] can waive the requirement altogether.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Instead, we require that the filed document \u201cclearly evince[ ] the party\u2019s in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>tent to appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The motion for writ does not clearly evince that the Bandis intended to appeal. Prior to filing the motion for writ, they had filed four notices of appeal, and the motion for writ did not mention the district court\u2014the proper appellate court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There was no reason to believe that the Bandis had intended to file a notice of appeal instead of a motion for writ, and, thus, the document did not provide \u201csufficient notice to other parties and the courts.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">However, even if we assume that the Bandis\u2019 construction of the case is accurate, there is no relief that an appeal of the Bandis\u2019 indicative ruling can provide. The Bandis\u2019 \u201cappeal\u201d seeks review of the bankruptcy court\u2019s refusal to hold a hearing to resolve whether the Bandis\u2019 Rule 62.1 motion raised a substantial issue. The case has been decided, and the mandate has issued. It does not matter whether the district court believes the motion raises a substantial issue, as the purpose of such a ruling is to allow us to remand the case if we deem it \u201cuseful to decide the motion before [deciding] the pending appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There is no case to remand, and, as a result, the requested hearing would serve no purpose. Thus, the motion is moot, and the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to reopen the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">The bankruptcy court also properly dismissed the independent action in equity and the accompanying motions. An \u201cindependent action [cannot] be made a vehicle for the relitigation of issues,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and \u201c[a]t some point a court must decide that a plaintiff has had fair opportunity to make his case.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Bandis\u2019 basis for reopening the trial through an independent action is that \u201c[t]he record shows that the trial court\u201d in the original proceeding \u201cissued written Orders and Reasons that contain material misrepresentations.\u201d They have unsuccessfully raised this same allegation on repeated occasions at every level of the proceeding, including before this court in their brief on the merits of the original claim and in their motions for a panel rehearing and a rehearing en banc\u2014all of which we rejected. The Bandis, in fact, acknowledged as much in their brief before the district court, stating that \u201c[during the case\u2019s original appeal to this Court ... all of the [material misrepresentations] were raised\u201d but, they believed, not \u201cfully considered,\u201d and that \u201c[u]pon further appeal to the Fifth Circuit, [we] again raised these issues.\u201d To the extent that the Ban-dis have now shifted the focus of their argument to a due process challenge stemming from a purported filing error by the Clerk of the Fifth Circuit, they have raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>that argument for the first time on appeal and have cited no case in support of that argument. Accordingly, it is waived.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cThere must be an end to litigation at some point.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We have reached that point.</p>\n<p id=\"A41\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
