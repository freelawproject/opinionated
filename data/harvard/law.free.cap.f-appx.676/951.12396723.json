After review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b966-9\">We first review the underlying litigation that gave rise to Elite Homes\u2019 claim for a defense, and then set out the terms of the relevant policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">On March 21, 2007, Joseph and Emily Crozier entered into a written contract with Elite Homes for the construction of a single-family residence. Shortly after construction was completed in June of 2008, the Croziers began experiencing problems due to water intrusion from the property\u2019s windows. Elite Homes made several repairs over the subsequent years, but they proved to be ineffective. Around January of 2014, the Croziers obtained inspection and testing reports which revealed elevated levels of toxic mold and opined that construction and installation defects caused the active water intrusion. In compliance with Chapter 558 of the Florida Statutes, the Croziers gave Elite Homes notice and a final opportunity to cure the problems with the property. The Croziers were not satisfied with Elite Homes\u2019 proposed plan to remedy the problem, and sued Elite Homes in state circuit court, asserting claims for breach of contract and negligence. Elite Homes then notified its insurer, Auto-Owners, of the Croziers\u2019 lawsuit, which remains pending. <em>See Croziers v. Elite Homes, Inc., </em>Case No. 16-2014-CA-003913 (Fla. Duval Cir. Ct. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-13\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b966-14\">Auto-Owners issued a Commercial General Liability Policy to Elite Homes on October 15, 2007. The policy provides the following coverage for \u201c[pjroperty damage\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-15\">a. We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of ... \u201cproperty damage\u201d to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any \u201csuit\u201d seeking those damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-16\">D.E. 1-2 at 3. \u201cProperty damage\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-17\">a. Physical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-18\">b. Loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured. All such loss shall be deemed tq occur at the time of the \u201coccurrence\u201d that caused it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-19\"><em>Id. </em>at 22. The policy excludes from coverage damage to \u201c[y]our work,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 8, which is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-20\">(1) Work or' operations performed by you or on your behalf; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-21\">(2) Materials, parts or- equipment furnished in connection with such work or operations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-22\"><em>Id. </em>at 23. \u201cYour work\u201d includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-23\">(1) Warranties or representations made at any time with respect to the fitness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>quality, durability, performance or use of \u201cyour work\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-5\">(2) The providing of or failure to provide warnings or instructions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">After being notified of the Croziers\u2019 lawsuit, Auto-Owners defended Elite Homes under a reservation of rights. On September 29, 2014, Auto-Owners filed this federal action seeking a declaratory judgment that it did not have a duty to defend or a duty to indemnify Elite Homes in the Croziers\u2019 lawsuit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Auto-Owners contended that Elite Homes\u2019 policy did not cover the damages claimed by the Croziers. Auto-Owners and Elite Homes filed cross-motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">The district court granted Auto-Owners\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The district court stated that, based on the agreement of Elite Homes and Auto-Owners at oral argument, the sole issue before it was whether the Amended Complaint in the underlying action sufficiently alleged damage to \u201cother property\u201d so that the claims would not be barred by the policy\u2019s \u201cDamages To Your Work\u201d exclusion. Auto-Owners\u2019 position was that the damages alleged in the underlying action fell solely within the policy\u2019s exclusion provisions. Elite Homes\u2019 position was that the allegations in the Croziers\u2019 amended complaint sufficiently alleged damages that were covered under the policy, thereby requiring Auto-Owners to provide a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">The district court reviewed three allegations in the amended complaint with respect to damage: there was \u201cextensive damage to other property includ[ing] the frame subsurface, sheathing, insulation, drywall, and interior finishes,\u201d D.E. 16 at 24, \u00b6 14; there was \u201cdamage to interior portions of the home,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 28, \u00b6 82; and there was \u201cdamage to other property including, but not limited to, exterior wood framing, wood substrate, vapor barriers, insulation, drywall, and interior finishes,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 28, \u00b6 38. The district court reasoned that, to the extent the damage in the underlying action was to the structure of the property and Elite Homes\u2019 defective work, such damage was excluded under the \u201cDamages To Your Work\u201d provision of the policy. Further, the district court stated that \u201cconclusory buzz words\u201d and inferences were insufficient to bring the allegations of damage within coverage since even under the \u201cmost liberal and broadest of readings\u201d of the underlying amended complaint, it did not contain allegations of damage to personal property or projperty other than the home itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-13\">The district court concluded that the allegations of damage in the underlying action related only to the structure of the property itself, which both Auto-Owners and Elite Homes conceded were excluded under the policy. Accordingly, the district court held that Auto-Owners had no duty to defend Elite Homes in the Croziers\u2019 action. Elite Homes now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-14\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b967-15\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. See State Farm Fire and Cas. Co. v. Steinberg, </em>393 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>F.3d 1226, 1280 (11th Cir. 2004). Summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, presents no genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Thrasher v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>734 F.2d 637, 638 (11th Cir. 1984). The parties agree that Florida law governs.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">We determine whether Auto-Owners has a duty to defend Elite Homes in the underlying action by looking only at the allegations in the Croziers\u2019 amended complaint. <em>See, e.g., Jones, </em>908 So.2d at 443. The duty to defend an entire action arises when the underlying complaint alleges \u201cfacts that <em>fairly and potentially </em>bring the suit within policy coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 442-43 (emphasis added). Further, if \u201cthe complaint alleges facts partially within and partially outside the scope of coverage, the insurer is obligated to defend the entire <em>suit.\u201d Trizec Props., Inc., </em>767 F.2d at 811\u201412. Any doubts about whether the duty to defend is triggered are resolved in favor of the insured. <em>Jones, </em>908 So.2d at 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">An insurer has no duty to defend if the complaint shows the applicability of a policy exclusion. <em>See Keen v. Fla. Sheriffs\u2019 Self-Insurance Fund, </em>962 So.2d 1021,1024 (Fla. 4th DCA 2007) (ruling that insurer had no duty to defend because allegations in the complaint fell within the policy exclusion). Thus, \u201c[t]he allegations within the complaint must state a cause of action that seeks recovery for the type of damages covered by the insurance policy in question.\u201d <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Tippett, </em>864 So.2d 31, 35-36 (Fla. 4th DCA 2003). Conclusory \u201cbuzz words,\u201d like allegations that fail to allege any underlying facts that create a duty to defend, are insufficient. <em>See Amerisure Ins. Co. v. Gold Coast Marine Distribs., Inc., </em>771 So.2d 579, 582 (Fla. 4th DCA 2000) (holding that use of buzz words were insufficient to trigger coverage); <em>Steinberg, </em>393 F.3d at 1230 (\u201cConclusory buzz words unsupported by factual allegations are not sufficient to trigger coverage.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">The parties agree that Elite Homes\u2019 own work is excluded under the \u201cDamages To Your Work\u201d exclusion. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 7 (\u201c[Tjhe [underlying [cjomplaint need only fairly and potentially, not specifically, allege the existence of damage to property <em>other than that included- within Elite Homes\u2019 scope of work.\u201d)', </em>Appellee\u2019s Br. at 13 (\u201cThere is no dispute that repairs to the entirety of the Croziers\u2019 home itself ... are damage to general contractor Elite Homes\u2019 Vork,\u2019 and therefore, excluded from coverage.\u201d) (emphasis added). This is consistent with how courts in Florida have interpreted similar \u201cDamage to Your Work\u201d provisions. <em>See Nova Cas. Co. v. Willis, </em>39 So.3d 434, 437 (Fla. 3d DCA 2010) (affirming lower court\u2019s determination that \u201cyour work\u201d exclusion applied to work completed on private owner\u2019s property but did not apply to work incorrectly performed on state property); <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. of Am. v. Deluxe Sys., Inc. of Fla., </em>711 So.2d 1293, 1297 (Fla. 4th DCA 1998) (concluding that purchase and installation of replacement shelving components fell within \u201cyour work\u201d exclusion); <em>Miranda Const. Dev., Inc. v. Mid-Continent Cas. Co., </em>763 F.Supp.2d 1336, 1340 (S.D. Fla. 2010) (holding that claim was barred by \u201cyour work\u201d exclusion because underlying complaint only alleged damage to owner\u2019s home).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">The parties\u2019 sole disagreement concerns whether the amended complaint sufficiently alleged damages beyond the \u201cDamages To Your Work\u201d exclusion. Specifically, the dispute is about whether the following allegations are sufficient to allege damage be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>yond Elite Homes\u2019 work: \u201cextensive damage to other property includ[ing] the frame subsurface, sheathing, insulation, drywall, and interior finishes,\u201d D.E. 16 at 24, \u00b6 14, and \u201cdamage to interior portions of the home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28, \u00b6 32.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Elite Homes contends that the use of those phrases sufficiently implicates damages to \u201cother property\u201d that are outside of Elite Homes\u2019 own work. We disagree. A fair reading of the allegations of the Croziers\u2019 amended complaint leads us to conclude that Auto-Owners does not have a duty to defend Elite Homes in the underlying action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court correctly concluded that the amended complaint contains no factual allegations of damage to property other than the work performed by Elite Homes, and that the use of con-clusory phrases such as \u201cother property\u201d is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">Elite Homes also argues that the district court\u2019s holding essentially requires the underlying complaint to specifically identify particular property damage to trigger Auto-Owners\u2019 duty to defend and that this level of specificity is unnecessary. Although we agree that such a level of specificity is not required under Florida law, in this case the -language in the amended complaint is too vague for us to assume that the Croziers alleged anything other than damages to the home, and therefore Elite Homes\u2019 own work. As a result, the damage alleged falls squarely within the \u201cDamage to Your Work\u201d exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Auto-Owners has no duty to defend Elite Homes in the underlying action, and affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Auto-Owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b967-11\">. By agreement of the parties, these two issues were bifurcated, and the duty to indemnify portion of the case was abated pending the outcome of the underlying case. The duty to defend is \"separate and apart from the duty to indemnify and the insurer may be required to defend a suit even if the later true facts show there is no coverage.\u201d <em>Trizec Props., Inc. v. Biltmore Constr. Co., Inc., </em>767 F.2d 810, 812 (11th Cir. 1985). As such, an insurer's duty to defend is \"of greater breadth than the insurer's duty to indemnify.\u201d <em>Jones v. Fla. Ins. Guar. Ass'n, Inc., </em>908 So.2d 435, 443 (Fla. 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b969-9\">. In the summary judgment proceedings below, the parties referred to a third provision, D.E. 16 at 28, \u00b6 33, in their briefs. The district court in turn relied on all three provisions when it granted Auto-Owners' motion for summary judgment. On appeal, however, Elite Homes only relies on two provisions,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b969-24\">. Although the Croziers amended their complaint during the pendency of this case in the district court, the damages allegations were not amended.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
