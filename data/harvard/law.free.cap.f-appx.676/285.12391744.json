The officers asserted the defense of qualified immunity, and Strain and Morse moved for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>eral Rules of Civil Procedure. After granting Strain and Morse\u2019s motion, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the nonmovant\u2014defendants, Domangue and Richard, pursuant to Rule 56(f)(1). Dr. Davis timely appealed, asserting that Morse and Domangue \u201comitted critical information from the application for the arrest warrant\u201d that would have \u201cfatally undermined\u201d the finding of probable cause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">. This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cSummary judgment is proper if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with any affidavits filed in support of the motion, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although qualified immunity is \u201cnominally an affirmative defense, the plaintiff has the burden to negate the defense once properly raised.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When the court considers the validity of a qualified immunity claim on summary judgment, \u201c[t]he evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in [the nonmovant\u2019s] favor.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">An official asserting the defense of qualified immunity must \u201cshow that the conduct occurred while he was acting in his official capacity and within the scope of his discretionary authority.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Once the officer pleads his good faith, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to \u201crebut the defense by establishing that the officer\u2019s allegedly wrongful conduct violated clearly established law.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201c[Qualified immunity shields officials from civil liability so long as their conduct \u2018does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cA clearly established right is one that is \u2018sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This \u201cdemanding standard\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> protects \u201call but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>late the law.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The Fourth Amendment guarantees \u201cthe right of the people to be secure in their persons ... against unreasonable searches and seizures ... and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is undisputed that this right is clearly established.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In the context of a false arrest claim, an officer is entitled' to qualified immunity if \u201ca reasonable person in [his or her] position could have believed [he or she] had probable cause to arrest.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Though generally an arrest made pursuant to a properly issued warrant \u201cis simply not a false arrest,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201cwhen an affidavit contains inaccurate statements which materially affect its showing of probable cause, any warrant based upon it is rendered invalid.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has recognized that an applicant for a warrant may violate the Fourth Amendment if he includes \u201ca false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth\u201d <em>and </em>\u201cthe allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus, \u201cwhere the officers charged with false arrest were responsible for securing the warrant, we are required to test the validity of that warrant.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-14\">We note that \u201c[p]robable cause to arrest exists if, at the moment an arrest is made, the facts and circumstances within the arresting officers\u2019 knowledge and of which they have reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the suspect has committed or is committing an offense,\u201d but \u201c[e]nough evidence to support a conviction is not required.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u201c[S]ubjeetive intent, motive, or even outright animus are irrelevant,\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and we confine our inquiry to an objective assessment of whether \u201ca reasonable officer could have believed [the arrest at issue] to be lawful, in light of clearly established law and the information the [arresting] officers possessed.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u201c[I]f even under [the plaintiffs] factual scenario the officers\u2019 actions may be deemed as a matter of law objectively reasonable[,] ... qualified immunity should be granted.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u201cTo determine whether facts omitted from a warrant affidavit are material to the determination of probable cause, courts or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>dinarily insert the omitted facts into the affidavit and ask whether the reconstructed affidavit would still support a finding of probable cause.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The actual sequence of events is contested by the parties. However, for purposes of a qualified immunity analysis, we cabin our review of the facts to the information the officers had <em>at the time of the </em>arrest.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In this case, the officers received information from Dr. Rachel Murphy that a patient came to her for a pre-employment drug screen on January 23, 2013, She informed them that, upon learning he had failed the drug screen, the patient and his father met with Dr. Murphy. According to Dr. Murphy, the patient left the office, subsequently returned, and presented a prescription for valium dated January 21, 2013. Dr. Murphy believed the prescription was fraudulent. The patient did not have a matching prescription in his prescription history between January 21 and January 23, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The officers obtained a search warrant for Dr. Murphy\u2019s office, where they obtained the prescription bottle, which indicated Dr. Davis provided the prescription. Dr. Murphy also stated that the pharmacist who had filled the prescription had initially told her it was filled on January 21, 2013, but later said he had backdated the fill date. According to Dr. Murphy, the patient\u2019s father had reported driving the patient to Dr, Davis\u2019s office just before the patient presented her with the valium prescription.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">The officers obtained a statement from the patient that, upon learning of the failed drug test, he had requested a back-dated prescription from Dr. Davis, which he received. He stated that he subsequently filled the prescription without incident, though this statement was later controverted by the pharmacist. Pursuant to a search warrant, the officers obtained the prescription from the pharmacy where it was filled. There, the pharmacist who dispensed the medication also informed the officers that the prescription numbers issue in order, and that the number on the prescription indicated it was actually filled on January 31, 2013. The officers obtained a search warrant for Dr. Davis\u2019s office and records, which revealed two signed entries for January 21. The two entries appeared to be written in different pens, and only the second referenced the valium prescription. The detectives also spoke with Dr. Davis regarding the January 21, 2013 entries and the valium prescription. Dr. Davis denied backdating any prescription, though she did acknowledge that the patient had made such a request at some time. Dr. Davis did see the patient on January 31, 2013, but there was no mention of a valium prescription on that date. The officers secured a warrant for Dr. Davis\u2019s arrest based on this information.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The application for the warrant did not mention the patient\u2019s criminal history or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>drug abuse, nor did it mention any possible \u201cdeal\u201d with the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The crux of Dr. Davis\u2019s argument is that the officers omitted two pieces of critical information from the affidavit and included false information concerning the timeline of events. The affidavit made no mention of the extensive criminal history of the patient who obtained the allegedly backdated prescription, including multiple convictions for crimes involving illegal drugs and deception. Nor did the affidavit mention the existence of an agreement not to prosecute the patient in exchange for his cooperation in the investigation. Finally, Dr. Davis argues that the affidavit misrepresents Dr. Murphy\u2019s account of when the patient presented the allegedly backdated prescription. Dr. Davis argues that Dr. Murphy\u2019s statement from May 15, 2013 contradicts the information in the arrest warrant by stating that the patient only visited her office once on January 31, 2013. Dr. Davis asserts that, were the affidavit rewritten to include the omitted information and her version of events, there would be no. probable cause. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Taking into account all the evidence available at summary judgment, and resolving all contested facts in favor of Dr. Davis, we cannot say that the allegedly false statements and omissions were necessary to the finding of probable cause.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> This is not a case in which the only information supporting the arrest was provided by a discredited witness.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The officers received information from at least two other individuals whose credibility has not been challenged, including Dr. Murphy and the pharmacist. Furthermore, the officers executed search warrants and independently verified many of the facts provided to them. Discounting all evidence provided by the patient, and assuming Dr. Murphy said the patient visited only once, the following facts support a finding of probable cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-10\">\u2022 Dr. Murphy advised a patient that he had failed a drug screen performed on January 23, 2013, and the patient produced what Dr. Murphy believed to be a fraudulent prescription dated January 21, 2013.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-11\">\u2022 The prescription history of the patient did not show a prescription for the drug in question during the relevant time period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-12\">\u2022 The pharmacist who filled the prescription admitted he had backdated the prescription\u2019s fill date to January 21, 2013, even though the receipt transaction date stated the prescription was purchased on January 31, 2013.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-13\">\u2022 The patient\u2019s father told Dr. Murphy that the patient had obtained the backdated prescription from Dr. Davis after learning he had failed the drug screen, and before presenting the prescription to Dr. Murphy, in an attempt to justify the failed drug screen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-14\">\u2022 Dr. Davis\u2019s \u201cprogress note\u201d for the patient from January 21, 2013 includes two signed entries, each written in different pen, and both signed by Dr. Davis. The second entry contained information regarding the prescription at issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>We reiterate that \u201c[e]nough evidence to support a conviction is not required\u201d to establish probable cause.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Even though Dr. Davis was not ultimately found guilty of the offense, the information available to the officers at the time of arrest, discounting that contested by Dr. Davis, was sufficient to support a finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b309-15\"> Pursuant to 5th C\u00edr.
