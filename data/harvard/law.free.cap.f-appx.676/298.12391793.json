A movant seeking leave to proceed IFP on appeal must demonstrate that he is a pauper and that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1); <em>Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-20\">In his motion, Fobbs challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal, for want of jurisdiction, of his \u00a7 2241 petition for writ of habeas corpus. As noted by the district court, Fobbs\u2019s claims amount to a challenge to his sentence, and he has not met the burden of showing that the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate or ineffective as required by, <em>e.g., Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir. 2001). The district court did not err in dismissing the \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(e). Accordingly, the motion for leave to proceed IFP and all outstanding motions are DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir. 1983); <em>see also </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b322-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
