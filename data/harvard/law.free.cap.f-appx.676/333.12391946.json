He claims that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to grant him an 18-month sentence, giving due consideration to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 sentencing factors. De la Garza-Montemayor acknowledges that the court did grant his request for a variance, but he contends that the variance was not sufficient, and he maintains that the court failed to give due consideration to the fact that his previous conviction was 12 years before the current one.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-21\">We review sentences for substantive reasonableness, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A within-guidelines sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). \u201cThe presumption is rebutted only upon a showing that the sentence does not account for a factor that should receive sig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>nificant weight, it gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or it represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir. 2009). Because the record reveals no objection to the sentence, the plain-error standard of review applies. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 134-35, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">De la Garza-Montemayor\u2019s counsel asked the district court to consider the age of the earlier conviction, but he stated that the main concern was the health problems of the defendant and those of his family. The court heard and considered the attorney\u2019s arguments concerning his reasons for requesting a variance. The court took into account de la Garza-Montemayor\u2019s personal history and characteristics and the other statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a), including his prior conviction for drug trafficking and his health problems, before imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">De la Garza-Montemayor\u2019s briefing does not show a clear error of judgment in balancing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; instead, he merely disagrees with the weighing of those factors. <em>See Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186. At sentencing, he personally argued for more weight to be given to his health problems. He should not be heard to urge now that the court did not give enough weight to the age of his earlier conviction, and he has not demonstrated that the district court plainly erred. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 134-35, 129 S.Ct. 1423; <em>Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 391-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-15\"> Pursuant to 5th C\u00edr. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
