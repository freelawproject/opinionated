Casta\u00f1o argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-17\">The district court committed no procedural error when sentencing Casta\u00f1o. Even if we were to assume that the district court had to consider a 90-month sentence that Casta\u00f1o served for a drug offense he committed after violating his supervised release, the district court did so. The district court stated that it \u201cconsidered the statements of the parties\u201d in fashioning an appropriate sentence, which included Castano\u2019s request for a sentence of time served because of his 90-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-18\">Castano\u2019s sentence of 12 months is substantively reasonable. As the district court recounted, Casta\u00f1o was convicted of \u201cfiling a false statement in an application for a passport\u201d while on probation for \u201ca prior conviction for grand theft, resisting, and obstruction without violence.\u201d After Casta\u00f1o \u201cmade [the] conscious decision\u201d to violate the conditions of his supervised re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>lease by failing to report to his probation officer, to submit monthly supervision reports, and to report a change of address or his whereabouts, he absconded to Mississippi, where later he committed the \u201cfar more serious federal offense\u201d of \u201cpossession with intent to distribute marijuana.\u201d And, the district court recalled, Castano\u2019s conviction failed to account for his use of a \u201cfalse birth certificate to obtain a Florida identification card, a Florida driver\u2019s license and a voter\u2019s registration card.\u201d The district court considered \u201cthe 3553(a) factors\u201d and selected a sentence that addressed Castano\u2019s \u201chistory and characteristics\u201d and that was intended to deter him from committing future similar crimes and to protect the public from his escalating criminal conduct. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3583(e), 3553(a)(1), 3553(a)(2)(B), 3553(a)(2)(C). The district court reasonably determined that a sentence to a term 5 months above Casta-no\u2019s advisory guideline range of 1 to 7 months was necessary to satisfy the sentencing factors. Based on Castano\u2019s flagrant violation of his probation and the disregard that he exhibited for the rule of law, we cannot say that \u201cwe are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment\u201d by imposing a sentence above the recommended sentencing range. <em>See United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir. 2010) (quoting <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir. 2008)). The decision to vary upward was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">We AFFIRM Castano\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
