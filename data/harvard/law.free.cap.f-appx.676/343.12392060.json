Both Haskett and the appellees have filed their opening briefs, but further briefing was suspended when Haskett\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal was submitted to the court. The IFP motion is granted, and we dispense with further briefing.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Haskett has waived review of the dismissal of his claims for a declaratory judgment and respondeat superior by failing to challenge their dismissal on appeal. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987). This portion of the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">The district court erred in dismissing his claim for failure to hire under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq. See Leal v. McHugh, </em>731 F.3d 405, 410 (5th Cir. 2013). Haskett\u2019s allegations, liberally construed, plausibly permit the reasonable inferences that he applied for landmen positions for which he was qualified, younger persons were hired to fill these positions, and the defendants did not hire him because of his age. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). This portion of the district court\u2019s judgment is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">IFP motion GRANTED. AFFIRMED in part; VACATED in part; and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir, R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
