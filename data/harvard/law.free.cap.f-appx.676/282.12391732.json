CitiMortgage counterclaimed for judicial foreclosure and moved for summary judgment. The district court entered judgment for CitiMortgage. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">In 2006, Michael Maldonado borrowed $292,000 under a Home Equity Note to finance the purchase of a home in Houston, Texas. The principal amount was secured by a mortgage on the property under a Texas Home Equity Security Instrument. The loan was originally serviced by ABN AMRO Mortgage Group, Inc. CitiMortgage obtained the lpan after its merger with ABN AMRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Since the execution of the loan agreement, CitiMortgage claims that Maldonado has \u201crepeatedly fail[ed] to make payments under the Loan\u201d and has \u201cdelay[ed] foreclosure by requesting modifications and forbearance agreements.\u201d Between 2009 and 2014, Maldonado received six written notices of default, but he never sought to bring the loan current. Maldonado last made a payment in May 2011, and the loan is currently in default.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">In December 2014, Maldonado sued Citi-Mortgage in what the district court characterized as \u201can attempt to stop CitiMort-gage\u2019s foreclosure on the Property after he defaulted on his loan.\u201d CitiMortgage removed the ease to federal court, counterclaimed for judicial foreclosure of the property, and moved for summary judgment on each of Maldonado\u2019s claims. The district court granted CitiMortgage\u2019s motion and its counterclaim for judicial foreclosure. The final judgment reflects that the outstanding balance on the loan is $533,960.80. That sum consists of the outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest, escrow advances, and late charges and fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">Shortly thereafter, Maldonado filed a motion to alter or amend the district court\u2019s judgment. He argued the district court erroneously calculated his outstanding balance by relying on incompetent summary-judgment evidence. The district court summarily denied Maldonado\u2019s motion. Maldonado filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b307-14\">Maldonado disputes the various amounts the district court used to calculate his outstanding balance. He attempts to create a fact issue by claiming that he \u201cpointed to evidence\u201d demonstrating the inaccuracies upon which the district court relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Trinity Universal Ins. Co. v. Emp\u2019rs Mut. Cas. Co., </em>592 F.3d 687, 690 (5th Cir. 2010). Summary judgment is proper when \u201cthe mov-ant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). \u201cFactual controversies -are construed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, but only if both parties have introduced evidence showing that an actual controversy exists.\u201d <em>Lynch Props., Inc. v. Potomac Ins. Co. of Illinois, </em>140 F.3d 622, 625 (5th Cir. 1998). To do so, the nonmovant must \u201csupport [his] allegations with admissible evidence.\u201d <em>Howell Hydrocarbons, Inc. v. Adams, </em>897 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>183, 192 (5th Cir. 1990). Conclusory assertions are not enough. <em>See Wheat v. Florida Par. Juvenile Justice Comm\u2019n, </em>811 F.3d 702, 707 (5th Cir. 2016). Further, the non-movant must designate <em>specific </em>facts; we will not search the entire record on his behalf for evidence that may create a fact issue. <em>Nissho-Iwai Am. Corp. v. Kline, </em>845 F.2d 1300, 1307 (5th Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Under Texas law, the holder of a negotiable instrument is entitled to enforce it. Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. \u00a7 3.301. A holder is \u201cthe person in possession of a negotiable instrument that is payable either to bearer or to an identified person that is the person in possession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1.201(b)(21)(A). Although ABN AMRO initially serviced the loan, the parties agreed that CitiMortgage became the holder of the note after its merger with ABN AMRO. Thus, CitiMortgage may enforce the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The court may order judicial foreclosure upon proof \u201cestablishing the debt and fixing the lien.\u201d <em>Bonilla v. Roberson, </em>918 S.W.2d 17, 21 (Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi 1996, no writ); <em>see also </em>Tex. R. Civ. P. 309. To recover, a movant must prove a financial obligation and the lien securing it, a default on the loan, and that the property subject to foreclosure is the same property subject to the lien. <em>See Rinard v. Bank of Am., </em>349 S.W.3d 148, 152 (Tex. App.\u2014El Paso 2011, no pet.). CitiMortgage established each of the required elements for judicial foreclosure by competent summary-judgment evidence. Michael Maldonado signed a Texas Home Equity Note for $292,000, secured by a mortgage on the property that is now subject to foreclosure. The parties stipulated that the loan is currently in default.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">The only remaining question, then, is the outstanding balance owed under the loan agreement. In its motion for summary judgment, CitiMortgage argued the outstanding balance was $533,960.80. That figure was adopted by the district court. In support, CitiMortgage offered the affidavit of Cindy Schneider, who testified, as the custodian of records, that CitiMortgage\u2019s figure was the sum of the outstanding principal balance, accrued and unpaid interest, and late charges and fees. CitiMort-gage also offered documentary evidence of the amount owed, including a comprehensive record of Maldonado\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">In response, Maldonado \u201cdispute[d] some of the numbers that CitiMortgage ... included in [its] motion for summary judgment to determine the value of the debt on judicial foreclosure.\u201d Specifically, he disputed the amounts that CitiMort-gage claimed in attorneys\u2019 fees, inspection fees, escrow, taxes, and late charges. Maldonado\u2019s response does not provide any evidence of what the correct amounts should be. He does not offer affidavits, depositions, or other documentation to create an issue of fact.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Instead, he relies on a policy argument, claiming that \u201cTexas law favors protection of the homestead,\u201d so CitiMortgage\u2019s motion should be denied because the amounts to be paid are in dispute. That is not a valid response to the evidence and law supporting foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">The district court did not err by granting CitiMortgage\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b307-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-6\">. Maldonado offers the affidavit of his attorney, Ricardo Guerra, who testified as to the appropriate amount of attorneys\u2019 fees that CitiMortgage should be claiming. Guerra never mentioned the amounts associated with the underlying transaction, which are the only amounts disputed here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
