On appeal, Whitehurst argues that the district court plainly erred by finding that home-invasion robbery in Florida is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1(a)(1)(A)(i). Whitehurst does not contest that he committed conduct equivalent to a home-invasion robbery. In Florida, home-invasion robbery is punishable by a maximum sentence exceeding 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. After re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>view of the record, the parties\u2019 briefs, and the applicable law, we find that the district court did not plainly err by finding that Whitehurst committed a Grade A violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the legality of a sentence imposed pursuant to revocation of a supervised-release term. <em>United States v. Mazarky, 499 F.3d 1246, </em>1248 (11th Cir. 2007). However, if a defendant fails to object to an issue at sentencing, this Court reviews it for only plain error. <em>United States v. Vandergrift, </em>754 F.3d 1303, 1307 (11th Cir. 2014). To establish plain error, a defendant must show: \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain and (3) that affects substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1276 (11th Cir. 2007) (quotation and citation omitted). Error is plain if it is clear or obvious under existing law. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Lastly, we may affirm for any reason supported by the record. <em>United States v. Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d 971, 975 (11th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">A district court may revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised-release term and require the defendant to serve an imprisonment term if it finds, by a preponderance of evidence, that he violated a condition of his supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). \u201cFor sentences imposed upon revocation of supervised release, the recommended sentencing range is based on the classification of the conduct that resulted in the revocation and the criminal history category applicable at' the time\u201d of the defendant\u2019s original sentencing. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>473 F.3d 1345, 1348-49 (11th Cir. 2007) (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7B1.1, 7B1.4). A \u201cGrade A\u201d violation occurs where the violation includes (A) conduct consisting of a federal, state, or local offense punishable by more than one year in prison that is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d or (B) \u201cany other federal, state, or local offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding\u201d 20 years. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(l). Importantly, \u201c[t]he grade of violation does not depend upon the conduct that is the subject of criminal charges or of which the defendant is convicted in a criminal proceeding Rather, the grade of violation is to be based on the defendant\u2019s actual conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1. comment n.l.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">A \u201chome-invasion robbery\u201d is \u201cany robbery that occurs when the offender enters a dwelling with the intent to commit a robbery, and does commit a robbery of the occupants therein.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 812.135(1). If the offender carnes a firearm or other deadly weapon during the home-invasion robbery, the offense is a felony punishable by a maximum of life imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 812.135(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">Distinct from determining sentencing enhancements under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), or the career offender guideline, when grading a violation under Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines, a district court considers the conduct, rather than the conviction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1 comment n.l. Here, it is undisputed that Whitehurst committed conduct consistent with a home-invasion robbery. A home-invasion robbery is punishable by life imprisonment. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 812.135(2)(a). Accordingly, the district court did not plainly err by finding that Whitehurst committed a Grade A violation of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">Lastly, Whitehurst\u2019s argument that this Court may not affirm on the basis of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1(a)(1)(B) because he was not on notice that the district court could make a finding on that alternative ground is unpersuasive. Section 7B1.1(a)(l)(B)\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>presence in the Sentencing Guidelines undercuts his argument. Whitehurst\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to discover and address this provision does not deprive this Court of its ability to affirm the district court\u2019s findings for any reasons supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
