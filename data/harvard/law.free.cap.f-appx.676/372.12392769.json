According to Garcia-Ar-redondo, his sentence is substantively unreasonable, greater than necessary to satisfy the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and fails to account for his personal history and characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-21\">We review the substantive reasonableness of Garcia-Arredondo\u2019s sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court, which was \u201cin a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d was presented with Garcia-Arredondo\u2019s .mitigating arguments but concluded that a sentence within the guidelines range was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir. 2008). Garcia-Arredondo\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s decision is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness accorded his within guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-22\">Garcia-Arredondo also argues that the illegal reentry guideline lacks an empirical basis and overstates the seriousness of illegal reentry offenses by using prior con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>victions to both calculate the base offense level and the criminal history category. We have previously rejected this \u201cdouble counting\u201d argument. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-30 (5th Cir. 2009). As to the empirical data underlying the illegal reentry guideline, the district court could have reached, in its discretion and as part of its \u00a7 3553(a) analysis, a different decision as to the relevance of the amendment to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 and the underlying policy decisions. <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir. 2009). That the district court did not do so, after considering the case before it, is also insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness accorded a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 566 (5th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
