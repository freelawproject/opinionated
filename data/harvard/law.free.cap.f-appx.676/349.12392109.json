Smith pleaded guilty in 2009 to embezzlement by a bank employee and was sentenced to 14 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. She was serving her term of supervised release when she was arrested on later felony embezzlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>charges that resulted in the revocation of her supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Smith argues that the district court committed procedural error by basing the sentence on the erroneous belief that she committed the instant offense while receiving counseling and that the sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">After the district court noted that the counseling Smith received had failed to provide adequate deterrence, Smith\u2019s counsel objected. The district court then engaged in a colloquy with Smith regarding her counseling, and no further objection was made. Further, the record shows that one of the special conditions of her supervised release was that she obtain counseling, and she testified that she had received counseling in the past. Moreover, the district court considered the Chapter Seven policy statements as well as Smith\u2019s mitigation arguments and ultimately concluded that the 24-month sentence was necessary to provide adequate deterrence, given her many years of embezzling from various employers, and to protect the public from future crimes\u2014factors that were appropriate for the district court to consider in imposing the revocation sentence and which we will not reweigh. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). As for the extent of the variance, we have routinely upheld revocation sentences that exceed the guidelines range by an even greater degree but are within the statutory maximum. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Kippers, </em>685 F.3d 491, 500-01 (5th Cir. 2012) (affirming a 48-month sentence where the advisory range on revocation of probation was three to nine months); <em>United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 265 (5th Cir. 2009) (affirming a 36-month sentence where the guidelines range on revocation of supervised release was four to ten months):</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b363-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
