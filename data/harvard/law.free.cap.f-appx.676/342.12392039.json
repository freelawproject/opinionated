She challenges the district court\u2019s denial of a reduction of her offense level for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Our review is even more deferential than review for clear error, and we will affirm the district court\u2019s decision unless it is without foundation. <em>United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 458 (5th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-21\">At her rearraignment, Morrison stated under oath that a written summary of the facts supporting her guilty plea was true and correct. The summary stated that Morrison transferred $50,000 from a bank account without the owner\u2019s knowledge or consent. The information to which Morrison pleaded guilty identified this $50,000 transfer as the basis for the wire fraud count.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-22\">During a presentence interview,, however, Morrison stated that the $50,000 was a loan. Morrison thus denied conduct comprising the offense of conviction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment.
