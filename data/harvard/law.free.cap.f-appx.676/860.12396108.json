On appeal, Smedley argues that the district court erred in denying her Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d) motion. As a result, she should participate in discovery. Smedley also claims that the district court should have converted M&amp;C\u2019s motion to dismiss as a summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-16\">We review the denial of a Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>Fla. Power &amp; Light Co. v. Allis Chalmers Corp., </em>893 F.2d 1313, 1315 (11th Cir. 1990) (interpreting Rule 56(d)\u2019s predecessor, Rule 56(f)). As a general rule, appellate courts \u201cwill not consider a legal issue or theory raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir. 2004). Under Rule 56(d), where the non-moving party to a motion for summary judgment shows \u201cby affidavit or declaration\u201d that, for specified reasons, it \u201ccannot present facts essential to justify its opposition,\u201d the district court may delay consideration of the motion, deny the motion, allow additional time for discovery, or issue another appropriate order. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d). In seeking the protection of Rule 56(d), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>non-movant must show that \u201cpostponement of a ruling on the motion will enable [her], by discovery or other means, to rebut the movant\u2019s showing of the absence of a genuine issue of fact.\u201d <em>Fla. Power &amp; Light, </em>893 F.2d at 1316 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">\u201c[V]ague assertions that additional discovery will produce needed, but unspecified facts\u201d fail to meet this burden. <em>Fla. Power &amp; Light, </em>893 F.2d at 1316 (quotations omitted). Moreover, we will not overturn discovery rulings under Rule 56 unless the appellant can demonstrate that those rulings \u201cresulted in substantial harm to the appellant\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Iraola &amp; CIA, S.A. v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., </em>325 F.3d 1274, 1286 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">A court is not required to await the completion of discovery before ruling on a motion for summary judgment, so long as the parties have had an adequate opportunity for discovery. <em>Fla. Power &amp; Light, </em>893 F.2d at 1316. Additionally, summary judgment may be appropriate when no discovery has been held. <em>Reflectone, Inc. v. Farrand Optical Co., </em>862 F.2d 841, 843 (11th Cir. 1989) (discussing Rule 56(d)\u2019s predecessor Rule 56(f)). In <em>Reflectone, </em>the appellant chose to suspend its discovery efforts pending the resolution of a motion for a protective order, and by the time the opposing party had moved for summary judgment, it had not conducted discovery. <em>Id. </em>at 843. Moreover, the appellant never alerted the district court that it did not have a sufficient opportunity to conduct discovery. <em>Id. </em>at 844. The district court then granted summary judgment prior to discovery; the plaintiff argued this was a <em>per se </em>violation of Rule 56(d)\u2019s predecessor, rule 56(f). <em>Id. </em>In finding summary judgment proper, we stated that \u201ca court may grant summary judgment without parties having conducted discovery if ... the court has, in valid exercise of discretion, denied such a motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Smedley\u2019s Rule 56(d) request. First, Deutsche produced a valid notice of default as well as an affidavit attesting to the validity of the notice. Therefore, the district court did not err in finding that the evidence demonstrated the baselessness Smedley\u2019s non-TILA and non-RESPA claims. <em>Reflectone, </em>862 F.2d at 844. Second, although Smedley tendered two affidavits in an effort to comply with Rule 56(d), she only denied receiving such a notice. She admitted she sought evidence\u2014contrary to sworn testimony\u2014that such a notice \u201cwas never mailed.\u201d Third, Smedley only vaguely asserted that the Ocwen\u2019s notice was manufactured, without specifying additional facts supporting her allegation, or from where or whom she could procure evidence to prove her allegations. <em>Fla. Power &amp; Light, </em>893 F.2d at 1316. Fourth, regarding her TILA and RE SPA claims, based on Deutsche\u2019s alleged failure to respond to her QWR, Smedley never alleged facts showing that it was a loan servicer or evidence in the record demonstrating Deutsche was not her loan servicer. Additionally, in her affidavits, Smedley failed to suggest how discovery would uncover relevant evidence supporting those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">Even if the district court did abuse its discretion, its ruling did not cause \u201csubstantial harm to the appellant\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Iraola &amp; CIA, S.A., </em>325 F.3d at 1286. Here, the magistrate judge deemed everything in Deutsche\u2019s statement of material facts admitted due to Smedley\u2019s failure to properly controvert them. Smedley did not challenge the facts before the district court or in her brief on appeal. The magistrate judge and district court also analyzed each of Smedley\u2019s eight claims at length and explained why each failed. She does not dispute any of the court\u2019s legal conclusions on appeal. In light of these omissions, the district court ruling did not impact or substantially harm her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>Finally, Smedley\u2019s \u201cimproper conversion\u201d argument fails for two reasons. First, she did not raise it before the district court, so she cannot do so for the first time on appeal. Access <em>Now, </em>385 F.3d at 1331. Second, conversion occurs when a court considers matters outside of the pleadings in a Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, and thereby \u201cconverts\u201d that motion into a motion for summary judgment. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)3; <em>Trustmark Ins. Co. v. ESLU, Inc. </em>299 F.3d 1265, 1267 (11th Cir. 2002). Here, the motion ruled on by the district court was for summary judgment, so conversion did not occur. Moreover, Smedley cites no authority for the proposition that a document originally submitted in support of a motion to dismiss\u2014which is later denied\u2014cannot be relied on, again, at the summary judgment stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting Deutsche and M&amp;C\u2019s motion for summary judgment prior to discovery, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
