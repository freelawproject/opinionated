Many courts treat evidence of such promissory representations as attempts to vary by parol the terms of the written contract. An exception which the courts of Texas have engrafted upon said general rule is that where such purely promissory representations have been made with the design of cheating and defrauding the other party to the written contract, fraudulently, without any existing intention of the promissor to carry them out, and merely as a false pretense to induce such other party to execute such written contract, and such representations and promises actually had that effect, and the other party to the written contract has demanded performance of the promissor, and he has failed and refused to carry out or perform each and all of said promises, and damage has resulted to such other party, such facts, taken all together, will support rescission and cancellation of such written contract. Railway v. Titterington, 84 Texas, 218; Cearly v. May, 106 Texas, 442; Bigham v. Bigham, 57 Texas, 238; Burchill v. Hermsmyer, 212 S. W., 770; Lott v. Harper, 204 S. W., 452; Lawrence v.

Failure to plead and prove any one of these elements of fraud is fatal to the attempt to rescind or cancel such written contract. Home v. National Bank, 122 S. W., 431-3; Hurst v. Knight, 164 S.

The real nature of the instrument is shown by its phraseology. Texas Co. v. Daugherty, 107 Texas, 226, 176 S. W., 717; McEntire v. Thomason, 210 S. W., 563; Thomason v. Ham, 210 S. W., 561; Davis v.

Thomason was no more than a mineral lease, and did not convey a fee simple title to the minerals in place. Grubb v. McAfee, 109 Texas, 527, 212 S. W., 464; National Oil &amp; Pipe Line Co. v.

Griffiths, 86 Fed., 452.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-6\">In the light of the authorities mentioned, unquestionably the real consideration for the contract under consideration was the expectation of royalties, and it certainly never was contemplated by the grantors that they would be divested of all their title in fee simple to the minerals in place, and that the grantee could hold the same for a period of twenty years, and that without any development whatever. In construing this contract the rule announced by Judge Cobbs in the case of Clutter v. Wisconsin-Texas Oil C., 233 S. W., 324, should certainly be applied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-7\">Under the terms of the contract in controversy there was an implied obligation that Thomason would reasonably and fairly develop the minerals even after the same had been discovered.

Justice GREENWOOD</author>\n<p id=\"ApZ\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Defendants in error brought an action against plaintiff in error G. J. Thomason to try the title to 1377 acres of land in Stephens County and to secure the cancellation of two conveyances thereto, executed by defendants in error to plaintiff in error G. J. Thomason. One of the grounds on which the suit was brought was that whatever rights were acquired under said conveyances had been lost by abandonment. Y. L. Thomason and G. W. Thomason intervened, having acquired two thirds of the interest of G. J. Thomason. The jury found for defendants in error on the issue of abandonment and the judgment was affirmed by the El Paso Court of Civil Appeals. 242 S. W., 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">We have carefully examined the pleadings, which are challenged, and think defendants in error alleged facts entitling them to a decree cancelling the conveyances, if the estates conveyed were such as to be lost by abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">Since our disposition of the case is governed by our construction of these conveyances, we copy them as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">\u201cKnow all men by these presents: That we, M.

Ham and wife, Lizziebeth Ham, of Stephens County, Texas, party of the first part, in consideration of the sum of $1.00 paid by G. J. Thomason,. parties of the second part, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, and the further consideration hereinafter mentioned;</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u201cHAVE GRANTED, BARGAINED, SOLD AND CONVEYED, and by these presents Grant, Bargain, Sell and convey unto the parties of the second part, their heirs and assigns, all of the coal, oil and gas and other minerals in and under the following described land, together with the right of ingress and egress at all times for the purposes of drilling, mining and operating for minerals, and to conduct all operations, and to lay all pipes and railway necessary for the production, mining and the transportation of the coal, oil, gas, water or other minerals, and shall have the right to remove all machinery, fixtures, and improvements placed thereon at any time,, reserving however, to the parties of the first part their part of the cash dividends 1/10 and such payment made quarterly without demand. Said land being described as follows, to-wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u201c304 acres out of Abstract No. 2946, 866 sq. vrs. granted to Sarah Blythe by Letters Patent No. 161, Vol. 21, dated July 3rd, 1875, same being situated in Stephens County, Texas, and particularly described by deed records of said County, containing (304) Three Hundred and Four acres, more or less.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\u201cTO HAVE AND TO HOLD the above described premises unto the said parties of the second part, their heirs and assigns upon the following conditions: In case operations for either the drilling of a well for coal, oil, gas, mining or other minerals is not commenced and prosecuted with due diligence within 15 months from this date on the above described premises, this contract is null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">\u201cIn case the parties of the second part should bore and discover either coal, oil, gas or other minerals, then and in that event this grant, encumbrance or conveyance shall be in full force and effect for twenty years from the time of the discovery of said product, and as much longer as coal, oil, gas, water or other minerals can be produced in paying quantities thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">\u201cWhenever sales are being made of the product on the land above described, such sales shall be added to the sales of the products, from all leases owned by the parties of the second part, and a settlement thereof shall be made at the end of each quarter.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>\u201cIt is further agreed that the second parties, their heirs, and assigns, may at any time hereafter surrender up this grant, and be relieved from any part of the contract heretofore entered into that may at that time remain unfulfilled, then and from thereafter this grant shall be null and void, and no longer binding on either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\">\u201cIt is understood between the parties to this agreement that all conditions between the parties hereunto shall extend to their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u201cWitness our hands this 18th day of August, A. D., 1909.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The grants are of minerals in place but for the single purpose \u201cof drilling, mining and operating for minerals.\u201d Bach grant, for the purposes stated, is to endure for twenty years from the discovery of minerals and as much longer as the same can be produced in paying quantities. Moreover, each grant appears to expressly authorize the exercise of the right to abandon, the enterprise by providing that \u201cthe second parties, their heirs and assigns may-at any time hereafter surrender up this grant and be relieved from any part of the contract heretofore entered into that may at that time remain unfulfilled, <em>then and from, thereafter this grant shall be null and void and no longer binding on either party. </em>Such grants plainly cannot endure after their voluntary relinquishment by abandonment. Regardless of this express surrender clause, we held today that estates vesting under grants for the sole purpose of mineral development, made in view of promised royalties, were limited to the time the grantees and their assigns were pursuing the essential purposes and objects of the grant, and that abandonment of such contracts and of the mineral operations thereby required necessarily deprived the grantees therein and their assigns of any further claim to minerals or land. The principle is applicable and controlling in preventing Thomason or his assigns from having any title in or to the minerals or land in controversy, after abandonment of the mining operations. Stephens County v. Mid-Kansas Oil &amp; Gas Co., 113 Texas, 160; The Texas Company v. Davis, 113 Texas, 321; Munsey v. Marnet Oil &amp; Gas Co., 113 Texas, 212; Robinson v. Jacobs, 113 Texas, 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The following excerpt from an opinion of the New Jersey Court of Chancery seems pertinent to the instruments executed by defendant in error, especially in view of their voluntary surrender clause, towit:</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\u201cIf we pay any attention to the general design of the instrument, the nature of the property which was the subject matter of the arrangement, the situation and relation of the parties, and the character of the privilege granted, it is impossible to believe that Williams intended to give to Rude an exclusive and irrevocable privilege to take ore from his lands, which Rude might exercise or not, just as he pleased, and if he chose not to exercise it, that his arbitrary choice in the matter should have the effect of preventing Williams, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>forever, from developing the mineral resources of his land. Williams\u2019 object was undoubtedly just the reverse of this. His purpose was to have his land explored and their mineral resources developed, not to grant a privilege which could be used to clog their development. That Bude understood that this was Williams\u2019 purpose, I think there can be no doubt. The discovery and mining of ore was manifestly the design of both parties, and their contract relations and duties were to cease when that purpose was abandoned.\u201d East Jersey Iron Co. v. Wright, 32 N. J. Eq., 256, 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Finding no error in the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals, it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
