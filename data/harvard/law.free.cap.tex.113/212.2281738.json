All conditions upon which the property was conveyed had been complied with. The property was not subject to forfeiture, based on the ground of alleged abandonment, because of failure to pump the wells for a period of time properly accounted for. The duty to pump the wells after full development of the property, is by reason of an implied covenant, upon which forfeiture will not be predicated. Appellees\u2019 remedy was, to compel operations, such as they thought proper, or to sue for damages, or both. Appellees did sue for and recover damages, in the sum of $1146.25 (S. 176), as compensation for the value of royalty to which they were entitled on oil which should have been produced on the property during the period of cessation in pumping of the wells.

If coal is found, the parties of the second part agree to pay the first party four cents per ton for every ton of the same that is mined and marketed, payable monthly. If gas or other minerals are found, second party agrees to - first party one-tenth of the.net produce each year, payable monthly for the product of each well, while the same is being used off the premises.

Robbins to the tract of 76.9 acres and the title of W. A. Polk and wife to the tract of 83.3 acres. Defendant in error holds the interests and rights granted to Staley, Carmody and Davis by the instruments herein-before copied, unless terminated or lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The wells expressly mentioned in both leases were sunk by the respective lessees within the times stipulated and produced oil in paying quantities.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">In 1913, this suit was instituted by plaintiffs in error, to_ cancel the instruments above set out, on the ground that the grantees and their assigns, including defendant in error, had abandoned their contracts and refused to perform their obligations to the grantors and their assigns, and had abandoned all operations for minerals. Plaintiffs in error also sought to recover damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">A jury trial resulted in a verdict and judgment for plaintiffs in error. On appeal, the judgment of the trial court was reversed and the cause was remanded on insufficiency of the evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. On rehearing*, judgment was rendered by the Court of Civil Appeals against plaintiffs in error, save on their causes of action for damages. 232 S. W., 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">The petition for writ of error complains of the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals, on rehearing, because: first, abandonment had divested defendant in error and its vendors of any right, title or interest in the lands sued for, and would entitle plaintiffs in error to a decree removing the cloud from their title cast by the claim of defendant in error; and, second, there was evidence to take the issue of abandonment to the jury, so as to preclude determination of the issue as one of law by the Court of Civil Appeals. On the other hand, it is strongly argued in behalf of defendant in error that Staley and Carmody &amp; Davis and their assigns became invested with a perfect legal title and an absolute fee simple title to the minerals which could not be destroyed save by written conveyance or by judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">On a previous appeal, the Dallas Court of Civil Appeals decided that the instruments executed by Mary B. Robbins and by Polk and wife evidenced sales of the minerals in place, and that the grants were absolute, <em>for the purposes contemplated by the </em>parties, for the period of 20 years or as long as oil in paying quantities could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>produced, after the express conditions subsequent as to successful drilling were complied with. The court flatly' rejected the view that the grantees could have or enjoy any estate in the minerals or land after all mineral operations were abandoned, saying:</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u201cThe only consideration moving to the grantors in the leases, other than the one-eighth interest in the oil which might be produced and saved, was $5. Without going to .the extent of holding that such sum would in no case constitute a sufficient consideration, it is\u2019 we believe, correct in this case to say that obviously the parties to the grant,.in view of its provisions, did not regard such sum the real consideration for the grant, but, on the contrary, indulged the hope and expectation that oil in paying quantities would be found beneath the surface of the land, and, when so found, the one-eighth portion thereof reserved by the grantors when delivered in the pipe line to the credit of the grantees in order that it might be marketed was to constitute the real consideration for the grants. Such being the purpose and intention of the parties, it was the duty of the grantees to continuously operate the wells in the manner contemplated by the undertaking; and if it cannot be said that the duty to continuously develop and produce the lands\u2019 mineral resources in a reasonably diligent manner, after discovery thereof in paying quantities, is not expressly provided for by the terms of the grant, then such duty unquestionably arises by implication. Such implication arises upon the provisions in the leases reserving to the grantees the right of ingress and egress over the surface land, and right to lay pipes for both production and transportation of all minerals when discovered and produced, and the duty imposed upon grantees to deliver to grantors in a pipe line their share of oil and to pay for same quarterly. These provisions suggest without discussion the intention of the parties, and what they contemplated. Clearly, it cannot be said that such provisions contemplate the operation of the wells at the will of the grantees, any more than that the right to operate by grantees could be divested at the will of grantors. Fisher v. Crescent Oil Co., supra, in our opinion presents a correct discussion of the mutual obligations of the parties under such contracts or leases after the discovery of oil in paying quantities.\u201d Munsey v. Marnet Oil &amp; Gas Co., 199 S. W., 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">In the ease of Fisher v. Crescent Oil Co., 178 S. W., 905, a conveyance was executed, for a cash consideration and promised royalties, of minerals in place, with appurtenant rights, for the purpose of drilling for and producing the minerals, for twenty-five years and as much longer as minerals could be produced in paying quantities, conditioned that the conveyance should be void in case operations for drilling for oil, gas, or other minerals were not commenced and prosecuted with due diligence on or before a fixed date. It was held, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>in the lamented Chief Justice Huff\u2019s carefully considered opinion, that while the lessee acquired a vested estate in the minerals and land, of indefinite duration, yet there was inseparable from such estate a continuing duty to mine and operate the land for minerals, which was utterly inconsistent with abandonment of the mining enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\">The last appeal herein was to the Texarkana Court of Civil Appeals, where both Robbins and Polk conveyances were held not to be conveyances of minerals in place or of other corporeal property, but were held to be grants of 'mere incorporeal rights and therefore subject .to abandonment. The issue of abandonment was further determined against plaintiffs in error, as though there had been no evidence to warrant the submission of the issue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">In our opinion, both contracts or grants passed title to corporeal property \u2014 not absolutely \u2014 but for mining purposes only, and title of such nature as to be incapable of enduring after abandonment of the contracts or abandonment of operations for mineral discovery and production. Stephens County v. Mid-Kansas Oil &amp; Gas Co., 113 Texas, 160; The Texas Company v. Davis, 113 Texas, 321; Robinson v. Jacobs, 113 Texas, 231. Furthermore, the evidence was such as to preclude the Court of Civil Appeals from determining as a matter of law, that there had been no abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Both conveyances grant, bargain, sell and convey the minerals as they lie in the land \u2014 for the single purpose - of drilling and mining operations. Every specified additional right granted is to enable the grantees to prosecute mining operations. The prime inducement to execute the conveyances is promised royalties which could never accrue save through mineral production. While the conveyance by Mary B. Robbins was to continue in force for twenty years after the discovery of oil or as long thereafter as oil could be produced in paying quantities, it was distinctly specified, as if to draw the distinction between this conveyance and one passing an absolute, unqualified legal title for any term,-that this conveyance was always to be understood as having been made for the purposes set forth on its face, that is, mineral exploration and development. The grant by Polk and wife containing no words otherwise defining its term, it would seem clear that, under the interpretation most liberal to the grantees, it could last no longer than the period of mineral production. This latter grant is also particular to save the right of the grantee to remove at any time all things necessary to effectuate the sole purpose of the grant. It is inconceivable that any grantor expected his property to be bound after this right of removal had been exercised, without expectation of return to the premises. Notwithstanding the expressions in the opinion in National Oil &amp; Pipe Line Co. v. Teel, 95 Texas, 586, we are not prepared to affirm that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>the consideration recited in the conveyance by Polk and wife would not support their grant. By its terms the grant was void unless the grantee had completed a test well within thirty days. Viewing the two instruments from beginning to end, whatever estate or right was acquired under either of them terminated with the mining operations contracted for. ' We do not mean that any necessary or reasonable or temporary cessation of mining operations would terminate the grants. But, deliberate intent to abandon the mining contracts is utterly inconsistent with any right to longer hold that which necessarily hampers the opposite contracting parties or their successors in title.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Expressions may be found in the opinions of this Court treating implied mining obligations in oil leases as conditions subsequent, such as Benavides v. Hunt, 79 Texas, 394. And, the court denied a writ of error in J. M. Guffy Petroleum Co. v. Oliver, 79 S. W., 884, where similar expressions were used. To the same effect are portions of the opinion in Fisher v. Crescent Oil Co., supra, approved on the first appeal, in this case. 199 S. W., 687. But, we find nothing from this court to give support to the theory that one can repudiate his drilling obligations and still hold the estate which is granted for the sole purpose of securing performance of such obligations. The doctrine seems to have scant support in the American decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Our discussion of the questions presented, in the above cited cases of Stephens County v. Mid-Kansas Oil &amp; Gas Co., The Texas Company v. Davis, and Robinson v. Jacobs, makes it unnecessary to extend this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The case having been disposed of under rules of law other than .those here announced, and the judgment of the trial court having been reversed on a ruling of the Court of Civil Appeals as to the insufficiency of the facts, and not being satisfied that the case is not capable of further development, it is ordered that the judgments of the District Court and of the Court of Civil Appeals be reversed, and that the case be remanded to the District Court for a new trial in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
